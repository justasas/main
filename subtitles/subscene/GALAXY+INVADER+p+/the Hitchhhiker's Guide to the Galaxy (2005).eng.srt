<i>It's an important and popular fact</i>

2
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,750
<i>that things are not always
what they seem.</i>

3
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,650
<i>For instance, on the planet Earth,
man had always assumed</i>

4
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,300
<i>that he was the most intelligent
species occupying the planet,</i>

5
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,050
<i>instead of the third most intelligent.</i>

6
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,650
<i>The second most intelligent creatures were,
of course, dolphins, who, curiously enough,</i>

7
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,650
<i>had long known of the impending
destruction of the planet Earth.</i>

8
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,200
<i>They'd made many attempts
to alert mankind to the danger,</i>

9
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,150
<i>but most of their communications
were misinterpreted</i>

10
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,750
<i>as amusing attempts to punch footballs
or whistle for tidbits.</i>

11
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,300
<i>So, they eventually decided they would
leave Earth by their own means.</i>

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,600
<i>The last ever dolphin message
was misinterpreted</i>

13
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,900
<i>as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt
to do a double backward somersault</i>

14
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,050
<i>through a hoop, while whistling
the 'Star-Spangled Banner'.</i>

15
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,900
<i>But in fact, the message was this...</i>

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,900
<i>"So long and thanks for all the fish."</i>

<i>The extraordinary story of
'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'</i>

18
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,950

19
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,000
<i>It begins with a man.</i>

21
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,900
<i>An Earthman, to be precise.</i>

22
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,600
<i>Who no more knows his destiny,</i>

23
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:26,200
<i>than a tea leaf knows the history
of the East India Company.</i>

24
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,300
<i>His name is Arthur Dent.</i>

25
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,700
<i>He is a 5'8''-tall ape descendant</i>

26
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,800
<i>and someone is trying to drive
a bypass through his house.</i>

27
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,250
What do I want you to do about it?
Well, I want you to find him

28
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:50,300
and tell him that I'm currently
lying flat on my back in front of...

29
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,700
Fine, I'll hold.

30
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,500
Come off it, Mr. Dent. You can't lie
in front of the bulldozers for ever.

31
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,700
Well, I'm game. We'll see who rusts first.

32
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,100
This bypass has got to be built
and it is going to be built.

33
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,250
- Why has it got to be built?
- It's a bypass!

34
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,000
You've got to build bypasses.

34
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,900
Besides, you should've made
your protest months ago.

35
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,350
These plans have been on display
at the planning office now for a year.

36
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,100
On display? I had to go down to a cellar!

37
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:20,550
Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much
damage this bulldozer would suffer,

38
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,100
if I just let it roll straight over you?

39
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,300
- How much?
- None at all.

40
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,200
<i>By a strange coincidence, none at all</i>

41
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,000
<i>is exactly how much suspicion
the ape-descendant Arthur Dent had</i>

42
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,850
<i>that one of his closest friends</i>

43
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,600
<i>was not descended from an ape,
but was, in fact, from a small planet</i>

44
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,050
<i>somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse.</i>

45
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,350
Arthur! Arthur!

46
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,200
- Ford!
- Yes?

47
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,750
Here.

48
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,200
Ah, there you are!

49
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,100
Come, eat, drink with me. We gotta talk.

50
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:56,400
Now's not the best time.
They're going to demolish my home.

51
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,950
Whoa! You already...
You already know? How?

52
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,950
What do you m...?

53
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,800
Oh, they, they? When you say "they",
you mean they? Got it.

54
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,550
Listen, I got something important
I gotta tell you. I gotta tell you right now.

55
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, what about my house?

56
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:25,100
Workers of the Earth, I bring
good tidings of peanuts and beer!

57
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,500
- Good. Next thing. Come on,
let's go to the pub. - Huh?

58
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,600
They said they won't demolish your home
until they've finished the beers.

59
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,100
- Can we trust them?
- I trust them to the end of the Earth.

60
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,550
- How far's that?
- About 12 minutes away.

61
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,700
Huh?

62
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,750
Barman, six pints of bitter and quickly.
The world's about to end.

63
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,750
Six pints coming up.

64
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:56,500
Keep the change.
You got about ten minutes to spend it.

65
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:59,950
Three pints each? At lunchtime?

66
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,100
Sorry.

66
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,500
Time is an illusion.

67
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,750
Lunchtime, doubly so.

68
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,650
And eat those peanuts,
because you'll need the salt.

69
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,400
- Look, what is going on, Ford?
- Arthur...

70
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,050
What if I told you
I really wasn't from Guildford?

71
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,550
I was from a small planet somewhere
in the vicinity of Betelgeuse?

72
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,700
Is that something you're likely to say?

73
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,150
Remember when we met?

74
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,300
Get out the way!

75
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Hi.

76
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,100
Do you think it was a bit strange
I was trying to shake hands with a car?

77
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,750
I assumed you were drunk.

78
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,900
I thought cars were the dominant life form.
I was trying to introducing myself.

79
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,450
You saved my life that day, and now
I'm saving yours. Please drink.

80
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,100
It must be Thursday. I could never
get the hang of Thursdays.

81
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,350
- Arthur, if this is about your house--
- No, it's not about the house.

82
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,400
- Who's he?
- She. She!

83
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,150
Tricia McMillan.
We met at a fancy-dress party.

84
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,650
<i>See, I hate those kind of parties.</i>

85
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,800
<i>I'd much rather have stayed at home
and, I don't know, ironed my hankies.</i>

86
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,900
- <i>But anyway, there I was.</i>
- Who are you?

87
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,700
- Oh!
- <i>And there she was.</i>

88
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,550
- Dent. Arthur Dent.
- Oh, no. I mean, who are you?

89
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,900
Oh, the costume? Right.
"Livingstone, I presume!"

90
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,350
Yeah, it's not as clever as Darwin, I know,
but it's the best I could do at short notice.

91
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,500
You're the first preson who's done that right.

92
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
- Really?
- Yes.

92
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,400
Everyone keeps calling me Santa.

93
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Right.

93
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,000
And I thought the beagle made it
a dead giveaway.

94
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,600
Yes! Well, so did I.

95
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,200
I guess most of the people who come
to these sort of parties are drunken idiots.

96
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,400
What?

97
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,500
I said, all these people are idiots! God!

98
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,950
That's awkward.

99
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,850
Tell me.

100
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,550
She was amazing though, Ford.

101
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,600
<i>Beautiful, witty, mad as a balloon.</i>

102
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,350
I've got to say, without the beard,
you look at least 80 years younger.

103
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,150
Maybe I'm de-evolving.

104
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,300
Well, I feel should tell you

105
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,650
that I do not date single-celled organisms,
okay?

106
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,500
Let's go somewhere.

107
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,000
Yeah, definitely.

107
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,750
Where do you have in mind?

108
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:41,800
- Madagascar.
- Is that that new club on Dean Street?

109
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,250
No, it's a country off the coast of Africa.

110
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,300
That Madagascar?!
Why are we waiting here?

111
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,000
Wait a sec.

112
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,050
Go!

113
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,500
God, you're serious.

113
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,700
I can't go to Madagascar.

114
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,800
- Why not?
- Well, because, I just, you know...

115
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,300
- You're really serious?
- Yeah.

116
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,000
I want to go somewhere I've never been
and I'd like to go with you, so...

117
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,500
What do you say, Dr Livingstone?

118
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,750
I say that's an extraordinary proposition.

119
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:20,850
I can't go. I mean, I've got a job.

120
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,200
Quit. Get a new one when you come back.

121
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't even know your real name.

122
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,700
- Tricia McMillan.
- Well, Tricia McMillan.

123
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,250
I have a proposition for you.

124
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:39,200
Why don't we go somewhere
a little closer first, say Cornwall,

125
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:43,000
and we'll see how it goes.

126
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,850
Right, of course, Cornwall.

127
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,200
Hey, excuse me.

128
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,550
Is this guy boring you?

129
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,200
Why don't you talk to me instead?

130
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,600
I'm from a different planet.

131
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,450
It's true. You want to see my spaceship?

132
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:11,600
"Do you want to see my spaceship?"
I mean, really, what kind of chat-up line is that?

133
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,850
Mmm, that does happen.

134
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,500
Speaking of...

135
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,300
We've got two minutes.
Drink up, drink up, drink up.

136
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,350
That's my house!

137
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:34,200
People of Earth, a round of drinks,
for everyone on me.

138
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,950
Do you really think the world's going to end?

139
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,550
Yes.

140
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:43,100
Shouldn't we lie down, or put a paper
bag over our heads, or something?

141
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,100
- If you like.
- Will it help?

142
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,900
Not at all. See you.

143
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,200
Last order today!

144
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,850
- What is that?!
- Run!

145
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,900
Look out!

146
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,750
A-ha! Towel!

147
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,800
Arthur!

148
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,900
What the hell are those things?

149
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,500
They're ships from a Vogon constructor fleet.

150
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,800
I picked up their signal this morning.
Here, you'll need this.

151
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,400
- What are you doing?
- Hang on, we're hitching a ride.

152
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,200
People of Earth,

153
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:07,750
this is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the
Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council.

154
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,400
As you are probably aware,

155
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,000
<i>plans for the development of
the outlying regions of the galaxy</i>

156
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,750
involve the building of a hyperspace
express route through your star system.

157
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,000
And your planet is one of those
scheduled for demolition.

158
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,550
<i>There's no point acting
all surprised about it.</i>

159
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:35,150
<i>The plans and demolition orders
have been on display</i>

160
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,000
<i>at your local planning office
in Alpha Centauri for 50 of your Earth years.</i>

161
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,850
<i>If you can't be bothered to take any interest
in your local affairs, that's your own lookout.</i>

162
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:46,350
Apathetic bloody planet.

163
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,200
I've no sympathy at all.

164
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,900
<i>'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'</i>

165
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,150
<i>is a wholly remarkable book.</i>

166
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,500
<i>Perhaps the most remarkable,
certainly the most successful book,</i>

167
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,650
<i>ever to come out of the great publishing
corporations of Ursa Minor.</i>

168
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:53,050
<i>More popular than
'The Celestial Homecare Omnibus',</i>

169
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,950
<i>better selling than
'53 More Things to Do in Zero Gravity',</i>

170
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,000
<i>and more controversial than
Oolon Colluphid's trilogy</i>

171
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,250
<i>of philosophical blockbusters,
'Where God Went Wrong',</i>

172
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,850
'Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes',

173
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,300
<i>and 'Who Is This God Person Anyway?'</i>

174
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,100
<i>It's already supplanted
the 'Encyclopedia Galactica'</i>

175
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,100
<i>as the standard repository
of all knowledge and wisdom</i>

176
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,800
<i>for two important reasons.</i>

177
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,500
<i>First, it's slightly cheaper,</i>

178
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,650
<i>and second, it has the words "Don't Panic"</i>

179
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:27,250
<i>printed in large, friendly letters on its cover.</i>

180
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,700
So you're not from Guildford.

181
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,850
Which would explain the accent,
which I've always wondered about.

182
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,700
You're not an out-of-work actor,

183
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:52,250
but rather a writer for this... this book thing.

184
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,750
It's good, huh?

185
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,250
I don't feel well. I need a cup of tea.

186
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:00,750
If I asked where we were, would I regret it?

187
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,100
- We're safe for now.
- Good.

188
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:08,050
We're in the washroom on one of the
ships of the Vogon constructor fleet.

189
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,650
- Oh, get me home, Ford!
- Arthur, your home is...

190
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,300
Oh, God, my home!
My home was demolished.

191
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,050
You don't remember.

192
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:30,450
Okay, Arthur, I've got something to tell you.
It's unfortunate, but it's true.

193
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,750
Your home planet has been blown up.

194
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,000
Blown up!

195
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Couldn't you have done something?

196
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,500
I saved your life.
Okay, that makes us even.

197
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,650
It's a tough galaxy. If you want
to survive out here, you've...

198
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,350
gotta know where your towel is.

199
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,000
Okay, give me a hand over here.

200
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:14,300
Careful. It's hot.
We've gotta get off this ship.

201
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,600
Before the Vogons find us.

202
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,750
Vogons, they hate hitchhikers. Pull.

204
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,900
- Now we'll get a signal.
- What is a Vogon?

205
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,800
Ask the Guide. Say "Vogons".

206
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,650
Vogons.

207
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,850
<i>Vogons are one of the most
unpleasant races in the galaxy.</i>

208
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,250
<i>Not evil, but bad-tempered,
bureaucratic, officious and callous.</i>

209
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:47,850
<i>They wouldn't even lift a finger
to save their own grandmothers</i>

210
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,200
<i>from the Ravenous Bugblatter
Beast of Traal without orders</i>

211
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,700
<i>signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back,</i>

212
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,150
<i>queried, lost, found,
subjected to public inquiry,</i>

213
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,650
<i>lost again and finally buried
in soft peat for three months</i>

214
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,600
<i>and recycled as firelighters.</i>

215
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:09,750
<i>On no account should you allow
a Vogon to read poetry to you.</i>

216
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,950
They can't think, they can't imagine. Most of
them can't even spell. They just run things.

217
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,650
Hmm?

218
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,250
And if we don't get a ride soon,

219
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,750
we won't need the Guide to tell us
just how unpleasant the Vogons can be.

220
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,200
They've already destroyed a planet today.

221
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,600
That always makes them a little <i>eee</i>!

222
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,650
What is that?

223
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,000
Put this in your ear.

223
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,000
Huh? Ford!

224
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,400
<i>We have unwittingly picked up
a couple of hitchhikers.</i>

225
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,000
The fish is translating for you.

226
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,300
<i>The Babel fish is small, yellow, leech-like,</i>

227
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,700
<i>and probably the oddest thing
in the universe.</i>

228
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,250
<i>It feeds on brainwave energy,
absorbing unconscious frequencies,</i>

229
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,900
<i>and excreting a matrix
of conscious frequencies</i>

230
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:11,250
<i>to the speech centers of the brain.</i>

231
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,850
<i>The practical upshot of which is that,
if you stick one in your ear,</i>

232
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:20,550
<i>you instantly understand
anything said to you in any language.</i>

233
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,150
Resistance is useless.

234
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,050
- All right.
- Someone's coming.

235
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,550
Here we go. Look lively.

238
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,550
Sir?

239
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:21,400
- What?
- Hitchhikers.

240
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,000
"O freddled gruntbuggly..."

241
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,650
Oh, no, no, really.
Really you don't have to read.

242
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:09,400
We've put you through
enough trouble already.

243
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,700
"... as plerdled gabbleblotchits
on a lurgid bee."

244
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,150
<i>Vogon poetry is widely accepted
as the third worst in the universe.</i>

245
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:24,550
<i>The second worst
is that of the Azgoths of Kria.</i>

246
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,200
<i>During a recitation by their Poet Master,
Grunthos the Flatulent,</i>

247
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,200
<i>of his poem
'Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty</i>

248
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,850
'I Found in my Armpit
One Midsummer Morning',

249
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,200
<i>four of his audience
died of internal hemorrhaging,</i>

250
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,700
<i>and the President of the
Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council</i>

251
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,300
<i>survived by gnawing
one of his own legs off.</i>

252
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,300
"Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts"

253
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,350
"with my blurgle..."

254
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:55,800
<i>The absolute worst poetry was written
by Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussex.</i>

255
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,450
<i>Luckily, it was destroyed
when the Earth was.</i>

256
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:03,200
"See if I don't." Yeah.

257
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,750
So, Earthlings, I present you with a choice.

258
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:14,000
Either die in the vacuum of space,

259
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:18,900
or tell me what you thought of my poem.

260
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,450
Actually, I rather liked it.

261
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,550
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

262
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:29,350
That's good. That's good, Arthur. Run with it.

263
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,850
Some of the words I didn't understand,

264
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:35,350
but I found the imagery quite effective.

265
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,550
Continue.

266
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,350
Well, yes, interesting rhythmic devices,

267
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,850
which seemed to counterpoint

268
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:46,650
the underlying metaphor of the humanity of...

269
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:49,950
- Vogonity!
- Vogonity, sorry, vogonity.

270
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,400
...of the poet's soul.

271
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,200
So, what you're saying is,

272
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,900
I write poetry, because

273
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,350
underneath this mean,
callous, heartless exterior,

274
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:11,400
I just want to be loved?

275
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,750
Yes, yes, yes.

276
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:17,250
Yes, yes, yeah, please.

278
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,500
Throw them off the ship!

281
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,900
All right! All right!

282
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,550
Resistance is useless!

283
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:42,750
Shut up! Get a job! Wash your filthy hands!

284
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,550
Don't panic. Don't panic.

285
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:51,650
So this is it. We're gonna die.

286
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,350
Yeah, we're gonna die.

287
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,400
No, no, what's this?

288
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,100
- What's that?
- What's this?

289
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,550
What's this? This is nothing.
Yeah, we're gonna die.

290
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,300
You're sweating.

291
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,850
- Would you like a hug?
- No.

292
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,950
<i>"Space", says the introduction
to 'The Hitchhiker's Guide',</i>

293
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,500
<i>"is big. Really big.</i>

294
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,950
<i>"You just won't believe how vastly,
hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is."</i>

295
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,950
<i>And so on.</i>

296
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:58,100
<i>It also says that if you hold a lungful of air,</i>

297
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,600
<i>you can survive in the total vacuum
of space for about 30 seconds.</i>

298
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,850
<i>But with space being really big and all,</i>

299
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,500
<i>the chances of being picked up
within that time</i>

300
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,800
<i>are two to the power of two billion,</i>

301

<i>79 million, 460 thousand,</i>

302
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
<i>347 to one against.</i>

303
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,850
<i>Which, by a staggering coincidence,</i>

304
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,600
<i>is also the telephone number
of the Islington flat,</i>

<i>where Arthur went to a fancy dress party</i>

306

<i>and met a very nice young woman

307
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:34,850
<i>Though the planet Earth,
the Islington flat and telephone</i>

308
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:40,600

309
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,500
- Ford?
- Yes.

310
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,700
- I think I'm a sofa.
- I know how you feel.

311
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,850
So much for the laws of physics.

312
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,750
<i>And once again our top story.</i>

313
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,150
<i>The sensational theft of the most
coveted ship in the universe,</i>

314
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:06,150
<i>the starship Heart of Gold.</i>

315
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,750
<i>Stolen at the launch ceremony
by none other</i>

316
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:11,700
<i>than Galactic President
Zaphod Beeblebrox.</i>

317
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:17,050
<i>In the name of people, freedom,
and democracy, stuff like that,</i>

318
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:21,000
<i>I hereby kidnap myself
and I'm taking the ship with me.</i>

319
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,300
<i>Come on!</i>

320
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,850
<i>Beeblebrox, universally considered</i>

321
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,950
<i>to be the dimmest star
in several solar systems,</i>

322
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:32,700
<i>is most famous for his controversial
defeat of Humma Kavula,</i>

323
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,750
<i>who claimed many thought they were voting
for the worst-dressed sentient being</i>

324
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,850
<i>in the universe contest.</i>

325
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,000
Great.

326
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,000
<i>Humma Kavula is, of course,
best remembered for his slanderous</i>

327
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,700
<i>"Don't Vote for Stupid!" campaign.</i>

328
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,250
Can we put your ego aside for a minute?
Something important has happened.

329
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,400
If there's anything more important
than my ego on this ship,

329
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,600
I want it caught and shot right now.

330
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,500
Hey, come on, I love it.

331
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,650
<i>Zaphod's just this guy, you know.</i>

332
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,900
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What d'you...?
I was just watching myself.

333
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,950
The computer says we have a couple
of hitchhikers in our receiving bay.

334
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,600
Hitchhikers? Why'd you pick up hitchhikers?

335
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,600
I didn't. The ship did.

336
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,950
What? Say what?

337
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:18,000
When we engaged the Improbability Drive...

338
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,200
- This? The big button?
- Yeah, I know.

339
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,000
They were picked up here
in sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.

339
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,900
Wait a minite. That's where you picked me up.

340
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
- What?
- On Earth.

340
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,200
- That's impossible.
- No.

341
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,000
- Just very improbable.
- Listen, Slam.

341
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,600
I don't have time for this, you know?

342
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,700
We've got the police of half the galaxy after us.

342
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,000
We've stopped to pick up hitchhikers. Okay!

343
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,450
So ten out of ten for style, but...

344
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,950
minus several million for good thinking.

345
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:44,350
You're too gorgeous, baby.
Stop it. You drive me crazy.

346
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:47,800
Don't. I'll send Marvin.

347
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,800
Marvin!

348
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:56,900
I think you ought to know
I'm feeling very depressed.

349
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,350
Well, we have something that
should take your mind off things.

350
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:06,150
It won't work.
I have an exceptionally large mind.

351
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:12,150
Yeah, we know. But we need you to go
down to the number two entry bay

352
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,100
and pick up our stowaways
and bring them up here.

353
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,500
Just that? I won't enjoy it.

354
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,200
Yeah, well, that's life.

355
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,550
Life? Don't talk to me about life.

356
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,200
- <i>Commander Kwaltz.</i>
- Yes?

357
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:41,600
<i>We have located the spaceship
Heart of Gold and President Beeblebrox.</i>

358
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:45,850
- Where?
- <i>Sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha.</i>

359
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,450
<i>Requesting hyperspace clearance.</i>

360
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:54,500
Hold your position, captain,
until clearance is granted.

361
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:00,000
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- Get me Vice-President Questular.

362
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:06,500
<i>Hyperspace permission granted, captain.</i>

363
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,950
Here we go.

364
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,250
I think that door just sighed.

365
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,800
Ghastly, isn't it?

366
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,250
All the doors in this spaceship
have been programmed

367
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:41,600
to have a cheerful and sunny disposition.

368
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:48,550
Anyway, come on. I've been ordered
to take you up to the bridge.

369
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,350
Please yourselves.

370
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,650
Here I am, brain the size of a planet,

371
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,350
and they ask me to take you up to the bridge.

372
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:01,700
Call that job satisfaction? 'Cause I don't.

373
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You can thank the Sirius Cybernetics
Corp. for building robots with G.P.P.

374
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,300
- What's G.P.P.?
- Genuine People Personalities.

375
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:15,850
I'm a personality prototype.
You can tell, can't you?

376
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,550
Arthur?

377
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:29,000
<i>Hey, Slim, are you wearing my underwear?
'Cause I'm wearing yours.</i>

378
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,900
<i>And they ain't doing the trick.
Come on. All right!</i>

379
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:38,050
Oh, for heaven's sake.

380
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:41,000
I've brought the aliens.
Don't thank me or anything.

382
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,350
Freeze!

383
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,950
Freeze? I'm a robot. Not a refrigerator.

384
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:52,650
- I wasn't talking to you, Giggles.
- Oh, why do I bother?

385
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,500
- Zaphod?
- Ford?!

386
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:59,050
Is that you? Ford! Praxibetel Ix!

387
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,150
What the hell are you doing here?

388
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,650
I don't know. I just stuck out
my thumb and here I am.

389
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,550
- That is so you!
- Look at you!

390
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,050
President of the Galaxy!
I can't believe you beat Humma Kavula.

391
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,800
- You zarkin' frood.
- Hey, come here, come here.

392
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,300
I want you to meet a friend.
Arthur, this is Zaphod Beeblebrox.

393
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,400
Oh!

394
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,450
President of the Galaxy. This is my
cousin. He's a semi-half brother...

395
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,150
- He shares three of the same mothers as me.
- We've met.

396
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,400
- Have we?
- Yeah.

396
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,700
I'm sorry. I've got a terrible
memory for species.

397
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,100
This is him, Ford. The would-you-
like-to-see-my-spaceship bloke.

399
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:44,950
- Hello, Arthur.
- Tricia!

400
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,400
- How you doin'?
- Hey, Trillian!

401
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,300
This is my semi-half-brother Ix,
I'm sorry, Ford.

402
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

403
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,250
Would you excuse us for a second, please?

404
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,600
You went down on that little planet
and didn't even call me?

405
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,500
Sorry, pal, I didn't know.
You know, I had a galaxy to run.

406
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,850
Hi, Tricia McMillan, right?

407
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:10,150
I think I heard him call you Trillian.
Which of us got the right one?

408
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,750
Oh, I shortened it.
Something a little more spacey.

409
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:15,450
Right. Yes, well... Actually
I was thinking of changing mine to,

410
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,300
I don't know, Arthoolia.

411
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,650
That's a good one!
Well, this is weird.

412
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:25,250
- How'd you get here?
- I just stuck out my thumb, here I am.

413
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:29,000
- Right. In your pajamas?
- I was in a hurry.

414
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,150
Okay. Did you know I was here?

415
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:33,950
Don't flatter yourself.
I've got a spaceman too.

416
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,750
Yeah, that's kinda like the Dingo Shuffle, yeah.

417
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,900
Okay, look...

418
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,850
I left you at the party. I feel bad about it,
but I was gonna call you when I got back.

419
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:45,900
Well, there is no going back now, is there?

420
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,600
You do know what happened, don't you?

421
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,500
Hey, enough small talk. Tria, we're
on the run, remember? I stole a ship.

422
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,500
Excuse me, mate, we're in the middle
of a chat here. Do you mind?

423
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,100
Well, I think the girl's getting... Boo!

424
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,450
You blew it with her, Earthman, so
shut your face or I'll kick you in the zatch.

425
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,150
- You wanna fight? You wanna fight?
- Yeah, okay.

426
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,400
- No, no.
- Earthman wants to fight.

426
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,000
- No.
- I'm just kidding.

427
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,550
I'm a kidder. Come on. Let's be friends.
Let's connect. You and I.

428
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:12,350
Didn't see that one coming, did you?

429
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,950
Popped right out of the box.
You foxy, yeah!

430
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:19,500
You should teach your pal a lesson, Ford.
He's a guest on my ship.

431
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,950
He's a guest on my ship!

432
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I thought you said you stole it.

433
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,500
Stole what? What are we talking about?

434
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,300
Uh-oh! That doesn't sound good.

435
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,900
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, just fabulous, thanks, Trill.

436
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Hey, baby, a little help over here.
I think I'm in over my head.

437
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,450
I'll take care of this. Good Zarquon,
do I have to do everything?

438
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,800
Yes, I do!

439
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,050
Hey, hey, Slim, this is really pretty.

440
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:53,750
- Don't!
- They're on our tail.

441
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,200
Fire a gun! Launch a missile!
Do some damage!

442
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,750
Ow! Stop that! Ow!

443
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,900
Just kiddin'. I love it rough.
Hit me! Hit me, baby!

444
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,900
- Computer?
- <i>Hi, there.</i>

445
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
<i>I'm Eddie, your ship-board computer.</i>

446
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,950
<i>I'm just pleased as punch to report that
it's a fleet of a hundred Vogon battle destroyers.</i>

447
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,300
<i>They're sending you a message.</i>

448
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,750
<i>This is Vice-President Questular Rontok.</i>

449
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:26,250
<i>I am speaking to the kidnapper
of the President?</i>

450
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,550
She digs me. Check it out.

451
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,850
<i>Surrender the stolen vessel at once,</i>

452
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:35,000
<i>or we will take action
as defined and permitted by...</i>

453
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,400
<i>section 1-8 of the Galactic
Interstellar Space Bylaws...</i>

454
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:42,900
<i>Zaphod, please come back now.
This is ridiculous.</i>

455
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,750
Leap to hyperspace! Come on!

456
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,000
<i>Oh, sure thing, fella!</i>

457
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,450
No!

458
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:02,000
Did they have proper
hyperspace authorization?

459
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,900
- No, commander!
- Oh.

460
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,400
Bring me the request
to pursue fugitive forms.

461
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
I'm coming, sir.

462
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:20,000
I'm boiling! Here's the form, sir.

463
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:26,100
So, are you along for the ride,
or am I just dropping you somewhere?

464
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:29,550
That depends. Where are you going?

465
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:31,650
Where am I going?

466
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,900
- You okay?
- Yeah.

466
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,150
Don't suppose there's any tea
in this spaceship, is it?

467
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,350
Yes, there is. Come on.
I'll show you the kitchen.

468
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:44,900
When you see what I'm about to show you,
you'll beg me to take you with us.

469
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,400
<i>The best drink in existence
is the Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster,</i>

470
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:54,200
<i>the effect of which is like having your brains
smashed out by a slice of lemon</i>

471
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,900
<i>wrapped round a large gold brick.</i>

472
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,600
- Belgium.
- Belgium.

472
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,400
Hold it one second.

473
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,400
Hey, Ape-man, Earth dude...
I'm sorry, what's your name again?

474
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,950
- Arthur.
- Right. Gorgeous.

475
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:14,000
No hard feelings, okay?
Sorry to hear about your planet...

476
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,200
- What's it called?
- Earth.

476
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,100
Yeah, yeah. I liked Earth.
Got these boots there.

477
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,350
But listen, don't mention it to the girl, okay?

478
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:23,200
Because if you do, I'll pull your
spleen out through your throat.

479
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:26,200
- All right. Thanks, buddy.
- Okay, okay.

480
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,300
Good stuff. Like those jammies.

481
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:35,150
Hey, hey, Zaphod,
what's with the two-head thing?

482
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,900
Oh, yeah. Apparently, you can't be
president with a whole brain.

483
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,700
It's crazy.

484
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,200
- Oh, so you carved it up?
- Yes.

485
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,700
Some parts of my personality weren't
exactly what you'd call... presidential.

485
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,200
- You know what I mean?
- No, no, no!

486
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,500
No, you know what I'm talking about.

487
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,750
<i>Your tea is ready.</i>

488
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:12,450
I suppose I should've said it resembles tea.

489
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,000
So, two heads is what does it for a girl?

490
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,750
I mean, if I'd had two heads,
or, I don't know, three...

491
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:20,950
Or your own spaceship.

492
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,800
Anything else he's got two of?

493
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,400
Come on, Arthur, don't be like that.

494
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:30,700
What am I supposed to be like?
You know. Green? Bleeping?

495
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,600
I can fold my eyelids inside out if you like.

496
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:37,000
Okay, look. Do you see this?

497
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:41,650
This detects what you're craving
and makes it for you.

498
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:44,050
<i>Enjoy your doughnut.</i>

499
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,500
Do you see this?

500
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:59,400
This toasts bread while you're slicing it.

501
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:05,250
We're on a spaceship, Arthur! In space!

502
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:08,250
- I told you I wanted to get away.
- To Madagascar.

503
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:14,550
That was... some sort of test.
And I failed.

504
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,150
- How badly does it hurt?
- It doesn't feel great.

505
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,250
No, I mean your chin.

506
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,500
- I might have an aspirin.
- Right.

508
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,900
Hey!

509
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:35,800
Tricia... Trillian, sorry.
There's something I have to tell you.

510
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,200
- Please, don't.
- Showtime, Trill!

511
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,500
I'm going to set up.
Buttons aren't toys.

512
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,250
Buttons aren't toys.

513
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,400
Anyway, when I saw
what I'm about to show you,

514
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,150
that's when I realized why I had to do
what I did to my brain.

515
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,400
I think, it's all a little...

516
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,250
shaky.

517
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,450
I've seen it. It's rubbish.

518
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,250
<i>Many millions of years ago,</i>

519
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:18,750
<i>a race of hyper intelligent,
pan-dimensional beings</i>

520
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:22,750
<i>got so fed up with the constant
bickering about the meaning of life,</i>

521
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:25,700
<i>that they commissioned
two of their brightest and best</i>

522
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,250
<i>to design and build
a stupendous super-computer</i>

523
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:33,700
<i>to calculate the answer to life,
the universe and everything.</i>

524
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,800
O' Deep Thought,

525
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:41,150
we want you to tell us the answer.

526
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:43,500
<i>The answer to what?</i>

527
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:48,200
The answer to life,
the universe, everything.

528
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:52,350
We'd really like an answer.
Something simple.

529
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,700
<i>I'd have to think about that.</i>

530
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:02,050
Return to this place in exactly
7.5 million years.

531
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,200
- Is it finished?
- No, no, no, there's more. There's more.

531
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,800
They go back.

532
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:11,000
- What, 7.5 million years later?
- That's right, they do.

533
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:32,000
- Deep Thought, do you have--
- An answer for you?

534
00:41:33,250 --> 00:41:35,000
Yes, but you're not gonna like it.

535
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,900
- It doesn't matter. We must know it.
- All right.

536
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,950
The answer to the ultimate question...

537
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,550
of life, the universe and everything...

538
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,300
is...

539
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,700
42.

540
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,550
Yeah? What?

541
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:04,150
42!

542
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:08,450
Yes, yes, I thought it over
quite thoroughly. It is. It's 42.

543
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,800
It would've been simpler, of course,
to have known what the actual question was.

544
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,750
But it was the question.
The ultimate question. Of everything!

545
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,750
That's not a question.

546
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:22,200
Only when you know the question
will you know what the answer means.

547
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:27,300
- Give us the ultimate question then.
- I can't. But there is one who can.

548
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:31,350
A computer that will calculate
the ultimate question.

549
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:34,050
A computer of such infinite complexity,

550
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:38,200
that life itself will form part
of its operational matrix.

551
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:42,450
And you yourselves shall take on new,
more primitive forms,

552
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:48,300
and go down into the computer to
navigate its 10-million-year program.

553
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,100
I shall design this computer for you,
and it shall be called...

554
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,000
- That's it?
- That's it.

555
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,500
You're looking for the ultimate question.

555
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,700
- Yep.
- You?

555
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,150
- Me.
- Why?

556
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,000
No, I tried that. Why? 42. Doesn't work.

557
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,950
- Let's get it ready, baby.
- Why...

558
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:13,000
do you wanna know the ultimate question?

559
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:17,250
Oh, well, partly the curiosity,
partly a sense of adventure,

560
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,750
but mostly I think
it's for the fame and the money.

561
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:23,000
You're President of the Galaxy, aren't you?

562
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,000
- That's right, Arman.
- Arthur.

563
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,400
Whatever. Presidential fame is temporary.

564
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,300
I find the question, that's permanent. It sticks.

565
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,900
Plus, everyone thinks you're deep. Win-win.

566
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:39,350
We just hit that button and... Bam!
...we're at Magrathea, I think.

567
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,650
I mean, I don't know, we've hit it twice
and we're still not there, but anyway...

568
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,150
- You in?
- Always.

569
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:48,000
- All right!
- I want to get off.

570
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,550
- Sorry, what exactly are we doing?
- This!

571
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,500
<i>The Infinite Improbability Drive
is a wonderful new method</i>

572
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:02,400
<i>of crossing interstellar distances
in a few seconds,</i>

573
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:05,700
<i>without all that tedious
mucking about in hyperspace.</i>

574
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,000
<i>As the Improbability Drive
reaches infinite improbability,</i>

575
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:13,100
<i>it passes through every conceivable
point in every conceivable universe</i>

576
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,950
<i>almost simultaneously.</i>

577
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,000
<i>In other words, you're never sure
where you'll end up,</i>

578
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,800
<i>or even what species you'll be
when you get there.</i>

579
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,850
<i>It's therefore important
to dress accordingly.</i>

580
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:27,300
<i>The Infinite Improbability Drive was invented
following research into finite improbability,</i>

581
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,500
<i>which was often used
to break the ice at parties</i>

582
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,500
<i>by making all the molecules
in the hostess' undergarments</i>

583
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,900
<i>leap simultaneously one foot to the left</i>

584
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,600
<i>in accordance with
the theory of indeterminacy.</i>

585
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,250
<i>Many respectable physicists said they
weren't going stand for that sort of thing,</i>

586
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:43,450
<i>partly because it was
a debased of science,</i>

587
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:47,500
<i>but mostly because they didn't get
invited to those sort of parties.</i>

588
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,250
Wow! Is this gonna happen
every time we hit that button?

589
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:03,250
Very probably, yes.

590
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:06,300
I think the Earthman's about to be sick.

591
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,250
Whoa, whoa! Do it in the trashcan,
ape-man. This ship's brand new.

592
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,000
Aw, Come on!

593
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,600
We have normality.

594
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,400
Did it work? Are we there?

595
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:22,350
Yeah. We're here. Magrathea!

596
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,200
- I don't think so. Eddie...
- Magrathea!

597
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:26,250
What planet are we looking at?

598
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:28,150
<i>I'm checking for you.</i>

599
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:33,250
Did you just pluck one of my hairs?
Off my head?

600
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:36,900
<i>Thank you so much for waiting.
I'm sorry to disappoint you gang,</i>

601
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,050
<i>but this is not Magrathea.</i>

602
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,900
<i>We are currently in orbit around
the planet Viltvodle Six.</i>

603
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,750
Humma Kavula!

604
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:51,800
Magrathea's gonna have to wait.
I got a score to settle on this planet.

605
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:56,850
Humma Kavula!

606
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:04,050
<i>In the beginning,
the universe was created.</i>

607
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:08,950
<i>This made a lot of people very angry,
and has been widely regarded as a bad move.</i>

608
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,350
<i>Many races believed that
it was created by some sort of god.</i>

609
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:17,900
<i>Though the Jatravartid people
of Viltvodle Six firmly believed</i>

610
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,050
<i>that the entire universe was, in fact,
sneezed out of the nose of a being</i>

611
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:24,950
<i>called the Great Green Arkleseizure.</i>

612
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,700
Humma Kavula!

613
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,100
<i>The Jatravartids,
who lived in perpetual fear</i>

614
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,650
<i>of the time they called the
'Coming of the Great White Handkerchief',</i>

615
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:36,550
<i>were small blue creatures
with more than 50 arms each.</i>

616
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:39,200
<i>They were unique in being
the only race in history</i>

617
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:43,000
<i>to have invented the aerosol deodorant
before the wheel.</i>

618
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:46,900
Mr. President!

619
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,700
Hey, all right. How you doin'? All right.

620
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,000
Hey, what have we here? I love it!

621
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:58,450
Hey, I love you. Fantastic!

622
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:01,150
You guys related? Don't go changing. Keep up!

623
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,350
Arthur, I want a drink.

624
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:07,600
I think I've been here before.
Have I been here before?

625
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,250
Ixxie!

626
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,350
- I've been here before.
- Humma Kavula!

627
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,000
Come on.

628
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,100
Tricia! Tricia!

628
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:45,000
♪ Thy Handkerchief to bring us back to Thee ♪

629
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:51,200
Hello, Humma.

630
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,200
Please, join us. Sit down.

630
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,400
Hey, good to see you. Thanks. All right.

631
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,600
The handkerchief is coming beloveds.

632
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:05,600
Let us pray the Almighty will exhale
a breath of compassion on us all.

633
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:11,200
So that's Humma Kavula.
I thought he was just swearing.

634
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:16,200
We lift our noses, clogged and unblown,

635
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,400
in reverence to you.

636
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,100
Send the handkerchief, O' Blessed One,
so that it may wipe us clean.

637
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:30,900
We ask this and all things
in Thy precious and alliterative name.

638
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:41,700
Bless you.

639
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:44,500
Where're we going? We're in here?

640
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,400
All right, I like it. It's big,
it's gold, it's fancy. Fancy pants.

641
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:52,050
Zaphod Beeblebrox,
our infamous President.

642
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:54,850
What brings you to our humble planet?

643
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:57,000
Oh, I think you know why I'm here.

644
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,900
No, I don't think I do.

645
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:05,650
Oh, I think you think you don't.
But we both know you do.

646
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,500
Eloquent as always, Zaphod.

647
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:11,450
Your ability to articulate
never ceases to amaze.

648
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:14,600
That's funny. During the campaign, Humma,

649
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:17,100
when you were my opponent
running against me,

650
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,500
you said I was stupid.

651
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:44,200
The election is ancient history, Zaphod, but...

652
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,550
if memory serves, you won,

653
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:50,950
proving that good looks and charm win

654
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:55,950
over brilliance and the ability to govern.

655
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:03,500
And, incidentally, you are stupid.

656
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,150
Excuse me, excuse me, Mr. Humma, sir.

657
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,400
I just want to say, there's been
some sort of terrible mix up, hasn't it?

658
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,900
'Cause, actually, he's not with us.

659
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,900
We came to worship you.
He followed us and...

660
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,600
He grew, didn't he. He's not that tall.

661
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:23,850
You didn't come half-way across the galaxy
to settle a campaign grudge, Zaphod.

662
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,400
Why are you here?

663
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,650
Of course not. That's... that's ridiculous.

664
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:36,000
I've been stranded on a strange planet
for a number of years.

664
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,400
I haven't been avoiding you.

665
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,500
You look great. You're doing well.

666
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,250
You've grown, obviously.

667
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
We don't know why we're here.

668
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:50,100
We were trying to get to Magrathea,
and our ship brought us here.

669
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:55,150
How very, very improbable.

670
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:05,400
I kept a few souvenirs from my former life.

671
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:08,400
The heady days of space piracy.

672
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:16,200
But even an Infinite Improbability
Drive requires coordinates.

673
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,700
Which I happen to have.

674
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:20,400
No, no, no.

675
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:22,950
You don't get something for nothing, Zaphod.

676
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:25,700
You must bring me something in return.

677
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,650
- What?
- A gun.

678
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:30,750
- A gun?
- A very special gun.

679
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:34,100
Designed by the greatest
computer ever invented.

680
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,200
But the only way to find it
is to go to Magrathea.

681
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:41,700
Fine. I'll get your gun.
Just give me the coordinates.

682
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,600
And what will you give me
to ensure your return?

683
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,850
My word as President.

684
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:52,650
No. I need a hostage.

685
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:02,350
Only... what does Zaphod
Beeblebrox treasure?

686
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Come on.

687
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,500
Oh, no!

688
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:15,900
Hey, hey, hey! Take it easy now.
Think about this before you do.

689
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,200
No, stop it! Oh, that kind of tickles.

690
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:22,800
Two heads are better than one.
Double your pleasure.

691
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:26,700
It's not fair! You need me!

692
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:31,000
Come back! Come back!
Don't leave me alone.

693
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:35,950
<i>Come back!</i>

694
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,700
Well, now, that was fun, wasn't it?

694
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,000
And there I was thinking I was the only one

695
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,200
who considered your boyfriend
a narcissistic moron,

695
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,650
when apparently the whole galaxy does!

696
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:45,550
What about you?
"Oh, excuse me, Mr. Humma, sir.

697
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:49,000
"We're not actually with him.
We just came here to worship you."

698
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:53,000
- Very brave!
- Where the hell is Ford?

699
00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:02,700
By the left, march.
Left, right, left, right, left, right.

700
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,000
Mr. President, we're here for your protection.

701
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,750
Fire upon the kidnapper.

702
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:12,200
<i>Hey, come on!</i>

703
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,900
Commander, the President is the kidnapper!
You're going to kill him!

704
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,900
Bang, bang, bang, bang!

705
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,950
It's locked!

706
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:24,250
Thank you, darling. I'll be in touch.

707
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,000
Come on, Zaphod.

708
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:38,250
- Hey, hey, what did I miss?
- What the hell have you been doing?!

709
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:39,900
I was out doing field research.

709
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,800
So, they found where we are.
Belgium bummer!

710
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,500
Bummer? They're shooting at us!
What are we gonna do?

711
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:45,600
I have an idea.

711
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,050
Does it involve pushing him out there
and running the other way?

712
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:50,600
What? He's the one they want.

713
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,000
Tricia, you can't go out there.
What are you doing?

714
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:57,250
- Back off!
- What's going on?

715
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:02,150
<i>I have the President
and I will kill him, I swear I will.</i>

716
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:06,250
- Could that actually kill him?
- I don't think so.

717
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:08,500
- It's an aerosol can.
- Oh.

718
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:12,100
Okay, frightened now, frightened.

719
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:16,200
- Hi, little guy.
- Get her!

720
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,300
- Zaphod, no, come on!
- Arthur!

721
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,900
- Arthur!
- Tricia!

722
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,000
- Arthur!
- Tricia! Wait!

723
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:37,000
Arthur!

724
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,100
<b>Resistance is useless!</b>

725
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,900
<i>Bring her to Vogsphere
for processing, captain.</i>

726
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:00,450
Circus? Circus?

727
00:55:00,550 --> 00:55:03,150
They got her and it's my fault.
We have to go. Let's go!

728
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:04,750
Let's go!

729
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,350
Computer, take us to Magrathea!

730
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:12,850
What? No, no, no, no, no.
We've got to go after Tricia.

731
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:14,400
- Who?
- Trillian, Trillian!

732
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,000
They've got Trillian,
you stupid half-brained git!

733
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:21,200
Right, you're coming out!

734
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:25,200
Computer, we don't want to go to
Magrathea yet. We want to follow the ships.

735
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,950
<i>Oh, I'd love to, fella, but, wouldn't you know it,
my guidance system has been deactivated.</i>

736
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:30,150
Oh, come on!

737
00:55:30,250 --> 00:55:32,500
<i>I'm sorry about that, but it wasn't my fault.</i>

738
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,800
What are you doing on this spaceship?

739
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,500
- Ford?
- Marvin.

740
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,000
I've been talking to the ship's computer.

741
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,400
And?

742
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:42,400
It hates me.

743
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:45,700
No, uh-uh. Eddie, computer...

744
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,300
There must be another way.
Is there another way to follow the ships?

745
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,850
<i>Activating Emergency Escape Pod.
It's super-neat and fun to fly!</i>

747
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,750
Unbelievable!

748
00:55:57,850 --> 00:55:59,100
I'm in. I'm in.

748
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,100
- Okay, Ford!
- Yeah, I'm here.

748
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,200
Do you have any idea?

749
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,900
- Okay, we'll press this button here.
- Okay, okay.

750
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,900
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

751
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
- Press this button again.
- No. Nothing's...

751
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,200
- Okay! Here we go!
- That's good.

752
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,250
- Good man, good man, good man.

752
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,300
- Good move.

752
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,300
- Okay. No, no! Not now!

753
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,900
Okay, we're wobbling.

753
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,900
- Hey, you forgot your towel.
- No!

754
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,550
Get him off me! I'll kill him! I'll kill...

755
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:21,150
- Okay, Ford, there's a...
- Is that better?

756
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,250
No, that's worse, that's worse.

757
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:25,500
- Do what... I don't need that.
- No, no, no.

757
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,700
- I don't need that.
- Okay.

758
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,450
Can you stop the rocking?
Okay, Marvin, any ideas?

759
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:33,200
I have a million ideas.
They all point to certain death.

760
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,700
Thanks very much, Marv!

765
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,000
Magrathea!

765
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,800
- No. We're on the Vogon planet.
- Yes!

766
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,500
- Yes, it is! It's Magrathea!
- This is Vogsphere.

767
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,500
Yeah, Magrathea!

767
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,800
- No, it's not.
- Yes it is! I know it is!

768
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:34,400
- There is no Magrathea.
- Yes, it is! Yes, it is!

769
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,700
- What are you doing?
- They took my head.

770
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,500
- They have these on Arcturan mega freighters.
- They took my head.

771
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,250
Captains use them when
they really need to concentrate.

772
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:46,200
- What is it?
- It's a thinking cap.

773
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:52,000
There you go.

774
00:57:56,550 --> 00:58:00,250
It should give him some zest
for about ten minutes or so.

775
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:04,800
Now I'm feeling much better
about our predicament.

776
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:29,250
By the way, I checked the Guide for the best
way to rescue a prisoner from Vogsphere.

777
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:32,550
It said don't.
I'm assuming you have a better plan.

778
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:35,150
Well, I kind of had this idea that we could...

779
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,500
- Did anyone see that?
- See what?

780
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,500
- What was it?
- Huh!

781
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:45,900
Nothing, it's... nothing.
It's just my imagination.

782
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,200
Okay, right now, stop! Everyone just
stop a minute, please, and look at me.

783
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:55,200
There's... definitely
something going on here.

784
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,300
Just... just watch.

785
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,750
Just watch.

786
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,150
Okay, I think we...

787
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,350
Ah-ha! You too!

788
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,400
Yeah, what was that?

789
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,550
I thi...

790
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,800
Zaphod, what do you think?

791
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,200
I think...

791
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,800
Zarquon! What was that? Jeez!

792
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:30,550
I'd make a suggestion,
but you wouldn't listen.

793
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,550
- No one ever does.
- I have an idea.

794
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,500
Ford! Kill it! Get rid of it!

795
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,000
Okay, don't think.

796
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,600
Nobody think. No ideas.

797
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,850
No theories. No nothing.

799
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:01,650
This is crazy!
Trillian is in there somewhere.

800
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:04,400
And we need an idea to help save her.

800
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,550
I have an ide...

801
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,800
Run!

803
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:40,250
You're supposed to stop.

804
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:53,800
Okay, so I'm not thinking.
Not thinking. No ideas coming.

805
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,750
All right, this isn't an idea
that has any merit at all,

806
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:03,500
but, Marvin, can you give me a hand?

807
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,300
Okay, where is she?!

808
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,150
Who, the director of robot arm repair?

809
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:20,350
Tricia Yggarstuk McMillanus of... Blaard?

810
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:23,650
No, Tricia Marie McMillan of Earth.

811
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,350
Oh, right.

812
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,300
Sorry, no record of Earth.

813
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,200
Galactic sector ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha?

814
01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:42,750
- Oh, yes.
- She's lying.

815
01:01:44,250 --> 01:01:47,600
She's skinny, and she's pretty,
and she's lying.

816
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,450
Oh, yes, here we are. Earth.

817
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:54,950
Oh! "Destroyed".

818
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:58,500
Do you have a second home planet?

819
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:02,100
- Destroyed? That's impossible.
- That's what it says here.

820
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:07,350
Says it was destroyed to make way
for a hyperspace expressway.

821
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:18,000
Who in their right mind gives
an order to destroy a planet?

822
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:24,100
- He said the gray building, right?
- All the buildings are gray.

823
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,500
"Give me a hand." Ha-ha, very funny.

824
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:31,100
How am I supposed to drive this pod
with one arm? Stupid human.

825
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,700
So, you need to go back and fill that in.

826
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,100
And then, make sure,

826
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,100
- when you fill in the facilitating form...
- Okay.

827
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:47,050
Leave this to me. I'm British.
I know how to queue.

828
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,050
If you'd fill that form in for me,

829
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:53,850
and return it as soon as possible.

830
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:57,000
You'll find writing implements to your left...

830
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:58,300
You're President. Can you do anything?

831
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,200
Presidents don't have power.
Their job is to draw attention away from it.

831
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:04,000
- No offense. You're a great guy.
- Hey!

832
01:03:05,350 --> 01:03:07,400
Hey, how're you doin'?

833
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,000
Hey, it's me, your President!

833
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:12,200
What's goin' on? Nice to see you.
Thanks for coming.

834
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:15,100
All right. I know that sponge. All right!

835
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,500
- Next!
- President coming through.

836
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,650
How you doin', Pinhead?
Thank you. No, really, it's me.

837
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:23,350
I love kabuki. Look at that little thing.

838
01:03:23,450 --> 01:03:26,350
Out the way. Out the way.

839
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:29,450
Give us a kiss! Give us a kiss, darling!

840
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,400
Hi, I've come about release of a prisoner.

841
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,500
Prisoner release form.

842
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:38,900
Oh, wha...?

843
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,200
I don't believe you.

844
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,900
These are the orders.

845
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,850
"Love and kisses"?!

846
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,600
Now, according to the Galactic Penal Code,

847
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:59,450
- the punishment for a presidential kidnapping...
- Come on, love!

848
01:03:59,550 --> 01:04:03,300
...is to be fed to the Ravenous
Bugblatter Beast of Traal.

849
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:06,150
Good day.

850
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:09,000
Get off of me!

851
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,700
What the hell is that?

852
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:18,000
No! wait, wait!
There's been some kind of mistake.

853
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:25,850
- Tick all the boxes at the right-hand side
of the page. - Okay. Right. Yeah, I've got it.

854
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:27,950
- Uh-huh.
- Not that one!

855
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:32,350
<i>What to do if you find yourself
stuck with no hope of rescue.</i>

856
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:36,750
<i>Consider how lucky you are that
life has been good to you so far.</i>

857
01:04:36,850 --> 01:04:40,250
<i>Alternatively, if life hasn't
been good to you so far,</i>

858
01:04:40,350 --> 01:04:43,500
<i>which, given your current
circumstances seems more likely,</i>

859
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:47,750
<i>consider how lucky you are that
it won't be troubling you much longer.</i>

860
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,000
Right, there we go.

861
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,600
Oh, kidnapping the President!

862
01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:01,100
And, no, she's not eligible
for release at this time.

863
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:04,350
Okay. Right. Look...
This... this is the President.

864
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:06,550
- Oh!
- Okay. See, there?

865
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:10,300
He says the whole kidnapping business
was just a horrible misunderstanding.

866
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,950
Oh, yeah.

867
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:15,000
She didn't mean anything by it.
He's ordering you to let her go.

868
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:20,600
But this isn't a presidential
release of prisoner form.

869
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,500
Those are blue.

870
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,050
- I'll stay here.
- Okay. All right. Hold that. Okay.

871
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:35,800
Oh, he's hungry today.

872
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:39,200
That's blue. Right.

873
01:05:41,450 --> 01:05:44,350
- I'm not a journalist.
- We're just hanging out.

874
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:47,700
Okay. Okay, this is...
it's for Tricia McMillan.

875
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:52,100
Tricia McMillan. Okay.

876
01:05:53,350 --> 01:05:57,500
Sir, it's a release form.

877
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,900
Thank you.

878
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,100
She's free to go.

879
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,400
Release her.

880
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:10,900
Zaphod's here. Well then, that's fine then.

880
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,500
Let's just go and him.

881
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:20,350
Who are we waiting for again?

882
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,700
No, I'm serious.

883
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,650
Tricia!

884
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,250
- Tricia!
- Trill.

885
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:39,250
- Hey, come on.
- You idiot!

886
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:41,350
You signed the order to destroy Earth.

887
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:43,300
- He did?!
- I did?

888
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:47,850
Yes. "Love and kisses, Zaphod"?
You didn't even read it, did you?

889
01:06:47,950 --> 01:06:52,750
Honey, I'm President of the Galaxy.
I don't get a lot of time for reading.

890
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:56,650
An entire planet, my home,

891
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:59,400
destroyed all because you thought
somebody wanted your autograph!

892
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,700
- Honey, they framed me!
- Are you an idiot?! Serously?!

893
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:06,700
- Trillian!
- You knew. Why didn't you tell me?

894
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:10,900
- He threatened me.
- Get a backbone, Arthur.

895
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,150
Oh, a backbone? What about coming
here to rescue you? Thank you. My idea.

896
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:20,000
Stupid!

897
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:26,000
- Got your arm.
- How considerate.

898
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:30,450
Right, then, all those of you lucky enough
to have two arms, hold tight.

899
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:50,300
The President tests my patience.

900
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,200
This time I shall pursue him myself.
Ready my ship.

901
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,250
Fantastic. At last.

902
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:06,850
Oh! That's one hour for lunch, everybody.

903
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:11,150
I think I'll have soup today.

904
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:15,400
<i>The Encyclopedia Galactica,
in its chapter on love,</i>

905
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,900
<i>states that it is
far too complicated to define.</i>

906
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:23,450
<i>'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'
has this to say on the subject of love.</i>

907
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:26,050
<i>"Avoid, if at all possible."</i>

908
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:29,050
<i>Unfortunately, Arthur Dent has never read</i>

909
01:08:29,150 --> 01:08:31,600
<i>'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'.</i>

910
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:35,700
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No, come in.

911
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,050
I didn't...

912
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,650
Look...

913
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:45,700
Trillian, I just wanted to say,
you were right, of course.

914
01:08:45,800 --> 01:08:50,600
I should've told you, and I understand
totally if you're angry with me.

915
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:55,100
For what it's worth,
I know how you must be feeling.

916
01:08:56,850 --> 01:09:01,200
- Can you hand me a towel?
- Yeah, sure, this...

917
01:09:02,650 --> 01:09:04,650
Thank you.

918
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:07,750
Actually, what I was gonna say was...

919
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:14,100
if I'd said yes to you
and gone to Madagascar,

920
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:18,050
then neither of us would be here now.

921
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:21,900
I just thought that might count for something.

922
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,200
It doesn't matter.

923
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:55,850
All right, computer, take us to...
Where we headed again?

924
01:09:55,950 --> 01:09:59,350
Okay, I'm gonna get you another lemon.

925
01:09:59,450 --> 01:10:01,450
All right.

No, no, no. Zaphod, no.

Incredible.

01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:14,850
- How can a planet be closed?
- Zarkin' A, cousin.

943
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:18,350
Okay, computer, keep going. Take us down.

944
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:20,050
<i>I'd be happy to.</i>

945
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:24,350
<i>It is most gratifying that your enthusiasm</i>

946
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:26,500
<i>for our planet continues unabated.</i>

947
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:29,500
<i>As a token of our appreciation,</i>

948
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,600
<i>we hope you will enjoy
the two thermo-nuclear missiles</i>

949
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:36,000
<i>we've just sent
to converge with your craft.</i>

950
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,150
<i>To ensure on-going quality of service,</i>

951
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:43,450
<i>your death may be monitored
for training purposes. Thank you.</i>

952
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:45,500
<i>Guys, I'm delighted to tell you</i>

953
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,450
<i>that there are two thermo-nuclear
missiles heading right for us.</i>

954
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:51,850
<i>If you don't mind, I'm gonna go ahead
and take evasive action.</i>

955
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:59,400
<i>There seems to be something
jamming my guidance system.</i>

956
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,500
<i>Impact minus 45 seconds.</i>

957
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:07,400
Computer, do something!

958
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:11,800
<i>Sure thing, fella. Handing over
manual control. Good luck!</i>

959
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,000
I need some help!

960
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,900
I can't do this without my third arm.

961
01:12:30,500 --> 01:12:33,000
Arthur, grab my hand!

962
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:47,150
- Did we lose 'em?
- No, they're coming right at us.

963
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:53,500
- Why don't I just press this thing?!
- No, we're not fully back to normal yet!

964
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,600
- So, what will happen then?!
- I don't know!

965
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:59,700
No! Don't do it! We're here.
No telling where it'll send us. Don't do it.

966
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,650
- Sod it all.
- No!

967
01:13:08,650 --> 01:13:12,000
Wow! Where are we?

968
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,000
Exactly where we were.

969
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:20,650
And the missiles?

970
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:27,250
Apparently, they've turned
into a bowl of petunias.

971
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:31,600
And a very surprised-looking whale.

972
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:39,000
<i>And an improbability factor
of 8,767,128 to 1 against.</i>

973
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:42,800
We have normality.

974
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,300
Normality, right.

975
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,300
We can talk about normality
till the cows come home.

976
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:52,500
- What is normal?
- What's home?

977
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:54,300
What are cows?

978
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:58,350
A proper cup of tea
would restore my normality.

979
01:13:58,450 --> 01:14:02,700
<i>It is important to note that,
suddenly and against all probability,</i>

980
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,700
<i>a sperm whale had been
called into existence</i>

981
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:09,850
<i>several miles above
the surface of an alien planet.</i>

982
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:12,800
<i>And since this is not a naturally
tenable position for a whale,</i>

983
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:17,900
<i>this innocent creature had very little
time to come to terms with its identity.</i>

984
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,550
<i>This is what it thought as it fell...</i>

985
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,850
Whoa! What's happening? Who am I?

986
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:27,600
Why am I here? What's my purpose in life?
What do I mean by who am I?

987
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:29,850
Okay, okay. Calm down, calm down.
Get a grip now.

988
01:14:29,950 --> 01:14:34,000
Ooh, this is an interesting sensation.
What is it? It is a sort of tingling in my...

989
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:39,150
Well, I suppose I better start finding names
for things. Let's call it a... tail. Yeah, tail!

990
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:43,350
And, hey, what's this roaring sound whooshing
past what I'm suddenly gonna call my head?

991
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:45,550
Wind. Is that a good name? That'll do.

992
01:14:45,650 --> 01:14:48,900
Yay, this is really exciting.
I'm dizzy with anticipation.

993
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,550
Or is it the wind?
There's a lot of that now, isn't it?

994
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:55,700
And what's this thing coming towards me
very fast? So big and flat and round.

995
01:14:55,850 --> 01:15:00,900
It needs a big wide-sounding name
like ow, ound, round, ground!

996
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:05,550
That's it, ground! I wonder if it'll be
friends with me. Hello, ground.

997
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:11,750
<i>Curiously, the only thing that went
through the mind of the bowl of petunias</i>

998
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:15,850
<i>as it fell was, "Oh, no, not again!"</i>

999
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:22,750
<i>Many have speculated that if we knew exactly
why the bowl of petunias had thought that,</i>

1000
01:15:22,850 --> 01:15:28,200
<i>we should know a lot more about the
nature of the universe than we do now.</i>

1001
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:34,800
What are those things?

1002
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:38,250
They're portals to another dimension.

1003
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:42,850
Right. I don't suppose this portal
has central heating, does it?

1004
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,650
Ah, this is the one.

1005
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:55,000
This will all end in tears, I just know it.

1006
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:00,300
Right here.

1007
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,000
Hey! Whoa!

1008
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:07,150
Okay, in we go!

1009
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:12,350
We can't just step into that... that!
We don't know where it leads.

1010
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:14,600
If we pick the wrong one,

1011
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:18,450
we just... we come back,
we pick another one. It's no biggie.

1012
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:22,150
What?! Yeah, it's a big biggie, Ford.
A big biggie!

1013
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:27,200
I mean, what if it rips us all into
tiny little atomic particle thingies?!

1014
01:16:27,300 --> 01:16:30,850
This is the right one. I have a hunch.

1015
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:35,150
- Ford!
- His hunches are good.

1016
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:37,650
Arthur, I say we go.

1017
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:43,600
Go with the hunch of a man
whose brain is fuelled by lemons?!

1018
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,350
This is suicide!

1019
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:49,450
- I think I resent that.
- I don't care what you think you think.

1020
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:52,450
I'm getting a lot of hostility from you,
Alex or...

1021
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:56,100
- Arthur!
- Have you ever tried yoga?

1022
01:16:57,300 --> 01:17:00,900
- Trillian!
- I think that's supposed to happen.

1023
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:09,000
She's gone! Ford, she's gone!

1024
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:12,250
Arthur, don't panic!

1025
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:17,900
- Ford!
- Hey, wait for me!

1028
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:39,300
Idiot! Come on, come on, come on!

1030
01:18:00,350 --> 01:18:04,000
No, no, no, don't leave.
Come on, come on, just start!

1031
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:07,250
I told you this would end in tears.

1032
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:09,450
Did you?! Did you?!

1033
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,450
Geronimo!

1035
01:18:23,150 --> 01:18:27,000
Far out! Far out!

1036
01:18:27,750 --> 01:18:32,450
This is it! This is it!
Deep Thought. I'm a-coming.

1037
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:41,550
So, this is how it's all going to end, is it, ey?

1038
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:46,550
Me, alone on a dead planet,
with a manically depressed robot.

1039
01:18:46,650 --> 01:18:48,100
You think you've got problems.

1040
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,750
What are you supposed to do,
if you are a manically depressed robot?

1041
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:53,050
Excuse me.

1043
01:19:00,150 --> 01:19:04,750
- Who are you?
- What? No, my name is not important.

1044
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,400
You must come with me.

1045
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:12,800
- Get away.
- Terrible events are afoot.

1046
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:16,400
You must come or you'll be late.

1047
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,700
- Late? What for?
- What?

1048
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:24,350
No, no. What's your name, Earthman?

1049
01:19:25,350 --> 01:19:27,700
- Dent. Arthur Dent.
- Well...

1050
01:19:27,800 --> 01:19:30,800
late as in "the late Dentarthurdent".

1051
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:35,150
It's a sort of threat, do you see? No.

1052
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:38,250
- No.
- Your friends are safe.

1053
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:41,600
- You can trust me.
- Trust a man who won't tell me his name?

1054
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,400
Okay, my name is...

1055
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:50,700
My name is... Slartibartfast.

1056
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,700
I said it wasn't important.

1057
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:01,550
Well... so my friends are safe?

1058
01:20:01,650 --> 01:20:03,100
Let me show you.

1059
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:09,100
I could calculate your chances
of survival, but you won't like it.

1060
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:36,850
Did you know we built planets?

1061
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:40,950
Oh, yes! Fascinating trade.

1062
01:20:41,050 --> 01:20:45,700
Doing the coastlines
was always my favorite.

1063
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:51,450
And we used to have endless fun doing
the little fiddly bits around the fjords.

1064
01:20:51,550 --> 01:20:56,550
But then the galactic economy collapsed,
and seeing that custom-built planets

1065
01:20:56,650 --> 01:21:02,150
are a bit of a luxury commodity...

1066
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:06,100
Anyway, you must come with me, because
there's been a terrible mix-up with your planet.

1067
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,450
Best laid plans of mice, you know.

1068
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:12,000
- And men.
- What?

1069
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,050
Best laid plans of mice and men.

1070
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,950
Yes, well, I don't think men have
got much to do with it. Here.

1071
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:01,900
I must warn you,

1072
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,500
we're going to pass through,
well, a sort of gateway thing.

1073
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,800
- Huh?
- It may disturb you.

1074
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:11,000
It scares the willies out of me.

1076
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,500
Welcome to our factory floor.

1078
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:12,400
All right. All right.

1079
01:23:12,500 --> 01:23:15,350
Yeah, this is it.

1080
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,000
This is it.

1081
01:23:21,050 --> 01:23:24,900
O' great Deep Thought!

1082
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,700
We have traveled long...

1083
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:30,550
and far.

1084
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:36,150
Have you calculated
the ultimate question of life,

1085
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:39,000
the universe and everything?

1086
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,450
No.

1087
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:43,150
- What?
- I've been watching TV.

1088
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,300
Oh.

1089
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,500
I designed another computer to do that.

1090
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:50,450
Oh, right, I forgot. Is it here?

1091
01:23:50,550 --> 01:23:53,300
No, it's not here. It's another world.

1092
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:55,550
It's on another world.

1093
01:23:55,650 --> 01:23:59,150
It is another world, stupid.

1094
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:01,650
Or at least it was until the Vogons destroyed it

1095
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:04,100
to make way for a hyperspace expressway.

1096
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:06,550
Well... Okay.

1097
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:08,750
You sure you don't have the question,

1098
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:12,350
or a way to, you know, access it or something?

1099
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:14,400
'Cause I think I've done like a lot to get here.

1100
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:19,000
Oh, shh, shush! The show's back on.

1101
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:27,400
Well, I don't wanna bother you,
so I'm gonna... Good stuff.

1102
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:31,900
Great. I'm gonna go and find something
else for my entire life to be about.

1103
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,250
- Zaphod, Zaphod, there's the gun.
- Yeah?

1104
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:37,650
- Gun?
- That Humma sent you for.

1105
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:42,200
- You gave him your head.
- Why'd I do that?

1106
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:44,000
- Okay.
- That's stupid.

1107
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:49,200
O' Deep Thought,
we were told that there is a gun.

1108
01:25:04,050 --> 01:25:06,250
- There you are.
- Hmm?

1109
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:08,050
Look familiar?

1110
01:25:08,150 --> 01:25:11,600
So, it wasn't destroyed?

1111
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:16,000
Actually, it was. This is a back-up.
Earth Mark II.

1112
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,900
So, you made the Earth?

1113
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:24,650
Not me alone, but I did my part.

1114
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:28,000
Ever heard of a place,
I think it's called Norway?

1115
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:31,500
That was one of mine.
I got an award for it.

1117
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:45,150
All right, Frank? That's... that's Frank.

1118
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:50,500
Ah-ha. They've nearly finished the oceans.

1119
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,350
Zaphod.

1120
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:02,450
Here, it's...

1121
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:08,000
It's just like Humma said.

1122
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:09,900
Now you can go get your head back.

1122
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:10,900
- Hey, Ford.
- Hey.

1123
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:13,250
It's been nice knowing you,
you zarking frood.

1124
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:14,350
No, no, no, no, no!

1125
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:16,700
- Whoa!
- Lucky this is a bust too.

1126
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:22,350
Hey, man. You know,
you must really be frustrated.

1127
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:25,400
You go through all you're going through,
you come all this way, you don't get an answer,

1128
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:28,100
which means no money and no fame,
which you deserve, man

1129
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,800
<i>The Point-of-View Gun, conveniently,</i>

1130
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:33,300
<i>does precisely what its name suggests.</i>

1131
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:35,900
Fantastic. Fantastic.

1132
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:39,700
<i>That is, if you point it at someone
and pull the trigger,</i>

1133
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,700
<i>they instantly see things
from your point of view.</i>

1134
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:44,800
Give me that thing.

1135
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,850
<i>It was designed by Deep Thought,</i>

1136
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:50,800
<i>but commissioned by a consortium
of intergalactic angry housewives,</i>

1137
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:53,350
<i>who, after countless arguments
with their husbands,</i>

1138
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:56,800
<i>was sick to the teeth of ending
those arguments with the phrase,</i>

1139
01:26:56,900 --> 01:26:58,950
<i>"You just don't get it, do you?"</i>

1140
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
And you're right, I shouldn't be so upset,

1141
01:27:04,100 --> 01:27:06,350
because life goes on, you know,

1142
01:27:06,450 --> 01:27:09,250
and I should just go on with it.

1143
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:11,600
Shoot him again.

1144
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:13,000
Whoa!

1145
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:18,650
Hitchhiking's good. Towels are good too.

1146
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:22,050
- Say what?
- That is brilliant.

1147
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:24,200
What's goin'...?

1148
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:27,100
I can see why Humma Kavula
would want one of these.

1149
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:31,050
- We better get back. Arthur's waiting.
- Yeah, who cares?

1150
01:27:31,150 --> 01:27:35,700
Well, I do. Especially since we're both somewhat
of an endangered species now, thanks to you.

1151
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,900
Why so edgy, baby doll? Relax.

1152
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:40,800
Why so edgy?
You wanna know why I'm edgy?

1153
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:44,850
Of course you're edgy.
Your planet's been blown up

1154
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:48,600
and you've been tooling around the galaxy
with the guy who signed the order.

1155
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:50,200
Huh?

1156
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,100
You actually wanted to know the question,

1157
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,700
because you always wondered to know
if there was more to life,

1158
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:00,000
and now you're crushed,
because you find out there really isn't.

1159
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:04,650
Hey, fantastic! Psychedelic!

1160
01:28:06,450 --> 01:28:10,200
You've got no home, no family,
and you're stuck with me,

1161
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:13,900
another in a long line of men
who doesn't really get you.

1162
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,650
Huh? That's not true.

1163
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:25,450
And you're worried you might have blown it
with the one guy who really does.

1164
01:28:27,150 --> 01:28:28,950
Hey, whoops.

1165
01:28:31,050 --> 01:28:33,700
Oh, baby doll!

1166
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,700
Give me that thing!

1167
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:42,900
It won't affect me. I'm already a woman.

1168
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,300
Hey, it's okay.
It's only a couple of little mice!

1169
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:03,550
Voilà! Himalayas! Good, ey?

1170
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,400
Earthman, you must realize

1171
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:16,000
that the planet you lived on was
commissioned, paid for and run by mice.

1172
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:22,050
When you're saying mice, do you mean
the little furry white creatures

1173
01:29:22,150 --> 01:29:24,050
with whiskers, ears, cheese?

1174
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:28,900
Yeah, but then they're protrusions into our dimension
of hyper intelligent pandimensional beings.

1175
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,800
I mean, I don't know this...
cheese of which you speak,

1176
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:36,650
but they were there on Earth
as mice experimenting on you.

1177
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:41,650
I see where you've become confused now.
You see, we were experimenting on them.

1178
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:45,600
Ah, no, well, yeah, no. I gather
that's what they wanted you to think,

1179
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:49,000
but you were actually elements
in their computer program.

1180
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:53,800
Actually, this explains a lot, you know.

1181
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:56,550
All my life, I've had this strange feeling

1182
01:29:56,650 --> 01:29:59,650
that there's something big and
sinister going on in the world.

1183
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:03,500
No, that's perfectly normal paranoia.
Everyone in the universe gets that.

1184
01:30:06,850 --> 01:30:10,350
Perhaps I'm old and tired,
but I think that the chances of finding out

1185
01:30:10,450 --> 01:30:13,150
what's actually going on
are so absurdly remote

1186
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:17,350
that the only thing to do is say hang
the sense of it and keep yourself busy.

1187
01:30:17,450 --> 01:30:19,900
I'd much rather be happy than right any day.

1188
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,950
- And are you?
- No.

1189
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:24,700
Well, that's where it all falls down, of course.

1190
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:37,500
Here you are then.

1191
01:30:52,600 --> 01:30:54,250
Is this...?

1192
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:10,500
It's all there.

1193
01:31:11,650 --> 01:31:13,850
You know, it all works.

1194
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:16,000
Welcome home.

1195
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,900
- Hey!
- Hey, man!

1196
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:40,100
- There you are!
- Surprise!

1197
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:43,150
What are you doing?
What happened to you?

1198
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:44,700
Is that tea?

1199
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:48,700
- First, our hosts attacked us.
- Right.

1200
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:52,700
But then they made up for it by making us...

1201
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:55,050
this amazing meal.

1202
01:31:56,100 --> 01:31:59,300
It's so... Everything's right.
Everything's delicious.

1203
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:03,600
Oh, come on, that's lovely.

1204
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:05,950
We're glad you like it, Earth creature.

1205
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:14,800
The... talking... talking mice. Cool.

1206
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:20,050
- Sit, Earthman.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you for that.

1207
01:32:21,050 --> 01:32:24,450
- Please, drink.
- Excuse me.

1208
01:32:24,550 --> 01:32:27,950
- Is there anything else?
- No, we're quite happy, thank you.

1209
01:32:28,050 --> 01:32:31,750
Good, I'll be outside, so...

1210
01:32:31,850 --> 01:32:34,050
You were right.

1211
01:32:34,150 --> 01:32:35,950
- Please, drink.
- Yes.

1212
01:32:36,600 --> 01:32:38,550
He was right.

1213
01:32:38,700 --> 01:32:40,500
Now, to business.

1214
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,400
- To business!
- To business!

1215
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:43,800
- Eat!
- Eat!

1216
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:45,650
- Shh.
- Sorry.

1217
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:46,900
As you know, we've spent a lot of time on
your planet looking for this ultimate question.

1219
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,950
Only to have it blow up in our faces, literally.

1220
01:32:54,050 --> 01:32:57,300
Which is why you're here.
We've been offered a lucrative contract

1221
01:32:57,400 --> 01:32:59,650
- to do several 5-D TV chat shows.
- Right.

1222
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:02,300
But here's the point.
We must have product.

1223
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:05,600
We need the ultimate question,
or at least one that sounds ultimate.

1224
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:07,750
- Of course.
- Yes, we've rebuilt the planet,

1225
01:33:07,850 --> 01:33:11,000
and now all we need is
the missing piece of the puzzle.

1226
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:13,250
- Which happens to be your brain.
- Right.

1227
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:14,650
More tea?

1228
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:17,450
Sorry, did you just say you need my brain?

1229
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:19,800
Yes, to complete the program.

1230
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:25,550
Okay. You can't have my brain. I'm using it.

1231
01:33:25,650 --> 01:33:30,450
- Hardly.
- Hardly? Cheeky... Cheeky mouse.

1232
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:37,500
Zaphod! Trillian!

1233
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,900
Ford.

1234
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,450
What was in that food?

1235
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,300
What was in my tea?

1236
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:48,000
Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.

1237
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:53,450
Just wait a sodding minute!

1238
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,100
You want a question
that goes with the answer 42?

1239
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:57,850
What about, what's 6x7?

1240
01:33:57,950 --> 01:34:01,500
Or... how many Vogons does
it take to change a light bulb?

1241
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:05,400
Here's one, how many roads
must a man walk down?

1242
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,750
Hey, that's not bad!

1243
01:34:08,850 --> 01:34:10,000
Fine.

1243
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:15,250
Fine, take it, 'cause my head
is filled with questions,

1244
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:17,600
and, I can ssure you,
no answer to any one of them

1245
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:21,300
has ever brought me one iota of happiness.

1246
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:22,950
Except for one.

1247
01:34:23,050 --> 01:34:26,000
The one. The only question
I've ever wanted an answer to.

1248
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:27,700
Is she the one?

1249
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:32,250
The answer bloody well isn't 42, it's yes.

1250
01:34:32,350 --> 01:34:37,850
Undoubtedly, unequivocally,
unabashedly, yes.

1251
01:34:37,950 --> 01:34:40,850
And for one week,

1252
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:45,700
one week in my sad little
blip of an existence...

1253
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,500
it made me happy.

1254
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:53,600
That's a good answer.

1255
01:34:53,700 --> 01:34:56,200
Rubbish, we don't want to be happy.
We want to be famous.

1256
01:34:56,300 --> 01:34:58,800
Yeah! What's all this "Is she the one" tripe?

1256
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:00,000
Take his brain!

1257
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:03,950
No, don't take the brain!
Don't take the brain, mice!

1258
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:14,700
It wasn't me!

1259
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,650
I'm famous.

1260
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:19,100
Shoot him, quickly, shoot him!

1261
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:20,700
Oh, bollocks!

1263
01:35:29,750 --> 01:35:31,200
I'm gonna be sick.

1264
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:35,700
Belgium.

1265
01:35:44,650 --> 01:35:46,100
Follow me.

1266
01:35:46,750 --> 01:35:49,250
Left, right, left, right.

1267
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:51,850
Attention!

1268
01:35:55,350 --> 01:35:58,300
Thanks a lot for leaving me behind.

1269
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,650
Though I can't say I blame you.

1270
01:36:00,750 --> 01:36:04,450
Mr. President, we're here for your protection.

1271
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:06,850
Oh, hey, thanks, man. I appreciate it.

1272
01:36:06,950 --> 01:36:08,300
Fire!

1273
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:11,750
No! No!

1274
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:16,850
I don't see what all the fuss is about.

1275
01:36:16,950 --> 01:36:19,800
Vogons are the worst marksmen
in the galaxy.

1276
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:25,000
- For God's sake, stop!
- Cease fire.

1277
01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:36,150
Now I've got a headache...

1278
01:36:44,350 --> 01:36:46,350
Marvin!

1279
01:36:46,450 --> 01:36:47,650
Oh, no!

1280
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,200
He's got a towel. Run away!

1281
01:36:55,450 --> 01:36:58,400
I'm gonna get us outta here.
How do you drive this thing?

1281
01:36:58,500 --> 01:37:00,500
Hey, what's going on?

1282
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:04,500
We need that gun.

1283
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:08,300
Come on, let's get this ship started.
Come on, start!

1284
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,450
Come on. Oh, fire, fire!

1285
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:12,900
Fire, fire!

1287
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,750
Oh, he's locked the gate
from the other side.

1288
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:21,950
We'll have to go the other way.

1289
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:24,000
Come on, let's go!

1290
01:37:29,300 --> 01:37:31,800
Stop!

1291
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:36,050
Oh, no!

1292
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:42,000
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop shooting at us! Stop it!

1293
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:04,750
Oh, I feel so depressed.

1294
01:38:06,150 --> 01:38:11,100
- I can't face another day.
- I feel so depressed.

1295
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:14,750
What's the point?

1296
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:25,050
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1297
01:38:30,750 --> 01:38:33,650
Sorry about your spaceship, Arthur.

1298
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,400
Marvin, you saved our lives.

1299
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:44,750
I know. Wretched, isn't it?

1300
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:53,250
You got to ask yourself, what's the point?

1301
01:38:53,400 --> 01:38:56,000
Take it away.

1302
01:39:03,700 --> 01:39:08,950
You could do all of that, but it's not gonna...
Well, I'll ask... I'll just ask.

1303
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:12,900
I've just been informed by some of the lads...

1304
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,400
- ...that since we're so near completion...
- Yeah?

1305
01:39:15,500 --> 01:39:17,850
...we're gonna go ahead and finish Earth.

1306
01:39:17,950 --> 01:39:19,500
- Oh!
- So...

1307
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:23,600
We, well, we can put it back exactly
as it was when you left, you know.

1308
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:27,050
Unless there's...

1309
01:39:27,150 --> 01:39:30,650
there's, you know, anything
you want to change.

1310
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:38,100
Something you think
your planet could do without.

1311
01:39:39,550 --> 01:39:42,850
Yeah. Me.

1312
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:45,550
Oh! Hello?

1313
01:39:45,650 --> 01:39:49,350
No, as is. Yep, leave it. Yep.

1314
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:52,900
Let's go somewhere.

1315
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,600
Definitely. Where did you have in mind?

1316
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:58,900
I know this great restaurant
at the end of the universe.

1317
01:39:59,050 --> 01:40:02,050
I am a little peckish.

1318
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:06,800
I need to go to Humma's.
He's got something of mine.

1319
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:08,100
I think.

1319
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,550
- I'm so confused.
- Don't worry, baby. We'll sort it out.

1320
01:40:12,650 --> 01:40:16,300
All right, let's trip the light fantastic, baby.
Just you and me.

1321
01:40:16,400 --> 01:40:18,250
Come on.

1322
01:40:18,350 --> 01:40:22,400
- You got your towel?
- Yeah. Why? Am I gonna need it?

1323
01:40:22,500 --> 01:40:25,950
- Only always.
- Right. Yeah.

1324
01:40:26,050 --> 01:40:29,500
'Cause I wouldn't wanna go anywhere
without my wonderful towel.

1325
01:40:35,050 --> 01:40:37,950
Okay. Hold tight.

1326
01:40:41,450 --> 01:40:46,650
<i>Stand by for commencement
of life cycle. In three, two, one...</i>

1327
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:49,000
<i>All right!</i>

1328
01:41:32,850 --> 01:41:35,100
Not that anyone cares what I say,

1329
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:38,450
but the restaurant is
at the other end of the universe.

1332
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:58,050
<i>It is, of course, well known
that careless talk costs lives.</i>

1333
01:44:58,150 --> 01:45:01,250
<i>But the full scale of the problem
is not always appreciated.</i>

1334
01:45:01,350 --> 01:45:05,000
<i>For instance, at the very moment
that Arthur Dent said...</i>

1335
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:08,650
<i>"I wouldn't want to go anywhere
without my wonderful towel",</i>

1336
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:13,300
<i>a freak wormhole opened up in the
fabric of the space-time continuum</i>

1337
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:16,900
<i>and carried his words far, far back in time,</i>

1338
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,000
<i>across almost infinite reaches
of space, to a distant galaxy,</i>

1339
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:24,800
<i>where strange and warlike beings
were poised on the brink</i>

1340
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:27,350
<i>of frightful interstellar battle.</i>

1341
01:45:27,450 --> 01:45:32,000
<i>The two opposing leaders, resplendent
in their black-jeweled battle shorts</i>

1342
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:34,100
<i>were meeting for the last time,</i>

1343
01:45:34,250 --> 01:45:37,000
<i>when a dreadful silence fell.</i>

1344
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:39,050
<i>And at that very moment,</i>

1345
01:45:39,150 --> 01:45:43,150
<i>the words "I wouldn't want to go
anywhere without my wonderful towel"</i>

1346
01:45:43,300 --> 01:45:46,250
<i>drifted across the conference table.</i>

1347
01:45:46,350 --> 01:45:49,000
<i>Unfortunately, in their native tongue,</i>

1348
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:52,100
<i>this was the most appalling
insult imaginable.</i>

1349
01:45:52,200 --> 01:45:53,800
<i>So, the two opposing battle fleets</i>

1350
01:45:53,900 --> 01:45:56,500
<i>decided to settle their few
remaining differences,</i>

1351
01:45:56,600 --> 01:46:00,000
<i>in order to launch
a joint attack on our galaxy,</i>

1352
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:04,200
<i>now positively identified
as the source of the offending remark.</i>

1353
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:07,500
<i>For thousands of years,
the mighty starships tore across</i>

1354
01:46:07,650 --> 01:46:13,050
<i>the empty wastes of space and finally
dived screaming onto the planet Earth,</i>

1355
01:46:13,150 --> 01:46:17,200
<i>where, due to a terrible
miscalculation of scale,</i>

1356
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:22,100
<i>the entire battle fleet was accidentally
swallowed by a small dog.</i>

1357
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:25,800
<i>Those who study the complex
interplay of cause and effect</i>

1358
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:27,650
<i>in the history of the universe,</i>

1359
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:32,300
<i>say that this sort of thing
is going on all the time.</i>

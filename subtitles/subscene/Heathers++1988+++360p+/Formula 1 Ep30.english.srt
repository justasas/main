1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:09,480
Formula 1 - Engines on The Track

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,380
My heart's continuous signal of love

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,380
It's that way because
I want to embrace you

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,780
And as I waited I
decided to dance slowly

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:28,780
Both of us could
read each other's lips

6
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:35,080
We secretly bathed
in the moonlight

7
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,880
After the goodbye

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:44,330
You left without leaving a clue

9
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,580
Don't betray me Darlin'
She passed through the city

10
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:51,230
Nobody knows Love Affair

11
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,630
Together until the morning

12
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:56,130
Making Love and no more

13
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,730
I felt you when I
touched your hand

14
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,280
Your a woman

15
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,830
Love Affair

16
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,380
Together until the morning

17
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,080
Making Love and no more

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,680
Those words of love
that you want to hear

19
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:18,380
Your a woman

20
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,277
Gunma? Have you decided
on the next race?

21
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,597
- I won't go!
- Eh?!

22
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,154
I won't.

23
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,500
Gunma vs. Hiziri!
Final Countdown

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,829
But why?
You got your license back.

25
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,037
Kishida told me.

26
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,114
Because Junko begged Tamotsu to help me!

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,589
And so he asked
Hiziri to do something.

28
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,148
I was in the
dark about everything...

29
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,754
...and I couldn't accept it,
so I went on a rampage.

30
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,956
My pride prevents
me acting properly!

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,038
Junko!

32
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,271
I don't agree with you.

33
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,549
It's foolish to give up
over something like that,

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,837
Do you realize that you have
overcome many obstacles to get here.

35
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,229
...and you want to
screw it up over your pride.

36
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,269
The Gunma I know
would not surrender ...

37
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,191
because, one day you decided on...

38
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,589
becoming the
world champion of Formula 1!

39
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,836
Damn you.

40
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,157
Snap out of your daze
and repeat your phrase.

41
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,909
"I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!"

42
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,551
I don't want it.

43
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,229
You were brilliant!
I thought you would become an expert!

44
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,357
You have to drive!

45
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,275
You can't give up now!

46
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,269
Please! You have to drive!

47
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,229
- The engine has a nice sound!
- The engine has a nice sound!

48
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,279
- The piston is my passion!
- The piston is my passion!

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,956
Good job, Tamotsu!

50
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,675
Now Tamotsu, where do they
drive the fastest machines in the world?

51
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,755
- In Formula 1!
- Good job my baby!

52
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,470
And that's where
you father drives.

53
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,396
- Sempai...
- It's not cash,

54
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,357
but it's worth a hundred million!

55
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,916
It's the only memory I have
of my mother. Will you give me the car?

56
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,109
Do you really think
you can beat Hiziri?

57
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,150
Fantastic!
A record time.

58
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,756
Are you sure this will work?

59
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,239
The radio will put
out the fuel pump ...

60
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,515
...and Hiziri will be left dry.

61
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,556
I just want to tell you
that it's not fair to him.

62
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,273
Look, we're doing it
for his own good!

63
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,356
I'll assume all responsibility!

64
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,868
There is no alternative ... unfortunately!

65
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,835
Hey, Hiziri! I'm sorry for not
being able to return the favor on the track.

66
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,357
Are you listening?

67
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,074
Let's see who's the best!
This is it, Hiziri!

68
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,710
This is weird,
why isn't he moving?

69
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,196
Hiziri is slowing down!

70
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,039
Gunma!

71
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,352
That noise...

72
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,200
Is there something wrong, Tamotsu?
Are you feeling okay?

73
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,197
No, I'm alright.

74
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,589
You see, it's just that
Gunma's car has an engine...

75
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,750
...that sounds very familiar to me.

76
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,116
Oddly enough, by the roar of the engine,

77
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,634
a mechanic can recognize his setup!

78
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,310
And that engine has left me stunned.

79
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,994
When I heard the engine it
reminded me of something familiar!

80
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,036
Hey, you.

81
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,916
What are you doing here?

82
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,157
Father!

83
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,272
Why didn't you stay at home
and work in the fields, Tamotsu?

84
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,588
Did your mother let you leave,
or did you run away?

85
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,956
- I don't have to answer to you!
- What did you say ?!

86
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,913
I want to get to Formula 1!
And I will succeed!

87
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,350
Formula 1?! Shouldn't you be
back at home in the fields.

88
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,558
The world of Formula 1 is
uncertain and full of disappointment!

89
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,518
On the other hand, if you work
in the fields, this won't happen.

90
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,031
You only speak like that
because you weren't able to succeed!

91
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,278
D-Damn you!

92
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,835
The engine ...

93
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,036
The piston ...

94
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,273
Father! Stop for a moment!
I have one last thing to say to you!

95
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,153
Mother believed that you
wanted to become a mechanic.

96
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,028
And she believes that you
left her for that career!

97
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,678
Instead your greatest
aspiration was to become ...

98
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,638
... a Formula 1 driver!
Deny it if you dare!

99
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,473
For this reason you
have forsaken me and mom!

100
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,677
Well, what's your answer?

101
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,740
I'm just saying that your machine
will never be able to overcome mine.

102
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,350
That's the only
answer I can give you.

103
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,873
Gunma will start in the second
row and Hiziri in fourth.

104
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,791
If my car were to win,

105
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,836
it would deal my
father a tremendous blow!

106
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,200
- Gunma!
- Don't you know it's useless...

107
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,431
...to read this!
Even if it starts to snow...

108
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,670
...I will gain the pole-position.

109
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,196
With a father like Eijiro ...

110
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,150
... you must have suffered very much!

111
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,277
However blood does not lie!

112
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,113
His car has the same roar
as a car you would setup.

113
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,914
I'm sorry,
but I'll win the race tomorrow!

114
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,513
Sorry to contradict you, Gunma!
But you won't win tomorrow.

115
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,637
- What?!
- Hiziri is in top shape.

116
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,597
And for reasons
that I will explain you,

117
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,750
he is absolutely
determined to win!

118
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,796
What's with all this seriousness?

119
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,235
When he asked me
to go to work for him,

120
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,471
he wanted to improve
his car to get to Formula 1.

121
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,239
And now the car is 100%!
Hiziri also...

122
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,959
...after months of
hard training, in top form!

123
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,915
This will be a
hard undertaking for you...

124
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,355
..and virtually
impossible since I'm with him.

125
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,750
I hope that your prepared...

126
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,354
...because this time Hiziri
is stronger than you.

127
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,512
I don't care!
If Hiziri is in perfect shape,

128
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,750
I will prove to
him that I'm better.

129
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,796
I have to win the
race at any cost!

130
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,156
I could not bear to be
defeated by you and Hiziri!

131
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,674
Just to let you know,
I don't plan on losing.

132
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,950
How long
will it be snowing?

133
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,476
What's wrong, can't you see?

134
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,197
I can't see.

135
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,156
Stop joking, you
were training earlier today.

136
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,959
That's because,
I know the circuit by heart.

137
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,117
I couldn't see at all.

138
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,589
On the track, I could
barely make out the shadows!

139
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,190
In fact, I didn't even
know it was snowing.

140
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,958
Don't worry, Ruiko,
tomorrow it will all be over.

141
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,755
Please, don't say
anything to Tamotsu.

142
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,835
- Do you want to drive...!
- Yeah!

143
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,432
Okay...

144
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,153
It's alright, there's
no need to be afraid.

145
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,198
Would you stop
if I asked you to?

146
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,949
Would you go all the way?

147
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,356
I have to do it, Ruiko!

148
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,277
Try to understand me.

149
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,915
I'm here about my drivers
license, I want to thank you.

150
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,315
This is truly an event to celebrate!

151
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,277
It's rare for you to thank someone.

152
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,029
However, I'm not the
one you should thank,

153
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,032
I did it only as a favor
to your friend Tamotsu!

154
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,350
He's a true friend
and loves you very much.

155
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,273
Another thing ...
I just wanted to let you know ...

156
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,351
...that, thanks to
your generosity my friend,

157
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,476
you were able to
get my license back.

158
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,676
But remember that
I will beat you.

159
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,398
Actually, you better
settle for second place.

160
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,198
What?

161
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,874
You will be the
one finishing second!

162
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,349
I'm stronger than
you and I can prove it.

163
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,955
I ask only one thing!
Listen!

164
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,757
If you have the chance,
try to keep up with me.

165
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,952
Because I'm going to teach
you something interesting.

166
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,233
- Something interesting?
- Exactly!

167
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,950
I'll teach you how a great
champion behaves on the track!

168
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,756
What's wrong with him?
He had a strange light in his eyes!

169
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,354
His expression was totally different!

170
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,797
Come on.

171
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,910
Damn! Where does
he think he's going.

172
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,756
Hiziri, enjoy it while you
can but I'll overtake you!

173
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,198
I see enough to at least distinguish the track!

174
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,229
I have to win at all costs!
Formula 1 is waiting for me!

175
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,430
Hey, Tamotsu...

176
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,152
I've changed my mind.
Let him drive.

177
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,478
- What changed your mind Ruiko...
- He wants to drive!

178
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,551
After all, everyone is free
to choose their own destiny!

179
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,591
I've done everything I could...

180
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,911
...to set-up the car.
But I couldn't stop him...

181
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,036
...from his goals.

182
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,754
Hiziri, it's all up to you.

183
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,558
Look at that, another lap and
he's got  the same time!

184
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,677
- Hooray!
- Yes, I know he can do it.

185
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,472
Damn it!

186
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,631
Ah!

187
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,629
He's catching up to Hiziri!

188
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,230
- Damn it!
- Come on! Keep it up, Gunma!

189
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,029
Hiziri, I'm sorry but I'm tired
of keeping up with you!

190
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,192
- He's overtaking!
- Sempai!

191
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,317
Great, don't stop now!
You can do it and...

192
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,356
...pass him with ease.

193
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,277
Gunma!

194
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,591
Enough, eat my dust!

195
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,837
Damn it!

196
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,552
I see that your
still keeping up with me.

197
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,517
Your a good driver.

198
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,189
- Phenomenal!
- He's the strongest!

199
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,670
This is bad.
If he continues to force the machine,

200
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,320
...the car will break down
before the race ends.

201
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,551
I don't think so! In any
case, Hiziri is ahead of him.

202
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,756
Gunma is chasing him desperately!

203
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,757
In my humble opinion,

204
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,956
he has a chance of winning.

205
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,749
My vision is once
again clearing up, that's good.

206
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,072
I have once again become
more aware of my surroundings.

207
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,957
But where's Gunma?

208
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,474
Gunma, I will teach you...

209
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,516
...how a real driver races!

210
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,756
Hiziri, hold on! Don't die

211
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,832
Tamotsu! The world is waiting for you!
Conquer the world in my place,

212
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,434
- with Gunma Akagi!
- Hiziri!

213
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,397
In the next episode:

214
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,038
Farewell Gunma!
Rise Fastest Man in the World!!

215
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,192
"I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!"

216
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:29,570
I saw you crying after
you were abandoned

217
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:36,470
Let's climb that hill
and look back down

218
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:40,570
In the big world it's undeniable

219
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:51,320
Yesterday's pain is
not visible anymore

220
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,820
OK Let's start it

221
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,820
In order to grieve

222
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,020
Ah It's as if we weren't born

223
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:16,270
You are my energy, You are my energy

224
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,670
Courage come out

225
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:27,970
By just being with you

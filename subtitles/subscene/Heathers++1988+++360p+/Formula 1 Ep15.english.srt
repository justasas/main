1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,370
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,370
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,020
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,020
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,370
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,270
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,270
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,570
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,870
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,370
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:50,870
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,120
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,620
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:07,120
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,912
- It 's a pleasure to see you again.
- Look, it's useless ...

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,036
...to try and get me to stay...

17
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,912
...you won the race.
I won't let you gloat!

18
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,157
Gunma, control yourself!

19
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,470
Listen up:
if that accident didn't happen,

20
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,516
I would have won the race.

21
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,837
However I won't lose again.
Next time I'll win.

22
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,959
It's really a shame,
I probably won't see you for a while.

23
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,117
What?

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,360
Just this evening I decided
on moving up in the world.

25
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,756
From now on,
I'll be racing in Formula 3.

26
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,040
Although this is still a bit away...

27
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,196
...I intend to go there eventually.

28
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,276
This time, next year
I'll be celebrating once again!

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,500
Tokyo Is Blown Away!
Gunma's Secret Part-time Operations

30
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,596
I can't use this.

31
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,188
The radiator and suspension
are beyond repair!

32
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,154
And the carburetor must also be replaced!

33
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,668
So it will cost
about two million, right?

34
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,550
F-Five million?!

35
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,676
That's an astronomical figure!

36
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,480
Yes, I know it
needs to be repaired,

37
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,235
but five millions
is a bit too much...

38
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,199
Give it to me!
Who is calling?

39
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,029
Yes, I know your a garage!

40
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,388
Who am I?! Gunma Akagi,
the greatest driver of all time!

41
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,357
I need my car repaired.

42
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,075
Say... why don't
you get me

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,072
a discount or better
yet, do it for free?

44
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,277
You could put my name up in...

45
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,636
big letters on your
garage when I win Formula 1!

46
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,519
As it happens I was
looking for a sponsor!

47
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,556
So, what do you say?

48
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,036
How rude, he hung up!

49
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,277
I'm going to make breakfast!

50
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,597
Gunma, why do you
always make matters worse?

51
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,676
Is this the thanks ...

52
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,955
...I get for trying to help you!

53
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,909
Get to work!
Next week we have a...

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,956
...race and we've
got no time to lose!

55
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,918
If you want to race next week,
you have to pay for the repairs!

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,956
We need five million!

57
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,675
I know what's wrong with you!

58
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,877
- Tamotsu!
- Weren't you listening?

59
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,918
I'm sure there's
something going on.

60
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,276
I know!
Your in love with Hiziri's girl.

61
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,836
I'm right, aren't I?

62
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,036
Stop acting like a fool!
How can you think of such a thing?

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,959
I can't forgive you for this.

64
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,758
How could you do something
like that without telling me?

65
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,197
Your an asshole!
You won't get away with this!

66
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,035
Stop it! I told you to stop!
Junko is watching us!

67
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,156
We're only messing around.

68
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,276
How about you join us?

69
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,915
This is terrible!
It's almost impossible to drive around!

70
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,956
Even taxis are stuck!

71
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,996
Yesterday, I had to
go to the city center,

72
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,230
and it took fifty minutes!
It was crazy!

73
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,278
This can't go on!
A solution must be found!

74
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,113
You gotta take the train!

75
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,351
Yeah, though I'm always in a hurry!

76
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,915
If your taking a taxi,

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,275
you always
gotta tip the driver!

78
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,915
Well, it seems that I've
found a solution to our problems.

79
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,277
See you later!

80
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:29,074
Thank you for the company!
I'm leaving for a while.

81
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,273
I wish I knew what he was thinking.

82
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,920
He drove all afternoon in a tractor.

83
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,116
He's got no time to lose!

84
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,036
Come here, Tamotsu ...

85
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,912
- If you want I'll pay for the repair.
- Really?!

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,150
I realize this
is a very high figure,

87
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,756
but I can pay it for you.

88
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,916
I'm sorry,
but I cannot accept it.

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,958
This time, we must solve
this problem ourselves.

90
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,156
On the other hand
we knew from the start ...

91
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,879
...that we needed more
money to move forward.

92
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,918
Anyway thanks for the offer,
Morioka! That was nice of you!

93
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,156
Okay, Tamotsu, forget about it!

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,956
Now what do we do?

95
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,600
We need a solution
as soon as possible!

96
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,356
Five million ...

97
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,476
That's it!

98
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,118
- Hey, look who's back!
- Good Morning!

99
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,756
Can I ask you for a favor.

100
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:50,678
Would it be possible to
postpone the payment of rent?

101
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,836
I am currently short of money.

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,036
Of course! It's alright!

103
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,836
I'll pay you guys
if you win this time!

104
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,397
I wish you luck!

105
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,037
Don't worry.

106
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,436
I'm very sorry, Gunma!

107
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,310
Things aren't really
working out for us.

108
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,756
We need to find a solution.

109
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,674
Remember, my door
is always open for you.

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,956
Think about it.

111
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,757
Taxi! Taxi!

112
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,351
Come on!
Give me a break!

113
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,876
- I've only got fifteen miniutes!
- Cheer up will you!

114
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,269
What do you suggest?

115
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,675
Well, you could at least do something!

116
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,354
Do you understand?
This is our honeymoon!

117
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,756
Do something!

118
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,437
I know, but what
can I do...darling.

119
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,236
What?!
Are you stupid?!

120
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,039
Hello, good people,
you need something?

121
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,669
- Like a ride?
- Eh?! Sure!

122
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,030
Can you get us to the
airport in fifteen miniutes?

123
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,031
Sure! We will arrive in a heartbeat!

124
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,590
But I charge ten
times more than a taxi!

125
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,553
That's great!
As long as we arrive on time...

126
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,110
...I'm willing to pay
twenty times the rate, okay?

127
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,709
- But, darling...
- Stop it

128
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,156
- Get your bags and hop on!
- Yes! Yes!

129
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,918
At full speed,
I'm Faster than the wind!

130
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,591
You have no reason
to worry, Tamotsu.

131
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,756
I'll have the money soon.

132
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,157
And then Hiziri,
we'll meet again in Formula 3.

133
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,513
Metropolitan Motorway

134
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,556
TOLL ROAD

135
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,677
What was that?!

136
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,749
TRAFFIC JAM IN THE DIRECTION
OF HANEDA AIRPORT : 5KM LONG

137
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,039
Eh?!

138
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,030
Come!
please stop!

139
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,749
I beg of you!
I can't take it anymore!

140
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,276
Excuse me, sir ...

141
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,316
What are you doing?!

142
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,434
I had to pay!

143
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,277
This is great!
And this is only the first step!

144
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,234
This is Hiziri's answering machine.

145
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,151
I'm not in at the moment,

146
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,515
so leave your name and phone number.

147
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,556
Speak after the beep.

148
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,276
Hey, we gotta move!
Don't you remember the street?

149
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,195
You said you would go
five times faster than a taxi!

150
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,914
- It's coming!
- We're almost there, dear.

151
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,956
Why aren't you moving?

152
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,876
Stay calm, dear!

153
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,916
Damn!
Is there no other way!

154
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,835
There has to be another way there!

155
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,675
There's a ditch that
passes under the railway.

156
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,035
But it's full of water and rocks!

157
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,076
Why didn't you tell me?

158
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,190
We made it just in time!
Thanks to you!

159
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,198
Wonderful!
She's my spitting image!

160
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,029
This is true love!
She's throwing a tantrum!

161
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,192
Maybe it's just her
way of showing that she's alive.

162
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,677
Ah! The money!

163
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,358
Here! For your
trouble. Thanks again

164
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,596
Well...

165
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,030
It was a pleasure
to accompany her here.

166
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,076
Keep the money,
I don't want it.

167
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,270
This baby is thanks enough!
Be with your child.

168
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,437
- That's it! Shake that bolt well.
- Sure.

169
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,357
In one week I
gained one million.

170
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,076
Where do I go
to find more money?

171
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,515
Although Morioka could give us an...

172
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,556
...an advance.
Probably not.

173
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,597
Damn!

174
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,757
- Where are you going, Gunma?
- I'm gonna get some fresh air!

175
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,275
But you haven't
even finished your work!

176
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,836
- He's gone!
- He's been...

177
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,956
...behaving
strange all week.

178
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,760
I hope
it's nothing serious.

179
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,757
I'm sorry, Morioka.

180
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,274
It's not your fault!
Tamotsu!

181
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:23,637
Hi!
Sorry for not calling back,

182
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,152
but I was in my home country.

183
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,196
I called as soon
as I got the message.

184
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,151
So, what's up?

185
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,834
Sorry, but I'm
working right now...

186
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,036
...and I'm really
busy right now!

187
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,198
Why don't you come
over after you finish work?

188
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,033
But I have to
work overtime today!

189
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,839
It's alright, just come
when your finished!

190
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,236
- Bye!
- Eh?!

191
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,397
Did he
call about the job?

192
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,916
Yeah! I think so!

193
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,152
Good.

194
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,356
I take it that everything is
going according to plan?

195
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,916
Those papers on the desk ...

196
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,951
Are they the new contracts
for our mechanic team?

197
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,638
- Maybe?
- I think so.

198
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,029
You always get
what you want.

199
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,190
Did you prepare new contracts...

200
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,510
because you know you will win.

201
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,270
For months you wanted
Tamotsu to become your mechanic!

202
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,516
He'll probably accept soon.

203
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,830
He can't be easily persuaded.

204
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,468
Though I'm sure you can convince him.

205
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,960
So, once again,
victory is yours!

206
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,917
Your success will be ensured
with Tamotsu! as your mechanic!

207
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,196
Well, he called you...

208
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,272
so that means that he's
thinking about accepting!

209
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,272
Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!

210
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,351
Come on, it's urgent!

211
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,153
Oh, come on!

212
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,156
Damn! I'll never be able
to get to my appointment!

213
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,713
What the hell is wrong with you?

214
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,711
- Hey, you need a ride?
- What?

215
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,677
Are you serious?

216
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,910
Can you get there in twenty minutes!

217
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,076
Boy, you're really a
great guy, you know that?

218
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,469
I've got two hundred thousand here?!

219
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,233
- What? Two hundred thousand
- Look over here.

220
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,715
Money! Lots of money!
I've just won the lottery!

221
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,189
I this this would be my lucky day.

222
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,589
And now I'm gonna
meet some ladies!

223
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,271
- Fantastic!
- Yes! It really is!

224
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,875
- Nice to meet you!
- The pleasure is all mine, son!

225
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,515
Come on!
Go faster!

226
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,750
Keep it going fast!

227
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,877
This thing can move
real fast, you know?

228
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,672
I've gotta go!

229
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,232
Here, this is for you!
I forgot your hamburger!

230
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,233
Come on man, pay
attention or we'll crash!

231
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,231
- Come on!
- What's the matter with you?

232
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,197
I've got this!

233
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,357
This is great!
We'll get there in no time.

234
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,517
Ahh!

235
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,595
Are you sure this is a tractor?

236
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,875
It seems more like a race car!

237
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,349
You guessed right!
Hold on tight!

238
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,118
I wish I knew where
that Gunma goes?

239
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,509
He comes home
late every night!

240
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,835
He may have found a night job.

241
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,110
- It's possible?
- That's probably it!

242
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,630
Otherwise he'll never make
it in time for the race!

243
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,755
- I'm home!
- Your back.

244
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,798
- Where have you been?
- I have been in the garage ...

245
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,917
... to fix an engine.
Tell me Junko, any news...

246
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,275
-...about the money?
- No!

247
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,755
I do know something,
Gunma asked me ...

248
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,035
...about Ryuji and
when he started racing.

249
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,675
He thought he
was full of money.

250
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,515
But where is he?

251
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,839
Here we are.
In twenty miniutes flat.

252
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,595
Where's the money?

253
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,550
- It's all gone.
- What?!

254
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,074
This is just great!
So how are you gonna pay me?

255
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,070
This is just terrible!

256
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,357
I'm sorry! Please forgive me!
I've got nothing!

257
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,675
Lend me two hundred thousand?

258
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,438
Huh..!

259
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,358
Gunma doesn't know yet,
but to pay off our debts ...

260
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,317
...I had to accept another job!

261
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,675
I had hoped to
resolve this problem!

262
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,757
No, I'll get it.

263
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,353
Yo, Tamotsu!
I need a favor...

264
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,317
...I need you to pick me up.

265
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,277
The tractor is damaged.

266
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,040
What?!
How did that happen?

267
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,032
- Is it serious?
- No, everything's fine.

268
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,111
Just wait for me.

269
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,580
And I have good
news about the money!

270
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,952
Everything should be alright,
I found another job.

271
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,117
We'll have enough money.

272
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,270
By doing this, you can
finally take part in that race!

273
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,117
Well, Gunma?

274
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,756
You gotta be joking, Tamotsu!

275
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,558
They gave you enough money!

276
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,352
What job is this?

277
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,877
I'm a mechanic for another driver.

278
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,753
It's Hiziri...!
Isn't it!

279
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,158
Gunma...

280
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,156
Gunma, with Hiziri's money,
we will win!

281
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,076
It's the only way.

282
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,839
Why did you do this?

283
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,630
The motors are switched on
a minute from the start!

284
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,836
Care must be taken:
as to not overheat,

285
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,837
or make noise,
you get a penalty for doing so!

286
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,077
In the next episode:

287
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,957
"Gunma Returns Home!
He Learns an Unbelievable Secret".

288
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,838
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

289
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:13,800
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

290
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,750
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

291
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:26,050
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

292
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:35,850
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

293
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:44,750
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

294
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:50,450
These feelings
just flare up

295
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:55,450
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

296
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:02,450
The fantasy penetrates through you

297
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:07,650
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

298
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:15,500
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,600
Formula 1 - Engines on The Track

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,500
My heart's continuous signal of love

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,500
It's that way because
I want to embrace you

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,900
And as I waited I
decided to dance slowly

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,900
Both of us could
read each other's lips

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:35,200
We secretly bathed
in the moonlight

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,000
After the goodbye

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,450
You left without leaving a clue

9
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,700
Don't betray me Darlin'
She passed through the city

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,350
Nobody knows Love Affair

11
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,750
Together until the morning

12
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,250
Making Love and no more

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,850
I felt you when I
touched your hand

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,400
Your a woman

15
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,950
Love Affair

16
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,500
Together until the morning

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,200
Making Love and no more

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,800
Those words of love
that you want to hear

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,500
Your a woman

20
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,872
Now I will teach you how
to overcome someone, Gunma!

21
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,357
Damn!

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Farewell Gunma!
Rise Fastest Man in the World!!

23
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,757
Hiziri, now the fight is just
between you and me.

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,353
I've finally found you!
It's useless to run away,

25
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,590
because I'll find you again!
Remember that!

26
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,750
Come on engine, don't
give out on me.

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,234
If you have the chance,
try to keep up with me.

28
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,031
Because I'm going to teach
you something interesting.

29
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,757
I wonder what
he meant by that.

30
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,879
He must have
meant something important.

31
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,596
But he's probably bluffing!
I'll show him something important instead!

32
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,277
Incredible!
I can hear the engine singing.

33
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,156
It's music beats in unison
with the beating of my heart!

34
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,550
Now me and the
machine are one.

35
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,758
Come on, sing!
Sing louder!

36
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,676
He's pulling me.

37
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,109
- What?
- Fantastic!

38
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,078
That car has an engine much
more powerful than a Formula 3!

39
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,037
H-Hiziri...!

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,231
How did he do that?
I'm pushing my car to the limit!

41
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,356
Is it possible
for me to go faster?

42
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,917
It will be an
impossible task for his car.

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,956
His potential is
higher than yours!

44
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,957
I warn you that
Hiziri is in great shape!

45
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,076
And he is absolutely
determined to win!

46
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,478
And he must do it!
Otherwise next year,

47
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,437
he won't be able
to race in Formula 1!

48
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,300
He won't be able to race in Formula 1!
He won't be able to race in Formula 1!

49
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,700
So...
Hiziri isn't bluffing after all,

50
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,996
He asked me to follow him so he could...

51
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,036
... laugh at my inferiority!

52
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,675
Finally the world is in my hands!

53
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,755
I don't think
Hiziri saw the signal.

54
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,435
I-I've never seen anything like it!

55
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,397
After many laps of high speed his

56
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,357
engine shows no signs of slowing down!

57
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,829
This is all because of Tamotsu's abilities.

58
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,876
Isn't that right, Eijiro?

59
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,477
Here comes sempai.

60
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,668
My car can't
go faster than that!

61
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,192
Gunma is really
giving it his all.

62
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,436
But he can't overcome Hiziri!

63
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,757
- Unless a miracle happens ...
- A miracle ?!

64
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,709
Hiziri is going strong,

65
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,678
However, his engine could stop working.

66
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,717
This is it! I've had enough
of being behind Hiziri ...

67
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,234
...and eating his dust!
At the cost of ...

68
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,278
...breaking the engine,
I will surpass him!

69
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,268
Hiziri is above his own limits!

70
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,876
And he's definitely not afraid.

71
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,076
And that means only one thing:

72
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,915
Hiziri is by far the
greatest driver of all time!

73
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,028
It's a miracle!
I've never felt so warm inside!

74
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,277
And this means that
the fatal moment is near!

75
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,434
The degradation of the
suspension, tires and brakes,

76
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,757
the roar of the engine, the valves,
the movement of the pistons ...

77
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,836
I can feel it in my hands.

78
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,551
Every square inch of asphalt
and every little wildfire,

79
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,950
has the lust of a diamond!

80
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,036
The grass, the trees, the flowers ...

81
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,278
Right now their colors seem
more beautiful than ever.

82
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,519
I've never noticed,
how beautiful nature is.

83
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,674
Unfortunately, I've
realized it too late.

84
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,596
This world is full of light!

85
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,155
I've never seen
so much in my life!

86
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,436
Are you following me , Gunma?

87
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,633
It's wonderful! I feel like
I'm in control of his life!

88
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,469
I wonder why he
didn't see the signal.

89
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,559
Tamotsu...

90
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,797
He's hurt!

91
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,036
Thanks for everything, Tamostu!

92
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,630
This machine was the
best gift I've ever received!

93
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,076
Glory awaits!

94
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,351
But instead of me,

95
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,151
share it with your friend Gunma.

96
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,156
I'm so sorry!

97
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,515
But ... I can't!

98
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,148
I promised not
to stop your race.

99
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,236
You decide your own fate.

100
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,476
Now it's just you and me, Hiziri!

101
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,558
Ever since this race began
I've done nothing but hang back.

102
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,073
But I am the
fastest on the track!

103
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,037
And I'll prove it.

104
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,230
I have to hurry,
we're on the final lap!

105
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,636
The track is perfect and
I'm not even forcing the engine!

106
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,270
But if I put myself in his wake,
I should be able to overcome him!

107
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,039
Yes!
This is it!

108
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,753
Yes! Just when
he least expects it!

109
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,036
I ask only one thing, Gunma!

110
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,679
I'll teach you how a great
champion behaves on the track!

111
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,357
H-Hiziri.

112
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,678
Is that so, Hiziri!

113
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,189
Now I know what you
were going to teach me!

114
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,836
Hey! Slow down!

115
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,480
If you continue like this,
the engine is likely to melt.

116
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,471
Let's try that again.

117
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,949
Speed up and drag
me like you did before.

118
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,677
And when you do,
I won't hesitate to overtake you!

119
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,711
Gunma! Slow down!

120
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,075
You can't continue at that speed!

121
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,471
Come on, Hiziri! Why the wait?

122
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,556
Do that trick you did again!

123
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,436
This time I'll show you that
I have learned this lesson well!

124
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,810
Gunma Akagi?
So he's still with me, that's good.

125
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,517
Great! He's accelerating!

126
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,950
If I can take full advantage
of his trail, I'll pass him easily!

127
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,756
I only hope that the
motor keeps working.

128
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,557
Ah!

129
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,077
Huh...

130
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,500
Hiziri?

131
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,756
What's going on?

132
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,436
Why isn't Hiziri following me?

133
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,111
He can't have gave up so easily!

134
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,192
Hiziri better be alright!
Hiziri better be alright!

135
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,278
- Hiziri! Answer me!
- Hiziri!

136
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,394
- Send an ambulance! Now!
- How did this happen?

137
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,675
I don't know!
Maybe it was the brakes!

138
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,356
Hiziri!

139
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,355
Hiziri, what's wrong with you?

140
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,630
Answer me, please!
Hiziri answer me!

141
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,675
In ... In all the world ...

142
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,954
...there is no one ...

143
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,950
...better than you!

144
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,677
Good luck!

145
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,957
Hiziri!

146
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,110
Wait!
I will take off his helmet.

147
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,036
And his mask!

148
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,836
Your free now,
you can breath.

149
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,428
Look at you...
We have to do something...

150
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,036
or your skills will suffer.

151
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,957
Where are you taking him?

152
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,596
I'll teach you how a great
champion behaves on the track!

153
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,599
All you gotta do is
keep up with me, Gunma.

154
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,553
Thank you Hiziri, for this lesson.

155
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,679
You are a great driver and I
will try to follow your example.

156
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,351
Hiziri asked me to
become his mechanic!

157
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,918
I can't explain the reason why,

158
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,072
but I can't betray the
promise that I made to Hiziri.

159
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,148
- Please forgive me!
- Forgive you!

160
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,236
Only now I
understand why you did it!

161
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,750
Gunma!

162
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,750
Hiziri!

163
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,671
Tamostu!
The champagne!

164
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,313
You are the winner!
Forgive me for being presumptuous.

165
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,672
Goodbye, Hiziri
... my friend!

166
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,517
What a bunch of idiots!
Risking their lives on the track

167
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,670
...and now look at what's happened.

168
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,956
Come on, let's go!

169
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,836
Y-Yuki.

170
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,675
Gunma AKAGI (JAPAN)

175
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:29,720
I saw you crying after
you were abandoned

176
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,620
Let's climb that hill
and look back down

177
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,720
In the big world it's undeniable

178
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:51,470
Yesterday's pain is
not visible anymore

179
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,970
OK Let's start it

180
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,970
In order to grieve

181
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:03,170
Ah It's as if we weren't born

182
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:16,420
You are my energy, You are my energy

183
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,820
Courage come out

184
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:28,120
By just being with you

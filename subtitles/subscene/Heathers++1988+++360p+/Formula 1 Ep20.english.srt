1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,670
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,670
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,320
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,320
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,670
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:28,570
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,570
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,870
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,170
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,670
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:51,170
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,420
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,920
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,420
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,278
Hiziri, who do you
think will come first?

16
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,676
We'll know when the race ends.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,197
But it will certainly be the
car with the best setup...

18
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,669
...and the driver with the best mechanic.

19
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,000
Short Lived First Victory!
Tamotsu's Betrayal

20
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,077
Move it!

21
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,357
Damn it!

22
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,678
In addition to being an idiot,
you can't drive!

23
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,433
It takes technique, boy! Technique!
You can't hope to win against me!

24
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,357
Go!

25
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,915
What's he doing?
He's getting close...

26
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,150
...to force me to speed up
while going round the corner!

27
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,678
Is he crazy! He's trying to
knock me off the track!

28
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,435
This is it!
Time to slow down.

29
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,830
Now he will be
forced to slow down!

30
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,596
I must hold on!

31
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,957
This is it.

32
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,748
Technique! It takes technique!
You can't hope to win against me, boy!

33
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,838
Hey! But where am I?
What happened?

34
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,235
- Way to go, Gunma!
- Hooray!

35
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,749
Wow! For a beginner
he's really strong!

36
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,557
Gunma...

37
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,314
Well, I can also gain
the crowds admiration.

38
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,356
I will become a star like Hiziri!

39
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,757
Hey, listen up!

40
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,479
Make sure that the rookie
does not cross the finish line!

41
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,155
Sempai's amazing!

42
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,310
He sure is!
What's the time?

43
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,356
01:01:58!

44
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,556
Are you sure?
A new record!

45
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,835
Incredible!
These test's are improving his times.

46
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,957
He couldn't have drove
like this months ago!

47
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,992
Well, he did say that
he would win this race...

48
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,914
- ...so he will!
- You're right! He'll win!

49
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,429
Did you see that Hiziri?

50
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,875
That novice could
win at this rate!

51
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,719
The race is getting interesting!
If he keeps this up he'll...

52
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,189
- win by a large margin
- He won't win ...

53
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,874
- ...that easily!
- What do you mean?

54
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,916
You see,
even a few years ago ...

55
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,956
I too was
a complete novice.

56
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,271
But, when you start to win,
everyone pays attention!

57
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,557
That's the truth!

58
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,520
Fantastic!
He's improving with every lap!

59
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,636
He's way
ahead of the others!

60
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,359
- There are only three laps left!
- Hold on Gunma.

61
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,116
I hope he won't need my...

62
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,156
assistance,
at least for a while!

63
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,834
Eh?!
What did you just say?

64
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,350
I though you said that you
hope that Gunma didn't need you.

65
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,910
Eh?! What?!
Why would I say such a thing?

66
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,436
Sempai!

67
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,350
That's against the rules!

68
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,970
I knew it,
everyone loves me!

69
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,231
They won't give way even
though he's a lap in front of them!

70
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,629
They aren't allowed to do that!

71
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,597
They're doing that because...

72
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,194
...they want him to proceed slowly!

73
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,157
Since they're behind a few laps...

74
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,276
...they can afford to do so!

75
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,472
Come on, Gunma! Go on the
attack!  Victory is yours!

76
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,028
Did you know this would happen?

77
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,670
- Yes!
- Has it ever happened to you?

78
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,633
- No, never!
- And you others?

79
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,349
I consider it a waste of time
and a futile gesture.

80
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,634
Come on,
get out of my way!

81
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,950
Move! Do you hear me?

82
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,997
Victory will be mine!

83
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,837
We'll see!

84
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,433
Are you getting out
of the way or not!

85
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,640
Sempai, you need to do better.

86
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,473
You made an idiot of
yourself before the race...

87
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,949
...this is just the after effects!

88
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,674
This is all happening on purpose!

89
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,709
As long as you drive on the track,
you will be surrounded by enemies!

90
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,950
This is because of your personality.

91
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,158
Gunma, it's up to you
to solve this predicament!

92
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,275
Do not rely on the car,
you have to rely on your skills!

93
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,279
You can do it Gunma,
lets see what your made off!

94
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,990
Damn it!
I have to do this!

95
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,357
Listen you idiots!

96
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,396
Now you'll see what I can do!

97
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,836
Gunma!

98
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,909
- Impossible! I must be dreaming!
- I should have taken a picture!

99
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,670
- How did he do that?
- I don't know.

100
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,793
- I wonder how...!
- He's the best driver in the world!

101
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,952
- I can hardly believe my eyes!
- Hand me the glasses.

102
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,356
It's just me and you!

103
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,590
- Victory!
- Gunma, you're great!

104
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,636
Those are my glasses.

105
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,756
He's almost won!

106
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,390
Come on!
Aren't you the fastest driver in the world?

107
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,436
You can't lose!

108
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,477
Oh...! I'm sorry.

109
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,480
Gunma, you've finally you made it!

110
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,596
You have won!

111
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,592
Wow!
Now that's a surprise!

112
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,439
Then the record that was
made during morning practice ...

113
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,397
...wasn't just a mistake!

114
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,436
We'll go and congratulate him.

115
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,436
Why don't you come...

116
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,750
...and meet him,
didn't you say you would?

117
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,550
You two should meet and
take a few photographs.

118
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,757
Come on, please!

119
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,553
- Sempai!
- You were great!

120
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,517
Congratulations!

121
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,477
Gunma!

122
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,517
You were terrific!
You deserve a great big kiss!

123
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,151
You take her.

124
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,236
Gunma!
Your lip is bleeding!

125
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,197
Are you alright?

126
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,271
Eh ?! It's nothing!

127
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,237
I bit the inside of my cheek ...

128
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,276
...when I passed that group of cars!

129
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,040
Next time, take more care.

130
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,036
- You shouldn't worry!
- Congratulations!

131
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,237
I am from the magazine "Race".
You were awesome.

132
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,151
You broke the record in a trial,

133
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,071
and you also won the race!

134
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,755
From the magazine "Race"?!
Yeah, I guess I earned it!

135
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,834
Can I take a photo while you ...

136
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,354
- ... have a handshake with ...
- Okay, okay!

137
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,671
You can take all the pictures
you want, come on Tamotsu!

138
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,117
Great, all we need to do is take a
photo of you and Hiziri!

139
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,589
What?!

140
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,757
Hiziri.

141
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,553
Well, about that handshake.

142
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,589
Now smile for the camera!

143
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,356
What is he doing?
That's the champion!

144
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,233
I'll never hold the hand...

145
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,197
...of an asshole!

146
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,470
I'm sorry about this Hiziri.

147
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,673
It's alright.
I expected as much.

148
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,194
That's just the way he is.

149
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,434
- Excuse him!
- What?

150
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,156
Gunma!
Have a drink with us..

151
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,550
We've gotta celebrate!
I've got some French champagne!

152
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,751
Champagne you say?

153
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,949
It's like I'm peeing champagne!

154
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,957
Grandma ...

155
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,036
Hiziri!

156
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,515
I'm sorry Hiziri.
Gunma has behaved terribly!

157
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,876
- I came to apologize to you!
- There's no need.

158
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,038
That machine you put
together is really something...

159
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,997
as I expected of you.

160
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,275
Anyone could win
with a car like that.

161
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,028
Thank you, but I don't
deserve all the credit.

162
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,112
Gunma only won because
of his excellent abilities!s

163
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,676
In fact, his driving has improved a lot.

164
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,868
But in the end what
matters most is still the car!

165
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,475
Hiziri.

166
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,756
I won't give up on you.

167
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,878
In your current state of
health you shouldn't drive.

168
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,037
Please, forget it!

169
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,675
- In order to win I need you.
- But I...

170
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,269
Tomorrow morning we
leave for the next circuit.

171
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,238
I hope you've got the message.
I'm counting on you!

172
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,596
Bye, I'll see you there.

173
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,756
Gunma!

174
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,517
Oh, I'm sorry!
Hey you know,

175
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,875
Is this the way
to celebrate my victory?

176
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,076
Drinking a fourth beer in a tavern!

177
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,875
I would rather be in a fancy restaurant,

178
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,269
surrounded by beautiful girls!

179
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,549
- You really are a true champion!
- Your lovely!

180
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,517
Why don't we have some fun?

181
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,360
This is the way I
would like to celebrate!

182
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,158
- Ehi!
- I'm sorry!

183
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,197
Gunma say sorry!

184
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,192
You know what? Thanks to
you, during the race,

185
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,750
- I seemed to be flying!
- I know!

186
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,354
Today you drove like a pro!

187
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,632
Our eyes were literally glued to you!

188
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,711
But this is only a small step.

189
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,519
I want to get
to race in Formula 1.

190
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,109
Just where are Junko and
the others? I'm getting hungry!

191
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,873
Well, Gunma... I asked
them to arrive a little late.

192
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,830
Well, I did ...

193
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,151
...so because I wanted
to have a talk with you.

194
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,197
Hiziri asked me to become ...

195
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,236
...his mechanic and I accepted!

196
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,959
- What? Why did you do that?
- Hiziri...

197
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:44,630
...will be making his
debut in Formula 3 next week.

198
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,756
And tomorrow
morning I leave with him.

199
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,514
From now on I can
no longer take care of your car.

200
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,955
But now you're an experienced
driver and you'll be fine.

201
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,154
Did you betray me just for money!

202
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,949
That's not true. That's the last
thing I was thinking of.

203
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,835
However I can't blame you.
It's Formula 3, after all.

204
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,632
So you aren't angry with me Gunma!

205
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,915
Just tell me why your doing this?

206
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,197
I'm trying with all my
might to remain calm.

207
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,033
I wouldn't want to
ruin my first victory.

208
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,439
I'm sorry, I just can't tell you!

209
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,950
Believe me, I want to
tell you but I just can't!

210
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,357
Please let me go.

211
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,633
- I beg of you!
- It's not fair for Gunma.

212
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,031
It's obvious that we cannot
stop you from going to work for Hiziri,

213
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,590
- but tell us why!
- He's right, Tamotsu!

214
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,838
That may be true but Gunma
does not swim in gold,

215
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,911
But he managed to
get a car from Kishida ...

216
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,956
...and gained his first victory!

217
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,314
It's true! Gunma did
everything possible...

218
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,356
...and you just can't walk away!

219
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,278
Well, you could at least answer me!

220
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,200
Don't you remember
our dreams of glory?

221
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,113
We started this adventure
together! Why leave?

222
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,756
It's not right to just leave us!

223
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,717
He's right, you know?

224
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,914
My feelings for you all
have not changed...

225
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,831
..since the day we met!

226
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,150
In fact, my dream
is identical to yours!

227
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,630
I want to travel the
world alongside Gunma!

228
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,672
I am sure that together we
will succeed! No, I know we will!

229
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,959
But...but...I...

230
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,270
Just have to do this.

231
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,949
Sometimes it's good to work
elsewhere for a while...

232
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,555
When he finally returns
to us, we'll all understand!

233
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,596
Granny,

234
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,676
You know what?

235
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,758
Get out, get out now.

236
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,269
I never want to see you again.

237
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,553
I will be able to win without...

238
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,279
...your help.
I don't need it anymore.

239
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,755
The checkered flag marks
the end of the race!

240
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,553
The car that sees the first
wave is the one that wins!

241
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,756
Winning is like living in paradise!

242
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,116
In the next episode.

243
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,111
Desert-colored heart?
Gunma Makes His Second Start Alone

244
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,272
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

245
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:14,150
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

246
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:20,100
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

247
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:26,400
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

248
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:36,200
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

249
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,100
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

250
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:50,800
These feelings
just flare up

251
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

252
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:02,800
The fantasy penetrates through you

253
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:08,000
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

254
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:15,850
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

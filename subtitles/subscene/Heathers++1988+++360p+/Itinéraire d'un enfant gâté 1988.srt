1
00:00:12,832 --> 00:00:16,791
Everyone is alone
and no one cares about anyone

2
00:00:16,952 --> 00:00:19,952
And our pains
are a deserted island...

3
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:23,391
To Jacques Brel.

4
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:57,630
who will give a circus
show for me

5
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:04,830
nostalgic love in the dust

6
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:09,629
who will make me go "I'm scared"

7
00:01:09,749 --> 00:01:15,949
the knife in the heart,
in the limelight

8
00:01:16,949 --> 00:01:21,629
who will treat me like a tigress

9
00:01:21,828 --> 00:01:28,588
the whip like
a caress to the music

10
00:01:28,749 --> 00:01:32,028
who will make me

11
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:38,188
balance between
balloons full of pathos

12
00:01:38,308 --> 00:01:42,827
sometimes I panic

13
00:01:43,948 --> 00:01:48,908
who will tell me

14
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:56,027
words of love
that can hurt

15
00:01:56,187 --> 00:01:57,707
who will hold me

16
00:01:58,187 --> 00:02:01,947
ITINERARY OF A SPOILED CHILD

17
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:08,107
when you'll release
all the stars

18
00:02:08,266 --> 00:02:13,066
who will want me

19
00:02:13,226 --> 00:02:19,946
with my red nose and
my heart full of tears

20
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:25,026
who will love me

21
00:02:25,226 --> 00:02:31,785
when there won't be much
of me left anymore

22
00:02:35,065 --> 00:02:40,185
who will still make me dream

23
00:02:40,345 --> 00:02:47,065
the clown or the rider
who emerges from the shadow

24
00:02:47,225 --> 00:02:52,265
who will still bring me the
artist's performance

25
00:02:52,385 --> 00:02:59,784
the trapeze artist's show
see him fall

26
00:02:59,944 --> 00:03:05,064
who will still bring me
the child that plays

27
00:03:05,224 --> 00:03:11,863
for the performing dogs
or the vampires

28
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:14,263
Don't you have a ticket?

29
00:03:15,383 --> 00:03:17,944
Where's your mother?

30
00:03:19,384 --> 00:03:22,023
Where? In the bar?

31
00:03:23,063 --> 00:03:28,343
Wait, I'll check. This boy
says his mother's in the bar.

32
00:03:28,503 --> 00:03:33,303
Could you have a look?
Ask for the mother of the boy.

33
00:03:33,462 --> 00:03:38,742
Wait a moment.
What's your name?

34
00:03:40,942 --> 00:03:42,902
Sam?

35
00:03:43,062 --> 00:03:49,062
What have you got there?
Can I have a look?

36
00:03:49,222 --> 00:03:50,981
Is that your mother's?

37
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:07,621
Sam's three years old. I can't
keep him. I'm desperate.

38
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:11,381
Look after him. I beg you.

39
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,421
three years later

40
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:16,338
Sam, 13 years old

41
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,455
Sam, 16 years old

42
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:24,409
it has a silver shine

43
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:31,288
the itinerary of a spoiled child

44
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:36,489
is littered with broken toys

45
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:44,408
the itinerary of a spoiled child

46
00:08:45,928 --> 00:08:49,928
The last time I saw him,
was just before he left.

47
00:08:50,048 --> 00:08:53,048
He wanted to get to know
himself.

48
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:59,287
This solitary voyage was a challenge
he added to all the storms in his 
life.

49
00:08:59,448 --> 00:09:04,968
He always said: when I spend some
hours with you, I want to believe.

50
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:10,687
When I spend an evening with my
children, I want to believe in family.

51
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:15,527
When I'm with a woman,
I want to believe in love.

52
00:09:15,647 --> 00:09:17,966
That's Sam Lion for you.

53
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:20,567
You know why he was called that,
don't you?

54
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:27,287
He was found near a circus and
when he was registered...

55
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:34,406
the circus master called him Sam Lion
because he was always near the lions.

56
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:40,326
This is the best day of my life.
-Because it's beautiful here.

57
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:43,205
Where does all this water go?
-To Lake Kariba.

58
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:49,285
It's beautiful. Rainbows
come straight out of the water.

59
00:09:49,445 --> 00:09:51,365
The most beautiful spot
in the world.

60
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,765
Will we see all of that?

61
00:09:53,925 --> 00:09:55,685
You and I?

62
00:09:58,805 --> 00:10:01,925
Look a rainbow. Quick.
Make a wish.

63
00:10:02,045 --> 00:10:05,004
When he falls from the trapeze,
he becomes a street sweeper...

64
00:10:05,484 --> 00:10:07,245
so he can stay with the carnival.

65
00:10:07,845 --> 00:10:13,524
He wins a prize for best sweeper
and gets the award from Yvette...

66
00:10:13,684 --> 00:10:17,524
who becomes his wife.
They have a son, Jean-Philippe.

67
00:10:17,644 --> 00:10:21,524
Then the big drama happens
in Singapore.

68
00:10:21,644 --> 00:10:25,443
He has to raise Jean-Philippe
on his own.

69
00:10:25,604 --> 00:10:30,644
It takes him ten years to
recover and meet Corine.

70
00:10:30,803 --> 00:10:34,083
Ten years to turn his little
business into an international 
company.

71
00:10:34,283 --> 00:10:38,563
Ten years before he can smile again
upon seeing a child's face.

72
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:40,483
Magnificent.

73
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:48,482
You look more and more like your 
mother.
-Then you must be starting to hate me.

74
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:53,762
Whose idea was it to go here?
-Mine.

75
00:10:53,922 --> 00:10:58,322
I wanted to go to Venice,
but Corine had already been there.

76
00:10:58,442 --> 00:11:01,521
Then I realised they have even more
water here.

77
00:11:01,682 --> 00:11:05,282
Who decided to call me Victoria?
-Your mother.

78
00:11:05,442 --> 00:11:10,561
She's sure you were conceived here.
In this area.

79
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:13,761
I'm glad it wasn't near the
Niagara Falls.

80
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:19,761
You were almost called Isabelle.
Because I loved Jacques Brels song.

81
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:22,561
It's about his daughter.

82
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:26,881
But because of this spectacle,
you became Victoria.

83
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:29,600
How did you get the business?

84
00:11:29,761 --> 00:11:36,320
After my accident, I was responsible
for keeping the circus clean.

85
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,080
I looked for machines to do the work.

86
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,000
What shall we do tonight?

87
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:52,079
American dinner, tamtam, birthday 
cake,
champagne. The good life.

88
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,879
Doesn't that give you ideas?
-Why not?

89
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,719
I watched them this morning.
It's great what they do.

90
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:09,438
Look, he's the best one.
Unbelievable what he does.

91
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:17,199
Imagine, autumn on the Champs-Elysées.
'Ballet with Brooms'.

92
00:12:45,837 --> 00:12:50,077
When will the machines be introduced?
-In a month.

93
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,597
How did you get the idea?

94
00:12:51,757 --> 00:12:58,156
My daughter and I saw them on our
travels and we improved on them.

95
00:12:58,316 --> 00:13:01,996
They say a minister is interested
in buying them.

96
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:06,156
That makes sense.
It's of interest to the public.

97
00:13:06,316 --> 00:13:10,716
Are you really going to buy
a circus that has gone bankrupt?

98
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,916
I love the circus,
but that's nonsense.

99
00:13:14,036 --> 00:13:20,556
I only hired people who were about to 
be
fired. This is my secretary, by the 
way.

100
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:27,515
The only secretary to land safely 
after
a death-defying leap. Most of the 
time.

101
00:13:27,635 --> 00:13:32,315
How did you become the biggest
in your trade, in 10 years?

102
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:36,875
Step in the shit often
and always clean it up.

103
00:13:38,155 --> 00:13:42,395
So this machine will
replace street sweepers?

104
00:13:42,515 --> 00:13:47,194
This machine can clean 10
kilometres per day.

105
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:49,594
A person can do 1 kilometre.

106
00:13:49,754 --> 00:13:55,434
The operator can also use the
machine as a mode of transport.

107
00:13:55,554 --> 00:14:01,433
But most of all, the operator doesn't
make contact with the garbage anymore.

108
00:14:01,553 --> 00:14:07,913
The work will get a better reputation
and will also be performed by 
students.

109
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:10,553
So, sweepers will be unemployed.

110
00:14:10,673 --> 00:14:17,513
The machine can't reach everywhere and
traditional sweepers are still 
required.

111
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:21,113
But they should learn to
use roller-skates.

112
00:14:30,392 --> 00:14:33,592
Do you find this funny?
-Not at all.

113
00:14:33,752 --> 00:14:36,392
I need to talk to you.
-I understand.

114
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:41,752
What do you mean?
-I'm just saying I understand.

115
00:14:41,912 --> 00:14:44,792
I don't want to go to the hotel.

116
00:14:44,912 --> 00:14:47,591
It's not a hotel,
it's where I live.

117
00:14:47,751 --> 00:14:50,711
It's also about the rest.

118
00:14:50,871 --> 00:14:55,911
What? I don't have anything.
This machine's my first moped.

119
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:58,231
What do you want?

120
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:05,510
What do I have to do to keep you?
Drive a pink Cadillac?

121
00:15:08,311 --> 00:15:11,911
Wait a moment. Wait.

122
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:15,030
Here, this is for you.

123
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,230
What is it?
-Have a look.

124
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:24,870
I'd like to take you there.
Near Victoria Falls.

125
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:39,029
Are you going? Alright.

126
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:43,189
Can I keep this?
-It's a present.

127
00:16:23,907 --> 00:16:27,906
Will you be roller-skating for long?
-I don't know.

128
00:16:28,026 --> 00:16:33,507
Aren't you taking that thing?
-Leave it. I'll take it tomorrow.

129
00:16:36,906 --> 00:16:40,786
When will you get married?
-Ask him.

130
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:46,466
Miss, bring me the file of
Albert Duvivier.

131
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:51,106
It's a machine to pick up shit with,
not girls.

132
00:16:51,266 --> 00:16:54,785
And how often have I told you
to wear your helmet?

133
00:16:54,905 --> 00:16:59,105
Can I speak to the boss?
-I'm your direct superior.

134
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:04,385
I want to speak to whoever makes the
rules, not to who enforces them.

135
00:17:04,505 --> 00:17:08,665
Can you swim?
-Breast stroke.

136
00:17:08,785 --> 00:17:13,785
Swim into the Atlantic
Ocean and you might see him.

137
00:17:23,864 --> 00:17:25,664
Damn.

138
00:17:55,103 --> 00:17:59,982
That's not clear. Repeat, please.
-Your position, Victoria?

139
00:18:00,102 --> 00:18:03,743
I repeat 42 North, 26 West.

140
00:18:06,102 --> 00:18:10,142
Still the same.
Speak clearly, dear.

141
00:18:10,262 --> 00:18:15,982
I ask him to call you.
-In an hour. I have things to do.

142
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:18,702
End of call.
-Fine.

143
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:26,221
So that's 42 North...
That's not my position at all.

144
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:31,021
Hello, Saint-Lys.

145
00:18:36,461 --> 00:18:41,181
Is there anybody at the pump?
-Céline. I'm here.

146
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,781
What do I have to do?
-Help them with the crossing.

147
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,660
How long will that take?
-Two weeks.

148
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,260
Will I be washing dishes
for two weeks?

149
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:04,779
Victoria Lion
Starting Point

150
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:15,579
I'll summarize.
Take it easy with the pills.

151
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,939
What's more important...
Are you listening?

152
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:25,018
Take your boat out mornings,
afternoons and evenings...

153
00:19:25,138 --> 00:19:30,139
and get far away from us,
for at least a month.

154
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:34,658
You can't quit smoking like
that either.

155
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:37,818
Want to bet?

156
00:19:41,298 --> 00:19:44,138
Is it that serious?
-It's in your head.

157
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:47,577
That's good.
I'll see you at dinner.

158
00:19:47,737 --> 00:19:51,018
Are you still with Martine?
-I'll tell you later.

159
00:19:51,138 --> 00:19:55,977
Jean-Philippe,
your father's not doing well.

160
00:19:56,137 --> 00:19:59,257
I fear a nervous breakdown.

161
00:19:59,377 --> 00:20:02,936
He shouldn't continue to live
close to his work.

162
00:20:03,097 --> 00:20:07,577
It's not good to live in a caravan,
especially for him.

163
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:13,337
I'll give him a prescription, but talk
to him. We have to get through to him.

164
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:17,896
Is he doing that bad?

165
00:20:19,656 --> 00:20:24,535
What is happiness then?
-You'd like to know, wouldn't you?

166
00:20:24,696 --> 00:20:31,655
Well, happiness is... it's...

167
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:36,775
When there is no trouble.
And you have to keep it that way.

168
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:40,215
You must be very tired
to talk like that.

169
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:43,655
What tired you out the most in life?

170
00:20:43,815 --> 00:20:45,335
Your mother.

171
00:20:46,335 --> 00:20:50,254
Didn't you love her a bit?
-Yes.

172
00:20:50,454 --> 00:20:52,774
Or you wouldn't have
been born.

173
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:56,134
And did you love Jean-Philippe's
mother?

174
00:20:57,334 --> 00:21:03,014
Can't we talk about something else?
-You don't want to talk about anyone.

175
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:05,894
Are you angry with me?

176
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:11,174
I'm glad you still look human.
You should see the car.

177
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:16,934
Can you explain to me why
we don't get along, dad?

178
00:21:17,973 --> 00:21:21,013
I've sent you to schools that were
too good.

179
00:21:23,173 --> 00:21:29,332
While we both run Victoria,
I can't be myself.

180
00:21:31,093 --> 00:21:34,652
Hold on a bit longer.
I won't stay for long.

181
00:21:34,772 --> 00:21:42,012
That's not what I mean. You sleep at
Victoria, you eat it, you drink it.

182
00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:45,772
You sail Victoria.
It's all you think about.

183
00:21:45,892 --> 00:21:50,052
We never have time to talk.
To spend an evening together.

184
00:21:56,772 --> 00:22:01,731
Do you really want to cross the ocean?
-I've been sailing for 30 years.

185
00:22:01,851 --> 00:22:04,691
The bay of St. Tropez isn't
the same thing.

186
00:22:04,851 --> 00:22:08,291
Anything urgent?
I'm not available for anyone.

187
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:10,771
You can't do this.

188
00:22:10,931 --> 00:22:15,571
Can't I go out on the ocean?
-You're abandoning 12,000 employees.

189
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:19,650
No, I'm not.
I'm selling a company. Quite a 
company.

190
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:22,610
You can't. You are the company.

191
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,530
Who can buy a company like that?
-What about these walls?

192
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:31,489
What will you do with the money?
-I haven't had a break for 50 years.

193
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,049
Two days of holiday and you'll go mad.
-I want to try.

194
00:22:54,609 --> 00:22:58,608
The doctor said he won't start again.
-What should I do?

195
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:02,608
Look.
-What should I do?

196
00:23:02,769 --> 00:23:04,128
Ride a bicycle.

197
00:23:04,288 --> 00:23:09,168
Look at him. He goes from
one to the next. Look.

198
00:23:11,008 --> 00:23:16,288
I want to write a book. Think I can?
-A book? Why not?

199
00:23:16,448 --> 00:23:22,287
And I want to go to the US.
-Is he American?

200
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:26,687
Unbelievable.

201
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:31,487
You always take me to the circus.
-Of course.

202
00:23:32,807 --> 00:23:36,127
My two big passions in life.

203
00:23:37,407 --> 00:23:41,647
When I was young,
I always wanted to marry you.

204
00:23:41,767 --> 00:23:46,526
And now?
-I'd be too scared you'd leave me.

205
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:49,726
But I do want someone like you.

206
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:53,646
Shall I tell you something?
I'm not a good catch.

207
00:23:53,806 --> 00:23:56,126
I don't believe that.
-It's true.

208
00:23:56,246 --> 00:24:01,086
What's a good catch?
-Someone who doesn't think too much.

209
00:24:01,245 --> 00:24:05,005
That only leaves the idiots.
-Don't believe that.

210
00:24:09,846 --> 00:24:12,525
Better late than never.

211
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,405
You're even late on the day
of your divorce.

212
00:24:15,565 --> 00:24:17,725
Especially then.

213
00:24:20,804 --> 00:24:25,644
Don't they know what the party's for?
-I was waiting for you.

214
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:31,004
Is this a joke?
-Don't pull that face. It's a party.

215
00:24:31,164 --> 00:24:36,444
You should celebrate the day of 
escape,
not the day of imprisonment.

216
00:24:36,604 --> 00:24:40,044
Isn't she beautiful,
my divorced wife?

217
00:24:45,564 --> 00:24:47,884
You look good.
-So do you.

218
00:24:48,043 --> 00:24:51,883
Will she be in time?
-I think so.

219
00:24:52,043 --> 00:24:55,403
When did she decide to come back?
-The day before yesterday.

220
00:24:55,563 --> 00:25:01,003
I knew she wouldn't like New-York.
She's too French.

221
00:25:01,163 --> 00:25:05,483
What's wrong?
-Nothing. Everything's fine.

222
00:25:05,643 --> 00:25:07,403
Look, there she is.

223
00:25:09,882 --> 00:25:14,362
What has she got in her arms?
-She'll explain later.

224
00:25:15,402 --> 00:25:21,482
You explain it to me.
-He's six months old and his name's 
Sam.

225
00:25:29,482 --> 00:25:35,241
His name's Sam, he's six months old
and I'm the grandfather. Is that 
right?

226
00:25:38,681 --> 00:25:41,001
Where's the father?

227
00:25:42,441 --> 00:25:45,481
Not here. Of course.

228
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:50,200
Does the father know, at least?

229
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,560
It's better like this.

230
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,040
Do you want to know what
I really think?

231
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:08,120
I'm the happiest man in the world.
Look, he's got my eyes.

232
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,200
Not because she's my daughter,
but it's great.

233
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,319
I would love it if you could
publish it.

234
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,239
If there's a problem,
you know where to find me.

235
00:26:19,399 --> 00:26:22,119
Don't tell my daughter, please.

236
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:24,439
What are you doing here?
-Your pills.

237
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,759
Those pills.
They're alright, it's the rest.

238
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:34,118
Everything goes wrong. Wait. I told
you to be here before the personnel.

239
00:26:38,678 --> 00:26:41,718
What's this?
Do you call this advertising?

240
00:26:41,878 --> 00:26:45,078
Everything you do,
I have to do again.

241
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:52,038
Did they pay?
Good, I'll call you back right away.

242
00:26:52,198 --> 00:26:54,598
We'll see each other tonight.

243
00:26:54,757 --> 00:26:59,477
Did you read your sister's book?
-What's it about then?

244
00:26:59,638 --> 00:27:05,157
A 25 year old girl falls in love
with a 50 year old man.

245
00:27:05,277 --> 00:27:08,357
He's a bit like you.
-And then?

246
00:27:08,477 --> 00:27:14,117
He gives everything up to go with her.
That's why it's called 'Starting 
Point'.

247
00:27:19,797 --> 00:27:22,756
How are you?
-Excellent.

248
00:27:22,917 --> 00:27:26,836
I can't hear you well.
-Excellent!

249
00:27:26,996 --> 00:27:31,236
Are you coming back soon?
-Not really.

250
00:27:31,396 --> 00:27:34,276
We're all coming to the harbour.

251
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:36,755
And my son?
-We haven't seen him much.

252
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:41,955
When will you be back?
-In a couple of days.

253
00:27:42,116 --> 00:27:44,516
Why? Are there problems?

254
00:27:44,675 --> 00:27:48,515
Not really, but we
have to make some decisions.

255
00:27:48,675 --> 00:27:50,115
Well, take them.

256
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:56,835
Hello? I can't hear you anymore.
Hello? I can't hear anything anymore.

257
00:28:00,315 --> 00:28:02,114
Finished.

258
00:29:10,192 --> 00:29:13,791
Is this really it?
-Yes.

259
00:29:14,511 --> 00:29:18,831
How can I reach you?
-I'll write when I get there.

260
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:25,631
It's far away, isn't it?
-Yes, it's Africa.

261
00:29:25,791 --> 00:29:33,390
Where is it exactly?
-I don't know yet. I'll find out.

262
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:38,430
What can I say?
If it fails, I'll be here.

263
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:41,870
I know. You're always here.

264
00:29:42,029 --> 00:29:45,470
Alright, dad. Take care. Goodbye.

265
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,909
It's in a hurry.

266
00:30:01,469 --> 00:30:06,909
who will give a circus
show for me

267
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:11,948
nostalgic love in the dust

268
00:30:15,068 --> 00:30:20,828
who will make me go "I'm scared"

269
00:30:20,988 --> 00:30:26,427
the knife in the heart,
in the limelight

270
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:33,787
who will treat me like a tigress

271
00:30:33,948 --> 00:30:40,507
the whip like a caress to music

272
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:44,907
who will make me

273
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:51,707
balance between
balloons full of pathos

274
00:30:51,827 --> 00:30:55,226
sometimes I panic

275
00:30:56,546 --> 00:31:01,146
who will tell me

276
00:31:01,266 --> 00:31:06,266
words of love that can hurt
-Good morning.

277
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:13,225
who will hold me

278
00:31:13,386 --> 00:31:19,145
when you'll release
all the stars

279
00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:24,985
who will want me

280
00:31:25,145 --> 00:31:31,305
with my red nose and
my heart full of tears

281
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:37,144
who will love me

282
00:31:37,264 --> 00:31:43,064
when there won't be much
of me left anymore

283
00:31:50,264 --> 00:31:55,463
who will still make me cry

284
00:31:55,624 --> 00:32:02,264
the clown or the rider
who emerges from the shadow

285
00:32:02,423 --> 00:32:07,623
who will still bring me the
artist's performance

286
00:32:07,743 --> 00:32:14,023
the trapeze artist's show
see him fall

287
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:19,142
who will still bring me
the child that plays

288
00:32:19,262 --> 00:32:25,382
for the performing dogs
or the vampires

289
00:32:26,422 --> 00:32:32,342
who will do the final act for me

290
00:32:32,502 --> 00:32:39,462
to seduce me to smile

291
00:32:41,221 --> 00:32:45,861
who will tell me

292
00:32:46,021 --> 00:32:52,821
words of love that can hurt

293
00:32:52,981 --> 00:32:57,941
who will hold me

294
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:04,340
when you'll release
all the stars

295
00:33:05,381 --> 00:33:10,020
who will want me

296
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:16,980
with my red nose and
my heart full of tears

297
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,940
who will love me

298
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:29,459
when there won't be much
of me left anymore

299
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:42,339
Remember what you told me last week?
-Last week I was tired.

300
00:33:42,498 --> 00:33:49,218
As far as eating, drinking and 
fucking are
concerned, animals do better than we.

301
00:33:49,378 --> 00:33:55,618
You're talking like a spoiled child.
Animals die of heart attacks too.

302
00:33:55,738 --> 00:34:00,017
What about priests and heart attacks?

303
00:34:00,178 --> 00:34:04,418
What reunites us here
is his love of others.

304
00:34:04,577 --> 00:34:10,898
Many of us know that he didn't need
much reason to come to our help.

305
00:34:12,657 --> 00:34:18,817
I've often heard him complain about
the company and talk about selling...

306
00:34:18,977 --> 00:34:24,657
but then he'd think of all of you
and nothing changed.

307
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:33,856
Victoria and Jean-Philippe,
you now have to survive this storm.

308
00:34:35,216 --> 00:34:37,696
He once told me...

309
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:43,056
if you love sun, rain and wind,
you have to believe in God.

310
00:34:44,976 --> 00:34:49,776
Let's pray for the days
that he did believe.

311
00:35:19,254 --> 00:35:23,854
Do you really speak French?
-If you want to talk to us, yes.

312
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:30,253
A taxi driver told me this was the
place to go in Hamburg.

313
00:35:30,373 --> 00:35:36,253
It's 300 marks
for an hour, 1000 marks for a night...

314
00:35:36,373 --> 00:35:39,373
and free if you marry me.

315
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:46,533
I need false papers.

316
00:35:48,053 --> 00:35:53,613
You'd have to go to granny.
She has the most contacts.

317
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:58,533
Careful, there's a lot of police here.
-I didn't do anything.

318
00:36:00,213 --> 00:36:04,972
What's your speciality?
-Anything, if you pay.

319
00:36:10,772 --> 00:36:13,691
Did granny explain?

320
00:36:13,852 --> 00:36:20,051
I don't make papers, I find them.
-That's better.

321
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:26,731
With the Cologne Carnival approaching,
it won't take very long.

322
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:30,571
Is Cologne far?
-400 kilometres.

323
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,051
Is it nice?
-It's special.

324
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:51,050
Want to know why I do this work?

325
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,770
You don't want to talk?

326
00:36:55,929 --> 00:37:00,969
When you ask someone how they are,
you take a big risk.

327
00:37:06,769 --> 00:37:09,529
Don't you like me?

328
00:37:09,689 --> 00:37:12,009
My daughter's your age.

329
00:37:15,529 --> 00:37:17,609
I don't know anyone who loves the
carnival this much.

330
00:37:18,128 --> 00:37:20,369
Me neither.

331
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:26,288
Will you really use those 20 tickets?
-I have nothing else to do.

332
00:37:35,048 --> 00:37:36,528
Well done.

333
00:37:36,648 --> 00:37:39,528
Have you got work?
-Not really.

334
00:37:39,688 --> 00:37:41,448
Come.

335
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:49,847
Come.

336
00:37:54,407 --> 00:37:57,287
Mr Van den Berghe, architect.

337
00:38:04,206 --> 00:38:06,646
50,000 dollars for one hour.

338
00:38:09,606 --> 00:38:11,606
What do I have to do?

339
00:38:14,646 --> 00:38:20,045
Deliver three bags at
Düsseldorf Station.

340
00:38:21,886 --> 00:38:23,686
Three bags?

341
00:38:23,806 --> 00:38:25,845
It's only the two of them.

342
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:34,965
I'm sorry.
I always work alone.

343
00:38:36,485 --> 00:38:38,765
Your passport, please.

344
00:38:43,765 --> 00:38:48,524
I see you also fly to New-York.
Cancel Tokyo.

345
00:38:48,644 --> 00:38:51,685
Tokyo?
-Cancel it.

346
00:38:53,844 --> 00:38:58,644
Do you also fly to Papeete?
-Cancel New-York. Give me Papeete.

347
00:39:00,764 --> 00:39:05,523
Papeete. If you tell me what you're
looking for, I might be able to help.

348
00:39:05,684 --> 00:39:09,684
Good question.
First, I'll go for some sun.

349
00:39:11,203 --> 00:39:14,163
It's the wet season there.

350
00:39:15,203 --> 00:39:17,923
Where do they go when it rains?

351
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:20,323
Papeete after all then?

352
00:39:23,603 --> 00:39:25,763
I only have smoking.

353
00:39:25,922 --> 00:39:28,322
I'll start smoking again then.

354
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:31,043
Are you doing that bad?

355
00:39:32,723 --> 00:39:36,522
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're descending towards Papeete.

356
00:39:36,642 --> 00:39:42,042
It's 39 degrees.
Tighten your seatbelts.

357
00:39:49,201 --> 00:39:55,441
an island
an island off the shore of hope

358
00:39:56,521 --> 00:40:00,241
where men would not be afraid

359
00:40:00,361 --> 00:40:05,441
and soft and calm like your mirror

360
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:13,440
an island
clear as Easter morning

361
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,000
offering the ocean's languor

362
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,120
with a mermaid on each wave

363
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:28,960
come, come, my love

364
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,759
there, there won't be any of
those madmen

365
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,159
who tell us to be wise

366
00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:41,199
or that twenty is
the beautiful age

367
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:45,519
here comes the time to live

368
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:51,679
here comes the time to love

369
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:58,718
an island, an island off
the shore of love

370
00:40:58,838 --> 00:41:03,518
placed on the altar of the sea

371
00:41:03,678 --> 00:41:07,758
satin lying down on velvet

372
00:41:09,518 --> 00:41:17,118
an island, warm as tenderness

373
00:41:17,238 --> 00:41:21,597
hoping like a desert

374
00:41:21,717 --> 00:41:26,957
for a rain cloud's caress

375
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:32,237
come, come, my love

376
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:36,397
there, there won't be any
of those madmen

377
00:41:36,517 --> 00:41:39,276
who hide the long beaches from us

378
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:44,796
come, my love
let's flee the storm

379
00:41:44,957 --> 00:41:49,196
here comes the time to live

380
00:41:49,356 --> 00:41:55,675
here comes the time to love

381
00:41:55,795 --> 00:42:03,196
an island, which we still have
to build

382
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:07,276
but that could hold on

383
00:42:07,435 --> 00:42:13,355
to the dreams we dream as two

384
00:42:13,515 --> 00:42:20,874
an island, that's about to
depart

385
00:42:21,035 --> 00:42:25,114
that has been sleeping
in our eyes

386
00:42:25,275 --> 00:42:31,354
since the doors of childhood

387
00:42:31,514 --> 00:42:35,514
come, come, my love

388
00:42:35,674 --> 00:42:40,154
because it's there that it all begins

389
00:42:40,274 --> 00:42:42,634
I believe in the last chance

390
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:48,033
and you are the one I want

391
00:42:48,153 --> 00:42:52,393
here comes the time to live

392
00:42:52,513 --> 00:42:58,313
here comes the time to love

393
00:42:58,513 --> 00:43:02,512
an island

394
00:44:37,749 --> 00:44:43,668
disillusioned flower salesman

395
00:44:43,788 --> 00:44:49,988
the itinerary of a spoiled child

396
00:44:51,107 --> 00:44:56,627
God believes in those who
looked for him

397
00:44:57,668 --> 00:45:03,107
the itinerary of a spoiled child

398
00:45:04,147 --> 00:45:07,427
Isn't that jacket warm?
-A bit.

399
00:45:07,587 --> 00:45:10,947
Why do you wear it?
-To protect myself.

400
00:45:11,107 --> 00:45:12,946
Do you believe that yourself?

401
00:45:13,107 --> 00:45:17,827
It's because Yvette gave it to
you in Singapore.

402
00:45:17,986 --> 00:45:20,947
Where did you put the jacket, sir?

403
00:45:21,106 --> 00:45:24,946
On my bag,
when I bought my ticket to Papeete.

404
00:46:29,103 --> 00:46:31,423
The car will come later.

405
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:35,343
This is a honeymoon.

406
00:47:14,061 --> 00:47:18,940
When there won't be much
of me left anymore

407
00:47:19,101 --> 00:47:20,461
Stop, Yvette.

408
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:34,540
You were very sweet at
the cemetery, yesterday.

409
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:37,420
I wanted to bring you flowers.

410
00:47:38,379 --> 00:47:40,940
It was the first time I saw you cry.

411
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,780
Can I touch you?

412
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:02,378
How do you like Jean-Philippe?
-You're rather hard on him.

413
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:05,099
You didn't raise him.

414
00:48:06,218 --> 00:48:08,219
Yvette.

415
00:48:17,578 --> 00:48:20,218
Come back, damnit!

416
00:48:31,177 --> 00:48:33,577
Where were you?

417
00:48:34,618 --> 00:48:38,777
Sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
That happens with ghosts.

418
00:48:40,257 --> 00:48:42,617
Careful, or I'll leave again.

419
00:48:45,576 --> 00:48:47,577
A little kiss.

420
00:48:59,016 --> 00:49:00,456
Smile.

421
00:49:00,816 --> 00:49:02,216
Perfect.

422
00:49:15,296 --> 00:49:20,615
you're successful in business
and lucky in love

423
00:49:20,775 --> 00:49:24,935
you often change secretaries

424
00:49:26,854 --> 00:49:32,614
your office is in a high tower
from which you look down upon the city

425
00:49:32,775 --> 00:49:37,334
from where you control your universe

426
00:49:38,695 --> 00:49:43,734
the largest part of your life you're 
in
the air between New York and Singapore

427
00:49:43,894 --> 00:49:49,494
you always travel first class

428
00:49:50,214 --> 00:49:53,414
you have a second home

429
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:56,694
in every Hilton on earth

430
00:49:56,853 --> 00:50:01,254
you can't handle misery

431
00:50:04,053 --> 00:50:07,093
you're not happy
although you seem to be

432
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:09,973
you didn't lose your
sense of humour

433
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:14,533
when you got your sense
of business

434
00:50:15,973 --> 00:50:19,572
you're successful and proud of it

435
00:50:19,692 --> 00:50:22,373
you only regret one thing

436
00:50:22,532 --> 00:50:27,172
you're not doing what you wanted to do

437
00:50:30,372 --> 00:50:35,731
you wanted to be an artist

438
00:50:37,732 --> 00:50:43,972
to do your act

439
00:50:44,131 --> 00:50:50,371
when the plane lands on the runway

440
00:50:50,731 --> 00:50:56,130
in Rotterdam or Rio

441
00:50:57,171 --> 00:51:03,010
you wanted to be a singer

442
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:08,610
in order to say who you are

443
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:14,849
you wanted to be an author

444
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:21,809
in order to make up your life

445
00:51:22,529 --> 00:51:27,969
in order to make up your life

446
00:51:28,809 --> 00:51:34,609
you wanted to be an actor

447
00:51:35,569 --> 00:51:40,449
in order to become someone
else every day

448
00:51:41,209 --> 00:51:47,008
and to admire yourself

449
00:51:47,968 --> 00:51:53,328
in colour, on the big screen

450
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:59,648
in colour, on the big screen

451
00:51:59,808 --> 00:52:05,808
you wanted to be an artist

452
00:52:21,367 --> 00:52:24,127
so you could say

453
00:52:24,287 --> 00:52:28,046
why you exist

454
00:52:38,606 --> 00:52:41,806
Van den Berghe, Belgium. Architect?

455
00:53:14,805 --> 00:53:19,324
Are there many French here?
-The whole kitchen crew's French.

456
00:53:19,484 --> 00:53:22,044
Where are you from?
-Belgium.

457
00:53:50,203 --> 00:53:52,363
A Belgian beer.

458
00:53:58,322 --> 00:53:59,802
With foam?
-Without.

459
00:53:59,962 --> 00:54:01,722
Yes, that's better.

460
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:06,282
On holiday. Victoria Falls?
It's beautiful.

461
00:54:09,642 --> 00:54:13,561
I'll put something under the 
table-leg.
It's the humidity.

462
00:54:13,722 --> 00:54:16,602
Where's my bungalow?

463
00:54:16,761 --> 00:54:18,522
Which number?

464
00:54:20,721 --> 00:54:22,201
Number 12.

465
00:54:22,321 --> 00:54:24,841
I'll take you there.

466
00:54:25,001 --> 00:54:29,960
You don't seem to need a guide?
-I've got a good map.

467
00:54:30,121 --> 00:54:34,680
Nice to have a Frenchman here.
-A Belgian.

468
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:40,200
But you don't have a Belgian accent.
-I can produce one.

469
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:44,200
Tomorrow morning, the elephants
might have breakfast with you.

470
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,880
Do you like animals?
-They're interesting.

471
00:54:49,399 --> 00:54:52,519
This is Snow White's house.

472
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:56,359
There are lots of mosquito's here.

473
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:04,679
Will you stay for long?

474
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:06,919
Are you a cop or a barman?

475
00:55:07,799 --> 00:55:12,359
I may have come across confused.

476
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:16,758
You look like an uncle of mine,
but without a beard.

477
00:55:16,919 --> 00:55:18,759
Here, thanks.

478
00:55:23,398 --> 00:55:25,878
Dinner's at 7:30.

479
00:55:26,038 --> 00:55:29,478
I'll go for a walk.

480
00:55:29,638 --> 00:55:33,158
Alright. Breakfast is at 6:30.

481
00:56:34,995 --> 00:56:36,995
They're going for it.

482
00:56:39,554 --> 00:56:41,555
I have nothing to eat.

483
00:57:18,433 --> 00:57:20,433
Are you going with us?

484
00:57:25,673 --> 00:57:27,792
Don't you have a guide?

485
00:57:34,592 --> 00:57:35,952
Excuse me.

486
00:59:58,106 --> 00:59:59,865
Hello.
-Hello, sir.

487
01:00:00,785 --> 01:00:02,426
Early bird?

488
01:00:02,585 --> 01:00:04,346
I've got the day off.

489
01:00:05,665 --> 01:00:10,505
Did you take good pictures?
-Yes, you with the lions.

490
01:00:18,105 --> 01:00:19,864
Any more?
-No.

491
01:00:28,304 --> 01:00:29,704
What's that?

492
01:00:39,543 --> 01:00:43,783
From when is this?
-It's been in the hotel for months.

493
01:00:47,263 --> 01:00:50,503
Did you show it to anyone?
-No, no one.

494
01:00:55,783 --> 01:00:59,222
Behind you. Don't turn around.

495
01:01:22,342 --> 01:01:27,541
It's your fault that I ended up here.
All this talk about Victoria.

496
01:01:27,661 --> 01:01:31,221
I was one of the 12,000 employees.

497
01:01:31,381 --> 01:01:35,701
You were looking for roller skaters
and since I was good at it...

498
01:01:37,141 --> 01:01:40,901
And then I got fired.
You fired me.

499
01:01:42,021 --> 01:01:43,380
What's your name?

500
01:01:43,821 --> 01:01:47,061
Albert Duvivier.
They call me Al.

501
01:01:51,060 --> 01:01:53,460
You're not afraid of lions.

502
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:57,060
Or of you.

503
01:02:00,779 --> 01:02:04,340
Journalists always exaggerate
a bit.

504
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:10,340
It's a small world.

505
01:02:10,499 --> 01:02:13,859
Nobody would believe me.

506
01:02:14,019 --> 01:02:16,499
Who will you tell?

507
01:02:23,619 --> 01:02:26,179
I'm just saying...

508
01:02:26,299 --> 01:02:27,699
Good.

509
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:43,058
Don't you feel at ease?

510
01:02:48,018 --> 01:02:50,257
Stop moving around
I'm getting seasick.

511
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:03,377
Why did you do it?

512
01:03:03,537 --> 01:03:06,176
Because I felt like it.

513
01:03:08,177 --> 01:03:10,177
Wasn't business going well?

514
01:03:11,816 --> 01:03:14,736
You know enough by now.

515
01:03:17,537 --> 01:03:20,336
I can keep a secret.

516
01:03:22,096 --> 01:03:24,176
It's more than a secret.

517
01:03:25,336 --> 01:03:28,816
If you'd explain,
at least I'd understand.

518
01:03:31,176 --> 01:03:36,095
I left behind what I loved the most.
Do you understand that?

519
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,135
No.

520
01:03:42,095 --> 01:03:44,495
What's your price?

521
01:03:44,975 --> 01:03:49,935
No, I won't sell them, because...

522
01:03:51,774 --> 01:03:54,095
Anyway, I don't have the photos
anymore.

523
01:03:54,654 --> 01:03:58,014
Be honest.
You wanted to blackmail me.

524
01:03:58,174 --> 01:04:03,134
No, I wanted to sell them.
-And what do you call that?

525
01:04:03,294 --> 01:04:05,454
Blackmail.

526
01:04:07,934 --> 01:04:12,814
I changed my mind.
Why did you do that with the lion?

527
01:04:13,694 --> 01:04:16,173
Do you ever toss a coin?

528
01:04:17,534 --> 01:04:21,453
Do you ever play Russian roulette?
-No, I don't.

529
01:04:21,614 --> 01:04:26,013
What shall I do?
Kill you or bribe you?

530
01:04:29,613 --> 01:04:34,333
I'd prefer the first solution.
No, the second.

531
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:40,412
I really don't know what to
do with you.

532
01:04:42,973 --> 01:04:46,572
I don't know what to do
with me either.

533
01:04:46,692 --> 01:04:49,052
What's your price?

534
01:04:51,612 --> 01:04:53,372
I have no price.

535
01:04:54,171 --> 01:04:55,772
Like with the tip.

536
01:04:57,051 --> 01:05:02,971
I won't tell anyone.
I'll work with you, if you like.

537
01:05:03,732 --> 01:05:07,771
Sell everything and come here
to study the lions.

538
01:05:07,931 --> 01:05:11,371
You've never had 12,000 employees.

539
01:05:11,531 --> 01:05:14,090
Is it true what the newspapers write?

540
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:16,411
There's something wrong.

541
01:05:16,571 --> 01:05:22,730
People often go missing at sea
to reappear years later.

542
01:05:23,171 --> 01:05:25,530
Do you know of an island
without telephone?

543
01:05:25,691 --> 01:05:28,890
Just say you got a mast against
your head...

544
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:32,570
and have been suffering
from amnesia.

545
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:37,369
Are you an author or a barman?
-I said it to help you.

546
01:05:38,569 --> 01:05:40,489
Have you got any family?

547
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:43,129
My father and sister.
-What do they do?

548
01:05:43,249 --> 01:05:45,929
They have a hotel.

549
01:05:46,649 --> 01:05:48,649
Well...

550
01:05:48,809 --> 01:05:50,809
There's hotels and hotels.

551
01:05:52,809 --> 01:05:56,809
I can understand you wanted to abandon
12,000 employees.

552
01:05:56,969 --> 01:06:02,328
I can also understand you wanted to
abandon your wife or wives.

553
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:06,648
I can understand all that.

554
01:06:06,768 --> 01:06:11,368
But I can't understand how you could
abandon your children.

555
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:17,448
You're driving too fast, sir.

556
01:06:20,087 --> 01:06:22,568
Where are we going?

557
01:06:25,168 --> 01:06:27,687
Where?
-To my children.

558
01:06:44,566 --> 01:06:50,887
'It would be a pleasure to work with 
you
if you come back to France.

559
01:06:51,046 --> 01:06:56,406
I'm asking you because of your youth,
your talent and your success in 
Canada.

560
01:06:56,566 --> 01:07:00,966
And also because I can see many
similarities between you and me.

561
01:07:01,126 --> 01:07:07,046
Our company needs a man like you.
I hope to welcome you soon.

562
01:07:07,206 --> 01:07:08,805
Sam Lion. '

563
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:13,845
So you're the last person to see
my father?

564
01:07:14,005 --> 01:07:18,725
At least, I'm the last person
to have dined with him.

565
01:07:18,885 --> 01:07:21,045
How did you get to know him?

566
01:07:21,165 --> 01:07:25,925
He contacted me because I had
a similar company as he.

567
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,845
In Canada. Montreal.

568
01:07:28,004 --> 01:07:30,965
And why did you leave Canada?

569
01:07:32,084 --> 01:07:35,844
I was homesick.
France will always be France.

570
01:07:36,005 --> 01:07:38,324
Of course.

571
01:07:38,484 --> 01:07:42,244
The letter, the handwriting...
It affects me.

572
01:07:45,444 --> 01:07:46,804
And?

573
01:08:01,043 --> 01:08:06,162
Once I brought up the circus,
all doors opened up.

574
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:10,482
And Jean-Philippe?
-He asked when you wrote the letter.

575
01:08:10,643 --> 01:08:15,202
Just before you sailed off,
I said.

576
01:08:15,363 --> 01:08:19,922
We had had dinner,
just like you told me.

577
01:08:20,082 --> 01:08:26,122
We talked business and just before you
left, you gave me the letter.

578
01:08:26,322 --> 01:08:29,762
Did you tell him the way
you're telling me now?

579
01:08:29,882 --> 01:08:32,122
Yes, but I was...
-More at ease.

580
01:08:32,321 --> 01:08:34,881
Yes, completely at ease.

581
01:08:35,762 --> 01:08:39,122
Did you understand why the company's
doing so bad?

582
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:43,281
I tried to find out more.

583
01:08:43,441 --> 01:08:47,201
He explained things to me,
but it was very technical.

584
01:08:47,361 --> 01:08:51,361
I don't think I completely
understood him.

585
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:56,800
He talked about debts the company
had when you died.

586
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,321
Debts?

587
01:09:03,640 --> 01:09:07,440
Go away. I'll explain.

588
01:09:10,839 --> 01:09:14,240
We have to play it very safe.

589
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,399
Are you ready?

590
01:09:20,119 --> 01:09:22,800
What do you mean, safe?

591
01:09:22,959 --> 01:09:28,639
From now on, don't do or say
anything without talking to me first.

592
01:09:28,799 --> 01:09:33,758
Within half a year,
you'll be a captain of industry.

593
01:09:35,558 --> 01:09:40,598
You'll have to wear another suit.
Pinstripe suits are out.

594
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:46,598
Tomorrow, you'll get a room
in the city.

595
01:09:46,758 --> 01:09:49,758
In a fancy hotel.

596
01:09:50,558 --> 01:09:51,918
Four stars.

597
01:09:52,598 --> 01:09:55,678
But you have to learn to say hello.
-Excuse me?

598
01:09:55,837 --> 01:10:01,198
Saying hello properly is one
of the most important things in life.

599
01:10:01,357 --> 01:10:05,278
It's half the job.

600
01:10:05,758 --> 01:10:08,557
Say hello to me.

601
01:10:08,757 --> 01:10:11,117
No, with conviction.

602
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:18,077
Say hello as if I'm ill.

603
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:21,677
Again.

604
01:10:23,277 --> 01:10:28,476
Now, I feel you're more interested in
me than in yourself.

605
01:10:28,596 --> 01:10:33,196
People prefer that you talk about 
them,
rather than about yourself.

606
01:10:36,036 --> 01:10:37,835
Say hello again.

607
01:10:40,115 --> 01:10:43,556
That wasn't good. I noticed it.

608
01:10:45,035 --> 01:10:48,555
You can feel it yourself now, right?

609
01:10:48,716 --> 01:10:53,355
Can I smile?
-As long as it's with compassion.

610
01:10:54,675 --> 01:10:57,195
Don't smile too hard.

611
01:10:57,355 --> 01:11:02,115
You'll often be confronted with
things you don't know.

612
01:11:02,314 --> 01:11:04,635
Pretend you know them.

613
01:11:04,875 --> 01:11:09,115
The best way to suggest you know
everything...

614
01:11:09,274 --> 01:11:12,074
is to never show surprise.

615
01:11:13,554 --> 01:11:14,874
Understood?

616
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:18,954
You often show surprise.
That's your weakness.

617
01:11:21,954 --> 01:11:25,034
We'll do a test.

618
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:29,553
I'll say a few things and
you can't look surprised.

619
01:11:31,074 --> 01:11:32,553
Understood?

620
01:11:32,713 --> 01:11:34,953
Concentrate.

621
01:11:37,273 --> 01:11:42,313
Did you know your father used to get 
it
on with the petrol station attendant?

622
01:11:45,673 --> 01:11:48,872
I don't want to see surprise.
-Yes, but that...

623
01:11:48,992 --> 01:11:52,553
You just can't show surprise.

624
01:11:52,673 --> 01:11:55,352
Imagine your father
with the petrol station attendant.

625
01:11:55,512 --> 01:11:57,752
There you go again.
-Another example.

626
01:11:57,872 --> 01:12:00,872
It's a gripping example.
-It is.

627
01:12:00,992 --> 01:12:03,352
Concentrate.

628
01:12:05,352 --> 01:12:07,752
You look like Jesus.

629
01:12:08,392 --> 01:12:10,591
You're doing it again.

630
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:13,672
Can't I do anything?
-No, nothing.

631
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:18,151
Look into the distance.
-Absent-minded?

632
01:12:18,311 --> 01:12:20,391
Not too much. Nothing.

633
01:12:25,511 --> 01:12:28,311
Yes?
-Go on then because I...

634
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:32,110
Now I see surprise because
I'm not saying anything.

635
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:37,750
I'd be surprised.
I did exactly as you said.

636
01:12:37,911 --> 01:12:40,030
I like you.

637
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:45,070
I don't know if...
-That's surprising.

638
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:49,030
Is this still part of the test or...
-Of course.

639
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:52,550
But you said...
-Don't let it surprise you.

640
01:12:52,670 --> 01:12:55,589
Alright. Are you religious?

641
01:12:55,749 --> 01:12:59,750
I don't know.

642
01:12:59,869 --> 01:13:06,109
To my son, you're deeply religious.
To my daughter, you're an atheist.

643
01:13:06,309 --> 01:13:10,389
And to you?
-I only believe in mathematics.

644
01:13:10,549 --> 01:13:12,868
We get what we deserve.

645
01:13:15,428 --> 01:13:19,429
Do I deserve to be here with you?

646
01:13:20,548 --> 01:13:22,788
I'm starting to think so.

647
01:13:24,628 --> 01:13:26,028
There he is.

648
01:13:30,668 --> 01:13:32,108
Say hello.

649
01:13:35,787 --> 01:13:37,188
Coffee?

650
01:13:38,388 --> 01:13:40,147
Did you sleep well?

651
01:13:42,067 --> 01:13:45,187
You get used to it.

652
01:13:45,507 --> 01:13:47,907
Look, nice and fresh.

653
01:13:48,587 --> 01:13:51,506
Do you still want to give us a hand?
-Of course.

654
01:13:51,626 --> 01:13:56,227
She'll show you around.
I'm going to the pump.

655
01:13:57,067 --> 01:14:01,266
What did you do in Belgium?
-I was with the circus.

656
01:14:01,427 --> 01:14:05,906
I love the circus.
-I was only a bookkeeper.

657
01:14:06,026 --> 01:14:11,266
Will you stay for long?
-Until I get a work permit.

658
01:14:11,426 --> 01:14:13,026
Has Alex left yet?

659
01:14:13,186 --> 01:14:16,705
I hope he'll be successful for once.

660
01:14:17,665 --> 01:14:22,385
You have to go and buy stuff.
We're out of things.

661
01:14:22,546 --> 01:14:28,105
Did it use to look like that?
-Yes, we were almost in the woods.

662
01:14:34,385 --> 01:14:37,265
I'm here for Mr Jean-Philippe Lion.

663
01:14:37,425 --> 01:14:39,425
Mr Duvivier for you.

664
01:14:42,105 --> 01:14:43,905
My sister, Victoria.

665
01:14:44,664 --> 01:14:50,624
Mr Verne, our notary.
An old friend, who'll do the talking.

666
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:53,584
In which part of Canada were you?

667
01:14:53,744 --> 01:14:58,943
The factories were up north.
The office was in Montreal.

668
01:14:59,063 --> 01:15:04,943
Beautiful country. Our company's
about to be taken over.

669
01:15:05,103 --> 01:15:09,663
You understand we can't
hire you.

670
01:15:09,823 --> 01:15:15,543
I'm prepared to accept a trial
period.

671
01:15:15,663 --> 01:15:18,943
At no expense.

672
01:15:19,663 --> 01:15:21,823
That's very friendly.

673
01:15:21,943 --> 01:15:26,102
But we have more problems,
that we can't talk about.

674
01:15:26,302 --> 01:15:28,543
Can I say something?

675
01:15:28,663 --> 01:15:33,542
When you saw dad,
was he alright?

676
01:15:33,662 --> 01:15:38,541
Yes, he's fine. Was fine.
-My sister asks because...

677
01:15:38,702 --> 01:15:42,582
when he left,
he was very tired and depressed.

678
01:15:42,741 --> 01:15:46,701
We even thought of suicide.
-Not at all.

679
01:15:46,861 --> 01:15:51,181
Your father's... was
in good shape...

680
01:15:51,342 --> 01:15:55,661
both physically and mentally.
So don't worry.

681
01:15:57,341 --> 01:16:00,301
You don't agree to a trial period?

682
01:16:00,461 --> 01:16:04,220
We do...
-No, Victoria.

683
01:16:04,501 --> 01:16:08,861
I consider that letter to be
dad's last instructions.

684
01:16:09,020 --> 01:16:11,981
Of course.

685
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:19,100
I'll let you talk amongst yourselves.

686
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:23,260
I'll say hello. I mean goodbye.
I'm jetlagged.

687
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,739
See you soon.

688
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:30,059
I'll show you out.

689
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:36,699
How's your mother?
-Fine.

690
01:16:36,859 --> 01:16:39,739
And little Sam?
-All fine.

691
01:16:50,499 --> 01:16:53,898
Sorry, but it failed.

692
01:16:54,058 --> 01:16:58,298
I did what I could,
but they didn't want it.

693
01:16:58,498 --> 01:17:02,298
Your son and daughter
agreed, but...

694
01:17:02,458 --> 01:17:05,258
the notary was completely against it.

695
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:11,098
He said they're firing people at the
moment and can't hire anyone.

696
01:17:12,977 --> 01:17:14,858
Sit down.

697
01:17:15,017 --> 01:17:20,857
The notary seemed to be in charge.

698
01:17:23,617 --> 01:17:29,737
I did exactly what you said.
I never showed any surprise.

699
01:17:29,896 --> 01:17:33,496
That notary's starting to
surprise me.

700
01:17:33,616 --> 01:17:37,016
Really? I was also surprised...

701
01:17:37,177 --> 01:17:40,536
but I didn't show it.

702
01:17:49,536 --> 01:17:51,735
What are you doing there?

703
01:17:51,855 --> 01:17:55,255
I haven't been able to
explain everything.

704
01:17:55,416 --> 01:18:00,615
When I dined with Sam Lion in 
New-York,
just before his departure...

705
01:18:00,775 --> 01:18:03,575
he gave me the letter
of recommendation...

706
01:18:03,735 --> 01:18:09,535
and also a suitcase with important
documents.

707
01:18:09,655 --> 01:18:14,054
He made a last minute decision not to
take it with him.

708
01:18:14,935 --> 01:18:19,814
Check his face to see
how he takes that information.

709
01:18:19,934 --> 01:18:25,734
If he seems worried, you're
on the right track. Keep going.

710
01:18:25,854 --> 01:18:31,333
One of those documents is a copy of
his last will.

711
01:18:31,534 --> 01:18:35,734
Some manipulation seems to have
occurred between...

712
01:18:35,893 --> 01:18:39,053
what the document says
and the beneficiaries.

713
01:18:39,814 --> 01:18:43,093
When he starts thinking and becomes
curious...

714
01:18:43,253 --> 01:18:47,053
he'll no doubt continue the
conversation himself.

715
01:18:47,173 --> 01:18:48,773
I'm listening.

716
01:18:51,533 --> 01:18:53,573
This is my proposition...

717
01:18:53,733 --> 01:18:57,012
You do everything I say...

718
01:18:57,173 --> 01:19:00,292
or I'll show the documents to
the parties involved.

719
01:19:00,453 --> 01:19:02,572
He won't speak for a long time.

720
01:19:02,733 --> 01:19:08,132
Then he'll say those documents are
false and you're blackmailing him...

721
01:19:08,292 --> 01:19:13,172
that you're a fraud.
-You want to blackmail me.

722
01:19:13,332 --> 01:19:17,012
Those papers must be false.
-Perfect...

723
01:19:17,171 --> 01:19:22,292
Then you stay silent even longer.
Keep looking him in the eye...

724
01:19:22,451 --> 01:19:26,771
without blinking and without
showing any surprise.

725
01:19:26,931 --> 01:19:32,691
That way you'll scare him. It's all
in the eyes, And then you'll say:

726
01:19:33,611 --> 01:19:38,530
Then the children will have to choose
between a blackmailer and a crook.

727
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:42,530
You'll see him regain some hope.

728
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:45,331
And he'll try something else.

729
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:51,250
A blackmailer and a crook...
may go well together.

730
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:56,770
If he wants to collaborate, that's it.
Don't say anything but look...

731
01:19:56,930 --> 01:20:01,410
the way Elliott Ness looked when
Al Capone wanted to bribe him...

732
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:03,729
and wait until he bows his head.

733
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:11,329
Maybe he'll raise his head for a 
moment
like a floored boxer.

734
01:20:11,489 --> 01:20:16,529
Look him in the eye.
And then knock him out.

735
01:20:18,529 --> 01:20:22,849
He seems like a fine man.
A great man.

736
01:20:23,009 --> 01:20:26,088
Your father really wanted him.

737
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:28,928
A rara avis.

738
01:20:29,048 --> 01:20:33,048
If he sings as well as
he looks...

739
01:20:33,168 --> 01:20:37,008
it would be stupid not to use him.

740
01:20:37,168 --> 01:20:39,088
What do you think?

741
01:20:39,248 --> 01:20:43,248
When I saw the letter,
I agreed right away.

742
01:20:43,408 --> 01:20:48,287
And since I wanted to slow down a bit,
this is the moment.

743
01:20:48,487 --> 01:20:52,687
Never hint at the notary's
embezzling.

744
01:20:52,847 --> 01:20:58,287
This is an impressive office.
Can I look around?

745
01:20:58,487 --> 01:21:01,527
Treat Jean-Philippe very
carefully.

746
01:21:01,647 --> 01:21:05,886
Dad must have told you about
his love of the circus.

747
01:21:06,047 --> 01:21:12,846
He wanted to turn his office into
a circus museum. Not very functional.

748
01:21:13,006 --> 01:21:18,286
Never go against Jean-Philippe.
He has a passion for architecture.

749
01:21:18,486 --> 01:21:21,646
He told me a lot about his
passion for lions.

750
01:21:21,766 --> 01:21:25,085
Yes, lions were his big passion.

751
01:21:25,246 --> 01:21:31,245
What I hate about this type
of architecture...

752
01:21:31,406 --> 01:21:36,285
is that there is no separation between
the workers and the board.

753
01:21:36,485 --> 01:21:40,085
That's the circus, the team spirit.

754
01:21:40,285 --> 01:21:44,925
My father always said: a boss has to 
be
able to see what the personnel are 
doing.

755
01:21:45,045 --> 01:21:48,525
and the personnel always have to know
where the boss is.

756
01:21:48,645 --> 01:21:51,884
He's got a point.
-But it's impractical.

757
01:21:52,045 --> 01:21:55,165
Yes, you're right.

758
01:21:56,605 --> 01:21:59,484
Then you'll be assigned an office.

759
01:21:59,604 --> 01:22:03,724
When you're alone, call me.
If he asks where you live...

760
01:22:03,844 --> 01:22:07,244
Where do you live?
-Since I came back from Canada...

761
01:22:07,404 --> 01:22:12,524
I've been staying with my dad, outside
of Paris. It's quiet.

762
01:22:13,683 --> 01:22:17,323
Telephone.
-I'll take it there.

763
01:22:17,484 --> 01:22:19,524
Here, you do it.

764
01:22:28,123 --> 01:22:31,403
Ask for the balance sheets
of the past three years...

765
01:22:31,562 --> 01:22:34,123
with all the corresponding documents.

766
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:39,962
Or else you won't make any decision.
Bring them tonight.

767
01:22:49,042 --> 01:22:52,201
It went fine with your son.
Better than with your daughter.

768
01:22:52,362 --> 01:22:58,361
A list of urgent things.
Give it to my secretary.

769
01:22:59,161 --> 01:23:02,281
When I call and you can't speak,
cough.

770
01:23:02,482 --> 01:23:06,441
Always ask for time to think.

771
01:23:06,561 --> 01:23:09,801
Bring your portable phone.

772
01:23:09,961 --> 01:23:14,561
You have to explain this.
-We've got all night.

773
01:23:14,721 --> 01:23:19,720
Did you ask my secretary to find
you a room? -Yes.

774
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,280
Did you discuss your salary?
-Yes, I told them what you told me.

775
01:23:24,441 --> 01:23:29,080
I keep saying to Jean-Philippe
that we'll discuss it later.

776
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:33,479
About my son...

777
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:38,480
It's normal that he's
nice to you.

778
01:23:41,159 --> 01:23:45,719
He's always nice to young people.

779
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:55,479
By the way, tell your father not
to eavesdrop.

780
01:23:55,599 --> 01:23:58,759
Or ask him to help us.

781
01:23:58,879 --> 01:24:01,478
Can we get some too?

782
01:24:01,598 --> 01:24:02,998
Telephone.

783
01:24:36,437 --> 01:24:38,197
Are you available for dinner tonight?

784
01:24:41,237 --> 01:24:44,276
Such a smart computer
can't be wrong.

785
01:24:44,436 --> 01:24:50,036
Ask for a printed copy.
We have to be on top of this.

786
01:24:50,196 --> 01:24:52,676
Take your time. I'm busy.

787
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:59,236
That gives me an excuse not to go 
tonight.
I'm coming over.

788
01:25:01,236 --> 01:25:04,836
Am I interrupting?
-Not at all. Come in.

789
01:25:04,956 --> 01:25:11,315
My mother wants to meet you.
She's inviting you to dinner.

790
01:25:11,476 --> 01:25:14,355
I'd love to, thanks.

791
01:25:14,515 --> 01:25:16,515
Is tonight alright?

792
01:25:16,675 --> 01:25:22,355
Tonight's difficult, because
there's a problem in South America.

793
01:25:22,515 --> 01:25:27,634
I have to see him...
I have to read all the files.

794
01:25:27,754 --> 01:25:32,994
I'll see if I can cancel my dinner.
Have a seat.

795
01:25:33,154 --> 01:25:35,634
I'll be right back.

796
01:25:37,234 --> 01:25:41,394
Anything wrong?
-No, I'm going with Jean-Philippe.

797
01:25:42,434 --> 01:25:44,753
Dad's hat?
-I'm always wearing it.

798
01:25:44,914 --> 01:25:47,393
How's mum?
-She's nostalgic.

799
01:25:47,513 --> 01:25:49,793
That's her.
-I know.

800
01:25:53,673 --> 01:25:58,073
I couldn't cancel the dinner.
So I can't tonight.

801
01:25:58,273 --> 01:26:03,153
But some time next week's fine.
-We'll do that then.

802
01:26:03,313 --> 01:26:07,513
I also wanted to thank you
for everything you're doing for us.

803
01:26:07,633 --> 01:26:11,072
It's nothing special.

804
01:26:11,233 --> 01:26:15,032
Dad would be very jealous
if he saw you.

805
01:26:16,072 --> 01:26:21,872
I understand he liked you.
-You're impressive too.

806
01:26:22,032 --> 01:26:27,231
You still dress the same way.

807
01:26:27,392 --> 01:26:31,232
How do you know?
-I know all about you.

808
01:26:31,392 --> 01:26:34,752
He tells me things every day. Told me.

809
01:26:34,872 --> 01:26:37,872
He told me about you each night.

810
01:26:40,631 --> 01:26:44,831
You're a bit like him.
-Do you think?

811
01:26:44,951 --> 01:26:46,831
Not physically...

812
01:26:48,710 --> 01:26:52,351
but your attitude,
your boldness.

813
01:26:52,511 --> 01:26:57,390
The way you greet people, how calm
you are, things like that.

814
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:04,550
Have a seat. I'll try one more time
to cancel my dinner.

815
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:06,430
I'll be right back.

816
01:27:10,189 --> 01:27:15,509
Do I have to continue to pretend?
-When I say no, it's no.

817
01:27:15,629 --> 01:27:21,029
They keep talking about you.
You're still important in their lives.

818
01:27:21,229 --> 01:27:23,629
That's why I left.

819
01:27:23,789 --> 01:27:26,189
Do you still not understand?

820
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:32,109
I noticed that your daughter...

821
01:27:32,268 --> 01:27:34,269
is a bit like you.

822
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:41,548
You should really consider
going back to them.

823
01:27:41,668 --> 01:27:44,908
If I wanted that,
I wouldn't go through all this 
trouble.

824
01:27:46,268 --> 01:27:51,947
They're not biting today.
-We're not forced to fish either.

825
01:27:52,108 --> 01:27:54,587
Alright, I'll go.

826
01:28:07,987 --> 01:28:12,267
You spend lots of money on
unnecessary things.

827
01:28:12,427 --> 01:28:18,027
And you don't keep check of
your expenses, That's not good.

828
01:28:18,187 --> 01:28:24,586
And the way you chase the personnel.
I'm embarrassed.

829
01:28:26,266 --> 01:28:28,186
Is that all?
-No.

830
01:28:28,346 --> 01:28:33,706
Al's fed up with the hotel and
wants to live in dad's caravan.

831
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:39,465
Can I come in?
-Make yourself at home.

832
01:28:39,626 --> 01:28:44,185
This is your house now. Not very
nice, this close to work.

833
01:28:44,346 --> 01:28:48,825
Didn't your dad like it?
-Yes, but he loved the circus.

834
01:28:48,945 --> 01:28:52,265
Don't you?
-No, I hate it.

835
01:28:52,425 --> 01:28:56,825
I'm surprised. Your sister
loves it, I believe.

836
01:28:56,945 --> 01:28:58,424
Yes, she does.

837
01:29:02,185 --> 01:29:04,985
Is it on tonight?

838
01:29:05,984 --> 01:29:08,424
Tonight? Oh, tonight.

839
01:29:11,144 --> 01:29:16,424
I wanted to say I'm happy about
how we work together.

840
01:29:16,584 --> 01:29:19,144
We're a very good team.

841
01:29:19,303 --> 01:29:25,943
It seems best to me to
keep it strictly business.

842
01:29:29,704 --> 01:29:31,943
I'm here, Jean-Philippe.

843
01:29:32,103 --> 01:29:35,863
Oh, is it you?
-I wanted to know if you're alright.

844
01:29:36,023 --> 01:29:42,183
This is a very luxurious
caravan. I'm very grateful.

845
01:29:43,223 --> 01:29:45,543
I'll be off then.

846
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:34,820
What do you think of him?
-Strapping.

847
01:30:34,981 --> 01:30:37,940
I like blacks who are
really black.

848
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,780
He is.

849
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:48,740
We're in a very difficult
situation.

850
01:30:53,299 --> 01:30:57,379
Goal. Yes, goal.

851
01:30:57,539 --> 01:30:59,139
You're kidding me.

852
01:31:04,579 --> 01:31:08,419
There are some bad things
happening here.

853
01:31:08,579 --> 01:31:13,298
You're having fun, but I'm not
having fun with your computers.

854
01:31:20,498 --> 01:31:24,338
This is a misunderstanding.
It's not my birthday today.

855
01:31:24,498 --> 01:31:28,578
This is because you've been
with us for a year.

856
01:31:28,698 --> 01:31:32,578
That's nice of you.
Shall I blow the candle?

857
01:31:35,537 --> 01:31:38,017
There's something else.
-Where are we going?

858
01:31:38,177 --> 01:31:40,817
With a birthday comes a present.

859
01:31:40,977 --> 01:31:44,017
Dad loves old-timers.

860
01:31:44,177 --> 01:31:47,537
We want to give you one.
-You can't.

861
01:31:47,657 --> 01:31:50,016
Choose one.

862
01:31:50,177 --> 01:31:52,817
No, you can't.
-Yes.

863
01:31:52,977 --> 01:31:58,336
You love those cars.
I can't accept it.

864
01:31:58,497 --> 01:32:03,696
I couldn't choose anyway.
They're all beautiful.

865
01:32:03,816 --> 01:32:09,695
I wouldn't know. I'll just
pick the closest one.

866
01:32:10,816 --> 01:32:14,816
I'm speechless.
-Dad once put it very well:

867
01:32:14,936 --> 01:32:20,096
Never give someone a present that
you don't love yourself.

868
01:32:20,255 --> 01:32:25,855
I'm driving a car that used to belong
to Sugar Ray Robinson. Unbelievable.

869
01:32:25,975 --> 01:32:28,655
I'd like to have lunch together.

870
01:32:29,775 --> 01:32:34,095
I'd rather have dinner with you.
-That's alright too.

871
01:32:34,255 --> 01:32:40,015
I'll introduce you to someone
who might become important to me.

872
01:32:40,174 --> 01:32:44,974
Since you've taken over dad's role,
I want to hear your opinion.

873
01:32:45,134 --> 01:32:51,614
Are you planning on getting married?
-Yes, if he agrees.

874
01:32:51,734 --> 01:32:56,174
If he agrees?
Why not?

875
01:33:26,693 --> 01:33:31,612
I don't know who it is.
She'll introduce me to him.

876
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:34,652
It's simple: if he's ok, you approve.

877
01:33:34,812 --> 01:33:39,372
And if not, I reject him?
-Of course.

878
01:33:39,532 --> 01:33:43,612
Talking about marriage.
Céline's getting married today.

879
01:34:10,251 --> 01:34:13,290
A beautiful car, isn't it?

880
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:16,810
Beautiful family.
-Yes, they're nice.

881
01:34:18,809 --> 01:34:21,050
Is something wrong?

882
01:34:22,409 --> 01:34:27,290
Family makes you think of family.
-That's true.

883
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:30,329
But why do you say that?

884
01:34:31,370 --> 01:34:34,009
I'd like to see them again.

885
01:34:34,169 --> 01:34:35,609
Just once.

886
01:34:38,009 --> 01:34:39,449
Once.

887
01:34:42,409 --> 01:34:44,569
How did you end up here?

888
01:34:44,728 --> 01:34:51,448
I was here for work and I was
almost out of petrol.

889
01:34:51,608 --> 01:34:57,128
I saw this petrol station attendant 
who
looks just like your dad.

890
01:34:57,288 --> 01:35:01,288
Everyone has a double.
-Exactly.

891
01:35:01,448 --> 01:35:05,367
He's not a real copy of your
father, of course.

892
01:35:22,167 --> 01:35:24,487
That's a nice ride.

893
01:35:25,526 --> 01:35:27,847
Perfect.

894
01:35:34,886 --> 01:35:36,326
Where's the hole?

895
01:35:38,246 --> 01:35:41,206
It's well hidden.

896
01:35:42,566 --> 01:35:47,125
They don't make them like this 
anymore.
-It's from'57-'58.

897
01:35:47,286 --> 01:35:50,886
It used to belong to Sugar Ray
Robinson, the boxer.

898
01:35:51,006 --> 01:35:57,526
You had La Motta and Dauthuille.
I remember Dauthuille well.

899
01:35:57,685 --> 01:35:59,925
Graziano was the world champion.

900
01:36:00,085 --> 01:36:05,685
He never gave up. Always attacked.
Bang, and down.

901
01:36:05,845 --> 01:36:11,285
I've seen Robinson box against Big 
Man.
Ray was good...

902
01:36:11,445 --> 01:36:16,564
and he had a good left hook...

903
01:36:16,684 --> 01:36:21,524
but he didn't cut it.
Not enough stamina.

904
01:36:23,884 --> 01:36:27,844
Striking, isn't it?
-Yes, unbelievable.

905
01:36:28,964 --> 01:36:33,844
He doesn't really look like him,
but it's how he acts.

906
01:36:33,964 --> 01:36:36,083
And Max Schmeling...

907
01:36:36,243 --> 01:36:42,403
he was very fast. The way
he'd come back with a left hook.

908
01:36:42,563 --> 01:36:48,323
He was younger. But he'd look a bit
like this now.

909
01:36:48,483 --> 01:36:54,883
Did anyone ever tell you, you look
a lot like Sam Lion?

910
01:36:55,003 --> 01:36:57,763
How's that?
-Sam Lion.

911
01:36:57,883 --> 01:37:02,642
What weight category?
-No, a business man.

912
01:37:02,762 --> 01:37:06,642
A business man? Me? No, kid.

913
01:37:06,762 --> 01:37:09,122
That's full again.

914
01:37:10,562 --> 01:37:15,362
That's 400 francs.
Yes, it's a guzzler.

915
01:37:15,522 --> 01:37:20,562
500, I have to change that.
-No, never mind.

916
01:37:20,682 --> 01:37:24,641
Well, thanks. You're as generous
as Robinson.

917
01:37:24,801 --> 01:37:29,841
Could you do the windscreen?
-Of course, that's part of the job.

918
01:37:33,041 --> 01:37:39,041
For that money, I'd polish
your shoes.

919
01:37:41,441 --> 01:37:44,160
That lady has beautiful eyes.

920
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:53,120
One moment. If you're in
a hurry, do it yourself.

921
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:57,360
It's true...
strong as a bear.

922
01:38:07,599 --> 01:38:09,519
I don't mean it in a bad way...

923
01:38:09,639 --> 01:38:14,799
but I get the impression your fiancé's
not very polite.

924
01:38:14,919 --> 01:38:17,039
He's always very punctual.

925
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:21,119
There are always exceptions
to the rule.

926
01:38:21,279 --> 01:38:24,639
He's also very special.

927
01:38:24,798 --> 01:38:30,398
Wait, this is wrong.
You're influencing the jury.

928
01:38:32,238 --> 01:38:36,558
I'll admit it.
I tricked you.

929
01:38:36,678 --> 01:38:40,637
He's been here for a while.
He was exactly on time.

930
01:38:42,158 --> 01:38:45,437
Is he in the restaurant?

931
01:38:47,198 --> 01:38:48,957
At this table even.

932
01:38:49,118 --> 01:38:51,997
What's that?
-He's at this table.

933
01:38:55,597 --> 01:38:57,917
Do you mean that...
-Yes.

934
01:38:59,437 --> 01:39:03,037
Am I dreaming or do you really
want to marry me?

935
01:39:04,156 --> 01:39:06,877
Only if you agree.

936
01:39:14,796 --> 01:39:18,156
Careful, I might say yes.

937
01:39:18,316 --> 01:39:20,475
Say yes then.

938
01:39:21,516 --> 01:39:26,316
I can't.
I'd want to but...

939
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:32,875
I have to make a phone call...
right away.

940
01:39:34,235 --> 01:39:37,115
I have to tell my dad.

941
01:39:41,834 --> 01:39:48,155
I'm very happy. I don't show it,
because I'm surprised.

942
01:39:48,314 --> 01:39:50,234
But I'm very happy.

943
01:39:50,394 --> 01:39:52,874
Mr Duvivier.
-That's me.

944
01:39:52,994 --> 01:39:56,714
Will you accept my daughter
as your daughter-in-law?

945
01:39:56,874 --> 01:39:58,394
Why do you say that?

946
01:39:58,554 --> 01:40:04,393
You're son's having dinner with my
daughter and she's proposing to him.

947
01:40:04,554 --> 01:40:06,073
Your daughter?
-Yes.

948
01:40:12,394 --> 01:40:17,353
And your son's about to call me and
ask my permission.

949
01:40:17,513 --> 01:40:19,993
And you want my permission?

950
01:40:21,113 --> 01:40:23,833
Is your daughter a serious girl?

951
01:40:33,753 --> 01:40:38,472
Your daughter was going to introduce
me to her fiancé tonight.

952
01:40:38,632 --> 01:40:41,912
The problem is that I'm the fiancé.

953
01:40:42,072 --> 01:40:46,631
You're both adults,
so do what you want.

954
01:40:47,831 --> 01:40:53,511
Aren't you surprised?
-Of course, I'm surprised.

955
01:40:55,112 --> 01:40:58,631
Very surprised even.
And I only have one daughter.

956
01:40:58,751 --> 01:41:02,151
Alright. Talk to you later.

957
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:27,670
Do you know where she went?
-Maybe to the ladies.

958
01:42:55,266 --> 01:42:56,705
I'll close.

959
01:42:58,906 --> 01:43:01,666
What are you doing here?
-And you?

960
01:43:02,705 --> 01:43:04,625
That's my hat.

961
01:43:21,585 --> 01:43:24,865
Are you alone?

962
01:43:24,985 --> 01:43:30,625
Where's Victoria?
-I thought she'd be here.

963
01:43:30,784 --> 01:43:35,024
Isn't she here?
-No. Weren't you having dinner 
together?

964
01:43:35,184 --> 01:43:37,904
Yes, we had started.

965
01:43:38,064 --> 01:43:43,023
Didn't she ask you to marry her?
-Yes, You knew about it?

966
01:43:43,184 --> 01:43:47,424
Everyone did.
-I only heard about it tonight.

967
01:43:48,223 --> 01:43:52,623
It's crazy.

968
01:43:52,743 --> 01:43:55,663
I've always been a bit crazy.

969
01:43:56,663 --> 01:44:04,622
And you live here?
-Yes, it's a bit like a circus.

970
01:44:04,823 --> 01:44:07,583
And you let me marry a clown?

971
01:44:07,703 --> 01:44:10,142
Don't you like him?
-Yes.

972
01:44:11,183 --> 01:44:18,062
I liked him for what you made him do.
-What he did was the hardest thing.

973
01:44:18,222 --> 01:44:20,542
And you didn't make a mistake.

974
01:44:23,941 --> 01:44:27,582
Did you have fun the past two years?

975
01:44:28,582 --> 01:44:33,901
That's hard with so many memories.
-Why then?

976
01:44:34,901 --> 01:44:40,141
I wanted to take a shortcut,
but I got lost.

977
01:44:41,501 --> 01:44:47,501
What do we do now?
-Find him quickly. And call me.

978
01:44:59,620 --> 01:45:02,620
Where is she?
-She left again.

979
01:45:05,099 --> 01:45:07,499
Can I talk to you?
-Go ahead.

980
01:45:07,619 --> 01:45:10,060
No, not here.
Not here anymore.

981
01:45:15,819 --> 01:45:17,819
Was this it?
-Yes.

982
01:45:17,939 --> 01:45:19,899
Are you sure?
-Yes.

983
01:45:20,059 --> 01:45:23,899
Now she knows.
-Listen.

984
01:45:24,059 --> 01:45:26,379
I'm not listening.

985
01:45:26,539 --> 01:45:32,539
I'll get worked up when I want.
It's over. Finished.

986
01:45:32,659 --> 01:45:39,898
Now I want to say something.
You listen to me for a change.

987
01:45:42,218 --> 01:45:45,418
Do you know what you are?

988
01:45:46,458 --> 01:45:51,578
A spoiled child that breaks its toys.
Your wives...

989
01:45:51,698 --> 01:45:53,337
your children, your company.

990
01:45:53,498 --> 01:45:57,817
And now you're destroying me,
but you won't succeed.

991
01:45:57,937 --> 01:46:01,098
You taught me to be strong.

992
01:46:01,257 --> 01:46:03,897
What are you thinking?

993
01:46:04,057 --> 01:46:08,937
That you're the only one who dares
stand in front of a lion?

994
01:46:12,217 --> 01:46:14,456
Come on.

995
01:46:16,457 --> 01:46:21,977
Do you think you're the only one who
dares stand in front of a lion?

996
01:46:25,976 --> 01:46:28,776
He's learning fast.
-He's getting there.

997
01:46:28,936 --> 01:46:30,296
He's doing well.

998
01:46:47,615 --> 01:46:50,455
Dad, it's me.

999
01:46:50,615 --> 01:46:54,615
He's not in the caravan, not in
the office. He's nowhere.

1000
01:46:54,735 --> 01:47:00,934
He'll be back. In a bad mood,
but he'll be back.

1001
01:47:01,095 --> 01:47:04,534
Call me when he arrives.
Talk to you later.

1002
01:47:09,254 --> 01:47:13,414
Some days, I don't understand...

1003
01:47:17,093 --> 01:47:19,493
Shall we have a drink?

1004
01:47:49,332 --> 01:47:54,772
He's still not here.
I was in the caravan all this time.

1005
01:47:54,932 --> 01:47:58,212
He'll be there.
-It's almost five.

1006
01:47:58,371 --> 01:48:00,291
Did you call him in his car?

1007
01:48:00,452 --> 01:48:03,572
Do that and call me back.

1008
01:48:05,251 --> 01:48:08,532
Don't talk to anyone.
-I promise.

1009
01:48:08,652 --> 01:48:12,291
Bye. I love you, dad.

1010
01:48:15,771 --> 01:48:17,811
Where's that asshole?

1011
01:49:30,767 --> 01:49:35,087
Al, what are you doing?
Where are you?

1012
01:49:36,687 --> 01:49:39,967
I'm in Thoiry.

1013
01:49:40,967 --> 01:49:43,007
The African part.

1014
01:49:43,167 --> 01:49:47,007
I want to ask you
a very important question.

1015
01:50:41,244 --> 01:50:44,204
He called. He arrived.

1016
01:50:44,364 --> 01:50:47,964
Do you think we can make him
come back one day?

1017
01:50:51,484 --> 01:50:54,924
He gave me this, just before he left.

1018
01:50:55,084 --> 01:50:57,563
He always carried this with him.

1019
01:50:59,603 --> 01:51:00,763
LOOK AFTER HIM. I BEG YOU.

1020
01:51:00,763 --> 01:51:03,083
LOOK AFTER HIM. I BEG YOU.
-He's at his final destination now.

1021
01:51:03,163 --> 01:51:05,563
Did your father say that?
-Yes.

1022
01:51:07,723 --> 01:51:11,003
Sam we're going home.

1023
01:52:32,519 --> 01:52:37,159
Get up, mummy.
We won't get separated anymore.

1024
01:52:42,359 --> 01:52:44,918
Do I have to run you over?

1025
01:53:04,518 --> 01:53:06,118
See you tomorrow.

1026
01:53:41,196 --> 01:53:47,156
when Isabel sleeps
nothing moves

1027
01:53:47,636 --> 01:53:52,316
when Isabelle sleeps
in her cradle of joy

1028
01:53:53,795 --> 01:53:57,155
do you know that she pilfers,
the little scoundrel

1029
01:53:57,635 --> 01:53:59,955
the oases of the Sahara

1030
01:54:00,475 --> 01:54:03,795
the golden fish of China

1031
01:54:04,315 --> 01:54:07,395
and the gardens of the Alhambra?

1032
01:54:07,435 --> 01:54:13,435
when Isabelle sleeps
nothing moves

1033
01:54:14,275 --> 01:54:19,074
when Isabelle sleeps
in her cradle of joy

1034
01:54:20,434 --> 01:54:23,754
she robs the dreams
and the games

1035
01:54:24,234 --> 01:54:27,354
of a rose and a butter cup

1036
01:54:27,873 --> 01:54:29,714
to put them in her eyes

1037
01:54:30,194 --> 01:54:34,713
beautiful Isabelle,
when she sleeps

1038
01:54:36,594 --> 01:54:42,433
when Isabelle laughs
nothing moves

1039
01:54:42,913 --> 01:54:47,513
when Isabelle laughs
in her cradle of joy

1040
01:54:49,352 --> 01:54:51,512
do you know that she robs,
the little mean one

1041
01:54:51,632 --> 01:54:55,433
the laughter of the wild cascades
which serve as a purse to kings

1042
01:54:55,512 --> 01:55:00,432
without a retinue?

1043
01:55:01,312 --> 01:55:07,472
when Isabelle laughs
nothing moves

1044
01:55:07,992 --> 01:55:12,912
when Isabelle laughs
in her cradle of joy

1045
01:55:14,191 --> 01:55:17,152
she robs the windows
of their gold opening onto paradise

1046
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:24,671
to put it into her heart
beautiful Isabelle, when she laughs

1047
01:55:26,111 --> 01:55:31,991
when Isabelle sings
nothing moves

1048
01:55:32,471 --> 01:55:37,630
when Isabelle sings
in her cradle of joy

1049
01:55:39,510 --> 01:55:47,230
do you know that she robs the lace
spun in the heart of nightingales

1050
01:55:47,310 --> 01:55:54,509
and the kisses which umbrellas
keep from taking flight?

1051
01:55:55,390 --> 01:56:01,869
when Isabelle laughs
nothing moves

1052
01:56:02,829 --> 01:56:07,669
when Isabelle laughs
in her cradle of joy

1053
01:56:09,309 --> 01:56:16,789
She robs the velvet and the silk
which the guitar yields to the Infanta

1054
01:56:16,869 --> 01:56:28,668
to put them into her voice
beautiful Isabelle, when she sings

1055
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,000

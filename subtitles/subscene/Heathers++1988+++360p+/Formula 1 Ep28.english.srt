1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,970
Formula 1 - Engines on The Track

2
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:14,870
My heart's continuous signal of love

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:19,870
It's that way because
I want to embrace you

4
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:24,270
And as I waited I
decided to dance slowly

5
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,270
Both of us could
read each other's lips

6
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:35,570
We secretly bathed
in the moonlight

7
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,370
After the goodbye

8
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:44,820
You left without leaving a clue

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,070
Don't betray me Darlin'
She passed through the city

10
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,720
Nobody knows Love Affair

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,120
Together until the morning

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,620
Making Love and no more

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,220
I felt you when I
touched your hand

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,770
Your a woman

15
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,320
Love Affair

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,870
Together until the morning

17
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,570
Making Love and no more

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,170
Those words of love
that you want to hear

19
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:18,870
Your a woman

20
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,190
I don't know what to do!

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,340
I have no money, no car
and no driver's license!

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,840
I've got to find a solution.

23
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,670
I just can't give up the world of racing!

24
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,000
Hiziri's Disease Creeps Closer, 
But I Am not Afraid of Death

25
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,190
I am concerned about Gunma!

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,230
- He isn't back yet!
- He'll be back soon!

27
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,430
Unfortunately, I have to
go back to the hotel.

28
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,430
If there is any news, let me know!

29
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,350
I am very sorry to have
kept you here all night.

30
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,150
- See you later.
- Wait!

31
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,340
Listen,
can you spare five minutes?

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,510
But how do I ask Hiziri?

33
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,350
Please, Tamotsu!
Remember who you once were.

34
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,430
...isn't he a friend of the president!

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,870
I beg you! He's the only
person who can intervene...

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,030
- ...and get back his license!
- I can't.

37
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,110
The fight wasn't his fault.
I was there.

38
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,310
He was provoked!
They can't do this without...

39
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,430
... giving him a chance to explain!

40
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,550
You must help him!

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,550
There is a lot of
work to do right now...

42
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,590
...and Hiziri is very busy!

43
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,020
But racing means the world to him.

44
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,990
- Help him!
- I can't promise anything.

45
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,830
But I will ask about it.

46
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,630
Though...I don't know
if Hiziri will do anything.

47
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,030
Well then, let us
know the answer.

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,960
- Alright, I will.
- Thank you.

49
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,030
Get out of there now!

50
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,830
Leave her alone!

51
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,950
This engine is great.

52
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,670
It would be a shame
if it was left in this dump.

53
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,350
You won't convince me,
your not getting it.

54
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,750
I don't need it anymore.

55
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,910
Because the have
withdrawn my license!

56
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,670
I couldn't drive
even if I wanted to.

57
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,750
I only came to see the machine.

58
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,990
Listen, can I ask you a question?

59
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,260
Why do you keep
it hidden like this?

60
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,670
I don't think
you can drive it.

61
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,830
- Well?
- Mind your own business!

62
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,150
In my opinion you have...

63
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,950
...prevented her
from making a career.

64
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,510
Well, what is it?
You wanted to ask me something,

65
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,750
I just wanted to know
if the route plan Hiziri ...

66
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,070
...made had been
studied with for the race.

67
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,750
Hiziri's road map?

68
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,980
- Why do you want to know that?
- Actually...

69
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,070
There are things
that concern me, but ...

70
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,870
What's the problem?
Why do you want to know my plans?

71
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,990
Hiziri!

72
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,070
It's nothing important,
I was just curious.

73
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,350
I wasn't born yesterday.

74
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,260
Tell me the real
reason your here, come on.

75
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,750
I can clearly see
that you need help.

76
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,230
I wanted to ask ...

77
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,110
- Is that true?
- That's right.

78
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,070
We can't do much.

79
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,030
When you told me to come over,

80
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,150
I expected something more.
Come on, what's the rest.

81
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,630
Well then, listen to me.

82
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,070
I know a guy that
could be very useful!

83
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,190
- You serious?
- Of course!

84
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,750
I'll let you know if you
promise not to behave as usual!

85
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,910
But you mustn't run away,
this is your only chance.

86
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,830
Hey, don't get my hopes up.

87
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,070
My hands are tied
without my license.

88
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,430
And yet ... I have to
race no matter the cost.

89
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,080
I have a score to settle with Hiziri.

90
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,420
- Do you understand?
- Yeah?

91
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,910
Until I have beaten him,

92
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,230
no one will take me
seriously as a driver.

93
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,430
Okay, okay, I get it.

94
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,470
Excuse me if
I've been a bit rude.

95
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,350
But I didn't expect this!
You caught me off guard!

96
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,900
Do you think I
should help him, well?

97
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,510
But your the
only one who can speak to the...

98
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,550
...President of the Federation!

99
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,910
I know the race is approaching...

100
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,950
...and that your really busy,

101
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,950
but I'm begging you.

102
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,150
You gotta do something
or Gunma will be ruined.

103
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,510
I don't know,
I wish I could help.

104
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,630
But I must say that Gunma
is lucky to have a friend like you

105
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,310
He's like a
brother to me, Hiziri.

106
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,430
You are invaluable to the team...

107
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,630
...and the constant concern
you have for him ...

108
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,230
...prevents you from
concentrating on my machine!

109
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,670
I don't like it.

110
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,990
Nothing should distract
you from your work.

111
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,510
Though I will talk to the president.

112
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,510
Hiziri!

113
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,160
I'm only doing it because
you make my car go faster.

114
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,550
- Is that alright, Tamotsu?
- Yes! That's great.

115
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,020
I'm sorry to ask...

116
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,950
But can you give
Gunma Akagi his license back.

117
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,030
Gunma Akagi must be special...

118
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,310
...if you are intervening for him.

119
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,510
They don't know him like I do
so they can't pass judgment like this.

120
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,310
Though i can't tell
whether he's worth it or not.

121
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,630
I just wish that you give
his license back and re-evaluate him.

122
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:58,740
Listen to me Hiziri, in my career
I have met many drivers.

123
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,430
But I have never met
one so uninterested as him.

124
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,340
I don't see what
the problem is here.

125
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,510
That's not the case!
Usually..

126
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,670
...we would get rid of the
driver because he is your rival.

127
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,150
Anyway, I'm interested in
seeing what will happen next.

128
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,030
How was your meeting
with the President?

129
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,230
He assured me he
would do everything possible.

130
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,070
But he couldn't guarantee success
because he's not the only one voting.

131
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,740
I didn't think you would
put in a good word for Gunma.

132
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,990
Why is that? Even the
most proud, over time,

133
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,030
must eventually soften up.

134
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,670
What's wrong?

135
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,950
It's just a plane.
Don't tell me you're scared!

136
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,150
It's nothing, it's over now.

137
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,390
- Don't worry.
- Hiziri, if you feel bad,

138
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,430
Don't be afraid to
tell me what's wrong.

139
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,590
Ruiko!

140
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,830
What's wrong with Hiziri?

141
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,350
Emergency Room

142
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,950
I understand, he's inside.

143
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,070
He's regained
consciousness right now.

144
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,830
We've calmed him down,
but he needs to rest.

145
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,990
Though we can't be too
sure until the tests are done.

146
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,760
Of course we are 
doing the best we can.

147
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,310
Though I'm not sure 
how much longer he will last...

148
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,040
Take my advice and 
keep him in the hospital.

149
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,150
Do you think Gunma 
will return this evening?

150
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,870
What happened Tamotsu?
You said you would phone me.

151
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,150
Sempai!
Where are you going?

152
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,150
We're all worried about you.

153
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,830
Want something to eat?

154
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:14,230
Why are you looking at me like that?

155
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,350
I don't want you to be angry.

156
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,910
- Come on, I'll make it real fast!
- I'm not hungry.

157
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,390
What's wrong with you?
Even if your sad,

158
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,390
that can't change anything.

159
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,750
It's easy to talk when
 your not the one in trouble.

160
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,230
Gunma!

161
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,300
Now what are we gonna do?

162
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,870
His condition is serious.

163
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,910
He can't participate in the next race!

164
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,550
It's clear that he 
will not go to Europe!

165
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:00,070
And his dreams of 
Formula 1 will just fade away.

166
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,840
Where are you going?
Come back!

167
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,070
The doctor said you 
have to rest! You can't leave.

168
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,070
Let's go home.

169
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,990
- How are you feeling?
- Ah...

170
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,670
I feel slightly better.

171
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,350
But I feel weak 
when I turn my head.

172
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,350
Is this the end?

173
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,340
While in the hospital I had
 the most beautiful dream of my life.

174
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,910
I dreamed of racing in Formula 1!

175
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,310
I would like to know 
why this room is so dark!

176
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,750
Turn on the light, please!

177
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,950
Hiziri, what's wrong? 
Are you hurt? Can't you see?

178
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,340
- It's alright.!
- But you said ...

179
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,750
It was just a normal attack!

180
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,030
I just have to change the program! 
You go to the circuit.

181
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,420
No person in the world 
has the right to stop me!

182
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,670
No one can stop me
 from driving! Up until the end!

183
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,470
I am not afraid! I am no
 longer afraid of death!

184
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,310
My state of mind even 
surprises myself sometimes.

185
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,590
I realize that my driving style ...

186
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,870
...since I've started driving in Formula 3.

187
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,150
I never imagined ...

188
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,230
...that the fear of 
death would change me.

189
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,430
At first I thought I could get ...

190
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,750
...rid of it thought driving.

191
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,070
But now everything is different.

192
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,550
I'm used to living with his shadow!

193
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,340
And he's now
 a good friend of mine.

194
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,150
There I expect a better world! 
Where my rivalry does not exist!

195
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,910
The wall inside of me,
 has given me comfort ...

196
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,980
...when I'm up against 
the outside wall of speed...

197
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,580
Now neither of them exist any more!

198
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,830
There is nothing that limits me!

199
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,670
Now I can only pray to 
have no attacks during the race.

200
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,740
Good evening! I found by chance,

201
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,440
You were right to call me. 
We needed to talk.

202
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,750
Yes, yes.

203
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,070
What ?! 
They've withdrawn the license?

204
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,550
But now he can't compete.

205
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,310
Indeed, this is troublesome.

206
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,670
- His career is over! 
- I...

207
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,670
Is that so...

208
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,710
Hello, hello...

209
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,830
Hello, hello.

210
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,230
Gunma!

211
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,230
Hiziri, my friend, you have to
 keep on fighting till the end!

212
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,350
Don't give up!

213
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,140
- Eh ?! He quit with the races? 
- Don't be silly!

214
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,310
Don't you ever ask Hiziri
 for help with my license!

215
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,350
- But, Gunma...
- Shut up!

216
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,430
In the next episode:

217
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,510
Gunma Draws the Line! 
The Enemy's Compassion Is Bitter

218
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,830
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

219
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:28,900
I saw you crying after
you were abandoned

220
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:35,800
Let's climb that hill
and look back down

221
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,900
In the big world it's undeniable

222
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:50,650
Yesterday's pain is
not visible anymore

223
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,150
OK Let's start it

224
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,150
In order to grieve

225
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:02,350
Ah It's as if we weren't born

226
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:15,600
You are my energy, You are my energy

227
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:21,000
Courage come out

228
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,300
By just being with you

1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,470
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,470
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,120
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,120
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,470
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,370
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,370
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,670
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,970
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,470
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:50,970
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,220
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,720
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,220
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,150
We could not ask for
anything better.

16
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,552
His time was astounding!

17
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,596
The sound of the
engine is really something!

18
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,100
Tamotsu Is Shaken!
Hiziri Conceals a Horrible Secret

19
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,356
MORIOKA MOTORS

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,432
I stopped racing because
my family was against it.

21
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,437
I'm not upset.

22
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,909
I must say that after the
accident, I leave without regret!

23
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,310
Though something else is bothering me.

24
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,358
I have to find the
answer to that question.

25
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,231
I want to study the behavior
of men and what pushes them ...

26
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,039
...to challenge the universe!
A disturbing question!

27
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,270
Because man wants to conquer space?

28
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,237
What drives him to climb mountains,

29
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,515
go to the sky,
and to probe the depths?

30
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,037
My thirst for knowledge
becomes larger by the day!

31
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,316
Let's stop talking about these things ...

32
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,356
...we have more important matters!

33
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,031
Only the thought
that Gunma will drive my car ...

34
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,677
I feel suffocated by
the pride and emotion!

35
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,156
This is great! This engine is
a gem, I assure you!

36
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,669
- I could not ask for better!
- Really?

37
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,758
A few more tweaks
and it'll be really fast!

38
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,876
We were lucky that Kishida...

39
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,916
...gave his car in Gunma.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,878
Did you say yes
or no to Hiziri's offer?

41
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,838
I haven't had the time
to contact him. I'll do it tonight!

42
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,832
Guys, I want to go now
and try out the new engine.

43
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,754
What ?! Are you crazy?
You can't do that here!

44
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,520
- It's not finished yet!
- Oh, really?

45
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,750
I don't give a damn, understand?

46
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,551
There isn't much time
before the race.

47
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,513
- Why didn't you say?
Gunma...

48
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,596
Listen here...

49
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,636
...no one can stop me!

50
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,677
I want to go to the track and...

51
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,637
...try it out, alright!

52
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,676
Is that it?

53
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,116
Okay, go on ahead.

54
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,757
Don't be angry with me.

55
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,070
We wouldn't have
been able to stop him...

56
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,239
Have you noticed that
the driving style of Gunma ...

57
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,276
- ...has improved?
- Yeah!

58
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,678
He wasn't very good
in the beginning, but he's improved.

59
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,916
Now his driving is much more fluid.

60
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,956
And even his confidence!

61
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,550
I really think he has a good chance.

62
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,755
Him and that car has
what it takes to win the race.

63
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,358
Yeah, Gunma is a natural
when it comes to driving.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,198
You know Tamotsu, I though
natural born drivers didn't exists...

65
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,837
In my life I have
met countless drivers,

66
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,754
and none of them
were natural born drivers.

67
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,437
I think they go fast ...

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,875
...because there is something bothering them.

69
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,916
It's anger that drivers them.

70
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,077
More like revenge.

71
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,470
Their desire to emerge
depends on an irrational desire ...

72
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,074
...to make the world
know that they exist.

73
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,156
I'm back!

74
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,160
- Hey, I'm starving!
- About time!

75
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,196
Aren't you two late?

76
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,598
- Good evening!
- Now that's a surprise!

77
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,030
Have you already been
discharged from the hospital?

78
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,839
- Are you okay?
- Hahaha, yeah.

79
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,754
- Hey, Grandma, I'm hungry!
- Coming!

80
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,796
Do you want some food too?

81
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,356
Tamotsu, I almost forgot ...

82
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,510
This afternoon Hiziri phoned.

83
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,556
He said to call him back.

84
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,229
He said around ten o'clock.

85
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,749
Tamotsu, hurry up and
deal with this money matter.

86
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,638
Because I won't drive with his money,

87
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,109
- Got it?
- Understood!

88
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,910
Hey, you two!
You still have to paint the car!

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,195
Get busy!
You know my car...

90
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,158
...must look really awesome!
- Right!

91
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,559
Hiziri?
This is me, Tamotsu!

92
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,753
I have to
talk about that thing.

93
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,919
Are you still there, Hiziri?

94
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,953
- Hello!
- I'm here.

95
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,952
Sorry, but I was
getting a cup of coffee.

96
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,512
I'm sorry to tell you,
but I really can't accept your offer.

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,151
You see, we found a
man who sold us his car.

98
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,675
Don't take it personally,

99
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,273
but it's better that
I remain by Gunma's side!

100
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,518
Hello?
Hiziri?

101
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,231
If your still there, answer me?

102
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,679
Hello, Hello?

103
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,350
Oh, I'm sorry,

104
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,550
but I have to hang up now.

105
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,349
- You'll have to call back later.
- But...

106
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,716
Won't Hiziri be angry with me...

107
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,950
because I refused his offer?

108
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,438
- Not at all!
- But I'm sure of it!

109
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,100
No, I assure you
that you're wrong!

110
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,758
He's just having a big headache!

111
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,039
Hey! What's going on?
Answer me!

112
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,673
- Hello, what happened?
- Please, get here now!

113
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,036
That sounded serious!

114
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,836
What could have happened?

115
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,270
Hiziri

116
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,836
Oh!

117
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,757
Tell me! What happened?

118
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,836
What's wrong?

119
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,036
What happened?

120
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,914
Uhm, I'm sorry.

121
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,753
You're so beautiful when you cry.

122
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,156
I'm sorry.

123
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,038
Hiziri...!

124
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,435
Hiziri?

125
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,036
S-Sempai.

126
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,076
That car is truly a gem!

127
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,677
With it's class, Gunma will use it to it's fullest.

128
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,030
- Yeah!
- Uhm...!

129
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,156
Yesterday afternoon,

130
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,835
You said just the opposite about the car!

131
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,956
That natural born drivers don't exists!

132
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,918
that they are drive
by revenge and desire ...

133
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,956
...to make the world know them.

134
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,036
But you just mentioned "class"!

135
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,757
About that...

136
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,915
What I meant to say is that
it's never just a matter of talent,

137
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,956
other factors are involved!

138
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,998
Especially for people who
have encountered difficulties in life.

139
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,356
Excuse me, but your
words aren't entirely clear.

140
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,470
Take for example the life of a boxer.

141
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,993
It would be logical to think
that after all those punches,

142
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,629
he would stop fighting.
But he continues to box.

143
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,629
And not only for his passion for boxing,

144
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,917
but also to get rid of
the wrongs he suffered in life.

145
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,873
In short, it is a way to
give meaning to their existence.

146
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,958
But why do you want
to know these things?

147
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,878
Well, that's because ...
Since you started ...

148
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,599
with a reference to
Gunma, I was interested!

149
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,755
I am convinced that he goes fast ...

150
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,475
because of the anger inside of him.
A revenge of sorts.

151
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,154
He wants to prove to
the world that he exists!

152
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,995
MR Tamotsu Ohishi

153
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,437
Terms of the agreement for team Hijiri

154
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,591
Hey, Tamotsu...

155
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,276
Hey, what are you hiding?

156
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,630
Let me have a peek!

157
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:47,349
Come on! Friends don't
keep secrets from one another!

158
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,917
- Let me see!
- Stop it!

159
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,116
It's personal stuff!

160
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,120
What kind of friend hides secrets?

161
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,668
I already said that it's personal!

162
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,116
Stop right there!

163
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,956
I've got it
Eh?!

164
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,951
What is it?

165
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,234
- What does this mean?
- Well ... Actually ...

166
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,436
You are a dirty traitor!

167
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,632
Don't you remember
anything that I've said!

168
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,914
This contract?
What are you doing with it?

169
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:45,356
I ... I wanted to return it,
but I didn't have the time!

170
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,353
I knew it, you were
dying to work for Hiziri!

171
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,755
- That's not it!
- You're lying!

172
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,189
I know you've got a crush...

173
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,350
- ...Hiziri's girl!
- Eh?!

174
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,236
What are you thinking?
You're wrong!

175
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,197
I'm not interested in her!

176
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,236
Fine then, If you won't...

177
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,754
- then I will!
- Gunma!

178
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,790
Remember, Tamotsu,
I'm the fastest,

179
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,270
You are my mechanic and
I don't intend to give you away!

180
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,197
- Gunma!
- Bye then,

181
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,473
Hiziri, come on out!

182
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,435
Or are you scared to face me!

183
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,156
Whatever you have in mind,

184
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,312
I will make sure that
Tamotsu will never work for you!

185
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,870
I suggest you leave him alone ..

186
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,155
or I swear you you'll regret it!

187
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,116
He doesn't understand...

188
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,077
..I always get what I want!

189
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,511
And as usual, what
I say always comes true!

190
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,956
I bet on it.

191
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,950
Aren't you in a good mood!

192
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,152
Even when working,
you find the time to whistle!

193
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,156
What's wrong with that!

194
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,674
It helps pass the time!
Right!

195
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,956
Yeah! Your right!

196
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,556
So, what do you think?

197
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,276
It's great!
But where's Gunma?

198
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,356
Wasn't he here a moment ago!

199
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,958
He shouldn't miss
a moment like this

200
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,872
He'll be back soon!
In the meantime, let's eat!

201
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,750
Easy, or you'll
break the bandages!

202
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,156
- I'm not hungry.
- But you haven't eaten!

203
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,674
Are you sure you
don't want anything?

204
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,951
No, it's alright!
I'll be fine.

205
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,757
He's strange,

206
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,876
This isn't right! I can't just leave
him to fend for himself!

207
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,432
Only a few hours until
tomorrow when I'll win!

208
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,875
Ready.
Go!

209
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,360
Here there is a curve to the right.

210
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,911
This is the first bend.

211
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,673
I'll have to pay close attention,

212
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,837
I'll have to slow
down when turning here.

213
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,195
And then full speed...

214
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,275
And when I get to the second bend,
I'll have to slow down.

215
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,356
just for a bit.

216
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,678
Then onto the finish line,
...at full speed!

217
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,190
I am the fastest and no
one will ever beat me!

218
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,030
In the race it is forbidden
to strike or push the other cars.

219
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,476
It is recommend
that you avoid such acts!

220
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,518
In the next episode:

221
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,397
He Really Is a Genius?
Gunma Runs Amok

222
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,278
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

223
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,250
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

224
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:19,200
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

225
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,500
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

226
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:35,300
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

227
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:44,200
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

228
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,900
These feelings
just flare up

229
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,900
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

230
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:01,900
The fantasy penetrates through you

231
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:07,100
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

232
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:14,950
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

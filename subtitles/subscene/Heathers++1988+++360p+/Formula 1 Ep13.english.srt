1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,150
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,150
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,500
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,700
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,000
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,000
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,250
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,750
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,250
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,100
Finally a Decisive Match! Gunma vs.
Hiziri, the Ultimate Dead Heat

16
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,751
- Why don't you take a break, Tamotsu?
- We've brought snacks.

17
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,398
Thank you, Hiziri! Thank you, Ruiko!
I appreciate it very much!

18
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,109
- I saw that Gunma has qualified!
- Congratulations!

19
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,039
He had a very
difficult start to the race,

20
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,236
but then in the last
laps he recovered well.

21
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,596
You are really good!
Anyone can qualify,

22
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,274
provided, that their
machines are finalized by you.

23
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,756
No, I'm not that good.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,309
Why don't we talk about
your performance?

25
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,153
You were amazing!
Only a driver like you could...

26
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,470
take pole position in
one minute and two seconds.

27
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,956
Look, Tamotsu, I really
envy your friend Gunma.

28
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,357
This is a good thing?

29
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,353
Yes, because my mechanics
aren't good enough.

30
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,914
If you worked on my car,
you could improve ...

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,230
- ... my performance!
- Eh?!

32
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,630
This is it!
Good luck for the race!

33
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,469
Apparently you've gained his trust!

34
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,915
Though I'm not so optimistic.

35
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,200
Kishida has just arrived at the hospital.

36
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,357
He has bruises all over the body,

37
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,512
and he broke an arm and some ribs.

38
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,389
- It's all because of Haitani!
- Now ...

39
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,950
.. he has to stay in the
hospital for at least two months!

40
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,635
Frankly, I can't even
believe this has happened!

41
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,950
It's hard to
resist provocations.

42
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,553
Gunma, you know,
we said that the qualifications ...

43
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,154
...you got were great,
and if you continue...

44
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,073
...you should have a
good chance of winning!

45
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,355
It would be great if you
could beat the other competitors!

46
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,798
Quiet! He finished only
second-last on the track!

47
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,156
That means his chances
of winning are slim!

48
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,840
How can he win with chances like that?

49
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,398
Today our guest is one of
the most powerful industrial ...

50
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,869
companies in our country ...: Mr. Soichiro Akagi!

51
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,476
Mr. Soichiro Akagi!
Mr. Soichiro Akagi!

52
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,797
Mr. Soichiro Akagi is
here with his ​​two children ...

53
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,836
...and has granted us this interview!

54
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,951
His two sons?!

55
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,071
Does that mean you,
Gunma?

56
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,038
Mr. Akagi is the President
of the Akagi Group,

57
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,998
but in addition to his company,
he's responsible for managing ...

58
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,957
... countless other businesses.

59
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,436
Tell us, Mr. Akagi,
are the rumors circulating ...

60
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,954
... about your falling
out with your son true?

61
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,878
Well, I wouldn't call it a falling out,

62
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,111
let's say I'm trying to introduce...

63
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,077
...him into the world of work soon.

64
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,118
On the other hand, young people
should be prepared to work.

65
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,153
Some argue that they
are too young for jobs,

66
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,233
though I don't think so.
People should start working when they're young.

67
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,917
Who knows, perhaps, under
his leadership, the Akagi Group...

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,673
...could be known
and loved across the world!

69
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,758
And now, Mr. Akagi,
one last question:

70
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,796
it is true that you intend to run for ...

71
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,110
...in the upcoming elections
for the House of Representatives?

72
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,351
I'd rather not talk about it,
that's a rather delicate topic.

73
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,473
Your useless,
you'll never change, Dad!

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,834
Are you crazy? That TV was brand new,
and I haven't payed yet!

75
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,516
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome!

76
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,518
The race will start in a few moments.

77
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,271
That hurt!

78
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,358
- Be careful, Hiziri.
- Don't worry.

79
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,238
I'm safer here than on the road.

80
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,437
- In any case, be careful.
- Don't worry, Ruiko.

81
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,757
Wow!

82
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,950
- Be careful, Gunma.
- Don't worry.

83
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,237
I'm safer here than on the road.

84
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,472
- Either way your fine.
- Yes.

85
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,235
Don't even think about it!
Now try,

86
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,278
to not get hurt and destroy the other cars!

87
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,076
Three minutes to go!

88
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,636
We ask non driers to clear
the runway as soon as possible!

89
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,596
So, promise to behave well?

90
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,150
Sure! I'll do the race
without damaging any cars.

91
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,151
Listen, Gunma, turn on your engine ...

92
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,471
...it's one minute before departure.
And remember that in the first round ...

93
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,439
...you need to warm up the engine,
then you can start driving.

94
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,556
Try to be careful, please!

95
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,915
Sure, sure!
However, I want to win!

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,275
I shouldn't be worried too much.

97
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,149
- What did you say?
- Tamotsu, I've got to go.

98
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,190
Please, don't do anything stupid!
After the lap,

99
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,157
try to keep the engine revved up,

100
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,437
otherwise the engine
won't work properly, got it?

101
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,671
- You already told me!
- You never listen!

102
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,836
Come on, Tamotsu!

103
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,035
Something must have happened to Gunma!

104
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,960
I've never seen him
so nervous before a race!

105
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,270
Probably because he
saw his father on TV.

106
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,869
- Come on, Gunma! You are the best!
- Grandma?

107
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,913
Why are you going so slow?

108
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,071
How can you expect to win!

109
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,628
Grandma, stop screaming!
He's going slow because...

110
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,950
- ...of the starting lap!
- Eh?!

111
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,232
Sorry, I didn't know!

112
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,670
Hopefully he won't cause trouble!

113
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,034
I hope so.
I'd like him to win this time.

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,197
I always wonder how you
can be so different from me!

115
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,597
You have to go, Gunma!

116
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,194
There is no place for
someone like you in our family!

117
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,748
- Get out of here!
- Goodbye, father!

118
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,837
Please, do not push the engine
too hard, try to calm down!

119
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,797
Gunma!

120
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,153
Come on, Gunma,
we're with you!

121
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,629
It's pointless to
cheer for him that way!

122
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,039
What?!

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,956
I'm the fastest!

124
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,590
You're going too fast, Gunma.
You have to slow down.

125
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,276
Out of the way!

126
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,673
To me you're
nothing but a slacker!

127
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,956
You are wrong. Dad!

128
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,751
- What are you doing?
- Get away from me!

129
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,956
- This isn't  over!

130
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,429
Damn it!

131
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,756
Damn!

132
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,351
Your mine, Hiziri!

133
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,112
Gunma is magnificent!
He's driving rather well!

134
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,555
Keep it up, Gunma!
You're the best!

135
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,154
You'll win at this rate!

136
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,357
Your mine!

137
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,956
I've finally caught up!

138
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,277
I'll win this race and then...

139
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,356
I'll become the world champion!

140
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,314
Your life will amount to nothing.

141
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,039
You're nothing but
an imitation of me!

142
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,156
Damn it! Why can't I get
rid of this nightmare?

143
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,155
Where are you trying to go?

144
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,516
To the country s borders?
Or to the end of the world?

145
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,279
If you continue like this,
you won't go anywhere!

146
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,112
Shut up!

147
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,272
You'll never be a real pilot!

148
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,955
That profession is not right for you!

149
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,188
Your place is here, at my side,
don't you understand?

150
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,917
Dad, please, stop it!
Leave me alone!

151
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,550
I'll beat you, Hiziri!
I will win!

152
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,032
Damn it!

153
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,116
What happened?

154
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,910
Where is Gunma?
What's happened?

155
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,156
Gunma!

156
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,675
Gunma!
What happened to you...

157
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,716
...you crashed into the guardrail.

158
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,031
- Yeah! What bad luck!
- Now there's nothing left to do.

159
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,237
- Don't do it!
- Don't make that face!

160
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,515
For your information
I almost beat Hiziri!

161
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,875
Stop doing everything
by yourself, Gunma!

162
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,552
- What?
- You were at fault!

163
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,275
- What?!
- Take it easy!

164
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,757
It's useless to argue!

165
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,229
You should have avoided it!

166
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,756
With your vision you had
plenty of time to avoid it!

167
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,470
Instead you lost your grip on the vehicle.

168
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,596
You should have slowed down,

169
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,677
instead you did the opposite!

170
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,479
Have you learned nothing?

171
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,269
The speed of your car
was what caused the crash!

172
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,313
I know all about your father.

173
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,914
...and that his
appearance on TV upset you!

174
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,753
- My father has nothing to do with this!
- He does!

175
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,236
Stop lying to yourself,
just admit it!

176
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,118
I know that deep down
you two have a connection!

177
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,270
Look, Tamotsu,
stop it now!

178
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,273
I can't forgive what you've done!

179
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,356
It was not my fault!

180
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,068
You should give the
race your full concentration!

181
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,276
- Nothing else matters!

182
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,676
That's enough, Tamotsu!

183
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,678
This is the first time
Gunma has raced seriously!

184
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,716
Anyone can make mistakes!

185
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,234
Yes, that's true!
But when your driving fast,

186
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,959
even the smallest
mistake could end your life!

187
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,550
Cars can be replaced but,

188
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,950
there is only one Gunma Akagi!

189
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,480
Do you agree, Tamotsu?

190
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,155
Yes I do! Gunma, you
can become a champion.

191
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,595
You're the only one
who can fulfill our dreams!

192
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,118
This would be an honor for Morioka.

193
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,438
Junko too!
And Grandma would be happy...

194
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,757
And even our friends Kinoshita and Matsuura!

195
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,677
And me too!
Think about it, Gunma!

196
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,517
No more dreams of glory!

197
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,275
We'll get to that soon enough.

198
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,155
Then, are we gonna get this car?

199
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,760
Damn it!
Who knows how many laps I lost ...!

200
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,430
All right.
I'll wait a while.

201
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,397
I'll surpass Hiziri at the finish line!

202
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,277
Look who's back!

203
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,592
What does he think he's doing?

204
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,839
Out of the way champion!

205
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,197
Careful, Gunma!

206
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,591
Watch out for the corner!

207
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,076
That car has an amazing engine!

208
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,276
Even despite that accident!

209
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,752
Lets go!

210
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,959
I'm the fastest, Hiziri!
You'll never beat me!

211
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,952
No!

212
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,357
Gunma!

213
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:24,476
Gunma!

214
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,598
I told them that an oil
slick caused the accident,

215
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,916
but we all know the truth!

216
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,590
I'm sorry. If I wasn't such
an idiot we would have won.

217
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,672
I, Gunma Akagi, dedicate
this tomb to a frog.

218
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,352
Don't worry,
there's always next time.

219
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,352
Didn't you see me!
I was like wildfire!

220
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,952
Even so!
You've still got a way to go.

221
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,594
- Where is Tamotsu?
- Tamotsu?

222
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,357
Never mind.

223
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,516
Ruiko sure is cute!

224
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,679
Though why does she
want to talk with Tamotsu?

225
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,594
I won't stand for this!

226
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,275
I'm really sorry,...

227
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,075
Can I do anything for you?

228
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,960
I don't know.
However, you are kind to me.

229
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,357
Could you give me a kiss?

230
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,556
Sure!
You deserve it!

231
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,677
It was Gunma's fault
that he didn't win the race!

232
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,156
Don't you think so?

233
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,160
Actually ... I ... I

234
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,957
You're so cute!

235
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,110
Don't do it, Tamotsu!

236
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,436
What's wrong with you?

237
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,829
Tamotsu,
now I know.

238
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,115
He's been flirting with Hiziri's girl!

239
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,156
What are you saying?

240
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,198
Ruiko only came to invite me to a big party,

241
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,158
...tomorrow evening for Hiziri's victory!

242
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,436
Party?!

243
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,234
A lot of drives will be attending also.

244
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,755
It would help my future
as a mechanic if I attended!

245
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,310
- Your invited too!
- You idiot!

246
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,198
I would never set foot
into the home of my rival!

247
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,029
Just the thought of
seeing him makes me sick!

248
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,111
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

249
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,235
Every things gone as you had expected!

250
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,550
I think you'll be pleased with yourself!

251
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,154
I don't think Tamotsu will attend the party.

252
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,037
Though one day he will work for me!

253
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,958
He'll come when he sees this,

254
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,996
I know he will.

255
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,670
The engine will draw him in.

256
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:38,569
A first-class pilot changes
gear at least 20 times ...

257
00:21:38,699 --> 00:21:41,611
...in a single lap
in the Tsukuba circuit!

258
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:44,698
And it only takes one
minute to complete a lap!

259
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:46,855
In the next episode:

260
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,975
"Goodbye, Gunma! Rival Hiziri
Announces His Step-up to F-3".

261
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:52,376
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

262
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,550
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

263
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:19,500
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

264
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,800
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

265
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:35,600
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

266
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,500
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

267
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,200
These feelings
just flare up

268
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

269
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,200
The fantasy penetrates through you

270
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

271
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:15,250
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

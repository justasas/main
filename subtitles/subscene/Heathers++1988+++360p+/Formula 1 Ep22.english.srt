1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,600
Formula 1 - Engines on The Track

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,500
My heart's continuous signal of love

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,500
It's that way because
I want to embrace you

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,900
And as I waited I
decided to dance slowly

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,900
Both of us could
read each other's lips

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:35,200
We secretly bathed
in the moonlight

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,000
After the goodbye

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,450
You left without leaving a clue

9
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,700
Don't betray me Darlin'
She passed through the city

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,350
Nobody knows Love Affair

11
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,750
Together until the morning

12
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,250
Making Love and no more

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,850
I felt you when I
touched your hand

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,400
Your a woman

15
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,950
Love Affair

16
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,500
Together until the morning

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,200
Making Love and no more

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,800
Those words of love
that you want to hear

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,500
Your a woman

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,276
Oh, Tamotsu, I'm in trouble!

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,914
Now that your with Hiziri,

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,435
I'm stuck with Konpon to do the repairs...

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,829
...and he's now my mechanic.

24
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,631
I need to get into Formula
3 as soon as possible!

25
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,951
Eh ?! What ?!

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,956
But where did
the others go?

27
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,750
Has Tamotsu Returned?
Gunma's Dramatic Change

28
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,356
But Gunma is left for last!

29
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,516
He's that last!
What happened to him?

30
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,160
I haven't got a clue.
I don't know.

31
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,435
But one thing is
absolutely certain:

32
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,080
Gunma must have
something tormenting him.

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,632
Maybe, though he might have
problems with the transmission.

34
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,559
Come on! We've got to
do something about it!

35
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,349
That's my money!
Don't you forget about it!

36
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,357
What is he doing?
Didn't...

37
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,396
...I fix up his car!

38
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,599
Just as I thought.
He's a misfit.

39
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,319
Damn it!
Why is this happening?

40
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,153
If this continues the
audience will fall asleep!

41
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,076
What's wrong with you?
Let go, you're hurting me!

42
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,840
Strange, your skin is
soft and delicate.

43
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,876
Morioka, what does this mean?

44
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,917
I've never seen anything
like this in my life!

45
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,992
Get away from me!
My allergy might...

46
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,116
...come back after your
paws touched me!

47
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,475
Don't do that again, understand?

48
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,915
He must be a great mechanic.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,073
Even though his hands
are soft they're covered in blisters.

50
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,676
- What ?! Are you sure?
- So he's not a fake!

51
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,553
So then there wasn't anything wrong...

52
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,756
...with the transmission,
it must be something else.

53
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,197
Yeah, Gunma himself.

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,072
At the time of departure he
was overwhelmed with fear...

55
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,276
...and therefore couldn't concentrate.

56
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,429
When you lose you concentration,
it's impossible to race properly.

57
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,553
And if by a miracle he managed
to regain his composure,

58
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,270
the body will not respond
until there is tension and fear.

59
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,510
There he is!
Sempai!

60
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,478
I'm the fastest!
And no one will ever beat me!

61
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,835
What's wrong with him?
Has he gone mad?

62
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,070
He's changing gear
but he's driving straight!

63
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,116
Oh, no! Can we do nothing?

64
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,755
I know! I've come
up with a great idea!

65
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,040
After six laps I've
overtook only three cars.

66
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,237
And there's still nine laps to go!

67
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,270
Is that true?
If the drive isn't nice to him,

68
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,670
He'll damage your engine!
No! I won't believe it!

69
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,879
Remember, your victory or
defeat depends on my efforts!

70
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,471
Tamotsu! I need you!

71
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,518
Hey! Judging by your speed
I would say that the likes you!

72
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,558
Well, at least try to
remain on the track!

73
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,756
Oh! He overtook me!

74
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,276
Tamotsu.

75
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,357
Tamotsu.

76
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,359
Did he come back to me?

77
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,190
No, it' can't be!
He's working with Hiziri!

78
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,951
- Here he comes!
- Start moving.

79
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,756
- Well, did it work?
- I'm sure it worked.

80
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,468
Well, as a child I was told ...

81
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,599
By my teachers that this
was one of my strong suits!

82
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,750
Yeah, you sure are...

83
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,796
...but does he know it's a dummy?

84
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,757
Don't worry!
Our aim,

85
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,400
...is to make him think that
Tamotsu has come back!

86
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,516
- Right?
- That's right,

87
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,672
I can do it,
I'll keep at this until...

88
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,751
...Gunma wins the race.

89
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,794
Tamotsu, you came back after all,

90
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,030
I knew you cared about me.

91
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,398
Oh! He passed
four cars at once!

92
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,631
We did it!
Grandma you were great!

93
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,029
Great! He finally went faster!

94
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,634
Though this isn't his doing!
When I fix cars,

95
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,676
...they always go faster!

96
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,477
It's raining?

97
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,830
Look!
He's going faster!

98
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,831
It's starting to rain!

99
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,150
Hopefully this won't stop him.

100
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,196
Don't worry!
Can't you see...

101
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,238
...that with Tamotsu here
he will surely win!

102
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,835
That's right! I totally agree!

103
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,190
I didn't know that sempai had such....

104
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,271
...a deep
relationship with him.

105
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,790
I wonder what reaction he will...

106
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,075
...have considering it's just a dummy.

107
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,560
I've gotta be strong!

108
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,710
I don't care if the radiator melts...

109
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,631
...or the breaks get damaged.

110
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,473
This is it!
I'm going all out!

111
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,276
Look! He's surpassing Haitani.

112
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,872
Incredible! He increased
his speed despite the rain!

113
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,275
He'll win if he keeps it up!

114
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,197
I can't believe this!

115
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,510
I knew he was a great mechanic!

116
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,830
I've never gone as fast before!

117
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,559
Just like he said, he's a great mechanic!

118
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,120
What's wrong, don't you trust me?

119
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,959
Though one thing is
for certain, he's strange.

120
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,477
Fantastic!

121
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,995
You're the strongest! You're the strongest!

122
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,880
Keep it up, I didn't know
he could drive so fast!

123
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,836
If he keeps going fast,

124
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,514
he'll become the strongest!

125
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,830
Thanks for the help, Tamotsu!

126
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,472
Tamotsu...

127
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,032
- Oh, no! The rain ruined it!
- What!

128
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,833
Now that it's wet we can't repaint it!

129
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,359
What can we do now?
Only if we weren't excitied,

130
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,109
There's nothing we can do.

131
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,629
Damn!
He's got one more lap left!

132
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,636
The rain's stopped!

133
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,598
Sempai...

134
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,193
- But why?
- It doesn't matter...

135
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,450
...he would have found out eventually!

136
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,955
He's just got to hold on.

137
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,196
Gunma is almost in second place...

138
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,350
and they he'll have a chance to win!

139
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,438
We can't give up
on him at this point!

140
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,277
Where they just making fun of me!

141
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,871
I thought that was him...

142
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,916
...I actually thought he came back.

143
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,475
It was only a dummy!
What a joke!

144
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,955
I should have know better...

145
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,110
...how could I allow myself to be tricked!

146
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,836
They tricked me!

147
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,588
Damn it! This can't
be happening to me!

148
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,591
I though Haitani was great!

149
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,069
Better for us!
Now Gunma can win!

150
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,319
This is it!
Only one more car to overcome!

151
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,359
Come on, Gunma!
We know you can do it!

152
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,278
Hooray!
Faster! Faster! Faster!

153
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,436
- Hooray! He did it!
- He's won! Great job!

154
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,434
- Come on! Come on!
- You're the best!

155
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,595
Now you'll understand!
Next time never make a fool of me!

156
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,757
Oh, what the?

157
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,031
What was that for?
What did we ever do to him!

158
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,358
What's wrong with him?
He never changes!

159
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,271
You got that right!

160
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,959
He's so good that
he could win again!

161
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,156
I don't believe it!

162
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,429
Give me my money!
I want it now!

163
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,914
How can you take the
money when I didn't win.

164
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,914
And since I didn't win
you don't deserve the money.

165
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,878
What are you doing?
I deserve that money!

166
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,030
I was your fault, so I'll keep the money.

167
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,951
Take my hands off of me!

168
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,951
It's not my fault if you lost.

169
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,031
Weren't you paying attention on the last lap!

170
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,997
If the water wasn't leaking...

171
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,355
...you probably would
have won the race!

172
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,793
What did you say?
If you had serviced it better...

173
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,633
- I would have won!
- You have some nerve ...

174
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,676
- ...to blame me!
- Hey stop it!

175
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,356
- You mechanical misfit!
- Sempai!

176
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,396
- Gunma!
- Come on!

177
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,830
- Help!
- Get back here!

178
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,956
- Let me go!
- I won't!

179
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,031
- Stop it both of you!
- But my money!

180
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,475
Gunma! Gunma, control yourself!

181
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,315
- Man, what a show!
- Driving ain't so easy.

182
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,233
They say he wants
to go to Formula 3...

183
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,630
...all because Hiziri
got there before he did!

184
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,516
- What a spectacle!
- But to race in Formula 3...

185
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,250
- ...you need money!
- He'll need a sponsor.

186
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,570
Yeah, how sad.

187
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,153
Make sure that machine is well polished!

188
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,370
- I got it!
- And don't get cocky!

189
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,358
Just because you were
right doesn't mean your good!

190
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,313
Hey! Since your Hiziri's favorite we'll...

191
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,436
...make you work even harder!

192
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,900
- I understand!
- Good!

193
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,751
Then get to work immediately!

194
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,597
What do you want?

195
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,359
Hiziri wants you to
go to his studio.

196
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,471
It's rather important.

197
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,957
Cheers!

198
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,597
Come on.

199
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,759
- If you have something
to say then say it!
- You are a fool!

200
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,312
You let victory slip
through your fingers.

201
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,277
Why did you do that?

202
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,794
Even though you had my back...

203
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,235
...you made me think
that Tamotsu came back!

204
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,470
We're didn't mean to make fun of you.

205
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,109
We were hoping you'd stop worrying ...

206
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,077
...and concentrate on the race.

207
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,950
And this is the thanks
we get after all we've done.

208
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,434
Consider yourself lucky
that we are even celebrating!

209
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,151
However, since you saw
that dummy of ours,

210
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,200
you became more
focused on the race!

211
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,039
You were able to see
how important it was,

212
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,680
that Tamotsu needed
to be by your side!

213
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,798
You have quite the fragile,
unstable and emotional character...

214
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,348
...and how you always
need someone to help you!

215
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,269
What's wrong!
Sempai, calm down!

216
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,153
Next time be careful
about what you say!

217
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,358
Remember the old saying:
"The truth offends"!

218
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,109
This shows that, after
so long, I still don't know!

219
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,196
Listen up!

220
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,754
I'll tell you.

221
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,676
I don't need Tamotsu's help!

222
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,830
I don't want to talk about him.

223
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,357
Remember why I asked
you all to come here.

224
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,630
I have decided to appoint ...

225
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,109
...Tamotsu as the chief mechanic!

226
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,598
That's not fair.

227
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,274
He hasn't been here that long.

228
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,034
He's right, but we've
been here for years!

229
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,957
I know.

230
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,714
I know that you
are great mechanics ...

231
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,677
...and I'll remember you as such.

232
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,473
That's the reason why
I have always trusted you!

233
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,520
And, I will continue to do so.

234
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,397
Are you trying to humiliate us

235
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,311
..by making him the chief!

236
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,550
I need to win Formula 3.

237
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,272
Age and career don't matter!
Only your skills do!

238
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,189
I'm sure you agree
with what I said.

239
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,950
- Sure, boss!
- Sure, boss!

240
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,313
Tamotsu is a very young boy,
but he is also very good.

241
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,039
He knows how to
communicate with the machine.

242
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,029
But I don't want to be chief!

243
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,116
I just want to take care of the car!

244
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,919
I'm sure that you'll be
fine with your work.

245
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,430
And we'll do our
best to help you, right?

246
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,677
But I can't!

247
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,636
Congratulations, boss!

248
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,678
It seems that I'm thanking you again.

249
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:24,071
Okay! From tomorrow everyone
will do their best to help Tamotsu!

250
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,032
They didn't accept that.

251
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,076
Disregard what others think!

252
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,357
B-But, they...

253
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,268
I asked you to come
here to take care of my car.

254
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,078
Now hurry up and
make sure it goes very loud!

255
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,271
Even just for a day!

256
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,671
Despite the rain,
Gunma could have won.

257
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,072
This time I'm really
tired of his tantrums!

258
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,077
I know.

259
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,236
Why are you laughing?

260
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,749
- I feel very relieved.
- Eh?!

261
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,077
Since Tamotsu is gone,
I saw Gunma react!

262
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,437
- He's never done that before.
- You're right.

263
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,950
Will I get by without the help of Tamotsu!

264
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,270
Tamotsu, I'll show you.

265
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,758
I will win one race after the other!

266
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,031
I'll win the next one,
and the one after that!

267
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,676
Everyone will adore me.

268
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,355
And next season I'll race
in Formula 3! That's a promise.

269
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,515
- Listen up, Gunma...
- What?! He's gone?

270
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,070
I'm sure he went to
Suzuka to watch Hiziri race!

271
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,152
In the next episode.

272
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,196
Gunma vs. Hiziri!!
I Am the Champ!

273
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,870
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

274
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:30,250
I saw you crying after
you were abandoned

275
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,150
Let's climb that hill
and look back down

276
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,250
In the big world it's undeniable

277
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:52,000
Yesterday's pain is
not visible anymore

278
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,500
OK Let's start it

279
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,500
In order to grieve

280
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,700
Ah It's as if we weren't born

281
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:16,950
You are my energy, You are my energy

282
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,350
Courage come out

283
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:28,650
By just being with you

1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,470
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,470
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,120
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,120
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,470
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:28,370
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,370
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:33,670
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,970
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,470
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:50,970
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,220
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,770 --> 00:01:01,720
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,220
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He Really Is a Genius?
 Gunma Runs Amok

16
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,277
VICTORY AT ALL COSTS!
GUNMA

17
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,911
Come on, Gunma! Don't you
dare fail! Do your best!

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,355
Madam, we have to at
least wait til he's finished!

19
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,358
The driver who completes the
fastest lap, wins the Pole ...

20
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,352
I don't care about
any of that, okay?

21
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,757
- Come on, you can do it!
- That hurt!

22
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,348
Excuse me, Hiziri, I'm from a magazine...

23
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,040
It's a great honor
to have met you.

24
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,755
Thanks, but I'm here
for personal business.

25
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,834
As I said on the
phone, we decided ...

26
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,673
to dedicate a long
article to you in the next issue.

27
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,836
Call it a homage!

28
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,831
We could not ignore the champion ...

29
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,070
...who in mid-season
switched to Formula 3.

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,831
You flatter me.

31
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,516
Tamotsu, what's the time?

32
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,836
- What's the matter?

33
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,356
I can hardly believe it!

34
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,914
DANGER! TO PREVENT
ACCIDENTS STAY AWAY!

35
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,116
SPECTATORS SHOULD MOVE ELSEWHERE

36
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,351
Because man wants to
conquer space at all costs?

37
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,516
Only Gunma will
give me the answer!

38
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,477
He who gives his all \Min every race ...

39
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,028
...risks his life
to enjoy driving fast!

40
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,834
If I don't say it,
no one will!

41
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,517
That's why I will study
Gunma's guidance in detail .

42
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,512
Who knows what prompts
him to drive fast ...!

43
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,958
This is it!

44
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,073
Amazing, Gunma!

45
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,756
Oh! what?

46
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,957
What is this...!

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,514
- 01:02:07?!
- It can't be!

48
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,511
Tamotsu, are you
sure that's right?

49
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,477
Yes, of course it's right!

50
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,279
I may have pressed
the button too soon.

51
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,916
But I could be wrong.

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,753
but this time is close to Hiziri's time...

53
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,673
...which is 01:01:47!

54
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,436
- I don't believe it!
- I'll write it down anyway.

55
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,273
It's his best time,
although could be a mistake.

56
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,237
Should it be written down.

57
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,517
Are you crazy?
Everyone will laugh at us!

58
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,111
- Sorry, I'll be more careful.
- Look!

59
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,754
- Here he comes!
- Gunma.

60
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,948
Can you give me
your opinion on these tests?

61
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,435
And the way the
drivers tackle the curves!

62
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,354
Which of them has impressed you the most?
Your opinion is valuable to us!

63
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,950
I'm really Flattered, but I think ...

64
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,031
...your over thinking this.

65
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,510
The circuit seems
empty without you.

66
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,831
It seems that the boy,
will take all the attention!

67
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,275
His car is out of control.

68
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,233
The driver and his machine must ...

69
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,834
...both work together
and form a bond.

70
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,510
Usually a driver will try and
get too much out of his car.

71
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,750
- ...and he'll lose!
- Huh?!

72
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,953
01:02:05?

73
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,151
Yet the stopwatch works perfectly.

74
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,196
Tamotsu can't be wrong again!

75
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,676
So we have to agree
that this is his real time.

76
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,077
This is impossible!
I can't believe my eyes.

77
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,913
Even if I did set
up the car myself!

78
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,550
His time is out of this world!

79
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,950
There is something strange about it!

80
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,189
Did Gunma rig it?

81
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,039
You have to expect this from him,

82
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,236
No, no, it can not be!

83
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,233
He could never have
done something like that!

84
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,517
I've drove countless times on this track,

85
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,591
and I can assure you that...

86
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,911
...the sharp bends,
will not stop you at top speed,

87
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,389
it takes skill to deal with the curves...

88
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,357
..the make your best time!

89
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,278
Your words do nothing
but increase my skepticism.

90
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,072
I don't think that Gunma
has ever been so clever.

91
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,358
Gunma, doesn't have
enough experience to do it.

92
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,596
Though I'm not so sure
about him driving on this track.

93
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,150
In a straight line, but
especially when tackling the curves,

94
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,276
you must maintain the correct trajectory.

95
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,113
You can't do it with intuition alone!

96
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,439
But only if he had
the intuition of genius!

97
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,630
Isn't that how you define Gunma...

98
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,756
...isn't it?

99
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,189
It's true... The answer
was right in front of me!

100
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,277
A really great time!
01:02:04!

101
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,277
The pole position is now yours!

102
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,591
No one can beat me!

103
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,031
How dare that brat?

104
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,956
- Gunma!
- Junko, what's my time?

105
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,952
Right!

106
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,755
Are you sure this is right?

107
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,277
I understand your doubts,
but there are no errors.

108
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,113
- Its a great time.
- Still...

109
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,156
But I though I was
a couple of seconds faster.

110
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,835
Instead I have been so slow?

111
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,278
Well, before the official
announcement let's go for a drink.

112
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,837
Gunma, tell me the truth!

113
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,189
How could you
get a time like this?

114
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,154
You must have done something?
Tell me the truth!

115
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,435
Hey, what are you talking about?

116
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,077
Gunma!

117
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,236
What's wrong with you,
Tamotsu?

118
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,830
Look, I am your trusted mechanic,

119
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,832
therefore you must
hide no secrets from me!

120
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,115
Let me go!
You're hurting me!

121
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,509
- Answer me!
- Let go!

122
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,511
Not until you tell the truth!

123
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,477
I don't have any secrets.

124
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,676
The truth is, I'm a genius!

125
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,349
And I'm sure I could
improve that time if I wanted to!

126
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,756
Hey, what's taking so long?

127
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,436
There must be a mistake!

128
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,596
Both of us have similar times.

129
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,810
What! In Pole-Position
is Gunma Akagi!

130
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,956
- You know him?
- No, I don't!

131
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,996
Never heard of him.

132
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,430
01:01:30

133
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,353
He beat the record I set last year.

134
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,955
Hey! There must be
something wrong with the time!

135
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,595
- 01:01:30!
- Seriously!

136
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,951
- A guy called Gunma Akgai
has beaten the record?
- Who is he?

137
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,589
Do you realize?
He beaten Hiziri's record!

138
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,913
Gentlemen, I'm the fastest!

139
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,955
Gunma,
stop showing off!

140
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,079
Gentlemen, I invite you
all to drink to my health!

141
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,757
He's really a nice guy!

142
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,355
I needed a cold drink.

143
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,074
My friends!
I propose a toast:

144
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,674
Gunma Akagi's first great victory!

145
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,869
Stop it, you ingrates!

146
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,394
Is that the thank you
I get for getting you drinks!

147
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,357
- Let's go!
- How ungrateful!

148
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,639
- Gunma, stop it,
that's enough!

149
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,549
- Try to calm down!
- Let me go!

150
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,436
Now that's a surprise!
A practically unknown driver

151
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,954
...managed to beat
your previous record!

152
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,556
- What's your response?
-  You see, an exceptional driver ...

153
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,632
is usually accompanied by
a extraordinary mechanic!

154
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,231
An extraordinary mechanic
prepares awesome cars!

155
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,830
Though sometimes,
the machine is ...

156
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,876
...is better than the driver!

157
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,957
Right.

158
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,758
By the way, do you know
this rising star of motoring?

159
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,633
It doesn't matter
if I know him!

160
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,394
I have a goal to achieve!
Mine is a challenge ...

161
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,074
...that takes all my energy, and my purpose...

162
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,116
... is to set new records!

163
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,760
The others do not
concern me in any way.

164
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,994
Can I take your picture ...

165
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,036
...while you do a handshake...

166
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,350
- ...with the rising star?
- What?!

167
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,637
It's a good idea to take
a picture with...

168
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,188
... the future
champion of Formula 3!

169
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,958
Alright.

170
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,672
Gunma, will you stop
fooling around and listen to me?

171
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,950
You cannot continue
to act like this!

172
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,514
You must get along
with the other mechanics and drivers ...

173
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,477
...if you want to keep driving!

174
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,437
This isn't funny at all!

175
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,080
- Are you even listening?
- Huh?!

176
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,150
- Gunma!
- Stop yelling!

177
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,834
I don't care if
people like me or not!

178
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,596
- Why are those two like that?
- Because their friends!

179
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,597
It's the same thing every day.

180
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,240
Let's just let them
fight it out, let's go.

181
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,119
Listen to me, Gunma!
Try to be calm!...

182
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,714
Your not the only
on the track, you know!

183
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,552
Shut up!

184
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,437
Your always do this.

185
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,193
You never listen
to a word I say.

186
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,198
Your always getting into trouble.

187
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,870
But I'm willing to
put up with your tantrums,

188
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,190
but others will not.

189
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,118
We're only beginners
in the middle of the season!

190
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,073
And only after two races
you've got a Pole-Position!

191
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,914
Do you realize what this means?

192
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,309
No, and I do not care!

193
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,550
- but I know I'm the bets.
- Eh?!

194
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,316
You know, Gunma, other drivers
have run on this track for years,

195
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,960
- don't take this so lightly.
- I won't.

196
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,029
Where would I
be without you, eh?

197
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,597
Gunma, I understand
that you're excited and happy ...

198
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,750
...since you beat the record...

199
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,278
...but you shouldn't have
toasted before you won!

200
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,756
You have not only increased
the envy of those people!

201
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,790
And with your cocky attitude ...

202
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,836
...you've made enemies of the drivers!

203
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,632
Boring as usual!
You never change,

204
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,357
Do you remember that day
in the countryside when we met Hiziri?

205
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,630
And all you did was apologize.

206
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,676
You've always been like that.

207
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,956
Haven't you?

208
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,675
You've got to be
deluded if you think that...

209
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,637
...everybody's a nice guy.

210
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,958
Do you think they will change
if I act differently?

211
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,117
I'm sure that when we race ...

212
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,760
...they would become my enemies anyway.

213
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,276
On this I agree with you.

214
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,950
But you shouldn't hate them
anymore than what's needed!

215
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,074
Maybe guys like you
can also have a ...

216
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,628
...peaceful race in the company of friends,

217
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,116
but not me!

218
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,719
You never know,
you've just got to keep at it!

219
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,951
You've just got to
do your best and you'll win!

220
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,914
That greenhorn!
He's just lucky that ...

221
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,230
...he was able to beat Hiziri's record!

222
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,233
But he doesn't know
who he's dealing with!

223
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,630
Hey there buddy,
your time was very amateurish!

224
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,915
What's wrong?
You got lady problems?

225
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,434
Let's see if I'm right,
you're so used to...

226
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,988
...chasing girls that you can't think of...

227
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,514
...anything else and
you can't driver properly?

228
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,109
Bad habits die hard!

229
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,231
- That guy gets on my nerves!
- Yeah!

230
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,278
- I've got a debt to settle with him!
- You do?

231
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,918
Do me a favor if it doesn't
bother you too much.

232
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,754
Gunma, in order to move forward,
we have stick together!

233
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,520
You see, I'm your mechanic
and I know all about you!

234
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,273
But you always insist on
doing things your own way!

235
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,275
The trouble is that
our goal is the same,

236
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,272
but we use different means.
Isn't that right, Gunma?

237
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,357
Ruiko!

238
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,277
Here, inside you'll
find your work program.

239
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,878
I wonder who drew
these three pictures of Gunma?

240
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,916
Hey!

241
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,956
This is a prohibited area!

242
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,918
- Hurry, get away from there!
- I'm sorry.

243
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,951
A new round of testing
is about to begin, understand?

244
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,072
Hiziri wants a response
as soon as possible.

245
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,915
I'll be waiting.
Bye!

246
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,956
Good luck for the race!

247
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,476
Part tomorrow!

248
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,277
Maybe Gunma really is a genius!

249
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,915
This is a very important race for him!

250
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,355
He can only rely on himself to win.

251
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,196
Go on, let it all out,

252
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,510
- ...because it will be your last!

253
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:17,029
Sempai! Look what
I found along the way! Look!

254
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,635
- Eh?!
- Along the grass path ...

255
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,029
...there were just scattered everywhere!

256
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,236
Cherish them as if
they were relics!

257
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,197
Stop making absurd speeches!
Your not a saint!

258
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,753
- What's going on?
- Eh?! What did you say?

259
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,197
You placed those in
strategic places, didn't you?

260
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,037
- I don't know!
- Come on, stop lying.

261
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,315
Those drawings
served you as a reference ..

262
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,153
...for the race,
didn't they Gunma?

263
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,078
Ready!

264
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,277
Last night I came here,
and secretly ...

265
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,316
...I placed all those references.

266
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,914
They remind me of
the recommend speed.

267
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,197
I did this so I could
improve my time on the track.

268
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,236
I thought it would be easier ...

269
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,276
... since I highlighted the key points.

270
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,831
I have also placed other signals:
woven grass, flowers on the fence,

271
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,236
- Drawings on the wall.
- Huh.

272
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,357
Now I understand how you
were driving magnificently.

273
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,756
It's really brilliant!
Wouldn't you say?

274
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,268
Why are you surprised?
Other riders are using this system.

275
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,758
Then it is true,
even geniuses work hard!

276
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,268
Oh, Sempai.
Now I feel bad because...

277
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,352
I didn't help you out
with your valuable signals.

278
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,233
Don't worry about that.
I don't need them anymore.

279
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,356
I've memorized everything!

280
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,118
Gunma!
I really hope so.

281
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,676
- Is there something wrong?

282
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,030
It's nothing.

283
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,197
Tell us, Hiziri, who
do you think will come first?

284
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,675
Well, we'll know once
the race has ended.

285
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,429
But it will certainly be
the car with the best setup ...

286
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,954
..and the driver who has
the most experienced mechanic.

287
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,429
Do you know how long it takes
to change tires during a race?

288
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,955
Don't be surprised!
To change all four tires ...

289
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,076
... it takes eight seconds!
Only eight measly seconds!

290
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,276
In the next episode:

291
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,237
Short Lived First Victory!
Tamotsu's Betrayal

292
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,153
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

293
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:13,750
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

294
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:19,700
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

295
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:26,000
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

296
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:35,800
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

297
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:44,700
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

298
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:50,400
These feelings
just flare up

299
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

300
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,400
The fantasy penetrates through you

301
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,600
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

302
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:15,450
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:09,900
Formula 1 - Engines on The Track

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,800
My heart's continuous signal of love

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,800
It's that way because
I want to embrace you

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,200
And as I waited I
decided to dance slowly

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,200
Both of us could
read each other's lips

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,500
We secretly bathed
in the moonlight

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,300
After the goodbye

8
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:44,750
You left without leaving a clue

9
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,000
Don't betray me Darlin'
She passed through the city

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,650
Nobody knows Love Affair

11
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,050
Together until the morning

12
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,550
Making Love and no more

13
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,150
I felt you when I
touched your hand

14
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,700
Your a woman

15
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,250
Love Affair

16
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,800
Together until the morning

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,500
Making Love and no more

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,100
Those words of love
that you want to hear

19
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,800
Your a woman

20
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,000
Just before the F3 Debut
Gunma's Visited by the Black Devil's Hand

21
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,156
His style is getting
better every day!

22
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,236
I can barely believe ...

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,550
...he only started with the
Formula 3 just 10 days ago!

24
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,680
Yes!
But he drives too fast.

25
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,076
That's not very safe.

26
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,436
Speed isn't everything.

27
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,750
I know that
speed is not everything,

28
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,957
but I find his determination exhilarating.
He'll learn over time.

29
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,836
He reminds me of that time...

30
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,036
...when I tried it once in my life.

31
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,078
It was twenty years ago,
when I saw you drive, Kuroi!

32
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,839
That guy drives with the same
determination that you once drove with.

33
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,997
- Attack!
- Come on!

34
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,000
And now a toast to Gunma
and his debut in Formula 3!

35
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,989
- Cheers!
- Thank you, my friends!

36
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,988
I still can't believe that
you'll be entering Formula 3!

37
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,111
I thought it would
take at least six months ...

38
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,031
...for you to make it.

39
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,317
- It's all about skill and talent!
- You are a genius!

40
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,751
Well, soon enough
you'll all see what I'm made of.

41
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,236
After I win the races in
Formula 3 I'll head to Formula 1.

42
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,153
Monaco, Brazil ... All the
grand prizes will be mine!

43
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,076
You serious?

44
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,517
Sure! But what
about the train tickets?

45
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,071
Yes! Yasu decided to
reserve seats for everyone! First class!

46
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,636
Meanwhile, he and Kuroi will
bring the car to the circuit tonight!

47
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,676
Tomorrow we will all be there!

48
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,352
And as soon as we get there
, I will send the pass to enter!

49
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,236
So will you be rooting for me!
I need your support!

50
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,439
I will be cheering you on
like a young girl at a rock concert!

51
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,074
Really? I didn't know
you were young.

52
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,518
We won't be able to
make it, we've got work.

53
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,109
Yeah! Though I hope you win the race.

54
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,191
- You serious?
- Yes.

55
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,714
We can't stop
work even for a day.

56
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,553
- I really hope your kidding.
- We're not, Gunma!

57
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,998
Come on, guys!
Don't make a fuss!

58
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,033
You can't do this, you must
come and see me tomorrow!

59
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,556
Because I will be fighting
with Tamotsu and Hiziri.

60
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,951
I know...
it's because your jealous of me.

61
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,836
My friends, it will be a
fantastic race! Don't miss it!

62
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,078
- So you'll go?
- I told you, we have work!

63
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,590
Someone else can do your job!
Don't be a spoilsport

64
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,194
What! This is not
a job that ...

65
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,840
- ...I can just leave!
- What?

66
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,593
Hey, brat, don't
make such a fuss.

67
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,511
Your making too much noise.

68
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,670
Am I wrong or
do you want a drink?

69
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,758
You little shit!

70
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,755
Someone please stop them!

71
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,236
I won't show
you any mercy!

72
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,878
Sempai!

73
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,757
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!

74
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,596
You shouldn't have done that!

75
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,356
Stop that right now!

76
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,000
Hold it!

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,510
Cowards, where are
you going? Come back!

78
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,676
- Hold it right there!
- Hey, let me go!

79
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,830
- What are you doing? It was them!
- Shut up! Come with us!

80
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,153
What?!

81
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,029
- Come on, let's get to work.
- Oh, yeah.

82
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,032
If we do it now,
we can take a nap later!

83
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,033
I'll check the stock,
while you get the doors,

84
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,076
- ...and close the windows.
- Right.

85
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,951
What's that?

86
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,837
I wonder?

87
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,077
Come on, stop moving!

88
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,549
Why the hell
did the cops take me?

89
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,438
When I find those two,
I'll make them pay!

90
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,314
Your hurting me!

91
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,914
I hope this time
you've learned your lesson!

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,956
Lesson ?!
It wasn't my fault

93
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,429
It's not about
who is right or wrong!

94
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,831
If you got your way,
what do you think would happen?

95
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,996
I though you were a professional!

96
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,594
Yeah, but what
do you mean by that?

97
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,032
Help! This is Yasu!
We need help!

98
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,838
Get here quickly,
they are destroying everything!

99
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,751
Help, they've got me!

100
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,517
- Gunma!
- Sempai!

101
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,633
Smash it all!

102
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,077
Don't!

103
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,636
Why, just why?

104
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,078
They destroyed
everything for no reason!

105
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,270
What did we do wrong?

106
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,676
- Yasu!
- Gunma!

107
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,716
- Kuroi!
- Call an ambulance!

108
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,109
There is a phone booth
on the street corner!

109
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,156
- Quickly, go!
- Sure!

110
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,356
My Formula 3!

111
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,592
I can't believe it!
My Formula 3 is burning!

112
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,555
There's nothing
more we can do, Sempai!

113
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,990
Sempai, stop it!

114
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,310
Everything here is burning!

115
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,356
Let's go!
Sempai!

116
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,956
Stop it, sempai!

117
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,436
S-sempai!

118
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,517
Sempai.

119
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,837
- Everything's been destroyed!
- Gunma...!

120
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,669
- Are you alright, Kishida?
- Yes... I think.

121
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,349
OPERATION IN PROGRESS

122
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,274
Did you see who did this?

123
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,836
Do you have any
idea who sent them?

124
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,591
Come on, you saw
their faces didn't you?

125
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,918
They came with bulldozers
and broke through the wall ...

126
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,275
Before we knew it
they were already inside!

127
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,273
We were not able
to look at their faces!

128
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,235
Where do you think your going?

129
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,356
Please don't scream,\M we are in the hospital!

130
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,870
What do we do now?

131
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,758
He didn't say a word!
And won't even eat!

132
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,477
I feel sorry for him!
He lost a unique opportunity!

133
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,436
I have never been in
agreement with Gunma's decisions.

134
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,750
I knew something was wrong.

135
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,598
Exactly! I don't know if
Kuroi was a legend or not,

136
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,636
but I never liked the guy.

137
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,596
Don't talk nonsense!

138
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,269
- Are you crazy?
- No! Gunma can no longer ...

139
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,635
"participate in the race
and you continue to play ...

140
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,757
- ... As if nothing had happened!
- Listen ...

141
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,677
Don't you remember that we
worked with him for a long time!

142
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,917
It's only natural that we forget
about what happened the other day.

143
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,359
Do you think that we...

144
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,757
...don't care. It's just that
Gunma is unlucky, get it!

145
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,316
Why should we cry
when it wasn't even our fault.

146
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,510
And we can't even
give him back his car!

147
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,308
Gunma a stubborn person!
He won't give up so easily!

148
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,960
Soon we will see
him leave. And we'll say, "Yo!"

149
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,837
And then we start over!

150
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,309
Watch where you throw the ball!

151
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,437
- Gunma!
- Sempai!

152
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,590
Hey, don't you want
a nice cup of tea?

153
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,835
- What?! He's not back yet?
- Yes!

154
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,673
We have received your reservation,
and all is in order.

155
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,837
Is that so...
Thank you.

156
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,555
I have dealt with them personally!

157
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,876
But the one who will
suffer most will be Gunma!

158
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,756
And listen up,
don't you dare cry for him.

159
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,996
My father was right when he said ...

160
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,036
...I was a fool to give you money!

161
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,357
And I was even more crazy ...

162
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,670
...when I asked you what you needed!

163
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,597
But you know, now I
understand all too well!

164
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,635
I swear that I'll never
make the same mistake twice.

165
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,348
You see, I discovered
an interesting thing!

166
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,438
The more you trust a person,
the more they will betray you.

167
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,352
That's the truth.

168
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,997
Yuki.

169
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,353
Please, Yuki, forget about
Gunma and live with me!

170
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,436
I need you!

171
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,990
Oh, Yuki, you don't know
how much I need you!

172
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,634
Yuki, I love you!
I love you!

173
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,075
I am willing to do anything for you!

174
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,595
Gunma Akagi

175
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,633
Gunma! I thought that
you would have raced in Formula 3!

176
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,632
Tamotsu! Try to concentrate
on todays race.

177
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,714
I must absolutely
win it and I don't need...

178
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,917
...you being distracted!
I need you.

179
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,357
Y-yes.

180
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,552
You shouldn't throw
away your ticket.

181
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,596
Well, I don't need it.

182
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,430
If things had gone
as they should have,

183
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,670
you'd be in the preliminaries!

184
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,350
I discussed this
affair with Kuroi and ...

185
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,632
And I'm afraid there
is no hope for our team!

186
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,518
- Eh?!
- Really?

187
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,152
What are you saying?
Can't we start over again!

188
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,034
Who are you kidding!
That's crazy!

189
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,156
It would take at least 500 million!

190
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,676
Then that's it! Just find a
sponsor and that's us!

191
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,270
You and your friend Kuroi,
at least owe me this, eh?

192
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,356
But why?

193
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,919
Try to understand, Gunma!
If we don't offer concrete results,

194
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,992
- nobody will sponsor us.
- Who cares about results!

195
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,071
If I drove,
I would have definitely won!

196
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,631
What's wrong with you, Gunma?
Don't you think I know that!

197
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,312
I've decided!
I'll race in Formula 3

198
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,956
...without your help!

199
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:07,829
Hiziri! You are the best!

200
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,679
Great job,
you're the strongest!

201
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,040
So, Kuroi, how are you?

202
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,998
You know, I continued to
call to get in touch,

203
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,356
...with our sponsors. They
might have been threatened like us.

204
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,632
Yes, it's possible!
Though...

205
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,154
Have you talked with
Gunma about our decision?

206
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,553
Of course I did.
He was furious!

207
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,349
- I thought as much.
- Though, I'm sorry.

208
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,960
- Kishida, are you hungry?
- Yeah,

209
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,351
- Would you like something to drink?
- Why not.

210
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,234
- Why don't we have a game?
- Why not.

211
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,039
- And if I was to drive?
- It's a good idea!

212
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,235
- I have one desire ...!
- Me too!

213
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,357
- Then let's do it!
- Yes!

214
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,830
This won't stop me!
I'll show them.

215
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,030
Sempai, but...

216
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,271
I promise you, Kishida!
I will return to racing at any cost!

217
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,951
Yes, sempai!

218
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,949
- ... We will not give up!
- We will not surrender!

219
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,435
I wasn't born to be beaten.

220
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:49,432
Eh ?! They withdrew
Gunma's license ?!

221
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,034
It can't be!
What did he do this time?

222
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,237
No, he didn't do anything!
- Damn!

223
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,197
In the next episode:

224
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,918
Gunma's License Is
Taken by Force, He Can't Run!

225
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,072
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

226
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:28,650
I saw you crying after
you were abandoned

227
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,550
Let's climb that hill
and look back down

228
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,650
In the big world it's undeniable

229
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:50,400
Yesterday's pain is
not visible anymore

230
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,900
OK Let's start it

231
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,900
In order to grieve

232
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,100
Ah It's as if we weren't born

233
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:15,350
You are my energy, You are my energy

234
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,750
Courage come out

235
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:27,050
By just being with you

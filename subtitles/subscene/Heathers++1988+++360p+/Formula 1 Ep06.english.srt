1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,150
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,150
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,500
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,700
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,000
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,000
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,250
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,750
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,250
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,436
Tamotsu, in the world
there is two men that I hate.

16
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,748
One of them is an asshole! Do you
remember him?The one who beat us.

17
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,436
There are tons of people who are
a lot faster than you in the world of racing!

18
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,268
As for the other one,
it's my old man!

19
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,748
I hate him for abandoning
my mother, I've never forgiven him!

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,517
I know I did the right
thing by coming to Tokyo!

21
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,229
I will do anything to
become the fastest in the world!

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,836
But to achieve this,
I need you,

23
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,276
your a genius with engines!

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,956
I'm glad I came here
from the countryside!

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,473
Now I've got
myself a FJ 1600.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,956
and I've even got a license!

27
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,949
We'll make it!
So, follow me, Tamotsu!

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Junko's Love! He's the
Guy Who Saw the Limit of Speed

29
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,829
I'm sorry that I got
you involved with this Junko .

30
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,876
Now worries.
It's alright.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,956
You really are too kind.

32
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,235
You've wasted so much
time with those lessons!

33
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,471
Gunma, say something!

34
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,273
Come see the
beautiful crescent moon!

35
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,516
Isn't it romantic!

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,955
I've never seen the moon like this.

37
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,996
It reminds me of love.

38
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,510
Even in the country
it's nice and shiny,

39
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,556
but your prettier, Junko .

40
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,597
Hey, Gunma! Morioka
loaned us this tape,

41
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,636
so you could
at least look at it!

42
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,550
Tamotsu, didn't you say that...

43
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,710
...you had
a date with a girl?

44
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,916
Stop trying to trick me!

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,072
Couldn't you at
least go make a snack!

46
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,879
But I'm not hungry Gunma!

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,560
Com one!
What are you stupid?

48
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,758
Give me a
moment alone with the girl!

49
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,950
You struggled to
get your license,

50
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,759
and now your trying this
right after being arrested!

51
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,434
Why are you reminding me?

52
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,631
- Because it's the truth!
- Come here!

53
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,870
No need to get serious, Gunma!

54
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,674
To drive on the track
you need a special license...

55
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,830
..but all you have is a normal one!

56
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,155
So how are you gonna race?

57
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,349
Even though the
tape is boring to you,

58
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,159
you've gotta watch
it so you can learn!

59
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,800
Try to understand, Gunma!

60
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,075
Stop screaming...

61
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,833
...I was only pretending
to choke you, honest.

62
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,876
I wasn't serious!

63
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,192
- How far are you willing to go?
- I'm sorry.

64
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,599
Your goal!
Do you think you will achieve it?

65
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,270
- Come on Tamotsu, you tell her!
- Of course...

66
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,478
He hasn't had any
serious thoughts on the matter!

67
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,757
If possible,
he'd like to enter Formula 3!

68
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,033
- What was that for?
- Your wrong, Tamotsu!

69
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,556
Formula 1!

70
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,269
Formula 1!

71
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,869
Formula 1!

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,514
Formula 1!

73
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,155
So that's your life long dream!

74
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,070
- It's not a dream!
- Then what is it?

75
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,353
You don't understand,
Formula 1 is not a joke!

76
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,795
You have to
be a great driver...

77
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,235
...if you want to
compete on the track!

78
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,756
You're so pretty
but your annoying!

79
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,429
Well, wait and see!
If you have the patience,

80
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,795
one day you'll see the
moon at Monte Carlo,

81
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,314
- If you're nice to me!
- Stop it!

82
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,277
- What did I say?
- Hey,

83
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,316
I'm gonna give
you some advice!

84
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,949
If you want to become a real driver
you have to get to know yourself,

85
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,315
and stop acting
like you know it all!

86
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,356
Is it me or is it warm in here?

87
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,955
That's because life is ...

88
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,916
Too precious to waste!

89
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,789
You done yet?
You worry too much ...

90
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,836
...you need to
have some compassion.

91
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,835
Or maybe I'm wrong this time?

92
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,550
No, no, you're right!

93
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,792
- Good morning, Grandma!
- Is it time to get up?

94
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,757
It's the afternoon!

95
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,400
Did you forget that you have to train?

96
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,869
- I got my license suspended!
- You don't...

97
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,520
... have time for this!
Tamotsu told me ...

98
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,431
...that theres
other ways to train.

99
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,397
That friend of yours
has a heart of gold!

100
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,391
Don't waste valuable time,

101
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,675
watch the tapes Morioka sent!

102
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,916
Heres Junko 's room key.

103
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,755
But I warn you, Gunma,
in that room ...

104
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,559
...don't you touch
anything else but the VCR.

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,549
What do you mean, Grandma?
Don't you trust me!

106
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,596
Do you think that I would search around ...

107
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,557
- ...in Junko 's room?
- Yes!

108
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,599
This isn't fun at all,
I'm just a fool...

109
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,511
...acting like this!

110
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,596
Let's see if theres something else on.

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,992
What is it!
It must be something special.

112
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,957
I wonder what it is!

113
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,710
Maybe it's a secret of Junko 's.

114
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,234
You could never know what's on it!

115
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,279
- Junko , I love you!
- What?

116
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,953
And for you I'll do
anything to win this race.

117
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,996
I know, Ryuji!

118
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,036
Do you really love me?

119
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,797
- Come on, strike a pose!
- Well?

120
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,916
I assure you that I
have never been so serious.

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,673
We'll get married when I win,

122
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,440
What is this?
Who is Ryuji?

123
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,556
For two years now.

124
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,957
<i>Ryuji...</i>

125
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,189
Come on, Junko!

126
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,272
This will all be
settled at the finish line,

127
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,677
Her comes Ryuji!

128
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,917
No!
No!

129
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,836
Ryuji!

130
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,077
- Junko, please ...
- Move back!

131
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,469
- No! Let me see him!
- Stop it! Junko!

132
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,358
I want to see him!
Ryuji! Ryuji!

133
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,439
Answer me!
Ryuji!

134
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:51,400
Why?
Why?

135
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,675
Tell me, Grandma, who is this Ryuji?

136
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,436
Who's Ryuji?

137
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,078
Well, you see ...
It was Junko's first love.

138
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,029
Now you understand why she
doesn't like to talk about Formula 1.

139
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,874
Ryuji was an exceptional driver,
perhaps the best in the world!

140
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,550
It's easy to tell that
your in love with her.

141
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,434
Am I right, young man?

142
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,590
Don't be silly, Grandma!

143
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,190
Listen, their love was
deep and passionate.

144
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,113
Nobody in the world
will make her forget him!

145
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,476
Even you can't change that.

146
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,036
Don't forget that!

147
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,117
Ryuji!

148
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,431
Ryuji!

149
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,956
Watch out, Ryuji!

150
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,957
Ryuji!

151
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,836
Oh, no, Ryuji! Why?

152
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,032
No, don't leave me!
Don't leave me!

153
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,758
Don't leave me!
Please!

154
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,956
Please, don't leave me!

155
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,596
Don't leave me!, Ryuji!

156
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,956
Ryuji!

157
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,957
Ryuji!

158
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,156
I'm just a fool!

159
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,355
You idiot!
We'll get you...!

160
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,151
Yes, I'll tell him.

161
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,837
Yes, yes, thank you.
Bye.

162
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,916
It was a call from France ...

163
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,117
...it was about a new car.
They said that it is almost ready.

164
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,277
GAKURAZAKA POLICE DEPARTMENT

165
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,239
WE RECOMMEND A GUIDE
 BOOK JUST TO BE SAFE

166
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,675
Don't leave me, Ryuji!

167
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,152
That's enough for today.
I'll see you tomorrow morning, Tamotsu.

168
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,551
Okay.
Bye.

169
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,677
- Hello, Gunma!
- Come on, get in!

170
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,716
How was the lesson?

171
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,198
Your showing up in a tractor?

172
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,437
That's right, Morioka.

173
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,476
Did the instructors say anything?

174
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,598
Are you crazy!
What is the police stop you?

175
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,911
Why should they
It's alright,

176
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,956
I have a driver's license.

177
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,110
By the way, Tamotsu, tell me one thing:

178
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,272
How long will it take
to get my B license?

179
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,837
If you start now you
can have it by next Sunday!

180
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,754
- Do you want to take the exam?
- Of course! How long will it take ...

181
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,354
... for a motorcycle license
and a drivers license?

182
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,278
Well, a bit more!
Probably a month.

183
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,431
What? A month?!

184
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,234
- Gunma, if you don't want to ...?
- Yeah, you guessed right.

185
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,356
I will attend the race next month.

186
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,552
And Tamotsu, I'll need your help!

187
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,029
But it is too early to participate in a race!

188
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,634
I don't agree with you!
You don't understand!

189
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,950
I will race!
Very soon!

190
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,432
Yeah! Sooner than you think!
It could happen tomorrow!

191
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,028
Tell me, Gunma,
you're not mad, are you?

192
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,392
- What?
- I was just saying?

193
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,677
- What about the others?.
- Remember one thing:

194
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,955
no one will ever beat me!

195
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,390
But what happened to your belly?

196
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,391
You feeling alright?

197
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,472
Don't worry!
It's just swollen!

198
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,516
Do you know where Gunma is?

199
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,592
- We've got a surprise!
- What?! A surprise?!

200
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,116
Hey there!
We're both starving!

201
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,070
- Eh...?!
- So what!

202
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,072
Is there something wrong Gunma?

203
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,832
Dinner!

204
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,271
Serve me my dinner!

205
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,878
Stop that now!
If your so hungry,

206
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,951
go make it yourself!

207
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,636
Why didn't you tell us about him Junko ?

208
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,678
- What?!
- Maybe it was not true love.

209
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,910
He must've been a bad driver...

210
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,956
...to have an accident like that!

211
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,629
It's funny!
He was only a Formula 3 driver!

212
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,952
- What do you mean, Gunma?
- If you loved him so much,

213
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,473
why aren't you dead with him?

214
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,149
- I don't understand!
- Stop ignoring me!

215
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,196
I'm talking about Ryuji,
your great love!

216
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,317
Now I know all of your history!
I saw the tape!

217
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,073
- What did you do?
- That accident happened...

218
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,628
... right before your eyes!
But you didn't have the courage ...

219
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,551
...to die with him!

220
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,348
That's got nothing to
do with you, Gunma!

221
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,038
He must have left a lasting impression,

222
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,673
since you repeat his name at night.

223
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,554
What a mighty speech!

224
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,030
I knew you were like this!

225
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,269
- You still love him so much?
- Now you've really gone too far!

226
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,196
Please, Gunma!
Come on, calm down!

227
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,953
I decided to give you a gift.
Here it is!

228
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,677
Try it on!

229
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,510
On the left side: "G"!
And on the right side: "T"!

230
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,114
And so it becomes a "Gran Turismo" helmet!

231
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,512
Its good luck for the pilot!
Remember: treat it with love!

232
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,277
Wait a minute!

233
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,430
- Shut up, you idiot!
- Hold it!

234
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,596
Wait, Junko !

235
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,916
Let me! Don't touch me!

236
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,560
Why didn't you die
with him? Tell me?

237
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,429
I wanted to die!

238
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,196
If I had followed the fate,

239
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,276
then I wouldn't have suffered.

240
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,671
But ...
I wasn't successful!

241
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,836
Why is that?

242
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,836
Because the Ryuji that
died that day was not my Ryuji!

243
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,596
You cannot understand ...

244
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,636
...I just couldn't do it!

245
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,276
Every time that Ryuji was driving, I was at his side.

246
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,914
In those moments
we were body and soul!

247
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,633
You see, he raced as if we were one!

248
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,876
My thoughts were his!

249
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,195
I was with him always!
Always at his side!

250
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,355
But that day was different.

251
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,033
I had the feeling that Ryuji
didn't want me there with him.

252
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,953
Though it was just a gut feeling.

253
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,348
Maybe he knew something would happen!

254
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,917
Do you think so too?
I've thought about it too.

255
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,956
Maybe that's exactly what happened!

256
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,235
Then I decided to go ahead
and dedicate myself to the world of racing.

257
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,756
- Now leave me please, Gunma.
- Not yet.

258
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,673
Grandma, this helmet
is out of this world!

259
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,913
I know!
It's one of a kind!

260
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,389
It was designed by
a friend of mine just for you!

261
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,040
For real?!
But there is something missing!

262
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,116
What are you doing?

263
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,556
- Let me go!

264
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,959
At long last!
My dream has come true!

265
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,195
I won't hurt you!

266
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,356
Just a little kiss on the helmet.

267
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,677
You're a scoundrel!

268
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,119
We scoundrels get along well!

269
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,314
From now on,
your my girlfriend!

270
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,030
We'll see about that.

271
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,550
Before an important race,
I recommend everyone ...

272
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,551
...practice at the weekend!

273
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,518
You can be just like Satoru Nakajima!

274
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,551
you too can join the paddock!

275
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,596
In the next episode:

276
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,398
"The Wandering Young Woman Yuki".

277
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,552
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

278
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,550
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

279
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:19,500
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

280
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,800
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

281
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:35,600
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

282
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,500
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

283
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,200
These feelings
just flare up

284
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

285
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,200
The fantasy penetrates through you

286
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

287
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:15,250
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

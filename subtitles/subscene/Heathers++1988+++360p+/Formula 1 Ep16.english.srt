1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,370
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,370
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,020
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,020
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,370
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,270
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,270
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,570
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,870
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,370
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:50,870
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,120
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,620
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:07,120
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,071
Gunma...

16
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,279
With Hiziri's money,
we will win!

17
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,636
Why did you do this?

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,500
Gunma Returns Home!
He Learns and Unbelievable Secret

19
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,315
- Tamotsu!
- What are you doing, Gunma?

20
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,277
Stop this at once.

21
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,436
Wait til I catch you.

22
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,953
You you'll never work for Hiziri!

23
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,759
Wait a minute!
I can explain!

24
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,435
Explain then,
and be quick!

25
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,592
- Why don't you calm down?
- But I,

26
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,636
though you wanted the money!

27
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,108
I've been a
good friend, haven't I?

28
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,272
So are you going to
through away our friendship!

29
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,312
I didn't know you felt like that!

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,550
I don't deserve this betrayal!

31
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,069
I know, this is just about Ruiko?

32
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,799
Gunma, you're wrong!
I did it for the both of us!

33
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,916
That's just a lie!

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,195
Where is Hiziri having you work?

35
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,756
Don't you remember
that I can't stand him!

36
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,278
Why are you two shouting
at this hour of the morning?

37
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,598
Shut up,
this guy has betrayed me!

38
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,511
He wants to
work for my rival!

39
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,160
You know what, Gunma?
You really are a fool!

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,879
Now come down from there!
Before someone gets hurt!

41
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,076
How dare you say that!

42
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,276
Hiziri took away my best friend!

43
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,316
Should I be celebrating?

44
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,311
Anyway, come down from there!

45
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,949
Tamotsu must have his reasons
for making this decision!

46
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,794
Just talk it out like
good friends should!

47
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,758
Why should I do that, Junko?

48
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,117
I'm very calm.

49
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,919
Help! Gunma, calm down, please!

50
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,190
Hiziri said he would
give me anything I wanted,

51
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,316
in exchange for working on his car...

52
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,630
...and because he
respects me as a mechanic.

53
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,914
But, I told him that me
and you were a team,

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,560
...and I would only work
for him when I had the time.

55
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,796
I hope you learned your lesson ...

56
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,757
...and learned to talk to one another.

57
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,599
To tell you the truth,
I'm glad this happened!

58
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,636
Because we need the money!

59
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,910
Now do you understand?

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,514
- This has to happen?
- Well, I think that...

61
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,068
you were really
lucky to get the job.

62
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,116
Though you shouldn't trust him,

63
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,156
because Hiziri will want you to stay.

64
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,268
He would never do anything like that.

65
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,599
On the other hand we
cannot continue to depend...

66
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,240
to take money from our friend Morioka.

67
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,029
- Not to mention the rent!
- It's no problem.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,515
I understand! You have to
work for him because...

69
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,830
...you need to get more money.

70
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,039
Well, we probably won't be
getting a lot of money but,

71
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,953
we will be able to
participate in the next race!

72
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,957
Don't even mentioned that!

73
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,951
Consider this discussion closed!

74
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,190
How about you think,
just for a moment,

75
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,510
I would have agreed
to drive with his money?

76
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,556
Even so,
it's our only choice!

77
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,870
You absolutely have
to attend all the races!

78
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,758
You must, if you want
to switch to a higher category!

79
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,519
Ideally you should come
at least sixth in every race!

80
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,353
What? Finish sixth?

81
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,551
I can do better
than that, you know!

82
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,871
If I can drive, rest assured
that I will arrive at least first!

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,798
Listen to me carefully:
I understand your dreams of glory,

84
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,791
but reality is quite different!

85
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,838
For your car,
sixth place would be a victory.

86
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,751
Your name would become known!

87
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,717
So you may find a sponsor ...

88
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,598
...since they will
be looking for you!

89
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,514
Logically, you'd also have
a more powerful machine ...

90
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,716
...and at that point I
would have no more reason ...

91
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,677
...to work for Hiziri!

92
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,354
I agree with what Tamotsu said!

93
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,358
I also agree!
Tamotsu is absolutely right!

94
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,471
Listen, Tamotsu ...

95
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,558
I'm sorry, Tamotsu, but this
time you've gone too far!

96
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,269
And another thing: I will not
ever settle for sixth place!

97
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,194
Gunma, try to calm
down now, okay?

98
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,111
- Tamotsu!
- What!

99
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,672
This is the result of my hard work!

100
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,950
- Gunma...!
- I've earned a lot more!

101
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,349
I will do everything possible!
But only if,

102
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,510
you don't take
care of Hiziri's car!

103
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,149
How are you going to
get another 4 million by next week?

104
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,231
And then there's other races!

105
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,357
Your father can't give you money!
He needs it for the election!

106
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,471
- Then how?
- If I had to drive ...

107
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,757
...with my fathers money,
I would never forgive myself!

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,912
So you mean to ask
your brother Yuma for help?

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,752
Maybe!

110
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,838
If that's what I
have to do, then yes.

111
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,632
- What are you saying?
- Don't worry, I was joking!

112
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,236
However, I'm not going
to ask my family for money!

113
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,833
I see no other alternative
but to work for Hiziri!

114
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,275
I've come up
with an amazing idea!

115
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,596
What do you mean?

116
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,550
I'm sure, you will
earn a lot of money!

117
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,877
So you've already
been paid 500.000 Yen?!

118
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,672
Hiziri really is the
generous type, isn't he?

119
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,872
I'll have the money we
need within a week at most!

120
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,957
Don't betray me, Tamotsu!

121
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,959
What do you think of
my car? Do you like it?

122
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,952
Are you in a bad mood?
I gave you a ride, didn't I?

123
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,838
- You could be more polite!
- I'm not in a good mood.

124
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,480
If you have a
problem, just tell me.

125
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,830
I always give good advice!

126
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,309
- No, I'm alright.
- Well,

127
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,277
your not very sociable!

128
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,356
You have quite a temper, my boy!

129
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,357
Mind your own business!

130
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,833
I was only being nice!
You idiot!

131
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,075
Hey, what's her problem!
I only asked for a ride!

132
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,156
You look like a lost dog.

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,309
Eh, listen hear you fool,

134
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,356
stop with this nonsense!

135
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,197
Hey....there's no
need to get so angry...

136
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,033
...I didn't mean to offend you!

137
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,074
And.. if I were you
I'd lay off the coffee!

138
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,356
Why, is it poisoned!

139
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,398
AKAGI POLICIES MADE WITH CHARACTER!

140
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,349
POLICIES MADE WITH CHARACTER!

141
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,836
Wha!!

142
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,076
Take this, you poster!

143
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,431
- What are you crazy?
- Shut up!

144
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,632
Hey!
You better pay for that!

145
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,553
Well, I...

146
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,151
Gunma, is that you?

147
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,471
I'm glad to have met you!
Are you hurt?

148
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,676
What kind of question is that?

149
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,274
I was obviously better
before you hit me!

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,468
Oh, your here!
What a lovely surprise!

151
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,437
What are you doing here?

152
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,273
Didn't I tell you that
I didn't want to see you!

153
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,355
Oh it's you Mr. Akgai!

154
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,119
- Did he do that?
- Yes.

155
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,756
This should be enough!
Is this okay?

156
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,274
I'm sorry for the
racket that boy caused!

157
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,757
Don't worry, Mr. Akgai.
Thank you very much!

158
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,034
Tell me, Shoma...
How is Yuki?

159
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,350
Is there something wrong?
I asked you a question!

160
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,757
Yuki...

161
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,752
Gunma...

162
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,599
I'm sure Tamotsu,
Junko and the others ...

163
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,195
can help you realize your dream.

164
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,948
Goodbye, Gunma!

165
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,551
Yuki!

166
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,275
Tell me, Shoma,
after you took her away,

167
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,316
you did something
to Yuki, didn't you?

168
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,313
I didn't take her away. Yuki came
with me of her own free will.

169
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,756
And take your feet down,
or I'll throw you out of the car!

170
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:13,274
That's a good one!
Even an idiot like you ...

171
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,749
- ...can't do that?
- What?!

172
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,951
Try it if you dare?

173
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,956
Stop it, both of you.

174
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,594
Soon we'll be home.
Today, Mom and Dad ...

175
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,036
... went out for a visit,
so we can rest easy!

176
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,234
Gunma, why don't
we take a walk?

177
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,197
I just need to talk to you!

178
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,714
I might as well accept...

179
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,756
because I have
something to say too.

180
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,468
What are your intentions, you two?
Tell me!

181
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,835
- None of your business. Go home!
- Shoma, but...

182
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,550
I told you to go home!
Didn't I?

183
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,677
Yes?
This is Yuki!

184
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,835
I bet you came to ask for money!

185
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,196
Isn't that the reason
you came home?

186
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,755
I'm sorry to
disappoint you, but no!

187
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,673
I'm not here for the money!
Or returning home!

188
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,270
- Then why are you here?
- None of your business!

189
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,316
You haven't said where Yuki is!

190
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,156
She went away.

191
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,312
What?! First you take her by force...

192
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,277
...and then she leaves.

193
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,356
It was her choice.

194
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,760
I had nothing to do with it.
Yuki wanted to go,

195
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,188
Did she at least leave an address?

196
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,754
No parent in this world would...

197
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,671
...just let their child go.

198
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,832
I hope she at least told someone!

199
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,436
This is none of your business!

200
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,273
I take it your
not going to tell me?

201
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,540
I have something else to say,

202
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,435
You are nothing but
the black sheep of the family.

203
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,159
And you have
disgraced the Akgai name...

204
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,754
...without thinking of the consequences!

205
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,235
And now it's time for your punishment.

206
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,550
Eh?! Hey, come on

207
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,709
- Why don't we talk calmly?
-  I'll let you go,

208
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,552
if you never come back...

209
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,596
...my dear brother!

210
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,677
So that's how it is,

211
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,149
Remember this,
I always go where I want.

212
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,754
And there's nothing
you can do about that!

213
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,356
Damn...

214
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,553
I am sorry, but he
has business to attend to.

215
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,477
He said he was sorry
for making you come here,

216
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,234
Don't worry, it's alright!

217
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,595
So, you've decided to work for Hiziri?

218
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,557
- I don't know yet.
- Well now,

219
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,919
it seems you don't
want to because of me.

220
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,276
No, that's not it.
It's just...

221
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,755
I think its obvious
that you don't like me.

222
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,955
Hiziri told me that it's
very important that you read this.

223
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,190
But ...
What's in the envelope?

224
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,235
I don't know.
Hiziri didn't tell me.

225
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,276
Here, read it carefully.

226
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,749
I won't be satisfied
until I've beaten you!

227
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,397
Well, did that hurt?

228
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,596
I've suffered more
than you'll ever know!

229
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,957
Gunma!

230
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,629
- Gunma!
- So Yuma warned you?

231
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,235
- Why did you beat him?
- Yuma, where are you?

232
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,073
- I'm here!
- I told you to go home!

233
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,036
All of this is pointless.

234
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,151
Even though we have different
mothers, your still my brother.

235
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,190
Why did this have to happen?

236
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,995
Yuma, let's hurry.

237
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,036
We need to bring him to my house.

238
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,675
- What's that smell?
- So you can stand up.

239
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,034
That hurt!
Now I've a mouth full of cuts!

240
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,236
- Why don't you eat more slowly?
- It's too good!

241
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,038
By the way, you've settled in quite well!

242
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,596
It's really peaceful,

243
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,597
- Yuki, tea!
- Yes!

244
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,032
Gunma...

245
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,117
Want to take a bath?

246
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,434
Man, this is warm!

247
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,671
Gunma, I'm leaving you
some spare clothes here, okay?

248
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,269
Thanks, and sorry
for the hassle, Yuki!

249
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,633
Since your there...
do you want wash my back?

250
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,670
Now what do you do,
do you work?

251
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,272
- You know what I do!
- I do?

252
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,278
I beg you to stop making fun of me!

253
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,676
I  don't understand.

254
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,238
Let's just change the subject.

255
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,152
I want to forget everything
and go back in time ...

256
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,677
Gunma!

257
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,111
I feel refreshed!

258
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,589
- You smoke?
- A little...

259
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,515
You've changed a
lot from I've last seen you!

260
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,679
Uhm...

261
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,356
Shoma pays for everything.

262
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,958
When I was taken away
from Tokyo, he put me here.

263
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,036
He told me that
I wouldn't be hurt ...

264
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,156
if I stayed with him.

265
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,273
I could live without having to work.

266
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,675
And your okay?

267
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,949
I don't care anymore.

268
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,670
You see, I ...

269
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,278
What?

270
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,554
- Are you going to marry him?
- No marriage!

271
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,675
Are you out of your mind?

272
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,034
Yes, that's exactly
what's happening!

273
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,430
I'll tell Shoma that he
shouldn't treat you badly!

274
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,435
- Gunma...
- Yuki...

275
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,558
I will not let you face
the same fate of my mother!

276
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,756
Your not allowed to
move before the start,

277
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,638
...of the match!
Otherwise, in one fell swoop,

278
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,950
everything will be messed up!

279
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,516
In the next episode:

280
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,556
"Farewell Hometown!
Gunma Runs Straight to Tomorrow!!".

281
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,438
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

282
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:13,800
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

283
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:19,750
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

284
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:26,050
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

285
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:35,850
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

286
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:44,750
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

287
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:50,450
These feelings
just flare up

288
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:55,450
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

289
00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:02,450
The fantasy penetrates through you

290
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:07,650
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

291
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:15,500
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

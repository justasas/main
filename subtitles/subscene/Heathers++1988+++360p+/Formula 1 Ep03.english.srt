1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,150
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,150
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,500
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,700
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,000
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,000
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,250
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,750
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,250
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,470
Understand these
words in memory of me.

16
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,870
Take a good look at my face.
You have a son a lot like you,

17
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,237
that bears the same name as you!

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,956
Fine then, I'll remember that!

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Dear Tamotsu! There are
 a lot of little girls in Tokyo!

20
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,196
Excuse me!

21
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,636
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Why are you sitting there?

22
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,957
You aren't at a restaurant!

23
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,759
You can't eat in the
middle of the road?

24
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,672
Be quiet,
or else you'll have trouble!

25
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,678
THE MEN WHO
DO NOT SURRENDER

26
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,757
"Driving School"?!

27
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,118
TESTS FOR
STATE DRIVING LICENSE

28
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,555
TESTS FOR LICENCE: A+A1,
B, C, B+E, C+E, D+E.

29
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,995
SPECIAL CLASSES HELD
EVERYDAY AND ON SUNDAY

30
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,596
STATE DRIVING SCHOOL

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,595
Attention: if you are already enrolled
in driving school

32
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,875
...please take a seat in a driving car.

33
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,273
I repeat.
Attention:

34
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,875
if you are already enrolled
in driving school

35
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,633
...please take a seat
in a driving car. Thank you.

36
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,030
Very well, we can start now.

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,150
Mr. Akagi,
Mr. Gunma Akagi is it?

38
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,558
It's true that you never
know who you could meet!

39
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,194
What a surprise!
Who would have thought?

40
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,590
The Queen of the circuit
is but a simple driving instructor.

41
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,114
Well then!
Can we go now?

42
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,430
Wait a minute, I
haven't told you yet!,

43
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,751
You must remember not to
break the most important rule!

44
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,751
Before getting into
a car it's a good idea...

45
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,912
...to always look around
as to avoid any accidents.

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,434
Unfortunately, on the streets,
accidents are waiting to happen!

47
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,358
For example, children could
be playing behind a the car.

48
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,635
So you have to always
look before you get in!

49
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,631
Or you'll be knocked out
just like before,

50
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,676
am I clear?

51
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,748
Now we can take the practice test!

52
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,957
Come on, get into the car.

53
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,951
To begin we'll take a
drive around the block!

54
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,354
What are you doing?
We're you listening!

55
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,550
The speed limit is 30 miles per hour.

56
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,756
It's essential to be
careful when driving.

57
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,919
I can't believe this!
You don't even have...

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,150
...a driver license!

59
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,035
Drive faster you...

60
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,429
- ...piece of junk!
- Where do you think you are?

61
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,274
Listen to me!
If you want to get a license...

62
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,316
...you have to do what I tell you!

63
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,593
Driving school's boring, you know!

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,072
This really is the "paradise of the turtles"!

65
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,837
I realize that I'm a beginner,

66
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,275
but that doesn't mean
I have to act like one!

67
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,278
Hi, Grandma!
How was the lesson?

68
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,436
It's really simple!
Just slow down to stop...

69
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,476
...and accelerate to move!

70
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,675
Come on, try it!
You know you can!

71
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,915
If you can't do that just go home
and look after the grandchildren!

72
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,479
I would like to know one thing:
the last time we saw each

73
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,516
...you said you wanted
to drive on the track.

74
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,478
Now you've got it!
That's why I decided...

75
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,199
to come to school
and get a valid license!

76
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,920
Listen, babe, wish me good luck.

77
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,195
Because I'm gonna be the fastest.

78
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,478
You can't be serious!
You'll never become a driver!

79
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,630
How do you know that?

80
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,190
You don't even know what it's like
to drive around the track!

81
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,510
Racing isn't a joke, boy!

82
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,558
- What? Boy?!
- Driving as a sport ...

83
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,677
...requires more than just brute strength...

84
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,070
...just like a boxer you've gotta train to win!

85
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,431
Don't you know that
the essential thing in this sport...

86
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,670
...is one's driving abilities!

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,639
A driver must be
quiet tempered when driving.

88
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,553
A driver must also work with a team!

89
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,871
And as a team you'll
fix a car's mechanical problems.

90
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,599
Driving isn't just a personal challenge!

91
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,389
If you don't have these qualities,
you'll never become a driver!

92
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,677
A driver must also be
smart so he doesn't crash!

93
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,832
I don't think the track
is the right place for you.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,275
You must respect others,
especially when you'll be...

95
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,316
...... going 300 km/h!

96
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,036
Man, what a scolding!

97
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,037
You are too irresponsible!

98
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,236
Come on, now!
Perhaps, some practice,

99
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,357
will help you better understand
how to behave behind the wheel!

100
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,076
Open the door!
That's an order!

101
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,356
I told you to open the door!

102
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,432
I don't think so!
I didn't come to driving school...

103
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,590
...just to listen to someone preach!

104
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,916
Watch this!
You'll change your opinion of me...

105
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,956
...after you see this little stunt!

106
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,076
Get out!
Don't do anything crazy!

107
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,517
Get back here!

108
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,591
Get out of the way!

109
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,750
What an idiot!
I have to stop him!

110
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,948
Lady, don't you understand?

111
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,957
This is the stop line!

112
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,031
You must never cross it!

113
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,591
Hey, Grandma, go home and
look after the grandchildren!

114
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,759
Come back, you scoundrel!
And stop calling me grandma!

115
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,033
Why me!
He must be stopped!

116
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,669
Hey you!
Pull over right away!

117
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,920
I came here to get my driver's license!
Not to see some...

118
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,673
...idiot driving around!
This can't be happening!

119
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,068
In my day,
this wouldn't have happened!

120
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,196
Stop right now!

121
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,474
This is really too much!
I'll make him pay!

122
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,673
Hey, look at that!
Come on, keep going!

123
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,556
Wow, he's real fast!

124
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,915
We're all with you!
You can do it!

125
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,560
Attention!
There's a madman at the wheel!

126
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,677
Quickly, abandon your vehicle!

127
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,070
Abandon your vehicle!
Quickly, abandon your vehicle!

128
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,270
Gunma Akagi, you scoundrel!
I'll get you!

129
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,830
This is amazing!
That boy's got talent!

130
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,150
- A real ace!
- I wish I was like him!

131
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,117
He should become a driver!

132
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,675
I can't believe this is happening!

133
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,116
This is amazing!

134
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,669
I haven't been this happy since 1915!

135
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,113
You're good at this!
I'll give you that at least!

136
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,552
Perfect! He's going towards a dead end!

137
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,076
STOP

138
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,193
Come on! I can't be beaten like this,
I can't let that happen!

139
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,396
I will not be beaten!

140
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,153
I won't alone anyone
to get in front of me!

141
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,675
It seems we're almost at the finish line!

142
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,110
I'll show you how
we deal with...

143
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,156
...people like you!

144
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,674
- I've gotta hurry!
- They might be hurt!

145
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,951
- Move it already!
- Theres been an accident!

146
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,996
Hey, kid, are you okay?

147
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,357
What an accident!

148
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,028
My dear Tamotsu,
how's life been treating you?

149
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,835
It's been fairly quiet here.
This city offers many opportunities.

150
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,237
I enrolled in a driving school
and was immediately promoted...

151
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,276
...thanks to my abilities!

152
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,755
- It's a miracle no one was hurt!
- But even so...

153
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,831
...what made him act this way?

154
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,150
I've learned a lot from using the tractor!

155
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,192
Unfortunately, my dear sir,
as you probably understand,

156
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,157
we have to reject your application.

157
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,913
But why? My driving skills
were awesome, weren't they?

158
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,116
- The same goes for the lady!
- Won't you reconsider?

159
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,794
I kindly ask you to
withdraw from this school.

160
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,552
That's not right!

161
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,950
And Tamotsu, the girls here in
the city are out of this world!

162
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,476
You know what?
I'm glad I came to live here!

163
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,273
I'm even in love
with a very beautiful girl!

164
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,630
Come on!
Gather round, everybody!

165
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,676
I'm not some circus freak!

166
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,351
Forget them, kid! Lets go!

167
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,034
Who cares anyway!
I'll just enroll at another school!

168
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,078
I go crazy for guys
who prove they have guts!

169
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,355
All young people
should show more character!

170
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,113
Don't you agree?
Come on, let's go get a cup of tea!

171
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,431
I'm sorry, but another time,
granny. I'm busy!

172
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,751
I only arrived a few days ago
and still don't know the city well.

173
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,594
I also need to find a place to sleep!

174
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,035
Really?!
Why didn't you tell me before?

175
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:16,051
KOMORI VILLA

176
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,648
Here we are.
You are really lucky!

177
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,659
Nowadays, it's impossible
to find cheap rooms...

178
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:26,095
... without giving at least
three months rent in advance.

179
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,933
I still have a room available.
You can have it.

180
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,853
You'll like it!
Come on, this way!

181
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,976
At least theres a bed!

182
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,257
- Of course! Would you have preferred the floor?
- It's also very comfortable!

183
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,650
It's just what you need!
I've also lived here...

184
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,617
...since the day I got married.

185
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,975
I spent the best
days of my life here!

186
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:01,734
This was our bedroom!
It hasn't been used ...

187
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,095
...since my husband
died two years ago!

188
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,057
Maybe it's better to
sleep in another room!

189
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,654
Don't expect to be sleeping in my room!

190
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,058
Only if you were here, Tamotsu!
I found a house!

191
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,777
A white mansion
surrounded in green!

192
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,773
This place is just too cool!

193
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,698
Not to mention the owner,
is a widow!

194
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,539
Young people are just full of energy!

195
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,537
It's just wonderful!

196
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,135
Young people always
give me such enthusiasm!

197
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,053
I feel like I have been reborn!

198
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,570
- Drink up!
- No thanks!

199
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:44,455
I turned this house into an
apartment building after being widowed

200
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,973
...then I rented out the
rooms to young people!

201
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,534
I'll introduce the
other tenants to you later!

202
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,054
They're all just like you!

203
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,859
- Come on, drink up!
- We're home!

204
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,894
- Hello, Grandma! Is dinner ready?
- Don't tell me it's dinner time already!

205
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,773
- And who is he?

206
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,856
He just arrived in town!

207
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,052
You're the one who caused
a lot of trouble at the circuit!

208
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,454
This is the worst day ever!

209
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,371
All because some
guy got carried away!

210
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,616
I'm home.

211
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,935
Grandma, what's with all the racket?

212
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,091
<i>Hello!</i>

213
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,853
Tamotsu, I hope
you come and see me soon.

214
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,976
Well, let's eat!

215
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,935
What is this guy doing here?

216
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,976
- What?
- More rice!

217
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,779
Join me, Tamotsu!
You won't regret it...

218
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,737
...you know you want to!

219
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,970
They have a lovely room just for you!

220
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,373
Don't listen to you're mother,
she'll never let you come!

221
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,616
I need you here!

222
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,376
Dear Tamotsu, I look forward to you're arrival!

223
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,453
With you by my side
I'll feel much better!

224
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,771
Who knows, one day...
we could become rich and famous!

225
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:02,615
Mom! Can you come?
There's a phone call for you!

226
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,773
- Yes, of course. I'm coming.
- What are you doing?

227
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,138
Nothing, I was just
looking for a screwdriver!

228
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,536
Gunma!

229
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,817
Just lying around all day will not...

230
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,970
...help you
get a drivers license!

231
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,049
- Here!
- What's this?

232
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,775
Books to help you get a drivers license.
I bought them myself!

233
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,092
You said you wanted to take
the exam for a driver's license...

234
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,057
...without attending driving school, right?

235
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,968
I thought about doing it myself!

236
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,098
<i>- We'll study together, okay?
- Well... alright...</i>

237
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,456
Who was on the phone?

238
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,970
They asked me if I could go to town!

239
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,091
Gunma's father is making a speech.

240
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,690
- I see that you don't want to waste time.
- Yes, that's right!

241
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,771
Maybe that's why his son is gone.

242
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,173
Tamotsu, tell me:

243
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,216
Are you envious of Gunma?

244
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:27,690
Why should I be? Gunma is
happy with the choice he made.

245
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,170
Stop pretending you don't understand.

246
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,856
Engines are your life.

247
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,456
Would you like to go to Gunma?

248
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,456
I really don't want to go.

249
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,496
It would be better if you didn't...

250
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,969
...follow in the
footsteps of your father.

251
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,216
M-maybe.

252
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,217
He only made mistakes in his life,

253
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,256
and was never
a man of character!

254
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,810
He truly lived his own life,

255
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,368
totally neglecting everyone else!

256
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,656
Everyone considered
him a great mechanic,

257
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:18,971
but then he started to
lose his friends, one by one...

258
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,775
and everyone hated him for that,
then he was truly alone!

259
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,970
But you're not like him.
He was a weak person,

260
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:33,858
and only created disappointment!
You're nothing like him!

261
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,695
What you go thinking, Mom?
Why are you telling me these things?

262
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,490
- You shouldn't have read that!
- I know, my son!

263
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,656
If you believe that
your future is in engines,

264
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,776
don't mind me,
honestly!

265
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,216
I will accept whatever
decision you make.

266
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,171
R-Really?

267
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,376
I am!
You're a man now!

268
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,771
Working on engines
has always been my dream.

269
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,450
I've always been
fascinated with mechanics.

270
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,536
If I become a
qualified technician,

271
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,088
then maybe one day
I'll become somebody!

272
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,934
What I lack is confidence in myself.

273
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,659
- You gain that in time.

274
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,936
My son, this is a difficult
and important decision.

275
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,378
Listening to your conscience,
and choose the right path.

276
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,220
Know that in spite of everything,

277
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,088
I have always loved your father.
I wish you luck, my child!

278
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,573
- Say hello to Gunma for me.
- Okay.

279
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,577
I know I can't help much but...

280
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,616
contact me
if you need me.

281
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,936
You're smart,
I know you can do it!

282
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,856
I'll miss you very much.

283
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,092
Goodbye!

284
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,814
Don't worry, Gunma will be in

285
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,698
good hands.
You'll see that he'll become famous.

286
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,977
<i>Mom ...</i>

287
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,290
Did you know that to drive on
the track you must have licenses A and B?

288
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:45,095
If you watch "engines
on the track" you'll understand more!

289
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,815
Next episode "Double-dealing his friendship,"

290
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,856
"Still his dream is the best in the world".

291
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,256
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

292
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:13,550
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

293
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:19,500
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

294
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:25,800
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

295
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:35,600
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

296
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:44,500
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

297
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:50,200
These feelings
just flare up

298
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

299
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:02,200
The fantasy penetrates through you

300
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,400
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

301
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:15,250
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

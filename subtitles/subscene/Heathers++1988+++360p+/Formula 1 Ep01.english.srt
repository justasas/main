1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,150
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,150
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,500
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,700
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,000
You always know
when your DOWN

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,000
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,250
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,750
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,250
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,300
Formula 1 Dream! I'm the Fastest in the World!!
Nobody Shall Drive Before Me!!

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,592
You listening?!
Move out of the way or we'll move it for you.

17
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,112
- Hurry up!
- Hurry it up will you!

18
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,836
Were going to be late!

19
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,195
Just what we needed
a motorized snail!

20
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,271
Hey, you, buddy!
Didn't they teach you ...

21
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,157
...that tractors are
used in the fields?

22
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,232
Yes, I know! But this
is a side road!

23
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,552
I don't care! I have no time to lose!
Move it right away, you turtle!!

24
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,190
Didn't you understand us!
Get out of the way, now!

25
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,032
Oh really! Since they're being polite!
We'll just have to let them through, Tamotsu!

26
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,437
Oh, Gunma!

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,828
What?!
Damn, and I thought I was old!

28
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,876
If I had another car,
I would climb with you!

29
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,119
- Thank you so much!
- Look, you bunch misfits,

30
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,590
listen to my words!
I will say it only once...

31
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,557
...pass by us or don't!

32
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,950
- Do you understand?
- Did you hear that, everyone?

33
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,316
We've gotta decide!
Listen, beautiful,

34
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,358
we are not interested in
wasting time with loudmouths like you!

35
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,591
Bye bye!

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,956
Who do they think they are!

37
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,153
- I want to drive too, Tamotsu!
- Gunma! But you...

38
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:32,596
If there's one thing that I hate,
it's those who are presumptuous!

39
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,240
They'll get what
they deserve!

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,037
And they will finally learn
that my name is Gunma!

41
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,436
Onward!

42
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,830
- Hey! Look over there!
- Huh?!

43
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,633
What... What the hell are you waiting for?
Drive faster!

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,230
Can you see me Tamotsu?
I'm sowing too!

45
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,197
Where is the lever
to increase speed?

46
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,589
It's under the odometer, Gunma!

47
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,155
- Ah, yes, the red one!
- Be careful!

48
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,754
We are on a tractor,
not a Formula 1 car.

49
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,349
I know that,
do not worry, Tamotsu!

50
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,235
Tremble in fear, for here I come!

51
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,078
- What is that?
- It's a madman with a turbo tractor!

52
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,678
No one can surpass me!
I'm the fastest!

53
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,834
- Get out of the way!
- Help!

54
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,160
- How do you like it?
- Now you can slow down, you know?

55
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,834
EAT FRESH VEGETABLES
WITH YOUR CHILDREN!

56
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,879
I told you! The tractor wheels
do not have enough grip!

57
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,757
- Your exaggerating as usual!
- Stop complaining!

58
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,235
Admit it: you had fun too!

59
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,678
That tractor is a true miracle!

60
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,439
Gunma, with this tractor
you can have lots of fun!

61
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,591
Sure, it's fast, but not that fast!

62
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,554
Oh come on!
Be modest will you...

63
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,837
- ...Your a mechanical genius!
- A genius?!

64
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,916
I only changed the
engine with one from an old Porsche.

65
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,116
Since we're here, why
don't we change the tires?

66
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,198
No way! If we did that it
wouldn't be a tractor anymore!

67
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,068
A tractor is a tractor and
I think it should stay that way!

68
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,550
Well, I've gotta go now.

69
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,156
Your going? Why don't
we have fun in Maebashi, instead?

70
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,152
I can't!
I have to help my mother in the fields.

71
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,630
And then I have school tomorrow!

72
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,156
I knew you'd say that!

73
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,358
Stop that tractor!
Stop that tractor!

74
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,633
- Come on!
- Come on!

75
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,917
They are too fast!
We won't be able to overtake them!

76
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,520
AKAGI HOUSE

77
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,276
Mind the step, sir.

78
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,518
You dare to go in first?
Move aside, idiot!

79
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,636
Welcome home, dear.

80
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,359
I have to tell you that the
police are coming here today.

81
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,834
Has Gunma done it again?

82
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,434
Yes! He caused a
nasty accident, unfortunately.

83
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,039
He ran around on a tractor
in the company of a group of girls.

84
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,913
He then collided
with some police cars.

85
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,071
- So he's been arrested?
- They've detained...

86
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,596
...him for the investigation.
As for his strange behavior,

87
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,189
I was hoping that Shoma and Yuma
would serve as an example for him.

88
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,550
Unfortunately that is not so!
Besides,

89
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,756
since I'm not his mother,
I can't even scold him!

90
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,794
However, his behavior
is likely to be...

91
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,075
...counterproductive for
your political career.

92
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,550
- You agree don't you, dear?
- Yes, you're right.

93
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,636
Bring him here!

94
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,436
Gunma is here, Sir.

95
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,717
I was told of your
latest stunt this morning.

96
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,837
By doing so did you think
you would gain my admiration?

97
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,873
That's the last thing
in the world I would want.

98
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,675
Maybe you would prefer to
spend some time in juvie.

99
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,155
A great idea,
but I do not recommend it.

100
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,999
It would be a serious mistake.
Especially since it wouldn't help...

101
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,275
... your future
political career, Dad!

102
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,149
Your attitude reminds me
very much of your poor mother.

103
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,550
May the poor woman rest in peace!

104
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:44,438
My mother was your victim,
you made her suffer!

105
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,114
That's not for you to judge!
However, it is my duty...

106
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,953
...to think about your future.
So if you want to stay here,

107
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,157
you will have to completely
change your entire way of life.

108
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,149
Don't you ever think that I'll become
a mere reflection of you!

109
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,029
You know I can't stand you!
I'd rather not see you again!

110
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,955
Don't you dare challenge me!

111
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,757
Gunma!

112
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,594
It's true when they say that
blood is thicker than water!

113
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,633
When I look at you I only see an ugly
reflection that irritates me to death!

114
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,917
Come on, pull yourself together!
Gunma! Gunma!

115
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,754
You dare to block my path, slug?
I can't stand anyone in front of me!

116
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,874
- Tamotsu, how many have I overcome?
- 91, I think!

117
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,557
But where are we going, huh?
East? West? North? South? Where?

118
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,957
I don't know, any place is fine!

119
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,996
You aren't going to
the border, by any chance?

120
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,436
Who knows, Tamotsu? Maybe I'll
reach the borders of the country.

121
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,751
I'll go to ends of the world,
as long as no one is in front of me!

122
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,758
Look, Gunma!
There's a car behind us.

123
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,550
But where did it come from?
How long has it been there?

124
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,758
It's large car,
very powerful!

125
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,191
- Let it pass by, Gunma!
- What for?

126
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,515
What have they done for me?
He just wants to look good...

127
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,956
...in the eyes of his girlfriend?
I'll show him!

128
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,039
Please, slow down, Gunma!
In the name of our friendship!

129
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,754
Soon they'll be a sharp bend
and then there's a river!

130
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,673
Stop your whining!
I like a challenge!

131
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,558
You'll see them
in the river not us!

132
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,949
- I hope you remember that!
- I'll be careful, though!

133
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,596
Gunma!

134
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,436
Damn tires!

135
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,596
You didn't hold up!

136
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,636
Damn tractor!

137
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,108
An absolute master of the road,
driving without sliding,

138
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,760
even when at high speed,
he can move the best!

139
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,911
Now that's a real pilot!

140
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,357
Tamotsu!

141
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,156
Tamotsu!

142
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,357
Tamotsu!

143
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,477
Hello, little one!

144
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,959
I'm your friend.
And you wouldn't even give me an egg?

145
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,556
Ah! Hope you enjoyed that, Gunma!

146
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,835
Tamotsu should be
back at any moment.

147
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,074
Did you know? Your father wants
to stand in the upcoming elections.

148
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,390
My dear boy, you need
to get used to the idea...

149
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,357
...of having an
important father!

150
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,715
Well then,
you'll do your best...

151
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,756
...to help him,
won't you?

152
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,429
Hey! Where are you going?

153
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,556
Damn him!

154
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,555
And his damn election too!

155
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,236
- Oh hi, Gunma!
- Hello!

156
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,155
- What are you doing here?
- What's the matter?

157
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,231
This is nothing new, I'm always here!

158
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,108
We need to change the tires,
don't you remember?

159
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,468
Yes! But now I think it's impossible!

160
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,556
Mom, prepare us some tea!

161
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,756
I may be wrong, Tamotsu, but
you're hiding something from me!

162
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,475
- Huh?!
- I hate ambiguous situations, you know!

163
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,871
No! It's not what you think, Gunma?
I'm not hiding anything!

164
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,951
Don't get smart with me,
somethings up.

165
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,190
If you've spent two
days locked in here,

166
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,113
you must've had a good reason!!
I have to know!

167
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,075
- Gunma!
- That's it

168
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,752
Don't you dare!

169
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,436
Don't look!

170
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,155
Sorry, but now I've
seen it, Tamotsu!

171
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,757
So, Tamotsu, have
you done all this for me?

172
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:16,476
It's not mine! They asked me
if I could fine-tune their engine.

173
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,869
- Then we'll test it.
- What are you saying, Gunma?

174
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,349
- You deserve a kiss!
- No!

175
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,833
This is awesome!
This engine is a real gem.

176
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,474
What a discovery!
This is nothing like a tractor!

177
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,109
However, the tires
aren't quite right!

178
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,033
It's an economy
car, not a Formula 1 car!

179
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,516
Wasn't that the guy
who we met before.

180
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,235
Luckily Gunma is too
engrossed and didn't notice!

181
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,157
I found him!

182
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,677
What's wrong with you, Gunma?

183
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,751
Didn't you see those
who we met a while ago?

184
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,400
The car was going in
the direction of the city ...

185
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,357
...and in it was that guy from the other night.

186
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,309
But now since we are on an equal footing,
we'll see which one of us will win.

187
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,309
- No, Gunma!
- This time I'll be the victor!

188
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,959
What a sight!
In a matter of a second he...

189
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,996
has totally changed!

190
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,950
Huh, that madman is angry with us!

191
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,355
What a scoundrel!
Probably thinks he's funny!

192
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,434
As I understand it,
Gunma has never...

193
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,751
...driven a car before.
He doesn't even have a driver's license!

194
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,996
Also...
he's driving at very high speeds...

195
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,150
...and even has the
time to joke around!

196
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,271
This is crazy! Mom, I'm
afraid you're going to lose...

197
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,670
... your beloved son.
This is just too dangerous!

198
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,071
He sure showed me!

199
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,678
You're really an amazing driver!
Though it's time to give up, Gunma!

200
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,958
Tamotsu, you're my best
friend, aren't you?

201
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,951
- Well aren't you?
- Yes,of course I am!

202
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,236
So hold on tight!

203
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,077
Let's go!

204
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,154
Gunma!
Are you crazy?

205
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,269
Will you stop that already!
Stop acting like a wimp!

206
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,598
Do you understand?
I can't stand anyone in front of me!

207
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,632
He has guts!
But what about yours?

208
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,028
Take a look!
Seems we've annoyed them.

209
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,196
They'll never pass me,
I assure you!

210
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,279
No!

211
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,116
Stop it!

212
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,510
What are we going to do,
Gunma?

213
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,751
Teach him a lesson!
Don't ever run away from a challenge!

214
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,760
- No!
- Don't worry I'll fix it!

215
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,470
Your behavior surprises me,
James.

216
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,472
This isn't your style!
Don't worry he's only a boy.

217
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,516
I just can't stand that idiot!

218
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,155
Why can't this piece
of shit go faster?

219
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,596
Give up, Gunma. They have a much
more powerful engine than ours!

220
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,636
And he must
be a real driver!

221
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,076
That's not true!
It's just bad luck!

222
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,670
Mommie Dearest, forgive me!
I think my life...

223
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,871
...will be cut short
if this continues!

224
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,757
Hello, gentlemen!

225
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,199
Listen to me!
I've been trying to...

226
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,875
...persuade my friend, but
he's not listening to reason!

227
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,958
I would be very grateful
if you could just drop out of this challenge!

228
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,355
I know that your car
is more powerful!

229
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,795
Tamotsu, what the hell
are you telling him?

230
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,350
- Stop flattering him and come here!
- Please excuse what he said!

231
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,630
Ideally it would be better
if we could talk this out,

232
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,280
but it's unlikely
that my friend will do so!

233
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,795
- Tamotsu!
- Please, You seem like...

234
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,952
- ...very reasonable people!
- So what about it?

235
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,276
Please forgive him!

236
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,357
Come here, Tamotsu!

237
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,676
What are you trying to do?

238
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,475
How would you like
it cooked, ma'am?

239
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,909
Sliced ​​very thin
and not very spicy,

240
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,833
- otherwise Shoma will not like it.
- Okay, ma'am.

241
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,359
- Where are you going, Yuki ?
- I'm going to see Mr. Gunma.

242
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,035
- Leave him where he is!
- But Mr. Shoma and Mr. Yuma

243
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,271
...finally got back after
a long time out and...

244
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,710
I thought that Mr. Gunma
would like to have dinner with them.

245
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,836
Tonight Gunma will dine alone!

246
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,756
Damn-it! What the hell is he thinking?

247
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,274
Hey, Tamotsu, what are you waiting for?
Strip! Take off all your clothes!

248
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,271
- What!?
- We'll make it,

249
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,874
even if we have to drive
nonstop for a week!

250
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,872
I can't give in to him!
No one will ever beat me!

251
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,275
He only has the advantage
because he's in a faster car!

252
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,079
But now, who knows?
Luck is with me today!

253
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,836
Come on, hurry up!

254
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,517
Idiot, you were meant to
throw them on his windshield!

255
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,236
- But I have nothing left to take off!
- What!

256
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,792
- So, how was it in America?
- Not bad!

257
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,757
However, I prefer my home country.

258
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,236
- So your mother was right.
- Yes!

259
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,796
- What about Gunma?
- Gunma is...

260
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,437
Gunma...

261
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,277
Ha! He's quite a lively fellow!

262
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,075
Cars are not toys
for little kids!

263
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,157
What!

264
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,556
A man like you has no right
to get behind the wheel of a car!

265
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,116
Hey, stop messing around!
All your doing is preaching!

266
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,589
Didn't you see how
incredible my driving was?

267
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,516
If I had a car as powerful
as yours, I would have won!

268
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,956
In all of Japan there is
no one who can beat me!

269
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,236
Don't kid yourself.
You'll never be the fastest,

270
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,949
- not even in your wildest dreams!
- Your just some asshole!

271
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,111
Gunma!

272
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,196
Gunma!

273
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,829
There are tons of people who are
a lot faster than you in the world of racing!

274
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,840
Do you know the letter "F" mean?
It's the cars in "Formula 1"!

275
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,556
The cars used in
"Formula 1" are...

276
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,029
...built solely and
exclusively for racing!

277
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,356
In the next episode of
"Engines on the track"

278
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,471
"The Idiot's Resolution: I'm Goin' to Tokyo!".

279
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,872
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

280
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:13,550
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

281
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:19,500
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

282
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:25,800
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

283
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:35,600
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

284
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:44,500
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

285
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:50,200
These feelings
just flare up

286
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:55,200
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

287
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:02,200
The fantasy penetrates through you

288
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,400
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of your wounds

289
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:15,250
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

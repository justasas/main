1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,220
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:06,220
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,870
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,870
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,220
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,120
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:32,120
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,420
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:38,720
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,220
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,720
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,970
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,470
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,970
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,434
Yes, that's exactly
what's happening!

16
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,756
I'll tell Shoma that he
shouldn't treat you badly!

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,199
- Gunma...
- Yuki...

18
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,278
I will not let you face
the same fate of my mother!

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,500
Farewell Hometown!
He Learns an Unbelievable Secret

20
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,236
Hey, wait for me, Shoma!

21
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,271
According to me you
were too relentless with Gunma.

22
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,551
In the end he
is always your brother.

23
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,197
I know, but even our father ...

24
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,635
he never considered
him a son like us.

25
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,277
Gunma is different from us.

26
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,874
And why are you siding with him?

27
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,636
Well, it's because ...
I love him very much!

28
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,950
However, I know that you
accompanied him the station.

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,232
He has a dangerous
tendency to get into trouble.

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,197
And he better stay away!

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,356
I'm very sorry.

32
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,431
Send the others away.
We need to talk in private.

33
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,591
This should be
enough to get you home!

34
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,671
And don't come back here!

35
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,195
Go on, pick it up!
I hope it's enough.

36
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,157
Stop it, Shoma!

37
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,677
Don't try to humiliate me!
I don't want your charity!

38
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,679
Or don't take the money.

39
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,110
However, I strongly advise
you to leave here at once.

40
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,677
Yuma, come on!

41
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,590
What are your intentions with Yuki?
You better take care of her!

42
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,757
I thought you wanted money
but your here to blackmail me!

43
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,357
Are you tired, dear?

44
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,513
My job is certainly not the easiest.

45
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,517
Soon it will be over.

46
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,273
Shoma and Yuma are
making great progress.

47
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,118
We have two smart children,
don't you think so?

48
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,152
- Gunma!
- Keep your dirty money!

49
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,196
I want none of it!

50
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,919
Are you looking for a fight!

51
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,589
Don't you touch
me ever again, got it?

52
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,150
I'm waiting for your answer, Shoma!

53
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,357
You'll take responsibility
by marrying her, right?

54
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,916
Please, stop it now!

55
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,439
- Dad, stop!
- Shut up!

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,151
Open your ears!
You can no longer afford ...

57
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,038
- ... to make a fool of me!
- What are you saying?

58
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,509
Shoma and I were
discussing a personal matter.

59
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,319
Get out! I don't want
to see you ever again!

60
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,153
You have nothing to
do with us, understand?

61
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,317
Shoma, I have to go
to an important meeting,

62
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,630
but I think you'd
better go in my place.

63
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,110
- I'm already late!
- I'm going now!

64
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,518
One moment, Shoma!
You still owe me answer!

65
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,431
Shut up!
Gunma,

66
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,829
He has nothing to
do with a wimp like you!

67
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,956
You're not part of our family!

68
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,872
I'll remind you that
the elections are close,

69
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,951
I don't think you
can afford to kill me!

70
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,515
But if you want to
risk it, then kill me!

71
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,995
Mr. Gunma, stop it, please!

72
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,277
Apologize instead!
I've never seen your father so angry!

73
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,592
- Father!
- What are you waiting for?

74
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,675
- Will you be quiet?
- Are you going to make me?

75
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,678
I speak because
I'm not afraid of you!

76
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,954
Go, on! We will see how
your career will benefit!

77
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,599
I want to become Member of Parliament!

78
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,790
And I will not let a wimp like you ...

79
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,950
...shame the whole family!

80
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,959
So now, I'll let you go.

81
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,476
Your just an old fart!

82
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,676
Are you afraid of a scandal?

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,956
I'll never see you again!

84
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,756
I'll make you pay!

85
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,557
You two!  If you have
something to say, say it!

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,231
- He will never understand!
- Gunma!

87
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,636
Yuki!

88
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,349
I wonder where he's gone
to mess around, this time?

89
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,359
I've forgone sleep waiting for him!

90
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,675
Well, maybe he went to his house.

91
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,358
Perhaps. But I think that
he would have told us,

92
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,078
Gunma isn't on good
terms with his family.

93
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,636
Does anyone want coffee?

94
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,719
But ... Tamotsu,
aren't you working today?

95
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,677
It's already
past nine o'clock?

96
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,960
Really?!
I hope Morioka isn't angry!

97
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,916
Today is my first day off.
I'll stay in the house all afternoon.

98
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,833
- As soon as he arrives, I'll call you.
- Thank you, Junko.

99
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,633
Okay! I think I'll get
a good night's sleep!

100
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,268
Gunma probably went to look for someone...

101
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,591
...to give him a loan,
or to see Kishida in the hospital.

102
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,916
I've had enough of this!

103
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,675
Gunma, come back soon.

104
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,431
Your aspirations and dreams
are the same as mine,

105
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,039
Only we have chosen
different paths to achieve them.

106
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,599
But we won't succeed if
we don't work together!

107
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,914
Gunma...Come back!
I need you.

108
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,196
We need to stick together.

109
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,876
Ah, he just walked in.

110
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,753
- Huh?
- Hiziri wants to talk to you.

111
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,118
Hi, I'm sorry about
yesterday, I was out.

112
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,356
So, have you read the contract?

113
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,238
If there is something wrong,
I am willing to change it.

114
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,154
Can't we talk about
that in a few days?

115
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,956
Is it not to your liking?

116
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,154
If something needs changed, tell me?

117
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,039
I can't make a decision
like this right away.

118
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,272
Try to understand,
I need time to think!

119
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,237
Have you talked with Gunma?

120
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,237
Listen, I assure you
that it is a contract ...

121
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,595
...that is open and transparent.

122
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,677
Well, to be precise.

123
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,836
I have already organized
some work for you.

124
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,439
I've also already made a
despot to you bank account.

125
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,956
Five million!

126
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,477
You can start whenever you want.

127
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,677
Yes ... Thank you!

128
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,116
AKAGI FAMILY

129
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,277
Mom ...

130
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,271
Gunma ... If anything bad
should happen,

131
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,756
take this ring, it's yours.

132
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,100
It's the only thing I've
asked your father for in my entire life.

133
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,198
Keep it to remember me by,
and don't sell it.

134
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,356
Unless you are in trouble!

135
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,077
Promise me, Gunma!

136
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,038
Even if you are short on
money, don't sell it!

137
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,111
Never get rid of it...

138
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,078
...it's the only thing you
have to remember me.

139
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,550
I'm so worried about you!

140
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,437
You see, my boy, I want
you to use my gift ...

141
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,956
only if your future is in stake!

142
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,155
Do you understand?
Promise me this.

143
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,349
Don't worry mother,
I kept my promise.

144
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,757
KUMADA JEWELRY - WE BUY
PRECIOUS STONES FOR GREAT PRICES

145
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,554
So what is your assessment?
Fifty million? One hundred million?

146
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,189
Or are you not saying
because it's worth half a billion?

147
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,637
I am very sorry,
but this stone is fake!

148
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,436
What ?! That can't be ?!

149
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,755
The ring is worth at
maximum, fifty thousand yen!

150
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,437
This is impossible!

151
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,590
Sorry, but it's the best I can offer!

152
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,713
- This isn't true!
- Young man! What do you want to do?

153
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,916
Did she know that it was a fake?

154
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,150
Calm down, please!
Please, calm down!

155
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,675
It's the only thing I've

156
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,354
...asked your father
for in my entire life.

157
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,956
Are you sure it's a fake?

158
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,114
- I'm sure..
- I understand ...

159
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,155
How about seventy
thousand yen for it, then!

160
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,078
- No, thank you.
- That's all right,

161
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,515
I'll take it anyway.

162
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,512
I already said that I don't want to sell it!

163
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,148
I will not sell
it even for a billion!

164
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,031
Is the lens defective?

165
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,356
No, it can not be!
A pauper like that ...

166
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,829
cannot own a diamond
that is worth a billion.

167
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,356
It can't be true!

168
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,952
- Honey, dinner is on the table!
- Right.

169
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,556
I'm right.
It can't be true.

170
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,952
- Be strong!
- Don't you see?

171
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,996
He mocked my mother by ..

172
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,036
...buying her this fake!

173
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,118
- What now?
- Well, I don't know.

174
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,756
I have an idea!
Would you like to come to town with me?

175
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,278
Even if you married Shoma,
you wouldn't be happy!

176
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,749
You could start all over again.

177
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,756
But...

178
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,751
Remember you promised
to be honest with me.

179
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,275
You need to stop
being afraid of my brother.

180
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,272
If you have problems,
I can fix them!

181
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,437
What do you say?

182
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,909
- Why not? ?
- Because ...

183
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,279
- ... Junko would suffer.
- What?

184
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,630
Hey, more beer, honey!

185
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,712
- We need to celebrate! Hurry!

186
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,268
Don't you understand
that when Shoma tires of you,

187
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,557
he will leave you?
What will you do then?

188
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,950
- Hey, you're not half bad?
- Get your paws off!

189
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,756
That is enough!

190
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,956
Yuki, come with me.

191
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,950
I just can't.

192
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,196
Gunma.

193
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,836
Thank you so much, but
I'm making my own way now.

194
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,752
Yuki...

195
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,349
Oh, it seems like you're
having a serious talk!

196
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,436
I bet she dumped you, boy!

197
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,909
It's humiliating to
see you beg, just stop!

198
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,956
Understand that she doesn't want you!

199
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,191
But I'm really curious to
hear more of this conversation!

200
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,357
- Go on, keep going!
- Look here!

201
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,838
This is ridiculous! He bought
her a ring! A ring, you know ?!

202
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:57,719
Boy, did you think to
win her over with a ring...

203
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,439
...which can be found on any stand?

204
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,150
Instead of the ring, get her a car!

205
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,515
It's the better
option, you know?

206
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:15,278
Remove your smelly foot
immediately from that ring!

207
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,958
Are you deaf?
I told you to remove your foot!

208
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,916
I see you know
how to fight, young man!

209
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,958
Gunma!

210
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,197
It's the only thing I've
asked your father for...

211
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,155
So that's it...! Gunma
is having financial difficulties.

212
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,755
I found a solution!
He could drive with my car!

213
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:29,356
I know I don't have
what it takes ..

214
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,590
... to become a great
driver, you know?

215
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,115
Anyway, following this dreadful accident,

216
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,156
my family has practically forced ...

217
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,674
...me to get rid of my
race car as soon as possible!

218
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,075
And since that's happening,
I would like Gunma to have it!

219
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,192
Thank you, Kishida!
I know that Gunma will...

220
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,919
be overjoyed by this news.
Thanks again!

221
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,113
Oh, I'm sorry!

222
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,236
Are you sure about this?

223
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,154
Don't worry. I am happy
to give my car to Gunma!

224
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,551
If there's on thing he
needs to do, it's to win!

225
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,437
Yeah, I can't wait to
give the good news to Tamotsu!

226
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,310
Yes?
Gunma, it's you?

227
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,435
Gunma, why can't
you behave properly?

228
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,909
Before you disappear again,
don't get caught...

229
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,673
...for speeding!
You could have told us ...

230
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,957
...that you went to your family.
Remember that, okay?

231
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,676
And Tamotsu was worried!

232
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,591
Hey! Are you listening?

233
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,550
I don't know what happened,

234
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,596
but based on his mood,

235
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,836
he probably doesn't have the money.

236
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,472
Hey, Gunma, don't
be so sad!

237
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,676
I have good news! Look!

238
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,235
Sempai!

239
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,428
He told me that if you
feel like it, you can race with his car!

240
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,477
Do you realize that in this way ...

241
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,676
...you can participate in that race?

242
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,509
- Sempai!
- Come on!

243
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,033
Kishida, are you serious?

244
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,839
Of course!
The car is all yours!

245
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,075
- Sempai!
- Don't you think...

246
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,435
...that it's time to at least react!

247
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,632
Come on Gunma, show
us what your made of!

248
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,678
- Sempai!
- You're an angel!

249
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,500
I don't want you to thank me,
I just want you to be happy!

250
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,670
To be honest...

251
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,755
My opinion on your car is...

252
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,229
that it's not a technical masterpiece.

253
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,073
Though with my abilities,
victory is assured!

254
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,674
Wouldn't you say?

255
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,109
- Wouldn't you say?
- Yes!

256
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,679
Yuki, I swear I'll make it!
I will win for you too!

257
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,758
I promise you, Gunma, I won't,

258
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,196
End up like your mother.

259
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,798
If the car had a problem
on the track, the drive ...

260
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,711
...must solve it without any help!

261
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,030
The other alternative
is to go into the pit!

262
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,072
In the next episode:

263
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,116
Tamotsu is Shaken!
Hiziri Conceals a Horrible Secret!

264
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,198
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

265
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:14,300
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

266
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:20,250
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

267
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:26,550
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

268
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:36,350
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

269
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:45,250
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

270
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:50,950
These feelings
just flare up

271
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:55,950
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

272
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:02,950
The fantasy penetrates through you

273
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:08,150
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

274
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:16,000
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

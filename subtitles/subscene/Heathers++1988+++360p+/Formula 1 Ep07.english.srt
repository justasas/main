1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,150
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,150
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,500
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,700
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,000
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,000
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,250
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,750
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,250
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,274
No!

16
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,149
Forget about him!
Don't be afraid, I won't hurt you!

17
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,116
Mr. Shoma!

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,751
Yuki!

19
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,750
Go! Go! Go!

20
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,000
The Wandering Young Woman Yuki...

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,833
- Will everything be fine?
- Yes, I'm sure.

22
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,753
He has trained a lot
and has a good chance of winning.

23
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,754
Do you understand, Junko?
I wasn't talking about Gunma,

24
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,229
- but the car!
- That guy is dangerous.

25
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,278
- He drives like crazy!
- He better not destroy the car!

26
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,920
Keith, aren't
you going with him?

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,389
I would have gladly gone,
but the...

28
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,869
keys were taken from my hands!

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,837
Good Morning!

30
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,633
Is this where Gunma Akagi lives?
I'm a friend of his.

31
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,589
What do you say,
Tamotsu, I'm fast enough?

32
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,750
Why do you insist on driving?

33
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,950
I've told you a thousand times...

34
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:18,429
- ...that speed isn't enough!
- Not for me!

35
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,353
My life is all about moving fast!

36
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,473
By the way, before the race\B what should I do more?

37
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,194
Considering the time of day,
you may take the higher license ...

38
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,669
Though if all goes well...

39
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,671
You can take the exam next week!

40
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,955
Really?!
Next week?!

41
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,277
Tamotsu do you think I
can participate in the race!

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,956
I'm happy!

43
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,950
Have you noticed that girl?

44
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,036
Junko, do you think that
girl is from a rich family?

45
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,555
- I don't know!
- Maybe she had a fight ...

46
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,949
with her parents
and she left the house!

47
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,475
Junko! Yuki has started
to do the cleaning!

48
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,956
To me they are just friends.
Though maybe something more!

49
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,039
We finally found
out his secret, Philip!

50
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,630
Your right about that!
Just what we needed!

51
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,597
Stop talking rubbish!

52
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,077
Guys ...!

53
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,836
Its a miracle!

54
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,074
- Hooray!
- Hello everyone, I'm back.

55
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,277
What's going on?

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,877
That'll teach you!

57
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,038
- What's wrong with you?
- Why didn't you say anything?

58
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,439
Your girls here.

59
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,357
What girl?

60
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,677
I am happy to see you.

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,753
- Yuki!
- What are you doing here?

62
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,676
- Did you run away from home?
- Yes!

63
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,075
What happened?
Were you abused?

64
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,836
What did father do?

65
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,275
- No! Nothing!
- So it was Shoma!

66
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,072
- I had a feeling it was him!
- That's not true!

67
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,276
I shouldn't have come here.

68
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,748
What are you saying?
Damn!

69
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,469
You did the right thing!

70
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,790
How could you endure so long?

71
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,440
Don't worry,
your better off here!

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,673
Junko!
This is my friend Yuki!

73
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,316
We already know this.

74
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,190
Could you be more polite!
Hey, wait a moment, Junko!

75
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,358
What's wrong with all them today?

76
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,870
Probably because
as usual your an ass!

77
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,953
Now that was being an ass!

78
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,197
From now on Yuki,
you shall live here...

79
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,157
- ...with us.
- Look, Gunma, I ...

80
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,436
Your just like me.

81
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,516
We both have nobody!

82
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,433
- Actually, I ...
- Don't worry the guys,

83
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,239
here may seem like
idiots but they're nice guys!

84
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,957
You see, Yuki is a
good girl,  a hard worker!

85
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,676
Yes, let's all become friends!

86
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,350
She's right,
I think so too!

87
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,513
Come on, stop standing.
Sit down and eat with us!

88
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,510
Yes.

89
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,068
We'll have to find a
place for you to sleep.

90
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,958
No problem!
Gunma can sleep in my room!

91
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,436
Thanks but no thanks.

92
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,473
- Yuki and I will share the room!
- What?!

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,151
- Did I say something wrong?
- You think?!

94
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,271
You must be joking!

95
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,035
Whats wrong!
Don't you guys trust me!?

96
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,197
Of course not!

97
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,431
Listen, Yuki, next Sunday
we will have a nice trip:

98
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,159
- To the circuit.
- The circuit?!

99
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,669
I have lessons
for a drivers license.

100
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,875
Yuki, if I pass the exam I will
be able to participate in the next race!

101
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,869
- But I'm afraid!
- No, there is nothing to fear!

102
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,437
You'll see, my little Yuki, one day I
will be the fastest driver in the world!

103
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,313
- My dream will come true!
- Of course!

104
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,552
Look.

105
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,837
What a spectacle!
I'll remember this night forever.

106
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,157
You know, Yuki, I was
thinking that if you wish,

107
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,879
you can stay with me forever!

108
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,393
- She's a really nice girl!
- What girl?

109
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,838
- I mean Junko.
- Are you joking?

110
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,593
She's a snake in a skirt!
She's unbearable!

111
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,078
But Junko is exactly the opposite of me.

112
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,074
- She's very elegant and refined.
- Please, stop being silly!

113
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,191
- It's true!
- I can't stand her!

114
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,750
Judging by the way
your looking at it! I get it ...

115
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,640
Gunma Akagi,
can I speak freely?

116
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,596
- Of course!
- Gunma, I know your crazy about her!

117
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,594
Hey, how dare you say that?

118
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,677
If I catch you ...

119
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,396
Yuki, look at the acrobat!

120
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,757
Help!

121
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,360
Damn it!
I'm just an idiot!

122
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,356
Hey, Gunma,
I have to say one thing.

123
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,554
- I'm sorry for all this trouble.
- Don't worry, Yuki.

124
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,280
Junko,
do you also do track racing?

125
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,277
Oh, yes!

126
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,280
I'd like to drive too.

127
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,636
Driving isn't easy.

128
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,038
I must confess that I
am worried about Gunma.

129
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,913
Do you think he'll get to Formula 1?

130
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,436
If he's as good as Tamotsu says,
then he'll make it!

131
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,551
Of course Gunma will succeed!

132
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,191
Excuse me.

133
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,194
Sometimes I get carried away with myself.

134
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,832
Good night.

135
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,074
- What did you say?
- I too could hardly believe it!

136
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,551
But Yuki wouldn't run
away without a reason.

137
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,913
Especially from the
house she grew up in!

138
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,558
Something serious must have happened!

139
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,510
It's true.
But what did happen?

140
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,756
I don't care if you love Gunma.

141
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,354
Now you'll forget about him!

142
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,797
Is that clear?

143
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,156
Dear Gunma and Tamotsu,

144
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,277
sorry that I left without
telling you. I had to.

145
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,230
Thank you for your hospitality,
but I've decided to go live alone,

146
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,871
I don't want to trouble you anymore.

147
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,272
- Please, do not come looking for me.
- Yuki...

148
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,869
When I woke up her
bed was already empty.

149
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,960
Damn it!
I should have stayed with her!

150
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,792
I'm sorry! I should have
payed better attention to her!

151
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,958
I have to find her!
She can't live alone!

152
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,758
Where are you going in a hurry?

153
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,469
Look who's here!
What are you doing here, Shoma?

154
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,675
I've come for Yuki.
This is an order from Dad!

155
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,436
What did you do to that girl?

156
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,309
- Stop it, Gunma!
- As far as we're concerned,

157
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,358
you don't exist to us anymore!

158
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,269
But Yuki is different,
she has her dues to pay!

159
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,839
This time, Shoma,
it won't end here!

160
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,758
I get it. Please contact us
should you have any news.

161
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,515
And we'll do
the same if we get any.

162
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,035
My mother hasn't
seen her near the house,

163
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,917
but she'll call us if she does.

164
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,549
That mean even
Shoma hasn't found her.

165
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,117
Gunma, do you know why she left?

166
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,758
Perhaps she feared that Shoma
would find her and bring her home.

167
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,119
Yuki is alone out
there and she needs me!

168
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,556
Uhm... Did you flirt with
her or something?

169
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,393
- Are you crazy?
- Well, you see ...

170
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,789
In the end Yuki
is a very pretty girl ...

171
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,394
...and she's been away from you..

172
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,675
-  for so long.
- Idiot!

173
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,756
Stop thinking like that!

174
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,638
Yuki is the last
person I'd flirt with!

175
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,597
Although I admit that ...

176
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,954
- I have though about it!
- I knew you were like that!

177
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,913
This could cause
Junko to be jealous.

178
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,630
- What?! - She must have
thought that you two were together.

179
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,156
Tamotsu, if there's a girl
in this world I hate, it's Junko.

180
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,913
Yes, but Yuki must have misunderstood.

181
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,956
Now stop saying stupid things!

182
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,270
She must have thought
you were in love with Junko ...

183
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,591
...and she ran away
because she was hurting!

184
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,912
Hello, friends! I managed to
get a garage for the circuit.

185
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,390
- That's great!
-  I'm glad you're happy.

186
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,675
We'll bring the car over this week.

187
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,595
- Thank you! We are grateful!
- It's been a pleasure.

188
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,996
Gunma, look forward
to tomorrows lesson...

189
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,036
...and give it your best!

190
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,236
Yes, that's for sure!

191
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,234
So, get the next license you must,

192
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,676
first pass a written
exam and then the practical test.

193
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,190
They say it's difficult but
I'm sure you can do it...

194
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:59,113
Stop it!
I heard you the first time!

195
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,839
Now I know it by heart!
That's enough!

196
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,548
Hey! Would you mind
going a little bit slower?

197
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,837
What's wrong you scared!
Sorry but didn't you...

198
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,956
want to go to the circuit,

199
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,355
But your the one that's driving the car!

200
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,393
- The traffic light is yellow!
- Stop, now!

201
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,436
It's red!

202
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,636
Can't you see that I've stopped!

203
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,956
- It's Yuki!

204
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,036
Hey! Yuki!

205
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,429
- Be careful, Gunma!
- Oh, Yuki!

206
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,956
Don't run away!

207
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,197
Yuki!

208
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,956
Why did you run away?

209
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,600
I was worried,
I've been looking everywhere!

210
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,040
You know why, I wrote that letter.

211
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,556
I didn't want to stop you
from reaching your goals.

212
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,155
I've got nothing more to say.
Leave me alone!

213
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,755
I would have only
caused you trouble!

214
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,677
- That's why!
- But how can you think of such things?

215
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,548
Remember when I promised
to take you to the circuit?

216
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,029
We we going there.
You can come if you want.

217
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,750
Come on, let's go!

218
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,436
Don't you want to come?

219
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,676
- There you are! I finally found you!
- Go away, Shoma!

220
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,599
Listen to me, Yuki:
come back home with us.

221
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,796
I promise it will not happen again!

222
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,233
- What did you do?
- None of your business, Gunma,

223
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,073
get out of my way!
Or there will be trouble!

224
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,557
Come on Yuki, let's go home
or father will become angry.

225
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,676
Tell me what you did!

226
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,035
Didn't you hear me,
it's none of your business.

227
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,951
- Come on. Let's go home, Yuki.
- Where are you going?

228
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,036
Yuki will stay here with me!

229
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,553
Do you want to cause trouble!

230
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,671
- Now step aside.
- No, I won't!

231
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,358
This time you'll pay dearly Shoma!

232
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,949
Stop it!
Stop it, please!

233
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,677
Enough! Stop it, Gunma!

234
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,073
- Let go of me!
- I'm going home!

235
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,197
Okay, I'll go home,
but no more fighting!

236
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,676
It's about time.

237
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,036
Don't worry about
the bag, I got it.

238
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,076
The boys will take care of it.

239
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,356
Yuki, you...

240
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,155
Gunma, go to the circuit!

241
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,357
- Yuki... What are you saying?!
- Please go!

242
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,553
Yuki...

243
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,757
Oh, Gunma...

244
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,269
You've got Tamotsu and
Junko by your side,

245
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,951
so go and make
your dream a reality!

246
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,155
Gunma...
Goodbye!

247
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,277
Come back!

248
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,397
No!
Yuki!

249
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,278
Gunma, we're late,
we have to go to the circuit.

250
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,635
If we don't hurry we
won't make it in time!

251
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,036
Come on!
Cheer up!

252
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,833
Don't disappoint her,
make your dream a reality!

253
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,070
Yes!
Faster!

254
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,794
I finally found you!
The machine is ready,

255
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,758
- it's waiting for you.
- I'm coming.

256
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,356
What's the matter?

257
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,590
- He's already arrived?
- Who?

258
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,837
Yes! Faster!
No one can beat me!

259
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,195
I'm the fastest man in the world!

260
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,475
That guys mad!
He's driving with a tractor!

261
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,475
Yeah, that guy sure is crazy.

262
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,275
Yeah, but he is too reckless.

263
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,074
Your driving style
was not much different.

264
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,516
Beginners are all the same.

265
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,151
The excitement for speed can kill!

266
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,110
Yuki, I promise you!

267
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,038
I will become the
best driver in the world!

268
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,159
The fastest man who ever lived!

269
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,674
The Regulation stipulates
that the minimum weight ...

270
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,433
of a Formula 1 car
must not exceed 540 pounds,

271
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,353
that's less than half the
weight of a normal compact car!

272
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,677
In the next episode:

273
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,557
"Gunma vs. Hiziri".

274
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,632
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

275
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,550
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

276
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:19,500
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

277
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,800
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

278
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:35,600
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

279
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,500
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

280
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,200
These feelings
just flare up

281
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

282
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,200
The fantasy penetrates through you

283
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

284
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:15,250
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

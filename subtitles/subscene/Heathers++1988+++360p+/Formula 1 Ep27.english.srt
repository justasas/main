1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,000
Formula 1 - Engines on The Track

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,900
My heart's continuous signal of love

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,900
It's that way because
I want to embrace you

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:24,300
And as I waited I
decided to dance slowly

5
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,300
Both of us could
read each other's lips

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:35,600
We secretly bathed
in the moonlight

7
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,400
After the goodbye

8
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,850
You left without leaving a clue

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,100
Don't betray me Darlin'
She passed through the city

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,750
Nobody knows Love Affair

11
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,150
Together until the morning

12
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,650
Making Love and no more

13
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,250
I felt you when I
touched your hand

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,800
Your a woman

15
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,350
Love Affair

16
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,900
Together until the morning

17
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,600
Making Love and no more

18
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,200
Those words of love
that you want to hear

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,900
Your a woman

20
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,631
My...My car ...

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Gunma's License Is
Taken by Force, He Can't Run!

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,235
Sempai!
Good luck!

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,477
You can't stop me
from seeing him!

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,552
Get your hands off me!
Let me go!

25
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,075
- You're crazy!
- What do you want?

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,157
What's the meaning of this?

27
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,909
The election candidate,
Michael Sander ...

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,673
- She's talking pretty loud!
- ...wants to greet his constituents

29
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,433
... and thanks you in
advance for your votes!

30
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,272
Hi, Grandma!
I wish you a long and happy life!

31
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,757
Why don't you mind
your own business?

32
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,434
Hello, Grandma!
Thank you in advance for your vote.

33
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,750
I won't be voting
for your candidate!

34
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,356
If I'm not mistaken
Gunma's father ...

35
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,159
...is also participating
in this election, and he'll win!

36
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,268
Oh!
Tamotsu!

37
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,153
Long time no
see, grandma.

38
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,475
Tell me, who's
in charge here?

39
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,154
- Your coming with us!
- Hands off!

40
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,589
Tell me who you
are and what you want?

41
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,558
My name is Gunma Akagi
and I'm a Formula 3 driver.

42
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,074
Why are you not interested
in becoming my sponsor?

43
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,000
Your sponsor?

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,436
You are the head
of a famous company!

45
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,431
You could easily sponsor me!

46
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,518
With your help I would be
able to get to Formula 1 faster.

47
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,155
- What ?! Formula 1?
- Really?

48
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,111
He must be dreaming.

49
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,236
What have you laughing at?
I'm telling the truth!

50
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,470
I assure you that
I'm an excellent driver.

51
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,755
There isn't another driver like me!

52
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,673
We are unsure
about your abilities.

53
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,598
However, I personally know
a lot of great drivers.

54
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,638
If you are so good then why
have you not won a World Cup?

55
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,349
- Doesn't it seem strange?
- Yes, very strange.

56
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,073
I appreciate your passion
and wish you success.

57
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,875
But our society,
cannot sponsor a stranger.

58
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,552
I'm sorry, but find a
contract somewhere else.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,515
I get it! You'll be
returning to Hiziri soon!

60
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,029
Yes!
I have a lot of work to do!

61
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,869
But, you can
always live with us.

62
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,270
No. I've already
booked a room at the hotel.

63
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,237
Why a hotel?

64
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,156
Hiziri said that a hotel
was the best solution for me.

65
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,995
Well, how is Gunma doing?

66
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,310
He's in a desperate
search for a sponsor!

67
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,914
He had managed
to get into Formula 3 and...

68
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,749
- ...did you hear about what happened?
- I did.

69
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,758
I almost forgot,
this came for you yesterday.

70
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,751
- It looks important!
- Thank you very much!

71
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,755
So what is that document for?

72
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,554
- To get a passport.
- A passport ?!

73
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,150
So you'll be following
Hiziri in his travels?

74
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,117
I envy you.

75
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,634
I wish I could travel abroad!

76
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,075
- Isn't it a bit late?
- I think so.

77
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,316
Oh, well...

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,434
Damn it!
Why did they all refuse?

79
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,511
They are all a bunch of morons!

80
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,558
But there's only one week left
It's hopeless!

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,468
Hey, sempai, let's
forget about a sponsor...

82
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,596
...and try to find a car instead!

83
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,150
Idiot! We have no money and
nobody's gonna give us one for free!

84
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,310
In any case, in order
to compete in a race,

85
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,436
- you need a lot of money!
- Hello, guys!

86
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,636
Tamotsu was here earlier on.

87
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,597
- Eh?!
- Tamotsu?

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,753
He has a lot of
nerve to show up here.

89
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,395
That kid who caused some trouble...

90
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,948
he's a Formula 3 driver and belongs...

91
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,996
- ...to your Federation! !
- Is that true?

92
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,033
Yes! By chance I saw
a report on television,

93
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,078
- and I sent some pictures.
- Why are you doing this?

94
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,839
I am a supporter
opposed to violence in sports!

95
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,795
It seems inconceivable that a driver...

96
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,836
...like him was involved with the Police!

97
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,555
You need to punish him,
before he gets out of hand.

98
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,998
All I ask is for you to take action,

99
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,957
to protect our supporters!

100
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,237
Otherwise, I will be forced
to resort to other means!

101
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,548
Other means?
What do you mean?

102
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,348
If you don't do it,
it will get personal.

103
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,235
- What did you say?
- Eh ?!

104
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,359
Yes.

105
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,074
He's got to abroad
to order a new car.

106
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,477
A new car?

107
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,870
Tamotsu said it is necessary.

108
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,600
Because if Hiziri be able
to win this championship,

109
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,672
- then next year he'll go worldwide!
- What?

110
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,316
That means that the next race ...

111
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,356
...will be the last
one he is here for!

112
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,436
This is just bullshit!

113
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,036
He mustn't change
category before I, I can't be...

114
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,031
... left defeated in Formula 3!

115
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,395
Nobody and I mean
nobody will overtake me!

116
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,155
- Sempai!
- Damn it!

117
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,557
Wait!

118
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,829
- A new car?!
- I need to join that race!

119
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,156
I must catch up with Hiziri!

120
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,071
I just can't do nothing!

121
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,116
Only you can help me!

122
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,756
Of course I can help you.

123
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,035
But if they know it's
you, you'll be removed.

124
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,237
Why should they?
Aren't I a good driver?

125
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,590
I won't let it end like this!

126
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,756
All the cars that
drive in Formula 3 ...

127
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,831
...need the help of a sponsor.

128
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,958
And your personality is
making it even harder.

129
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,236
So you'd better forget it!

130
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,356
Besides, it takes a lot of money!

131
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,396
I will manage to get hold of the money!

132
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,597
You must only show me
someone who can get me a car!

133
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,955
Sempai is an excellent driver!

134
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,996
I think he's the best in the world!

135
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,077
We must do something for him!

136
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,628
I'm ready to use all my savings!

137
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,915
Well, what do you say?

138
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,590
You idiot! I don't need
you anyway, we'll get by on our own!

139
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,353
- Come on, we'll show him!
- Yes!

140
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,356
Wait.

141
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,830
I know a man who could help you.

142
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,158
- He's called Eijiro!
- Eijiro?!

143
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,073
The last time I saw him,
he lived just outside of town.

144
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,233
It's too late now,
however, I've heard ...

145
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,357
...he had a car to sell!
But be careful!

146
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,996
He's not the friendly type.

147
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,350
I was able to endure even you,

148
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,079
so I might as
well impress him too!

149
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,757
Hey, get me a drink!

150
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,036
Are you going
to get it or not?

151
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,437
We are closing!

152
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,636
Ah, you're his friends!

153
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,076
Good evening,
you must be Eijiro!

154
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,356
My name is Gunma Akagi.

155
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,596
Kuroi told me about you.

156
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,996
Would you be
willing to sell your car?

157
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,071
Logically, we will
pay you for it!

158
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,999
I have to participate in the
next round of the championship!

159
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,432
Boy, I haven't the faintest
idea what you're talking about!

160
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,590
Come on, don't play dumb.

161
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,757
It's useless to pretend!
We know you own a car!

162
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,996
What do you say?

163
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,835
Are you willing to
sell the car or not?

164
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,675
Whoa!
This man is a real savage!

165
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,836
Shut your mouth!

166
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,754
No, my friend! It's not my
style to give up without a fight!

167
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,031
- Be careful!
-  Look who's talking!

168
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,597
I'm finally home!

169
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,236
Did you think
you could escape me?

170
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,234
- Hello!
- Why are you here?

171
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,191
The machine has already
been set up, hasn't it?

172
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,157
Don't touch it!

173
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,630
Wow, you've got
yourself a real beauty!

174
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,637
Don't do it!

175
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,828
Yes, it is ...
I'm coming too Tamotsu!

176
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,360
This is great!
Truly outstanding!

177
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,070
The engine is a real gem!

178
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,915
With this car,
nobody will beat me!

179
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,072
- Sempai!
- Get out of that car now!

180
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,757
- Sempai!
- What was that for?

181
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,713
- Get out of here!
- Not a chance!

182
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,075
Now hat I've seen
the car I want it!

183
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,870
I badly need to drive this car.

184
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,190
I must participate in the next race!

185
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,840
- I'm begging you!
- Please sir!

186
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,276
Didn't you hear me?

187
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,551
Get out of here!
Or I'll make you suffer!

188
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,551
Sempai!

189
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,677
Please, calm down!
Let us talk this out!

190
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,315
Good thing those two are gone!

191
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,156
This is not for children!

192
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,350
I wouldn't give this car up
for all the gold in the world!

193
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,918
This car is my friend,
it'll never betray me.

194
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,430
And it's all mine!

195
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,434
He was the craziest
guy I've ever met!

196
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,909
Yes, but I warned you!

197
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,949
You were right!
Anyway, his car ...

198
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,917
- ...is really something.
- Yes!

199
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,512
But, as soon as I
got in the passenger seat,

200
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,160
it reminded me of the
days I spent with Tamotsu.

201
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,199
But there is one
thing I don't understand!

202
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,919
Why does he keep
it hidden in his house?

203
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,594
It's hard to explain.
He's always been the kind ...

204
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,557
..who's not good with people.

205
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,871
He argues that machines
unlike humans do not betray you.

206
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,917
Someone must have made him suffer!

207
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,639
That's not a good reason
to keep it under lock and key!

208
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,188
I'll take the care by
force and beat Hiziri.

209
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,236
Kuroi, something has happened ...

210
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,551
Ah, you're not alone!
Gunma is here too!

211
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,234
Well, why don't you tell us?
What's so bad?

212
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,880
Well ... Uhm...I

213
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,996
Speak, tell us what happened!

214
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,036
Well, you see...

215
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,836
It just got this letter.
Hey, wait!

216
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,076
Look! It's from the
President of our Federation!

217
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,478
Who knows what he wants...

218
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,837
- Eh, they want to withdraw his license?
- And for what reason?

219
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,150
They didn't specify a reason.

220
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,434
- What about Gunma?
- He's...

221
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,429
How is your new passport?
Was there any problems?

222
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,318
- No! Everything is alright!
- Hi, Hiziri!

223
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,960
It was kind of Mr. Kasai
invite us to this party.

224
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,076
Just imagine!
This is a party with friends ...

225
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,436
...that happens once a month!
It's nothing official!

226
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,031
I see that she does not drink alcohol.

227
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,429
Do you not drink?
You should at least try a cocktail!

228
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,750
- I don't drink when I drive!
- I'm the same as you.

229
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,872
By the way, has reached an
agreement with management?

230
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,993
Sure! Now I need to
win the next two races.

231
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,669
You have a lot of confidence in yourself!
Okay! I wish you good luck!

232
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,313
The President of the Federation
takes notice of my career.

233
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,072
- Are you sure you're all right?
- I'm better now.

234
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,516
Luckily it was a light attack.

235
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,433
Luckily it wasn't a stronger
attack or I'd be done for.

236
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,994
HEADQUARTERS OF THE SUPPORTERS OF Soichiro ROSS

237
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,036
We were able to make
him withdraw the license.

238
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,078
Our man in the
Federation just confirmed this.

239
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,238
- I understand.
- And finally ... this!

240
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,636
They are the result of the negotiation.

241
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,033
Excuse me, sir, there is a certain
Gunma Akagi who wants to enter.

242
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,076
What?! Gunma Akagi?

243
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,039
For heaven's sake! Don't let him in!
- Mr Kasai!

244
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,076
Looks like I've found you.

245
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,309
I demand you give me an explanation!

246
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,960
Tell me why your
pulling my license?

247
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,988
Oh, no! Why is he here?

248
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,997
Dad, accept this apology
for the trouble I've caused.

249
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,957
However, this is your money!

250
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,508
Then the matter is completely settled?

251
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,751
Yes! And I even sorted Gunma out.

252
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,676
- Perfect!
- By the way, how is Yuki?

253
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,436
I've seen how
you've been treating her.

254
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,829
If I were you I
wouldn't think of leaving.

255
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,076
I'll take care of her.

256
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,591
- Who took these?
- I don't know.

257
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,711
But I had to take action.

258
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,076
But this is an injustice!
I didn't cause the brawl!

259
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,435
I don't see why I
should be punished.

260
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,678
This isn't about who
is right or who is wrong.

261
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,349
Your a sportsman
under everyones eyes.

262
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,034
We just can't be involved with...

263
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,839
...any form of violence when
a sportsman is involved!

264
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,838
I was forced to make this decision ...

265
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,674
...as to prevent problems more
serious problems in the future.

266
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,353
The license has been withdrawn
and there is nothing we can do.

267
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,517
I'm sorry!

268
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,834
- Wait a minute!
- Gunma!

269
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,753
- Tamotsu?
- Gunma...

270
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,156
I am happy to see you!

271
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,756
I never imagined to meet you ...

272
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,796
...at a party as important as this!

273
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,952
If forgot how much
you love parties now.

274
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,157
Gunma,
Is it true...

275
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,196
That they withdrew your license ...

276
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,677
- because you were involved in a fight?
- Why do you care.

277
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,633
I though you only cared
about Hizir and his car.

278
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,837
What's wrong with you!
I'm still your friend and I care...

279
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,356
...about you. I also know how
much Formula 3 means to you.

280
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,914
And since you've no
license, you can't drive.

281
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,877
- Traitor!
- Eh ?!

282
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,757
Do you remember
how hard I worked?

283
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,758
But that didn't stop
you from joining Hiziri.

284
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,075
And you dare to
say you're still my friend.

285
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,230
So why don't I...

286
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,355
My matters do not
concern you anymore.

287
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,157
Gunma!

288
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,756
I don't know what to do.

289
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,069
I have no money, don't have a car
and now I don't even have a driver's license!

290
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,634
I've got to find a solution.

291
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,111
RACING CIRCUIT ENTRY FOR PADDOCK

292
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,512
I just can't give up the world of racing!

293
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,556
Eh ?! Hiziri is sick?

294
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,154
Yes, but it's a secret!
But we've got to be careful.

295
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,635
Unfortunately Hiziri is
suffering from an incurable disease!

296
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,234
It's something that
only me, Hizir and Ruiko know!

297
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,271
In the next episode:

298
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,316
Hiziri's Disease Creeps Closer,
But I Am not Afraid of Death

299
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,550
Hiziri, the circuit will
not become your grave!

300
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:28,650
I saw you crying after
you were abandoned

301
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,550
Let's climb that hill
and look back down

302
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:39,650
In the big world it's undeniable

303
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:50,400
Yesterday's pain is
not visible anymore

304
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,900
OK Let's start it

305
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,900
In order to grieve

306
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,100
Ah It's as if we weren't born

307
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:15,350
You are my energy, You are my energy

308
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,750
Courage come out

309
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:27,050
By just being with you

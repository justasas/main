1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,370
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:05,370
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:08,020
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,020
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,370
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,270
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,270
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,570
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,870
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,370
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:50,870
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,120
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,620
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:07,120
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Goodbye, Gunma! Rival Hiziri
Announces His Step-up to Formula 3

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,676
You think this is funny?

17
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,874
My mother bought me this,

18
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,191
...to wear on very special occasions!

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,155
Don't you believe in
celebrating for Hiziri?

20
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,675
Look, Tamotsu,
you can't be serious?

21
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,039
But a lot of important
people will be there.

22
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,277
Ruiko said that we will have fun.

23
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,634
Who knows,
maybe you will.

24
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,948
You're in love with Ruiko!
And that's the truth.

25
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,189
What are you saying?
That's nonsense!

26
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,993
Is it!
If not why...

27
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,150
...did you dress so fancy?

28
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,073
The fact is that I've
never been to a party so...

29
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,071
...I didn't know how to dress!

30
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,390
Grandma, please,  tell me:

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,755
should I also bring a gift?

32
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,593
Maybe, a cake,
or a box of chocolates,

33
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,513
- Or a bunch of flowers!
- Tamotsu!

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,194
Your like a school
boy on his first dance!

35
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,350
Well, guys,
I should be going.

36
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,675
You'll join me later,
won't you?

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,349
Go on ahead!
Gunma will be ...

38
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,317
...making an appearance later!

39
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,960
Stop joking!
Don't even think...

40
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,156
...that I'd go and
celebrate in my rivals home...

41
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,151
...just so he can gloat!

42
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,677
Have fun!

43
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,638
So, are you
going to Hiziri's party?

44
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,836
Of course I'm going!

45
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,916
And will Gunma be going?

46
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,957
I get it ...

47
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,157
Look Tamotsu, go ahead
and enjoy yourself.

48
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,117
Get to know nice people!

49
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,198
The important thing is
that you don't provoke Gunma!

50
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,678
- Yes, you're right!
- You're a good boy.

51
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,673
If there are any problems,
let me know right away.

52
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,590
I would hate for
you two to fall out.

53
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,589
UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL HARUKA

54
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,757
This is terrible!

55
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,519
- Hell there!
- Sempai!

56
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,077
You alright?

57
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,994
What bad luck!
Once I've done more than fifteen,

58
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,230
I'll then be able
to overcome Hiziri!

59
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,197
I almost beat him!

60
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,157
I am very sorry!

61
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,674
By the way, you know what?
I got my revenge!

62
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,275
- Haitani got what he deserved!
- You serious?!

63
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,674
Once you win the next race,
Hiziri will know that your better!

64
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,390
Heal faster,
then we'll race together...

65
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,552
- ...all over the world!
- Sempai!

66
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,551
Okay ...

67
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,037
See you!

68
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,551
Sempai!

69
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,668
- See you later.
- Bye Tamotsu.

70
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,356
Am I going or not?

71
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,919
I came to
check up on you.

72
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,991
Oh...! Thank you.

73
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,594
Don't worry about the party,
you don't

74
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,830
- have to come!
- Uhh...

75
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,476
Hiziri picked up Tamotsu!

76
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,836
It's none of my business,

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,673
but I'd though I'd let you know.

78
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,314
Tamotsu seems worried about something!

79
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,037
Why is he worried?

80
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,676
Why would he be worried?

81
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,551
I'm home.

82
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,397
What are you up to?

83
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,988
"I'll be back late.
In the fridge you will find...

84
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,197
...everything you need for dinner.
Yours, Grandma.

85
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,039
By the way,
Kinoshita and Matsuura aren't here either.

86
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,276
They probably went out for dinner!

87
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,277
And Tamotsu went to that party ...

88
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,517
It's just the two of us.

89
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,194
Why don't we both go out for dinner?

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,956
It's my treat!

91
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,237
Since we are alone,
why do not you give me a kiss?

92
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,156
At least one! Please!

93
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,909
It's always the same with you!
Don't you think about anything else?

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,956
I'm going to dinner alone!

95
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,951
Wait Junko!
I'm coming too!

96
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,315
- Then your paying the bill!
- Wait!

97
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,277
But it is logical that I pay!

98
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,158
We'll go to a luxurious French
restaurant by the candlelight!

99
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,551
Wait here a minute!
Okay? Don't move!

100
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,351
Tamotsu will pay.

101
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,910
He must have
money hidden somewhere!

102
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,277
Where is it?

103
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,911
Is this it?!

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,753
I knew I would
find it sooner or later!

105
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,560
Damn,
he's spent a lot of money...

106
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,837
buying that race car,
but he still has some left over!

107
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,959
There's so little left!

108
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,436
Hurry up!

109
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,836
Hi, who's calling?

110
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,592
No, Tamotsu will be
back later this evening.

111
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,557
Would you like to leave a message?

112
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,116
Wow, he was polite.

113
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,509
That person sounded very nice.

114
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,234
It's great
that Gunma is felling better.

115
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,276
And Tamotsu...

116
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,316
...and Junko.

117
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,035
I must admit that
Gunma is a handful,

118
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,998
however he needs
more money to race.

119
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,559
So it would seem.

120
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,598
Shoma will be arriving home soon,

121
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,071
...and if he found these
magazines he would get angry!

122
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,875
No! Don't worry.
I'll hide them.

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,036
I get it.
Well, I'm going.

124
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,075
This is delicious.

125
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,595
Waiter, bring me more, please.

126
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,358
Junko, what was Ryuji's position?

127
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,836
I don't understand what you mean.

128
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,470
I'm talking about money: funding!

129
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,440
I'm guessing he was very rich.

130
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,117
No, he wasn't.

131
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,348
One day, however,
he managed to find a sponsor:

132
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,238
a service station.

133
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,235
I remember that he was very happy!

134
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,957
They instructed Ryuji...

135
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,756
I'm curious to know what
Tamotsu is doing at that party!

136
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,796
- I don't care.
- You mean ...

137
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,757
...you wouldn't like to go?

138
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,757
Are you kidding?

139
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,036
It isn't too late you know.

140
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,997
Why don't you go there?

141
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,674
Stop it!
It's none of your business!

142
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:01,356
Why do you feel such angry towards Hiziri?

143
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,676
Instead, you should be grateful.

144
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,190
You wouldn't have a
license if it wasn't for him.

145
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,756
Why don't we change the subject?

146
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,351
Hiziri was here!
He picked up Tamotsu.

147
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,556
Fight me, Hiziri!

148
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,836
Next time I'll win.

149
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,909
Hi, Tamotsu!
This is a surprise!

150
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,470
- What happened?
- I have to talk business with Hiziri.

151
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,437
Are you serious?

152
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,949
What kind of business
do you have with him?

153
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,677
Hiziri...

154
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,956
He's a trouble maker!

155
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,470
So, you're having fun tonight?

156
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,878
Yes. But I have
come here for another reason.

157
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,431
So, Tamotsu, go ahead!

158
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,353
Can I ask you for a big favor?

159
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,960
With all the knowledge
and influential friends you have,

160
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,996
it would be easy for you...

161
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,230
...to put in a good word for me.

162
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,349
It would be great if you could...

163
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,432
...help me get a job as a mechanic.

164
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,476
I beg of you.

165
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,350
Why do you want to change your job?

166
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,749
I can't stay there any longer!

167
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,275
Anything would be fine.

168
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,592
Okay.
I'll see what I can do.

169
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,557
Really? You will!

170
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,357
Though, remember one thing,

171
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,352
my car is always here waiting for you!

172
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,599
I'm honored,
but I can't!

173
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,517
Wow! He owns a whole
villa filled with young ladies!

174
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,036
Where are you going?

175
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,753
Just where is Tamotsu?

176
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,717
Hello, Mr. Akagi!

177
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,714
Don't even think about stealing anything!

178
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,711
...or there will be trouble!

179
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,950
- What?
- Don't tell me you came...

180
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,270
- ...to join us?
- No way!

181
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,234
Then stop looking at
me like that and go home!

182
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,597
How dare you!

183
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,359
- I'll show you!
- Oh, my God!

184
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,831
Good one.

185
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,552
Hey, why are you
staring at me like that?

186
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,917
- Tamotsu, where are you?
- Excuse me!

187
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,833
Gunma?!
What are you doing here?

188
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,673
I'm obviously here to find you.

189
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,556
You asshole!

190
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,676
How rude!

191
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:34,594
- Well, Tamotsu, let's go home.
- Why don't you stay, Gunma?

192
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,029
- It's good to see you again.
- Look, it's useless ...

193
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,997
...to try and get me to stay...

194
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,674
...you won the race.
I won't let you gloat!

195
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,711
Gunma, control yourself!

196
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,314
Listen up:
if that accident didn't happen,

197
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,356
I would have won the race.

198
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,876
However I won't lose again.
Next time I'll win.

199
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,678
It's really a shame,
I probably won't see you for a while.

200
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,956
What?

201
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,555
Just this evening I decided
on moving up in the world.

202
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,675
From now on,
I'll be racing in Formula 3.

203
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,592
Although this is still a bit away...

204
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,910
...I intend to go there eventually.

205
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,197
This time, next year
I'll be celebrating once again!

206
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,919
- Congratulations!
- Hiziri!

207
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,755
Enough!
I will get my revenge soon!

208
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,470
I wish you good luck...

209
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,279
...and treat Tamotsu well,
he deserves it!

210
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,198
I'll have the last laugh!
I'll catch up to you,

211
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,191
no matter where you go.

212
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,635
And then we'll see who's the strongest!

213
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,676
Remember that!

214
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,194
Stop that!
Before you can beat me ...

215
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,236
...you need to learn
how to finish a race!

216
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,631
- What was that?
- Stop!

217
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,794
- Let's get out of here!
- But I don't...

218
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,235
Do I have to repeat myself!

219
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,356
I still haven't finished
talking to Tamotsu.

220
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,154
Do what you want!
But remember, Tamotsu:

221
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,595
whatever proposal he makes,
don't accept it!

222
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,433
Me and you are
a team, aren't we?

223
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,677
Gunma.

224
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,632
Goodbye!

225
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,037
- Damn!
- What happened?

226
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,634
What happened in there?
Come on, tell me?

227
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,796
- Formula 3?
- Yes!

228
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,519
But how do I
get into Formula 3?

229
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,279
Listen, don't let him bother you!

230
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,158
Junko, I said how
do I get into Formula 3!

231
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,392
It's simple!
You have to win the championship ...

232
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,358
...and then
make your way there...

233
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,351
...and prove your a good driver!

234
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,159
So all I have to do is win all the upcoming races?

235
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,674
By doing so then you'll
reach Formula 3 next year,

236
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,712
- But you can't do it!
- And why not?

237
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,519
- You'll see that it's too difficult!
- I will succeed!

238
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,592
And don't forget:
it takes a lot of money!

239
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,595
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

240
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,673
This is the new machine.
It just arrived.

241
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,474
Can I look at
it a bit closer?

242
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,516
Sure, why not.

243
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,713
- Really?!
- Sure! Go on ahead.

244
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,360
You can use it,
the walls are soundproof.

245
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,550
- Do whatever you want!
- Eh?!

246
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,630
This is fantastic!
It's the most...

247
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,676
...beautiful car I've ever seen!

248
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,960
It sounds exciting, right?

249
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,477
It's a wonderful feeling!
Isn't it?

250
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,473
Don't worry about Hiziri...

251
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,440
- Come on, stop this.
- Don't you like me?

252
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,598
Of course I do!
I'm a man, aren't I?

253
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,832
The fact is that I have no
experience with women, and...

254
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,196
I'll be gentle.

255
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,313
Get off me!

256
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,789
I'm not that type of guy,

257
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,348
who succumbs
to something immoral,

258
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,193
Now, please,
leave me alone!

259
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,596
I'm sorry for what Ruiko did.

260
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,518
Forget about that,
what about a drink?

261
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,279
I've got something to say.

262
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,391
I've been dealing with an idiot?!

263
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,398
Do you treat me like
this because I'm from the country?

264
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,589
I've lost all respect for you.

265
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,791
Is that so...
Whatever makes you happy.

266
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,118
A drive and a
mechanic....

267
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,751
...should both treat each other well...

268
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,356
...to prove that both of
them care for each other.

269
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,833
I propose a toast
to our future cooperation!

270
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,277
A cars setup is everything.

271
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,954
If a bolt is loosened,
the rider could die.

272
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,675
But if the bolt is in place,
victory is assured!

273
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,518
The world of racing
is a dangerous place...

274
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,672
...time and money
can't solve everything.

275
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,439
Though a man can feed
his passion for engines.

276
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,034
And his skills can be improved,

277
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,275
My door is always open to you.

278
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,237
Think about it.

279
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,476
Your speed is determined
by what category your in.

280
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,676
In F1, you start from
what is called "the grid" ...

281
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,716
this is decided the
day before you race.

282
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,711
In the next episode:

283
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,836
"Tokyo Is Blown Away!
Gunma's Secret Part-time Operation".

284
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,433
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

285
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,550
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

286
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:19,500
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

287
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,800
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

288
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:35,600
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

289
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,500
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

290
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,200
These feelings
just flare up

291
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

292
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,200
The fantasy penetrates through you

293
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

294
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:15,250
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

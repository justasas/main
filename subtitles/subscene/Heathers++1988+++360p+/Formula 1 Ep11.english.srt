1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,150
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,150
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,500
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,700
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,000
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,000
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,250
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,750
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,250
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,672
I'm sorry for Gunma behaving rude,

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,756
I don't know how to apologize.

17
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,198
- But nothing serious happened!
- But he ...

18
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,556
- I saw your car!
- Eh?!

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,956
The one you prepared for Gunma.

20
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,550
I was very interested in it.

21
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,230
During the race I saw ...

22
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,436
...how his car was as equal as mine.

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,635
You must be a genius ...

24
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,951
- ...with cars.
- I'm actually a beginner.

25
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,838
Why don't the two of use become friends?

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,250
The Storm of Tsukuba Circuit,
Another Genius Appears

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,956
Okay, thank you very much.

28
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,719
I have just been informed
that the ship with your new car ...

29
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,677
- ... has arrived in port.
- Good.

30
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,553
Now I'll have a new machine
and a new mechanic.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,958
Now you've put all that behind you.

32
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,672
I hope that you won't change girlfriend.

33
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,836
- In fact I already have!
- Eh?!

34
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,676
My true love came into port.

35
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,269
How can you compare me to a car?
It's absurd!

36
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,154
And that's why I'm such a great driver!

37
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,839
If I didn't love the car and the mechanic,

38
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,797
I wouldn't be a real driver.

39
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,755
Excuse me,
I'm going to take a shower.

40
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,357
Sempai.

41
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,757
How's your foot?

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,036
- Damn it!
- What's wrong?

43
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,950
The doctor said it was healed.

44
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,996
That's great! Hurray!

45
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,671
I'd had enough of
these stupid bandages!

46
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,671
Anyway thanks for your help.

47
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,597
Move it!

48
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,991
He's so smart.

49
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,389
SHIPPING SERVICE

50
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,958
I never though you'd heal so fast!

51
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,799
I was willing to bet that I was...

52
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,836
...going to race.

53
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,077
I'm unbeatable.

54
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,436
And it shows! You can
start training tomorrow!

55
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,188
There are only five days til the race.

56
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,550
So you've got to train for eight hours,

57
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,359
- for four days!
-  That's more than enough!

58
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,836
Now don't overdo it!
Eight hours is the bare minimum!

59
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,636
Stop whining!

60
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,268
Listen up!
This isn't a game!

61
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,158
Even a tenth of a second
can make a difference!

62
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,840
It's important that
you remember the path,

63
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,956
- So nothing goes wrong!
- Stop it!

64
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,355
The most important
thing is that you win!

65
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,677
Uhm ...

66
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,390
I have something
interesting to show you.

67
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,436
It might be useful!

68
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,075
I analyzed the track
in a scientific way ...

69
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,116
...and I got this detailed diagram,

70
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,509
in which I reported the
speed and trajectory ...

71
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,831
- ... to turn the corners!
- But how?

72
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,275
If you prepare well and
study your opponents,

73
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,316
no one can beat you.

74
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,958
Second.

75
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,475
You can't race on an empty stomach!

76
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,676
A nice plate of spaghetti!

77
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,355
Tell me, are you still
entrusting your new car ...

78
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,157
...to that young mechanic?

79
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,630
I don't see why I
should change my mind!

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,956
You look troubled.

81
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,156
Maybe your doubts are justified!

82
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,676
That guy is so young!

83
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,950
Don't worry,
everything will be fine.

84
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,277
You lost again!

85
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,314
Your not good at this are you?

86
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,277
You should quit!

87
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,830
- Anyway you owe me money!
- We'll see, I'll win the next one!

88
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,117
You never give up, do you?

89
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,873
You just got lucky,
you hear?

90
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,548
- Hello everyone!
- Welcome back!

91
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,474
I'll make dinner soon!
After I beat this cheater!

92
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,909
It's alright,
I've already eaten.

93
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,036
I was at the restaurant with Morioka.

94
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,634
Tamotsu, I decided to leave early tomorrow morning.

95
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,756
I'll go to the circuit to do some training.

96
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,751
- Eh?!
- Look!

97
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,150
My foot healed.
The doctor gave me the green light.

98
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,231
- But you can't!
- I can!

99
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,959
Hurry up and make your move!

100
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,913
- Here it is!
- Victory!

101
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,517
What did I tell you?
I knew that I would win!

102
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,634
Okay! Now I can
cook dinner, guys!

103
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,917
In my opinion you are not
yet ready to participate in that race.

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,956
What did you say?

105
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,758
Gunma,
don't you understand!

106
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,912
To be able to run on the track
you must first rehabilitate your foot!

107
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,839
Who do you think your talking to?

108
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,837
Let me go!

109
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,191
- I will race!
- Alright then!

110
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,276
Are you convinced?

111
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,589
If you had listened from the beginning,
this would not have happened!

112
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,035
Okay, but on one condition!

113
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,551
A condition?

114
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,835
I demand that you promise me one thing.

115
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,116
Whatever decision you intend to take,

116
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,191
you must tell me before hand,

117
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,517
By now you should know!

118
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,558
A mechanic and a driver
should understand each other!

119
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,912
We must work as if
we are a single person!

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,230
This is important to
the success of the race!

121
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,594
I hope your happy,
Tamotsu, but remember:

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,595
I will not race just to race,
I will race to win!,

123
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,553
Just remember, I will win!

124
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,549
It's strange that both Hiziri and
Haitani can't understand this!

125
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,390
- Gunma!
- How come your so slow?

126
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,438
I've done three laps already!
I told you to keep up!

127
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,756
I ain't that good.

128
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,959
Incredible!
Gunma's doing great!

129
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,675
- It's the engine!
- Hiziri!

130
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,598
You know, the straight, sharp bends, ...

131
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,353
Easily done by a driver like me,

132
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,431
But they become impossible to deal when ...

133
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,476
...you've got a bad setup!

134
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,516
Tell me, how old are you, Tamotsu?

135
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,030
Eighteen years old, the same as Gunma!

136
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,435
Eh?!
One wouldn't think so.

137
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,437
Thank you! I...

138
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,750
In fact, my father
was also a great mechanic.

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,673
I started very early with engines ...

140
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,637
...and I soon learned the trade.

141
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,915
- I feel sorry for you.
- Eh?!

142
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,952
In my opinion,
that car is wasted on Gunma.

143
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,668
Your more talented,
it should be yours.

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,594
He'll never become a good driver.

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,549
I'm sorry if my words
offended you.

146
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,230
There's no need.
I was not offended at all!

147
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,154
I think, that Gunma has
several chances of success!

148
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,714
If you say so ...!
Seeing him drive ...

149
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,678
...makes me think that
he won't be a great driver!

150
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,916
Well, we'll see!

151
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,276
I want to put him to the test!

152
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,550
Pay attention to what's happening now!

153
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,517
Gunma which way?

154
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,197
Did it work?

155
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,552
What happened?

156
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,359
See?
He had to guess the direction!

157
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,955
Up, down, right or left.

158
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,270
This test shows this!

159
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,395
Your friend, really is a strange one!

160
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,517
As kids we spent the
afternoon's on the river bank.

161
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,269
Gunma would always
read the trains advertisements.

162
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,238
The train passed at a
distance of about fifty meters!

163
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,597
"Hiking in the mountains.
Weekly departures throughout the summer.

164
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,955
For more information
contact the following number. "

165
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,677
I beg your pardon, friend.

166
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,751
It was not my intention to upset you!

167
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,595
- I'm not angry.
- I'll make you a promise:

168
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,511
I won't speak ill of Gunma,

169
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,750
Agree.
Let bygones be bygones.

170
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,956
But...

171
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,595
- I have to go now. Bye!
- Hiziri.

172
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,750
By the way ...
Do you remember?

173
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,112
My car arrived two days ago...

174
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,919
...straight from Europe!
- What are you saying?

175
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,033
Well, I thought you'd like a look.

176
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,118
You two should drop by
when you have the time.

177
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,430
A new car...

178
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,277
Lucky him!

179
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,273
I knew he wouldn't come!

180
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,233
Though he'll come around eventually.

181
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,278
He's probably just being stubborn!

182
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,279
I will succeed, my dear.
I just need more time.

183
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,272
My visit has only
served to test the water.

184
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,038
I'm sure that I can convince him.

185
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,951
At any cost!

186
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,074
Hey, what was that about?

187
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,151
It was nothing.

188
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,913
He seemed interested in you.

189
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,719
- Am I right?
- Don't be stupid!

190
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,360
Anyway you should concentrate on the race,

191
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,713
You should know that I
don't like being tricked by anyone ...

192
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,950
- ..even by you!
- Gunma!

193
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,476
Now it's serious,

194
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,515
The champion of the
world champion, Hiziri,

195
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,273
is racing!
He's mine!

196
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,155
Don't do anything crazy, Gunma!

197
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,357
Remember that we have to
go home as soon as possible!

198
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,199
Have you forgotten that
Morioka is waiting for us?

199
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,597
- Let him wait.
- Listen to me Gunma!

200
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,955
We still have a lot of work to do!

201
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,958
I am the fastest!
He won't beat me!

202
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,958
You're finally here!
What have you done to this engine?

203
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,996
It's a disaster!

204
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,230
I told you to follow the instructions!

205
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,675
I at least followed most of it!

206
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,677
- Is Gunma still on the track?
- Unfortunately!

207
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,516
- Gunma!
WE HAVE TO GO HOME!

208
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,836
Gunma is trying to beat Hiziri ...

209
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,753
and prove that he's the best!

210
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,956
He's such a great driver!

211
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,039
Damn it!
This won't be easy.

212
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,596
I must win! In fact I was the
one who started the challenge!

213
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,437
This guy's crazy!

214
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,117
I'm first.

215
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,758
You damn frog!
Did you have to do that?

216
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,228
Damn! Don't you know
there wasn't any time to break?

217
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,834
You were lucky!
You didn't die!

218
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,675
It's now leaking oil!

219
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,955
I'm afraid that won't be
able to fix it.

220
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,195
- It's very serious.
- I'm sorry about this.

221
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,869
Gunma, you could at least apologize!

222
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,275
Don't even think about it!

223
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,197
What are you thinking?
This was your fault!

224
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,669
You can't avoid
the blame this time!

225
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,556
Isn't that right, Hiziri?

226
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,758
How dare you speak to Hiziri like that!

227
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,115
- Apologize right now, Gunma!
- I won't!

228
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,350
- Gunma!
- The one who wins the championship ...

229
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,671
...should at least
know how to avoid a car!

230
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,837
Or did you do it on purpose.

231
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,354
because I though you were a pro!

232
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,550
Stop talking nonsense, Gunma!

233
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,791
- How dare you!
- Enough! stop this!

234
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,835
I am a human being just like you!

235
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,675
And as one,
I made a mistake!

236
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,678
If you want I could
help repair the car.

237
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,189
You gotta be kidding...

238
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,272
...a beginner could never repair it!

239
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,278
- But I just wanted to ...
- Let's go, Tamotsu!

240
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,109
Your just wasting your breath!

241
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,630
Let's get moving,
we have work to do at home!

242
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,474
We can't leave, we're the one's responsible!

243
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,758
It's okay, Tamotsu,
It's your choice.

244
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,030
- Thank you, Hiziri!
- Hiziri...

245
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,192
While you're there, do a general
overhaul of the car,

246
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,754
so that I can race with confidence,

247
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,793
You can do anything,
but on one condition:

248
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,757
put it back together again!

249
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,836
You have my word!

250
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,836
Alright, I trust you!

251
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,196
Great!
I'll do my best!

252
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,514
I didn't expect this from Hiziri.

253
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,439
He must have confidence in Tamotsu.

254
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,875
In any case, I don't trust him

255
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,918
Hiziri should have been able to dodge me.

256
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,510
Maybe he did it on purpose!

257
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,950
I'm sure he did it on purpose!

258
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,230
You've know it!

259
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,516
You didn't dodge on purpose!

260
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,273
I know you could have avoided it!

261
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,190
I wanted to test Tamotsu's abilities,

262
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,750
I just had to.

263
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,951
However, the accident on the track was beneficial.

264
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,109
So you did it on purpose!

265
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,075
Though I didn't expect
Tamotsu to help fix the car.

266
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,198
Sorry to keep you waiting.

267
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,513
It took me a while but it's fixed.

268
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,751
- Very good!
- I admit that it was not easy!

269
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,035
Unfortunately, the damage to
the engine was considerable!

270
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,315
Thank you, Tamotsu!
You did well.

271
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,755
Though I'll be resting for a while since I'm tired.

272
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,957
Thank you again!

273
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,196
Tamotsu, can we go?

274
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,197
Have you finished

275
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,236
...being a good Samaritan?
- Gunma!

276
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,959
We have work to do at home,
don't you remember?

277
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,676
In have to go.
There shouldn't be any problems.

278
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,752
- if there is let me know!
- Bye, see you soon!

279
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,757
You done yet?

280
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,757
I'm coming!

281
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,355
So is Gunma training today?

282
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,234
Those two are desperate because
there are four days until the race!

283
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,756
And also he needs money to train.

284
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,748
- A lot of money!
- It must be hard for Tamotsu!

285
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,758
He spent all
morning at the circuit,

286
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,673
and then goes to work...
He works very hard!

287
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,671
He's still not back yet!

288
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,960
How much money do
they need for each race?

289
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,909
A lot of money!
That's what you need to race!

290
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,996
Just where is he?

291
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,435
Well he's probably doing something!

292
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,836
One minute, and eighty-two!

293
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,236
That's unheard of!

294
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,838
This engine is just perfect!

295
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,033
This engine does not miss a beat!

296
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,511
It's great!

297
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,357
Nobody will beat me!

298
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,830
Yes! I was right!

299
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,759
That boy is the one.

300
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,949
No one can beat me!

301
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,473
The cars run on two circuits:
Tsubuka and Suzuka.

302
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,110
Throughout the year,
there are 30 games in all!

303
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,754
Would you like to try?

304
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,751
In the next episode:

305
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,717
"The Blade of Elimination Matches!
Aim for the Pole Position".

306
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,268
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

307
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,550
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

308
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:19,500
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

309
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,800
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

310
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:35,600
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

311
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,500
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

312
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,200
These feelings
just flare up

313
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

314
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,200
The fantasy penetrates through you

315
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

316
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:15,250
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

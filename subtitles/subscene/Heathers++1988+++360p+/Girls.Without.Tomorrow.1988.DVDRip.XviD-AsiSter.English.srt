1
00:02:55,474 --> 00:02:59,240
A girl involved in love
may easily make a slips!

2
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:02,176
As social ethics are sinking

3
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,547
I must warn you

4
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,878
against this

5
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:07,542
I hope you understand
what I mean

6
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,214
Mum, I'm going to see
a classmate with my sister

7
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,120
It's been an hour
I'd better go & find her

8
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,493
Oh, no, her mum won't care to see you!

9
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:20,526
I must go out

10
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,530
Don't go out!

11
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,340
Cut, VTR play back

12
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,204
Auntie Lan, what a powerful slap!

13
00:03:35,815 --> 00:03:36,804
Is it?

14
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,079
What is it?

15
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:40,378
Be on your guard

16
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:43,488
No! No one has been following us!

17
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:46,250
I've been wasting my time
on filming

18
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,053
Mr Chen has openly claimed
he'd date you!

19
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,320
Don't gutter nonsense

20
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:50,759
Jenny, excuse me!

21
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:51,954
Auntie Lan, where are you going?

22
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:53,224
Tung Hsing

23
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:54,297
Give me a lift

24
00:03:54,433 --> 00:03:54,990
Okay

25
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:56,965
Don't write about it!
I must leave. Bye-bye

26
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:01,603
A car will pick you
up in Thailand

27
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:03,607
The Hotel has been booked

28
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,545
Board the plane and take a rest!

29
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:11,913
Go straight to the
hotel room on arrival

30
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:15,083
After you finish, don't go out

31
00:04:15,454 --> 00:04:17,285
Come back by an early
flight tomorrow

32
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:33,435
Take it, Auntie Lan

33
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,101
Thank you

34
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,372
She is come in

35
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:11,303
and the further expansion

36
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:12,171
of our group

37
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:14,142
I propose we should offer...

38
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,111
Okay! No problem

39
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:17,613
You guys go ahead

40
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,682
I'll be back in a minute

41
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,651
First of all, we should offer

42
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,717
We guarantee on our reputation

43
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,259
everyone's good

44
00:06:02,394 --> 00:06:07,855
HK$400 for a local

45
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,558
How much did you
make last night?

46
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,830
Nothing
My husband was on leave

47
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,940
So I had to serve him free

48
00:06:15,507 --> 00:06:17,134
I fared even worse

49
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,607
I did my best to
serve my client

50
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:21,235
and thought he would
give me some tips

51
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,177
But he gave me nothing
How outrageous

52
00:06:23,315 --> 00:06:25,510
Ling-ling, Pi-shan

53
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:26,743
You've guests waiting

54
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,650
Tsui-tsui, you can speak English
Go to Johnny

55
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:32,279
You've nothing to loss
It's $100 more

56
00:06:34,493 --> 00:06:35,517
Here it is!

57
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,295
Beautiful bosom, beautiful ass

58
00:06:40,432 --> 00:06:43,128
Very good! Not bad, very nice

59
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,098
One hundred US dollar, okay?

60
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,205
You want to take a bath first?

61
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,122
Hello Jenny

62
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:31,135
Oh, looks even better off-screen

63
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:34,443
Come...

64
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:38,046
Take your pick

65
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:44,385
Stallone, John Travolta,
Chau Jun Fat

66
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:47,788
Anyone will do
I'll go & take a bath

67
00:08:47,926 --> 00:08:49,291
Okay!

68
00:09:00,205 --> 00:09:04,801
Jenny, Stallone's here

69
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,637
Stallone's excited

70
00:09:31,603 --> 00:09:33,264
Stallone's lousy

71
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:35,063
I should've picked
Chou Jun-fat

72
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:02,223
How's it Fei-fei? Depressed?

73
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,028
Want to make
a confession in a church?

74
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:07,500
Innocent?
Innocent or erotic?

75
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,901
Innocent?

76
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,509
I did it when I was 13

77
00:10:11,643 --> 00:10:13,941
I did that more than you ate

78
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:17,339
Great! She looks like Big Sis!

79
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,542
Hey, you know who did
that to you last night?

80
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:21,676
Do you remember that?

81
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,421
Not me, not me, not me!

82
00:10:34,566 --> 00:10:35,999
You did it

83
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:37,968
A few pills

84
00:10:38,103 --> 00:10:38,899
couldn't turn me on

85
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:40,402
You're sober, you're smart

86
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,337
Since we got on okay
& we fit each other

87
00:10:43,475 --> 00:10:47,002
Why not follow me?

88
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,545
What have I to gain?

89
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,544
Everybody here knows me

90
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:57,887
If you follow me

91
00:10:58,023 --> 00:11:00,685
You have no worries

92
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:02,891
I don't mind being your darling

93
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:05,553
But I'm possessive

94
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:08,063
If I ever catch you
being unfaithful

95
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,760
you may not return
in one piece

96
00:11:21,747 --> 00:11:23,681
Well, feel sorry?

97
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,846
Bear with it!
Life counts for much, you said it!

98
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:32,021
I'll pay first, Miss

99
00:11:32,157 --> 00:11:33,215
Hello

100
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:38,187
Our cleaning charge
has to be raised soon!

101
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:39,721
When?

102
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,059
The 1 st of next month

103
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:59,712
Well, they want me
not to come again?

104
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:02,677
To come more often each week!

105
00:12:06,358 --> 00:12:08,189
Mum, you're lying

106
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:11,153
What's it now?

107
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:14,228
You promised to take
me to Disneyland

108
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,061
if I got full marks

109
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:18,499
Now you're bought me
this toy only

110
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,005
I'm too busy

111
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,473
I can't spare any time for that

112
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,100
When I'm off,

113
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,541
I'll take you there

114
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:33,674
Reading again?
Don't gripe about headaches!

115
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,013
Oh, no, I've never felt any better

116
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:39,813
Mummy, mummy!

117
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,425
Don't sit up so late!

118
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,094
Mummy, I've squeezed out
the toothpaste for you

119
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:48,096
Thank you

120
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,755
Hey, you're using
my toothbrush again!

121
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:21,160
Come on, use your own

122
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,495
Oh, no. I want to use yours!

123
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:26,503
Don't get any bleeding like I do

124
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:46,181
I want to have sex with you, okay?

125
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:50,888
How much do you want?

126
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,995
What are you talking about?

127
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,399
What are you doing?

128
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:57,400
Let go!

129
00:14:01,973 --> 00:14:02,667
Miss Lin

130
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,673
Ever been teased in acting?

131
00:14:05,143 --> 00:14:06,269
What did he say?

132
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:09,275
He wanted to know your
charge for going to bed!

133
00:14:09,715 --> 00:14:10,773
What did you tell me?

134
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:12,573
I said you're my fiancee!

135
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,446
Maniac!

136
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,400
Jenny

137
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,733
Jenny, give me
an autograph please

138
00:14:36,241 --> 00:14:37,936
I'm sorry, you must
have made a mistake

139
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:57,655
That's not being fair

140
00:14:58,096 --> 00:15:00,121
That's no way to treat me!

141
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:01,623
Sorry!

142
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,629
I'll buy them back for you

143
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,667
How can I contact you?
Do you live in HK?

144
00:15:07,005 --> 00:15:09,303
Yes, but my folks live in Thailand

145
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,703
You'll find me there
in the day for sure

146
00:15:14,846 --> 00:15:16,211
Are you a student?

147
00:15:16,481 --> 00:15:18,711
Yes, I'm a senior this year

148
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:20,281
Which seat is yours?

149
00:15:20,852 --> 00:15:25,152
Mine? 25B

150
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,087
I'm next to you

151
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:28,351
What a coincidence

152
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:29,616
Look

153
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:31,419
You're kidding

154
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:33,230
I could get a swap in a minute

155
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,855
Don't take you seat now

156
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,298
If you do, no man would
swap with me!

157
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:39,831
Crazy

158
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:04,693
Godfather, Ling Yu's here!

159
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,230
Godfather

160
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:08,800
Mr Wen

161
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:10,497
Where's that shrew?

162
00:16:10,635 --> 00:16:11,761
Which one?

163
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:13,427
My daughters are all nice!

164
00:16:13,738 --> 00:16:14,864
Shan-shan!

165
00:16:16,007 --> 00:16:17,065
Shan-shan

166
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:18,642
It's loan shark Chan again

167
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,142
Say that I'm not here!

168
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:26,907
Come on!

169
00:16:27,052 --> 00:16:30,112
It's a friend of
Ling Yu's godfather

170
00:16:33,558 --> 00:16:34,752
Do you miss me?

171
00:16:35,093 --> 00:16:37,186
No, I'm getting angry

172
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,521
There's none better
than godfather

173
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:44,163
Boss Wen, you must
make a self-review!

174
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:48,167
When have you bought a new watch?
Show me

175
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,105
Be careful, it's expensive!

176
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:54,941
It suits me well!
Give it to me!

177
00:16:55,213 --> 00:16:57,477
What? It costs me thousands!

178
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,641
Ling-yu, let's not talk about money!

179
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:01,513
Remember how much
you took from me?

180
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:04,144
It suits me well, I'll keep it!

181
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:05,950
Stop joking
Give it back to me

182
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,855
Or I'll get mad
Give it back to me!

183
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,823
Never!
It's already on my wrist!

184
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:11,894
What a bitch!

185
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,600
Give it back to me!

186
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:16,996
Godfather, get it back for me!

187
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,670
Well, well...

188
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,033
Well, forget it, Ling-yu!
I'll buy you a new one!

189
00:17:26,177 --> 00:17:27,542
Why do that?

190
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,611
She's so naughty

191
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:29,645
Quiet!

192
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:31,214
He's promised to
buy you a new one!

193
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:34,080
I'll pay for it!
Take it for my gift to Shan-shan!

194
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,516
Why worry about this?

195
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,986
I still owe you a favor
on that last deal

196
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,857
Ling-yu's out

197
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:42,721
No need to wait for her!

198
00:17:42,861 --> 00:17:43,850
Is she?

199
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:46,060
I'm here

200
00:17:47,732 --> 00:17:50,360
You're late,
have another drink to make up

201
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,266
Leave it to me!

202
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,066
You're kind!

203
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:59,901
When did you buy this?

204
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:02,013
Be careful, it's expensive!

205
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,842
It's nice! Give it to me!

206
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:06,447
Never! I bought it for thousands!

207
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:09,782
Let's not talk about money

208
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:11,511
Remember how much money
you took from me!

209
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:12,486
It suits me best

210
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,114
I'll keep it!

211
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,283
Give it back to me
or I'll get mad!

212
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,328
No...

213
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,695
Am I to deposit a check
into your bank?

214
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:24,699
No

215
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:05,871
Fucking bitch!

216
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,773
You peep, you're so cheap!

217
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:12,943
That's no way to talk to me
I'm your dad

218
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:14,949
My dad?
You fooled my mum

219
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:17,316
and you're making passes at me

220
00:19:17,455 --> 00:19:18,888
Don't say you've
no flames outside!

221
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:21,356
So what? I do what I like

222
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,357
Is that any of your business?

223
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,483
What're you talking about?

224
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:25,790
He! He's a creep!

225
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:29,889
Me, a creep?
She always returned late

226
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,229
So I warned her against

227
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:32,666
getting trapped

228
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:34,697
Shit!

229
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:37,505
How dare you?

230
00:19:43,181 --> 00:19:44,205
Sister

231
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,381
He's a peeping Tom!

232
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,150
When you were

233
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,382
hospitalized last time

234
00:19:53,658 --> 00:19:56,024
he caressed me when
I was asleep

235
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:59,225
I feigned ignorance
to avoid provoking him!

236
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,797
She's getting out of her mind

237
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,460
I've been treating her

238
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,932
like my own daughter

239
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,662
Why are you bearing me a grudge?

240
00:20:06,938 --> 00:20:07,962
Why didn't you shout

241
00:20:08,106 --> 00:20:09,232
when he caressed you that night?

242
00:20:16,347 --> 00:20:18,872
What are you up to?
Trying to huff me?

243
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,213
You want to know why?

244
00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:23,320
I was still a kid

245
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,946
I didn't want to give
you a breakdown!

246
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,688
Chuan-chuan, where are you going?

247
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:30,021
Never mind me

248
00:20:30,161 --> 00:20:31,856
I won't see that creep anymore

249
00:20:31,996 --> 00:20:32,928
What? You...

250
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:33,962
Chuan Chuan

251
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:38,328
I want to move to your side

252
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,405
I always wanted you to join me!

253
00:20:41,706 --> 00:20:43,003
Discos, shows!

254
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:45,336
And you name it!

255
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:49,271
But we must get together
to make some dough

256
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,049
I'll work at McDonald's

257
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:54,145
Are you going nuts?

258
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:55,252
Would you've spare time

259
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:56,819
to go out?

260
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:59,389
And how much can you earn

261
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:00,984
What else can I do?

262
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:03,259
My darling wants a high pay

263
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:04,759
Short working hours

264
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:06,454
freedom and lots of dough

265
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,725
Isn't that right?

266
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,264
Let me give you
a few private sessions

267
00:21:15,373 --> 00:21:18,570
You may resent me
I've slept with many men

268
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,541
Never

269
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,038
It's easy money

270
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,205
Far better than working
at McDonald

271
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:27,116
Why work so hard bitch?

272
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:30,187
With dough, we can
have fever anytime

273
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:31,955
I'm getting a sore heart too

274
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:39,696
Terrific!
What kind of a guy is that!

275
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,321
He's quite presentable

276
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:44,064
Well, I'll take your advice

277
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:46,663
They're coming

278
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,897
Go and get the keys!

279
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,098
Mama san,
why are you late again?

280
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:50,935
Sorry,

281
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:52,975
they spent too much
time on make up!

282
00:21:53,444 --> 00:21:55,002
Well, you go

283
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:57,614
& get the keys yourselves!

284
00:21:59,083 --> 00:22:00,311
Shan-shan,
what's your room number?

285
00:22:00,451 --> 00:22:01,418
205

286
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:02,747
Mine's 204

287
00:22:03,788 --> 00:22:05,551
Can't open it. Is this the right key?

288
00:22:10,895 --> 00:22:12,795
Don't weigh on me

289
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,033
This is not my room

290
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:18,692
Okay, okay

291
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:23,137
I won't be late!
Wait for me!

292
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:31,438
She's okay!

293
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,608
A fatty again

294
00:22:36,487 --> 00:22:39,718
Two together? It's killing

295
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,122
What a shapely figure

296
00:22:43,027 --> 00:22:46,861
I can't, it's coming

297
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,693
So much the better I'm a vampire

298
00:22:49,834 --> 00:22:52,394
The sight of blood turns me on!

299
00:22:53,204 --> 00:22:55,764
Yuan, it's the best divination

300
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,238
I'm so excited!

301
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,138
Well, go now!

302
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,238
Take good care of my nephew

303
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,850
It's his first time!

304
00:23:09,854 --> 00:23:12,914
Remember to come to me

305
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:14,115
if it keeps coming

306
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:19,796
Well, you can't make it today, can you?

307
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,193
I'm alright now

308
00:23:23,534 --> 00:23:25,229
Miss, may I know your name?

309
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,634
Romona is my name,
romance is my personality

310
00:23:31,776 --> 00:23:36,645
I'm a sentimentalist
& a tender lover

311
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:39,477
I've good aspiration & ideals

312
00:23:39,617 --> 00:23:41,141
Look at my eyes

313
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,950
They are full of lust

314
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:02,397
What's wrong?
Have I no appeal?

315
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,139
Yes, but I can't be turned on!

316
00:24:08,179 --> 00:24:12,513
They say when touching
a female leg

317
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,649
a man has a slight reaction

318
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,788
When touching further down,
it rises to a medium degree

319
00:24:18,222 --> 00:24:20,747
Still further down,
it jumps even higher

320
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,723
And still further down...

321
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:28,659
You're sweating!

322
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,132
It means you've been turned on!

323
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:34,067
I'm sweating with fear

324
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:35,838
How come?

325
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:39,805
Don't laugh if I tell you

326
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,242
What's wrong?
Just tell me! Come on!

327
00:24:46,584 --> 00:24:48,575
You're a man! Don't be sissy!

328
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,121
Come on!

329
00:24:52,256 --> 00:24:53,814
I was in bed with a foreign bird

330
00:24:53,958 --> 00:24:56,119
when I was a student in UK

331
00:24:57,795 --> 00:25:00,764
But after I took off everything

332
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,230
She jeered: Little Man!

333
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,560
From that time on...

334
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:07,393
So what's the big deal?

335
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:09,699
I'm not a foreign bird!
Why worry?

336
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,908
But you look like one!

337
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:17,448
Come on, let's try again...

338
00:25:17,582 --> 00:25:19,709
Keep away! Please go away!

339
00:25:21,652 --> 00:25:24,212
I thought you were a he-man

340
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,585
Calm down!
I'll pay you all the same!

341
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:30,993
3 grand for doing nothing?
I'm lucky

342
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:34,696
How much would you pay
if you could make it?

343
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,263
I won't try the second time

344
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,258
It depends on affinity

345
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:44,097
Don't ever tell
my uncle about this

346
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,845
Who's your uncle?

347
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,510
That fatty you saw just now

348
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,044
Yuan, how do you feel?

349
00:25:57,355 --> 00:25:58,788
Hey, lend a hand!

350
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,661
You're hitting me!

351
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:45,430
Why are you standing
behind me?

352
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,730
Don't worry
Next time I'll stand in front of you

353
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:54,474
Take it back!

354
00:27:00,084 --> 00:27:02,109
Well, do I look like a film star?

355
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,025
Go on with your studies
I won't bother you

356
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:12,955
When shall we meet again?

357
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:16,059
I'll be free

358
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,394
when the paper is fixed

359
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:19,367
My schedules are rather uncertain

360
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,729
I managed to come only because
the schedule has been changed

361
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:22,737
Excuse me

362
00:27:23,841 --> 00:27:26,571
Go on! Don't see me out

363
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:51,399
Why is she here?

364
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,434
Who is it?

365
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:56,062
Jenny Lin!
She's quite beautiful!

366
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:59,199
She has a good personality

367
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,745
I must study hard

368
00:28:10,054 --> 00:28:12,181
Mr Fang, be patient

369
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:13,984
I can't commit myself now

370
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,116
Doctor, I've already
waited for 6 months

371
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,990
I want to have a kidney
transplant early

372
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,188
You know how many patients

373
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,060
are waiting for this?

374
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,328
Some of them don't
even have family support

375
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:29,371
We're waiting for
kidney donors too

376
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:40,751
Fei-fei...

377
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,581
I'll quit! I'll quit! Go now!

378
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:46,155
Otherwise, we must
pay the loan shark!

379
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,422
I'm scared!

380
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:49,223
With me here, you've no fear!
Come on!

381
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,123
Don't be scared
Go up, hurry up!

382
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:55,957
Want to go around the world, sir?

383
00:29:00,037 --> 00:29:01,470
It's alright, perfectly alright!

384
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:03,233
Please go in & sit for a while

385
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,842
Bobbie, you get me
involved on her first day

386
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,410
Pay us back if she's
in no mood for work

387
00:29:07,678 --> 00:29:10,203
Sorry, Ming
I promised to serve him well

388
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,578
Hurry up!

389
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:24,824
Sorry

390
00:29:27,698 --> 00:29:28,494
Yours

391
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:30,362
Bye-bye!

392
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:31,969
Look, she really is enjoying it

393
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:35,231
Why not?
She has no family burden

394
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,364
Without me, her family
would have been finished

395
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:43,671
Jimmy, I want to talk to you

396
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:45,105
What do you want now?

397
00:29:50,554 --> 00:29:52,385
I want to borrow $60,000 from you

398
00:29:52,757 --> 00:29:53,985
$60,000

399
00:29:54,925 --> 00:29:57,052
I want to buy my husband
a hemodialysis machine

400
00:29:57,728 --> 00:29:59,696
I promise to serve
more guests in a day

401
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:02,797
Stop dreaming
How much interest on $60,000

402
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:05,458
40% interest each month
For that alone

403
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,798
you've to do 12 sessions a day

404
00:30:09,907 --> 00:30:11,204
I don't mind

405
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,037
You wouldn't get
so many guests

406
00:30:13,644 --> 00:30:16,044
and you've to allow for periods

407
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,511
or sickness

408
00:30:17,648 --> 00:30:19,411
What if you get sick?

409
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,245
Oh, no!

410
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,786
Ling-yu, a guest for you!

411
00:30:29,927 --> 00:30:30,951
Who's it?

412
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:34,392
Ling-yu, isn't that the little man

413
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:35,794
you teased?

414
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,641
So it really is you!
Where's your uncle?

415
00:30:48,245 --> 00:30:49,041
He's not here

416
00:30:49,613 --> 00:30:51,308
So, you've come by yourself!

417
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:52,343
You know what happened
at the meeting

418
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:56,953
I opened the file
& your bra dropped down!

419
00:30:57,755 --> 00:31:00,053
Good, let everybody
know you're hefty

420
00:31:00,424 --> 00:31:02,824
Well, why are you doing that?

421
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,360
Only for fun

422
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:12,865
This is not mine
It's not my size

423
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:15,469
So, it's yours!

424
00:31:15,606 --> 00:31:18,541
Such a big size must be yours

425
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,904
Good, what a compliment

426
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,570
Thank you

427
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:26,914
I... I want to leave!

428
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:31,447
I'll call the waiter for you!

429
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:32,783
It's beautiful!

430
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:34,220
So small

431
00:31:34,358 --> 00:31:35,655
Hi, isn't Ling-yu coming in?

432
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:36,657
What's taking so long?

433
00:31:36,794 --> 00:31:38,091
Well, I'll go out to see

434
00:31:38,362 --> 00:31:40,421
You change & we'll fix the bill

435
00:31:40,564 --> 00:31:41,656
Okay!

436
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,092
I'll do it

437
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:44,627
$900, please, sir

438
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:46,564
I'm not used to this place!

439
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:49,666
I'll give you my home number

440
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:50,967
Let's go for

441
00:31:51,108 --> 00:31:53,474
some healthy activities then

442
00:31:57,681 --> 00:32:02,084
Sleep! Close your eyes

443
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,526
Mei-feng

444
00:32:18,402 --> 00:32:19,460
Still not in bed?

445
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:24,135
I'm waiting for you

446
00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:26,808
Go in first!

447
00:32:46,964 --> 00:32:48,090
Are you not tired?

448
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,213
Darling, not tonight,
I've no more condoms

449
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,614
I know how to take care!

450
00:33:10,387 --> 00:33:12,617
No, it's not safe

451
00:33:12,756 --> 00:33:13,745
Come on

452
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:16,121
Oh, no, next time!

453
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,261
Next time?
I may not live to do it

454
00:33:23,701 --> 00:33:24,963
If you're so depressed

455
00:33:26,303 --> 00:33:29,136
why should I work so hard?

456
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,877
Mine's a chronic disease
which is costly

457
00:33:34,111 --> 00:33:35,601
Who knows how long
you're going to suffer?

458
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:38,376
For the sake of you & Ming

459
00:33:40,317 --> 00:33:45,949
I don't mind

460
00:33:47,124 --> 00:33:48,989
Ming is our hope

461
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,991
He'd take care of you if

462
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:53,894
& when I leave you

463
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:06,602
Don't say that!
I'm going out now!

464
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,143
Where?

465
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,538
I'll go & buy it a 7-Eleven

466
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:22,886
She has been filming
the whole day

467
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:25,325
Let her take a rest!

468
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:26,927
Come and get it

469
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:29,088
Her mammy's above
Don't alarm her

470
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,257
Climb up quietly
to bring Jenny down

471
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,629
After you come down

472
00:34:31,769 --> 00:34:33,498
go and embrace her

473
00:34:33,637 --> 00:34:34,399
Easy

474
00:34:34,538 --> 00:34:35,596
Try

475
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,127
Jenny, take your position

476
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,060
Jenny... your turn!

477
00:35:04,201 --> 00:35:08,900
Jenny, come... quick!
Come here quick!

478
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:12,869
You read this

479
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,170
And Hua reads this

480
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:20,681
You meet

481
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:24,151
then hug and kiss

482
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,277
Okay, Director

483
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:27,322
Then you say, let's go up!

484
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:40,603
Countdown 10 seconds,
5, 4, 3, 2

485
00:35:41,105 --> 00:35:48,602
<i>"Your heart"</i>

486
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:56,644
<i>"meets my heart, makes a love"</i>

487
00:35:58,522 --> 00:36:04,654
<i>"Your hot kiss is like the rage</i>
<i>of the sea"</i>

488
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,889
What now, Director?
She's so stiff

489
00:36:07,097 --> 00:36:08,496
I just can't play this part

490
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:10,796
What's going on below?

491
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:22,775
<i>"Laugh can't be stopped"</i>

492
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:32,784
<i>"Warmth can't be stopped"</i>

493
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:40,294
<i>"Everything in you"</i>

494
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:51,232
<i>"glitters with love in my life"</i>

495
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,491
The whole Hong Kong's asleep

496
00:37:51,635 --> 00:37:53,398
What's wrong?

497
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,799
I'm sorry, my surname is yuen

498
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:58,137
Oh, it's you!

499
00:37:58,275 --> 00:37:59,708
Sorry for waking you up

500
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:01,509
I thought you'd risen

501
00:38:01,645 --> 00:38:03,704
You gamble & you take pills

502
00:38:03,847 --> 00:38:05,371
Can't you cut off
the bad habits?

503
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:09,145
Ling-yu, what are you
talking about?

504
00:38:09,419 --> 00:38:12,445
Never mind,
I'm not talking to you

505
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,654
Have you got any money

506
00:38:20,497 --> 00:38:22,158
Well, fifty-fifty

507
00:38:27,137 --> 00:38:28,832
I've no change

508
00:38:32,876 --> 00:38:35,606
Just say it if you need money
Don't be shy

509
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:38,842
Let's go eat in a minute

510
00:38:38,982 --> 00:38:40,472
I've no time
I've an appointment

511
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,044
Where?

512
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:43,850
Play ball

513
00:38:55,465 --> 00:38:56,432
Where's the ball?

514
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,796
Ask her

515
00:38:57,935 --> 00:38:59,402
Now, the ball is mine

516
00:38:59,536 --> 00:39:00,468
What a shame!

517
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,595
Shame on you!
I bet you to play with me

518
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:04,673
What would I get if I win?

519
00:39:04,808 --> 00:39:06,139
The winner can make
fun of the loser

520
00:39:06,376 --> 00:39:09,174
Are you sure?
Hey, me first

521
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,512
Start!

522
00:39:21,825 --> 00:39:22,757
Oh, good!

523
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,891
Hopeless! Let me!

524
00:39:44,848 --> 00:39:45,974
So you've lost too

525
00:39:52,522 --> 00:39:54,387
Where did you learn it?

526
00:39:56,226 --> 00:39:57,818
Didn't you play in childhood?

527
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:02,831
Where are you going now?

528
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:04,459
Anywhere you say

529
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:05,599
To buy a dress for you!

530
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,668
For me?

531
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:08,430
That boutique offers
lots of patterns

532
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:12,403
Chic, isn't it?

533
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:21,406
Try yours

534
00:40:21,551 --> 00:40:22,711
Don't mess them up!

535
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,990
What? Get away

536
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,561
Sister, does it look awkward?

537
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:35,722
You're top old fashioned
You're no longer young

538
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:39,794
Did that bastard do anything to you

539
00:40:40,203 --> 00:40:43,570
He's alright!
Mammy has been matching him

540
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,238
Sister, when are you
moving back?

541
00:40:46,376 --> 00:40:48,469
When I work for 1
more year or 2

542
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,374
Well, you may tell
mum you're off

543
00:40:51,515 --> 00:40:52,482
And move

544
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,640
to join me

545
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:56,986
I've to work
The bookies may call me any minute!

546
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,951
Shut up! My sister!

547
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,456
2 sisters combining
to make a living

548
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:08,593
Bobbie, you can all be relatives!

549
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:10,256
Sis, I'll go & change for
a school uniform

550
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,232
Take it when the fruit's ripe!

551
00:41:16,573 --> 00:41:19,235
Stop dreaming!
My sister's a good student

552
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:27,850
Jimmy, I must go home!

553
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,316
What? It's busy now

554
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:30,420
Don't go so soon!

555
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:32,112
My son's back from
school early today!

556
00:41:32,255 --> 00:41:33,779
Stop acting!

557
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,221
I'll talk to you after
I get a packet of cigarettes

558
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,519
Jimmy!

559
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:53,639
Ming, why stand there?

560
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,677
Mummy's over there!

561
00:41:57,981 --> 00:41:59,175
Where?

562
00:41:59,816 --> 00:42:02,717
Tsui-tsui

563
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:06,482
It's not mummy!
Go back home!

564
00:42:07,257 --> 00:42:08,952
Tsui-tsui, wait for me!

565
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,430
Thank you

566
00:42:15,198 --> 00:42:17,166
Jenny, happy birthday

567
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,460
Thank you

568
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,760
Happy birthday!

569
00:42:19,903 --> 00:42:21,131
Thank you

570
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:25,703
Jenny, come and slice the cake!

571
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:32,078
Can we wait a second?

572
00:42:32,582 --> 00:42:34,311
She's waiting for her boyfriend!

573
00:42:35,118 --> 00:42:38,212
Her boyfriend's here
Let's all sit down!

574
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:40,185
Go there!

575
00:42:40,323 --> 00:42:42,291
Be quick

576
00:42:42,592 --> 00:42:44,992
Jenny, come here!

577
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:50,091
Come on, hurry up,
here comes the actress

578
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:56,700
Come on

579
00:42:57,707 --> 00:43:00,335
Beautiful!

580
00:43:00,777 --> 00:43:02,677
Hey... sing the birthday song

581
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:11,119
Happy birthday to you

582
00:43:11,254 --> 00:43:19,059
Happy birthday to you, Jenny

583
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,632
You're late!

584
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:26,530
I was busy

585
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,463
What gift are you
giving to Jenny?

586
00:43:31,174 --> 00:43:33,039
I forgot to bring any!

587
00:43:35,912 --> 00:43:36,810
You really are clumsy!

588
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:37,504
What?

589
00:43:37,647 --> 00:43:39,080
It's now the vogue
to give one's heart!

590
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:40,840
How much have you got from me?

591
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:44,279
Help me!

592
00:43:48,024 --> 00:43:49,491
Slice the cake!

593
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,356
Miss Lin, a gift needs
your signature

594
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:55,730
Wonder what it is

595
00:43:56,766 --> 00:43:58,290
Well, over here!

596
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:03,032
Great

597
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:15,443
Happy birthday! Open it!

598
00:44:23,593 --> 00:44:24,457
What does that mean?

599
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,494
My parents are coming
to HK soon

600
00:44:27,764 --> 00:44:30,232
I'll go with you to see them

601
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:33,628
maybe they want you

602
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,101
to be their escort

603
00:44:35,238 --> 00:44:37,263
and take them around
for sight-seeing

604
00:44:39,676 --> 00:44:41,143
Jenny, got in & have a trial run!

605
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:49,375
Jenny, congratulations!

606
00:44:50,153 --> 00:44:51,085
Thank you

607
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:52,381
Comfortable?

608
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:56,388
Well, do you like it?

609
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:15,206
Since when did he get the fever?

610
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,046
Already one week ago

611
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,579
but it goes off & on

612
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:20,376
His fever seems
getting worse today

613
00:45:20,817 --> 00:45:22,045
Go out & check in for him

614
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,980
What's it so serious?

615
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,245
A tonsillitis,

616
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:28,383
but there maybe complications

617
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:31,519
Let me check carefully

618
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,562
Wonder how Ming is

619
00:45:34,831 --> 00:45:36,128
Don't worry!

620
00:45:36,399 --> 00:45:38,128
The doctor's report
will be out soon

621
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:45,531
Sorry

622
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,077
Mammy, I'm a bit late today

623
00:45:55,418 --> 00:45:57,113
Well, Ling-yu wanted me

624
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,654
to see a video movie with her

625
00:45:59,889 --> 00:46:03,484
The hero was your
favorite Chou Jun-fa

626
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,420
We watched till 5 am
I felt hungry and

627
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:08,690
told her to go to the kitchen
to get something to eat

628
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,294
She came back with nothing

629
00:46:11,434 --> 00:46:14,767
and said:
"There's nothing, what about this?"

630
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:16,339
What was it?

631
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,168
Two chickens

632
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:31,480
Mum, I should've
listened to you

633
00:46:32,355 --> 00:46:35,324
Now a hostess is no
better than a whore

634
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,957
But I promise to
earn more money

635
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:42,728
to get you cured

636
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:52,606
Mum, don't ever leave me

637
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:21,768
My wife & children

638
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:23,065
are returning from
USA next week

639
00:47:23,206 --> 00:47:24,798
I must enjoy myself today!

640
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,100
You've brought all the girls!

641
00:47:26,242 --> 00:47:27,573
How can we cope with them all!

642
00:47:30,046 --> 00:47:33,345
Shan-shan, why don't you change?

643
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,081
I don't like swimming

644
00:47:35,218 --> 00:47:36,583
You must play along

645
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,745
You're paid for

646
00:47:38,888 --> 00:47:42,051
Well, what does money count? I don't
wanna change! So what? Damn it!

647
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:44,291
We're all here for fun!

648
00:47:44,427 --> 00:47:45,553
Just calm down!

649
00:47:46,062 --> 00:47:47,461
Well, come on, get up!

650
00:47:47,597 --> 00:47:50,828
You creeps, don't cut corner

651
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:54,535
Shan-shan, shut up!
Don't provoke Godfather!

652
00:47:56,072 --> 00:47:57,699
Why's she so depressed?
Did you force her?

653
00:47:57,841 --> 00:48:00,275
She was not in this mood
when she took the money

654
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:01,872
She must be out
of her mind now!

655
00:48:02,011 --> 00:48:03,501
Yes, I'm out of my mind!

656
00:48:03,646 --> 00:48:05,580
If you prefer,
I'd repay you the money

657
00:48:10,186 --> 00:48:12,211
Don't be nasty!
Are you a nut!

658
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:15,322
Shit! Mind your own business,
mainland girl!

659
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:21,192
Go in to wash &
change for a swimsuit!

660
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:22,696
Come on!

661
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,857
You're a freedom swimmer,
you must be a good swimmer!

662
00:48:25,001 --> 00:48:26,434
If you like swimming
you go ahead

663
00:48:27,203 --> 00:48:28,227
What are you talking about?

664
00:48:28,471 --> 00:48:29,733
So what, mainland girl?

665
00:48:31,007 --> 00:48:31,974
Say that again!

666
00:48:32,108 --> 00:48:33,302
Fuck a duck!

667
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:52,893
Say that again

668
00:48:53,229 --> 00:48:57,131
How dare you?

669
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:11,675
Police check!

670
00:49:11,815 --> 00:49:17,913
Police check! Open up!

671
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:21,049
What are you doing?
Is your girl working up there?

672
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,318
No, I was passing by

673
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:26,359
Who's inside?
Why is it locked?

674
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:31,126
Open up...

675
00:49:36,706 --> 00:49:37,764
What's taking you so long?

676
00:49:37,907 --> 00:49:39,306
I was getting dressed!

677
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:11,964
Does it hurt?

678
00:50:13,309 --> 00:50:14,537
How old?

679
00:50:17,614 --> 00:50:18,945
Sixteen?

680
00:50:23,486 --> 00:50:30,517
I'm 56, I've worked for 40 years

681
00:50:34,697 --> 00:50:37,325
Every whore has a story!

682
00:50:38,434 --> 00:50:39,833
What's yours?

683
00:50:43,406 --> 00:50:44,873
For love?

684
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:52,580
Once a whore, forever a whore

685
00:50:58,621 --> 00:50:59,645
Look

686
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:04,257
I wanted to win a man's heart

687
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:10,395
Now all I get is a denture,
an ugly face

688
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:17,201
and V.D. Such a long ordeal

689
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:25,706
You got in from here,

690
00:51:27,283 --> 00:51:28,841
go out from here too!

691
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:53,766
Coming, coming

692
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:54,808
Master

693
00:51:54,944 --> 00:51:57,003
Please come in
You're welcome

694
00:51:57,146 --> 00:51:58,704
Oh, she's ever prettier
off-screen!

695
00:51:58,848 --> 00:51:59,815
Please sit down

696
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:03,616
Miss Lin, my mummy
is your drama fan!

697
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:07,086
Last time I saw your
serial drama

698
00:52:07,223 --> 00:52:09,123
I wept on seeing the end

699
00:52:09,258 --> 00:52:10,816
and his dad said I'm a nut

700
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,190
Well, let me introduce
my mummy

701
00:52:13,329 --> 00:52:14,023
Auntie

702
00:52:14,163 --> 00:52:15,755
Auntie, sister

703
00:52:16,065 --> 00:52:17,089
Auntie, take this!

704
00:52:17,233 --> 00:52:18,200
Thank you!

705
00:52:18,334 --> 00:52:19,665
Come and see the others

706
00:52:22,438 --> 00:52:24,963
So you're here!
I was busy at the kitchen

707
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,042
and didn't know you were here!

708
00:52:27,176 --> 00:52:27,972
Never mind

709
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:30,045
My auntie 9!
She lives here!

710
00:52:30,246 --> 00:52:30,678
Welcome

711
00:52:30,813 --> 00:52:31,472
Nice to see you

712
00:52:31,614 --> 00:52:35,710
Brother, come & play with us!

713
00:52:36,252 --> 00:52:39,119
To see you!

714
00:52:39,355 --> 00:52:40,049
Auntie

715
00:52:40,189 --> 00:52:43,681
Quiet, they're my sister's children

716
00:52:43,826 --> 00:52:45,987
Come & play TV games with us!

717
00:52:46,462 --> 00:52:47,986
Jenny has to see others

718
00:52:48,564 --> 00:52:50,725
Brother's interested
in these pieces of land

719
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:52,357
Okay, I'll have the data ready

720
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,368
Steven

721
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:56,401
My uncle!

722
00:52:56,639 --> 00:52:57,663
Nice to meet you

723
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,035
My brother-in-law, Jenny

724
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,373
Where's dad?

725
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,444
He's upstairs calling Thailand

726
00:53:02,578 --> 00:53:03,510
on business

727
00:53:05,581 --> 00:53:07,071
He's busy even on holiday

728
00:53:07,216 --> 00:53:10,014
He's planning to acquire several
listed companies in Thailand

729
00:53:11,254 --> 00:53:13,017
Has he many
interests in Thailand

730
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:15,188
He must be very busy!

731
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:20,721
Take Miss Lin
upstairs to see dad!

732
00:53:20,863 --> 00:53:21,852
Coming!

733
00:53:38,781 --> 00:53:40,715
Jenny, my dad

734
00:53:40,983 --> 00:53:41,847
Nice to see you, Uncle

735
00:53:41,984 --> 00:53:43,076
Nice to see you

736
00:53:43,586 --> 00:53:47,044
Auntie, come &
take photos for us!

737
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:49,253
Miss Lin, come &
take photos for us

738
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:51,489
Come & take photos

739
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,286
Come... sit down!

740
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:54,396
Put on something first!

741
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:55,497
Hurry up!

742
00:53:55,798 --> 00:53:57,561
Wait for me, wait for me!

743
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,894
Don't be so long

744
00:54:06,909 --> 00:54:07,841
Good boy

745
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,202
You were excellent
at games in childhood

746
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,942
Now, you're excellent
at making love

747
00:54:13,449 --> 00:54:15,383
Dad, I'm serious

748
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:17,509
We're true to each other

749
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:21,190
How can you be true
to this kind of girl?

750
00:54:22,191 --> 00:54:24,352
Dad, don't tell me that

751
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:27,088
You look down on artists!

752
00:54:27,363 --> 00:54:28,557
So she's playing you

753
00:54:28,698 --> 00:54:30,393
on her palm!

754
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,023
You know what she does?

755
00:54:32,869 --> 00:54:34,496
She's a whore!

756
00:54:35,204 --> 00:54:36,501
Who says?

757
00:54:37,206 --> 00:54:38,503
I do!

758
00:54:38,641 --> 00:54:41,075
Uncle, did you read it

759
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:42,609
in the gossip magazine?

760
00:54:42,745 --> 00:54:46,579
Sometimes we take
a moral holiday

761
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:50,277
but won't tell you about it

762
00:54:50,686 --> 00:54:52,881
Your dad doesn't want
you to be fooled

763
00:54:53,122 --> 00:54:55,283
He wants me

764
00:54:56,058 --> 00:54:57,958
to remind you that

765
00:54:58,094 --> 00:54:59,026
some of these Thai merchants

766
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:01,892
have slept with her

767
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:04,731
I want a soft drink

768
00:55:04,867 --> 00:55:05,856
Me too

769
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:07,765
Don't drink too much!

770
00:55:07,904 --> 00:55:10,498
I want one too

771
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:23,949
What proof have you got?

772
00:55:24,086 --> 00:55:25,144
Before you left

773
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:28,883
she flew to Thailand to serve me

774
00:55:34,063 --> 00:55:36,327
Jenny said she had to
rush for recording

775
00:55:36,866 --> 00:55:38,857
Jenny

776
00:55:39,001 --> 00:55:41,765
Steven, don't let your
relationship with a whore

777
00:55:41,904 --> 00:55:43,929
get me into a family scandal

778
00:55:44,073 --> 00:55:45,335
I don't care,

779
00:55:46,809 --> 00:55:47,969
I must marry her

780
00:55:52,748 --> 00:55:57,708
Will you take Chou Chih-hsiung
as your husband

781
00:55:57,954 --> 00:56:00,218
for better or worse,
for rich or poor

782
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:05,191
And cherish him all your life?

783
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:08,693
I do

784
00:56:08,831 --> 00:56:10,264
Now exchange rings

785
00:56:16,572 --> 00:56:18,699
Oh, no!
Don't get out before we say 'cut'

786
00:56:18,841 --> 00:56:22,004
Jenny...

787
00:56:28,317 --> 00:56:29,375
Jenny, what's going on?

788
00:56:29,518 --> 00:56:30,610
Jenny

789
00:56:31,454 --> 00:56:32,284
Never mind her!

790
00:56:32,421 --> 00:56:34,116
Jenny, the Director wants
you back for filming

791
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,615
Tell the Director to wait

792
00:56:43,499 --> 00:56:45,296
Wipe off your tears first

793
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:46,665
Thank you

794
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,107
Your friend has been waiting

795
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:03,677
Why are you weeping?

796
00:57:05,554 --> 00:57:07,454
Act... ing only

797
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,660
Tell the Director to skip
your close-up first

798
00:57:13,796 --> 00:57:14,854
Okay

799
00:57:14,997 --> 00:57:16,021
Get going

800
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:21,031
Why didn't you answer my call?

801
00:57:22,805 --> 00:57:25,296
I switched off my beeper
while working

802
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:32,570
Hi, Jenny, have a pose

803
00:57:33,149 --> 00:57:35,242
They say you've
been in high spirit

804
00:57:35,584 --> 00:57:38,553
Jenny, what a beautiful gown!

805
00:57:38,854 --> 00:57:40,253
When are you going
to get married?

806
00:57:40,389 --> 00:57:41,686
Not sure myself

807
00:57:41,824 --> 00:57:43,758
It all depends on her!

808
00:57:44,393 --> 00:57:47,191
She'd given you the chance to decide
What's your answer?

809
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:48,262
Excuse me

810
00:57:48,397 --> 00:57:50,388
We've something to talk about

811
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:04,445
Do you want to talk to me?

812
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,215
Have you been
overseas these days?

813
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:12,384
What do you mean?

814
00:58:14,223 --> 00:58:15,417
Nothing

815
00:58:16,158 --> 00:58:19,150
I'm going to USA
on family business

816
00:58:20,162 --> 00:58:21,959
Join me

817
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:24,256
if you're free

818
00:58:30,172 --> 00:58:31,434
What do you say?

819
00:58:35,711 --> 00:58:39,238
Sorry, I can't,
filming's not yet over

820
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:43,618
Have a good time yourself

821
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:49,883
Call me when you get there
Excuse me

822
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:25,551
Is Mrs Fang in?
It's from the office

823
00:59:25,694 --> 00:59:28,492
She's out at the moment
Who's speaking?

824
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:29,996
Tell Tsui-tsui

825
00:59:30,132 --> 00:59:31,759
to return to office

826
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:49,518
Didn't you boil
the congee for me?

827
00:59:49,785 --> 00:59:52,219
It's almost time to see Ming

828
00:59:54,256 --> 00:59:56,986
I told you that before

829
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:02,562
Tsui-tsui

830
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:19,214
Mrs Fang? This is the Hospital!

831
01:00:19,348 --> 01:00:20,940
Your son's getting serious

832
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:23,711
The doctor wants you &
your husband to come at once

833
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:25,411
Thank you

834
01:00:28,891 --> 01:00:30,722
It's from the Hospital
They want us to go at once

835
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,858
They say Ming's getting serious!

836
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,966
I know you never do it
in Hong Kong

837
01:00:41,103 --> 01:00:42,695
Make an exception now

838
01:00:43,439 --> 01:00:46,875
He came from overseas too

839
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,113
Don't worry,

840
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:55,510
I introduce respectable men only

841
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:58,249
I've never let you down

842
01:00:59,855 --> 01:01:01,220
You can keep your
family girl image

843
01:01:01,624 --> 01:01:04,718
after these years!

844
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:09,826
I'm going to Canada next month

845
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:13,094
You don't have to worry
about me anymore

846
01:01:14,803 --> 01:01:17,033
Jenny, just do me a favor

847
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:24,638
Don't worry

848
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:27,840
They won't stick to you forever

849
01:01:31,687 --> 01:01:34,178
Okay, I'll do it

850
01:01:34,723 --> 01:01:35,212
I won't do it!

851
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:36,586
Have you any say on this?
Come back

852
01:01:39,228 --> 01:01:40,126
What's wrong?

853
01:01:40,262 --> 01:01:41,957
I won't do it without condoms

854
01:01:42,097 --> 01:01:42,995
What's wrong with your girls?

855
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:45,532
She wants me to wear condoms!
Is the service free?

856
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:46,333
Bobbie

857
01:01:46,468 --> 01:01:47,662
Well, I'll fix it!

858
01:01:47,803 --> 01:01:48,428
Go through it now!

859
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:49,765
No!

860
01:01:50,005 --> 01:01:51,495
Who'll suffer if anything happens?

861
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,438
I may lose all my teeth & hair!

862
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:56,177
So you're getting nasty!

863
01:01:56,312 --> 01:01:59,042
Listen, just do as I tell you

864
01:01:59,181 --> 01:02:02,241
Nuts! Do it yourself if you like

865
01:02:02,384 --> 01:02:04,147
Am I not born of a mother too?

866
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,545
Bitch

867
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,089
How dare you talk back?

868
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:41,055
Speak up! OK

869
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:43,752
Please have a blood test,

870
01:02:44,193 --> 01:02:46,718
for it's serious

871
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,024
What's going on?

872
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:50,730
Has the result been known?

873
01:02:51,233 --> 01:02:53,360
Your son's got AIDS

874
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:56,634
He won't live for a long time

875
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:00,208
How could a boy have got this?

876
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:03,036
The only chance is contamination

877
01:03:03,178 --> 01:03:06,841
with a relative's blood

878
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:10,210
So we wanted you to
take a blood test

879
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:14,352
Now the result shows
Mr Fang's reaction is negative

880
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:16,515
without any AIDS virus

881
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:19,684
Mrs Fang's blood is positive

882
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,293
She may have

883
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,364
contaminated your son

884
01:03:26,835 --> 01:03:28,462
An AIDS patient looks normal

885
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:29,866
before the virus

886
01:03:30,005 --> 01:03:32,667
becomes active

887
01:03:32,908 --> 01:03:35,672
It may remain
dormant for 7 years

888
01:03:36,178 --> 01:03:36,872
Mrs Fang

889
01:03:37,012 --> 01:03:40,470
We'll recheck
you in a minute!

890
01:03:40,816 --> 01:03:43,512
The Medical Health Dept
wants your data again

891
01:03:43,652 --> 01:03:46,712
with those men who had
sex relation with you

892
01:03:52,227 --> 01:03:55,253
Can... can I've a word with
my wife alone?

893
01:04:23,425 --> 01:04:25,985
I knew that once I did it

894
01:04:27,062 --> 01:04:30,122
I'd have a lot to lose

895
01:04:32,234 --> 01:04:36,102
I did try to find
other decent work

896
01:04:37,272 --> 01:04:38,933
but then the money
earned would be

897
01:04:39,074 --> 01:04:43,170
far from meeting our needs

898
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:49,707
I lived in fear everyday

899
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,956
Formerly you could shore my fear

900
01:04:55,090 --> 01:04:56,853
and comfort me

901
01:04:58,660 --> 01:05:03,461
but this time
I've to keep it to myself

902
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:07,091
I've to face it by myself

903
01:05:08,804 --> 01:05:11,170
I've been accompanied

904
01:05:11,673 --> 01:05:13,538
by fear everyday

905
01:05:15,277 --> 01:05:17,438
I even made myself up

906
01:05:17,579 --> 01:05:19,843
like another person

907
01:05:20,816 --> 01:05:23,751
because I'm ashamed to see you

908
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:32,156
Sending Ming to school
& cooking for you

909
01:05:32,661 --> 01:05:35,528
was my only pleasure

910
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:39,966
for I could feel like mammy

911
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:42,233
& have hope

912
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,903
Now I've dashed it

913
01:05:46,041 --> 01:05:50,205
with my own hands

914
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:57,748
Why? Why should I make
such a serious mistake?

915
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:02,784
My mistake!

916
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:08,460
Not your mistake, it's Tsui-tsui's!

917
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:24,841
Mum...

918
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:30,577
Mum... I'm sorry! Don't die!

919
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:47,064
Ming, is your forehead still hot?

920
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:50,069
Want to go to Disneyland?

921
01:06:50,205 --> 01:06:51,399
Yes

922
01:06:55,043 --> 01:06:56,067
Shall I take you there?

923
01:06:56,211 --> 01:06:57,143
Okay

924
01:07:04,686 --> 01:07:05,209
Yuan

925
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,379
Get me some shoes from the
drawer in the sitting room

926
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:15,629
Which box is it?

927
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:20,725
They all belong to Shan-shan

928
01:07:23,505 --> 01:07:27,771
Look at you, all sweaty
Change now!

929
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,377
Change now! I'll get you a cold drink

930
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:37,249
Oh, you're burly!

931
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:42,280
Sit down and have a drink

932
01:07:49,464 --> 01:07:51,364
Are you still hot?

933
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:16,299
Where are you going?

934
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,103
To take a bath

935
01:10:19,948 --> 01:10:21,074
What do you mean?

936
01:10:22,317 --> 01:10:25,946
You wanted to see
if I'm a whore!

937
01:10:27,989 --> 01:10:31,425
Listen, I quitted

938
01:10:31,793 --> 01:10:33,658
since I know you

939
01:10:33,795 --> 01:10:35,558
What about now?

940
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,767
I know you were the guest

941
01:10:43,805 --> 01:10:45,796
and come to see for myself

942
01:10:46,074 --> 01:10:47,063
I wanted to see

943
01:10:47,209 --> 01:10:48,767
if you were as cheap as they said

944
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:50,775
I wanted to see your true face

945
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:56,249
I can show you now

946
01:10:56,685 --> 01:10:59,085
I'll show you

947
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:01,086
how I act as a whore too

948
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:15,797
Are you going to bed?
I'll quit if you don't

949
01:12:46,027 --> 01:12:47,688
Ling-yu, is that you?

950
01:12:47,829 --> 01:12:48,955
Yes

951
01:12:49,097 --> 01:12:50,291
Come out!

952
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:56,534
I want to talk to you!

953
01:12:57,839 --> 01:12:59,067
Wait a minute

954
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:01,603
Can you come out now?

955
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:16,948
Ling-yu, don't move out!

956
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:21,026
Mammy may never
care for me anymore

957
01:13:22,764 --> 01:13:25,426
I'm not worthy of any care?

958
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:45,680
Are you asking for punishment?

959
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:47,879
Come on... kill me

960
01:13:48,023 --> 01:13:50,048
I know you don't love me

961
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:52,517
That's no way to talk to me!

962
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:55,124
I love you so much...

963
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:56,524
If you do,

964
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:58,462
you won't have made me a whore

965
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:04,070
I don't want to be a whore all my life

966
01:14:04,205 --> 01:14:07,333
Quit then!

967
01:14:07,475 --> 01:14:10,137
Pay off all your debts
& you may go

968
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:17,144
Come on, have a few pills!
Take them!

969
01:14:17,285 --> 01:14:18,252
No!

970
01:14:21,556 --> 01:14:22,045
Hi, what are you doing?

971
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:23,054
Sleeping!

972
01:14:25,493 --> 01:14:29,361
Sheeping?
You bitch, don't sleep!

973
01:14:31,132 --> 01:14:35,125
Tramp, you're fighting back

974
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:39,968
I was nice to you,
but you're so damn cheap!

975
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:48,706
Is my sister with you?

976
01:14:52,787 --> 01:14:53,845
Your sister's here to see you

977
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:58,316
Sister

978
01:14:58,460 --> 01:14:59,586
What happened?

979
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:01,888
Uncle molested me

980
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:02,860
Where's mammy?

981
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,761
She's out for a party

982
01:15:06,868 --> 01:15:08,199
Sleep with me tonight

983
01:15:08,336 --> 01:15:10,099
I'll talk to him tomorrow

984
01:15:11,773 --> 01:15:12,797
The blanket

985
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:14,642
I'll go in to sleep with my sister

986
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:17,540
Go in? We sleep in this room

987
01:15:17,979 --> 01:15:20,345
unless you prefer to
share the same bed

988
01:15:34,262 --> 01:15:36,287
Sister, did you get bullied?

989
01:15:39,334 --> 01:15:41,894
No, but I don't feel too well

990
01:15:46,374 --> 01:15:47,204
Sleep!

991
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:50,902
The doctor said you
maybe discharged

992
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:53,879
Sterilize everything
at home with detergent

993
01:15:54,015 --> 01:15:55,846
All utensils should be separated

994
01:15:55,984 --> 01:15:58,077
Don't share the same bed
with your husband

995
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:01,584
Avoid any more sex
behaviour with anybody

996
01:16:01,923 --> 01:16:03,584
Understand?

997
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:07,192
Warden, someone in
Rm 216 needs your advice!

998
01:16:15,036 --> 01:16:17,027
Where's my son?

999
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:38,186
Let me take this down first

1000
01:16:41,062 --> 01:16:42,154
I'll tell Shan-shan first

1001
01:16:58,379 --> 01:16:59,004
I'll call an ambulance

1002
01:16:59,147 --> 01:17:02,708
No, it's too late!
Lend me a hand now!

1003
01:17:08,456 --> 01:17:10,981
Come on...

1004
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:13,151
We've searched
and found nothing

1005
01:17:13,294 --> 01:17:14,226
There's no answer at home

1006
01:17:14,796 --> 01:17:15,353
No answer?

1007
01:17:15,497 --> 01:17:16,589
Did you see his dad
enter the room?

1008
01:17:16,731 --> 01:17:17,663
Yes

1009
01:17:17,832 --> 01:17:18,423
What did he say?

1010
01:17:18,566 --> 01:17:19,362
Did he say anything?

1011
01:17:19,501 --> 01:17:21,628
He just said: Any headache?

1012
01:17:21,769 --> 01:17:22,895
Want to go to Disneyland?

1013
01:17:23,037 --> 01:17:24,004
Disneyland

1014
01:17:25,406 --> 01:17:26,395
Go now

1015
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:38,885
We've won! It's fun!

1016
01:17:49,531 --> 01:17:50,520
Police

1017
01:17:57,939 --> 01:18:02,899
Faster! Faster, Shan-shan!

1018
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:10,684
A white Benz DP278

1019
01:18:10,818 --> 01:18:11,876
Don't die!

1020
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,078
A road block in front!

1021
01:18:20,495 --> 01:18:22,360
You've exceeded the limit!
Show me your licence!

1022
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:23,862
Someone's dying!

1023
01:18:24,232 --> 01:18:26,166
Sure, I will if I let you go

1024
01:18:27,468 --> 01:18:29,333
Switch it off
Open the trunk

1025
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:40,408
Damn it!
You nearly ran us down!

1026
01:18:47,021 --> 01:18:49,512
Stop! Stop!

1027
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:58,191
Get out! Get out!

1028
01:18:58,333 --> 01:19:01,131
Come out!

1029
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:03,362
Don't you know you nearly
knocked us down?

1030
01:19:03,504 --> 01:19:05,938
I... I was rushing someone
to hospital!

1031
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:07,200
I could accuse you
of dangerous driving

1032
01:19:07,342 --> 01:19:08,707
& wounding with intent

1033
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:11,208
Have you got wounded?
Are you dying?

1034
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:13,314
The one in the car
is really dying

1035
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:15,105
Isn't life more important

1036
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,478
than prosecution?

1037
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:18,210
Are you good policemen?

1038
01:19:18,353 --> 01:19:20,446
It's a policeman's duty
to help the citizen!

1039
01:19:20,588 --> 01:19:24,080
At least you shouldn't let
someone die without help

1040
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:32,699
A policeman must
execute his duties

1041
01:19:32,834 --> 01:19:34,028
Show me your licence!

1042
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:36,861
Miss, show me your ID card
for registration

1043
01:19:39,307 --> 01:19:41,707
I seem to have forgot
to bring it

1044
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:43,867
We can't admit her
without registration

1045
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:45,240
It's our rule

1046
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:51,343
Oh, I've found it!

1047
01:19:53,154 --> 01:19:54,951
Get a doctor to treat her first!

1048
01:19:55,089 --> 01:19:56,556
Go now!

1049
01:19:59,494 --> 01:20:00,859
Hurry up!

1050
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:05,264
Miss, please show
me her ID card

1051
01:20:09,370 --> 01:20:10,735
Shan-shan

1052
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:12,336
You can't go in! Let me go in!

1053
01:20:12,473 --> 01:20:13,269
No!

1054
01:20:14,175 --> 01:20:15,767
Ling-yu, let's wait outside

1055
01:20:20,948 --> 01:20:21,642
We can't stay here

1056
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:24,274
Don't worry, we'll just wait here!

1057
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:26,853
Miss, don't go!

1058
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:29,553
This is not yours!

1059
01:20:29,824 --> 01:20:32,122
We suspect you're
using a lost ID card

1060
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:12,328
Did you have a good time?

1061
01:21:12,467 --> 01:21:13,525
Yes

1062
01:21:19,874 --> 01:21:21,569
Dad, it's nice here

1063
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:09,423
Well, let me kiss you

1064
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:21,094
Sister...

1065
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:30,466
What are you doing? Stop it

1066
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:32,901
Let me go

1067
01:23:34,041 --> 01:23:36,271
What? Sister

1068
01:23:36,410 --> 01:23:39,902
I want you to let her go, please

1069
01:23:40,481 --> 01:23:43,917
Let me go, no

1070
01:23:44,051 --> 01:23:45,245
Stop it

1071
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:50,583
Go away I beg you to stop it

1072
01:24:16,417 --> 01:24:18,885
Bobbie, stop!

1073
01:24:43,077 --> 01:24:45,568
Stop staring!
Sooner or later she'll have to do it

1074
01:24:45,713 --> 01:24:47,340
Why not benefit her own relative?

1075
01:24:47,481 --> 01:24:50,541
A grown up girl needs
this sort of experience

1076
01:25:04,398 --> 01:25:06,628
Hey, get me back the panties!

1077
01:25:56,617 --> 01:25:59,108
Listen,

1078
01:25:59,253 --> 01:26:00,811
have your sis attend
some sessions

1079
01:26:00,955 --> 01:26:02,650
She can relieve some
of your duties

1080
01:26:51,038 --> 01:26:52,005
They're up above

1081
01:27:02,116 --> 01:27:04,778
Shao Feng, Hsiao Ming

1082
01:27:04,919 --> 01:27:07,513
He's died for sometime!

1083
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:13,024
Let me go! Let me see!

1084
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:15,993
You take her there

1085
01:27:16,664 --> 01:27:18,063
Keep cool

1086
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:19,689
Keep cool

1087
01:27:24,371 --> 01:27:26,168
Your husband left
this letter for you!

1088
01:27:37,785 --> 01:27:38,911
Excuse me!

1089
01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:43,251
I even took Ming away!

1090
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:46,025
You've suffered for too long

1091
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:47,491
You need a rest

1092
01:27:48,195 --> 01:27:53,098
Love is the most valuable,
not life

1093
01:27:53,734 --> 01:27:55,929
and each of us has it

1094
01:27:56,337 --> 01:27:57,998
I can now die without regret

1095
01:27:59,507 --> 01:28:00,974
I know you are very sad

1096
01:28:01,742 --> 01:28:03,676
But I hope you can get it together

1097
01:28:04,011 --> 01:28:05,945
And get on with your life

1098
01:28:06,947 --> 01:28:10,439
Take my advice & don't
waste the rest of your life

1099
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:47,387
Give me back my gun

1100
01:29:20,955 --> 01:29:26,188
Excuse me. A visitor for you

1101
01:29:38,572 --> 01:29:39,937
Sorry!

1102
01:29:40,374 --> 01:29:42,569
Forget it, it's fate

1103
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:45,440
It was all my fault

1104
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:49,712
Had I watched you closely,
you wouldn't have done that!

1105
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:54,482
I shouldn't have got you involved

1106
01:29:55,289 --> 01:29:56,381
Don't cry!

1107
01:29:56,523 --> 01:29:57,785
I'm going, not you

1108
01:29:57,925 --> 01:29:59,449
Don't be so sad!

1109
01:29:59,593 --> 01:30:02,653
If you're still my sister, smile

1110
01:30:08,602 --> 01:30:10,126
Okay, Ling-yu

1111
01:30:10,271 --> 01:30:12,705
I promise

1112
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,740
I'll live a new life

1113
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:16,069
Good

1114
01:30:16,944 --> 01:30:19,242
And you, little big man?

1115
01:30:21,949 --> 01:30:24,110
Send me your address
upon your return

1116
01:30:24,251 --> 01:30:25,912
I'll visit you whenever I can

1117
01:30:26,053 --> 01:30:28,214
Why take the trouble?

1118
01:30:28,355 --> 01:30:29,754
I'll see you when I return

1119
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:31,187
Keep an eye on him for me

1120
01:30:31,325 --> 01:30:32,792
Don't let other girls
get closed to him!

1121
01:30:32,927 --> 01:30:34,986
You alone are an exception!

1122
01:30:45,139 --> 01:30:48,700
Come on quick!

1123
01:30:53,614 --> 01:30:54,410
Keep up!

1124
01:30:54,548 --> 01:30:55,845
Get in, get in

1125
01:30:55,983 --> 01:30:57,041
Ling-yu

1126
01:31:05,492 --> 01:31:08,984
Get in! Go quick!

1127
01:31:15,369 --> 01:31:16,961
Come on. Get in...

1128
01:31:17,571 --> 01:31:18,629
I'll wait for you

1129
01:31:19,306 --> 01:31:20,466
I'll be back soon!

1130
01:31:20,607 --> 01:31:21,767
When?

1131
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:23,140
1997!

1132
01:31:23,477 --> 01:31:24,944
Get in...

1133
01:31:29,283 --> 01:31:30,841
See you in 1997!

1134
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:23,534
<i>"I want to tell you"</i>

1135
01:32:24,638 --> 01:32:31,476
<i>"Our story is colourful"</i>

1136
01:32:33,447 --> 01:32:40,319
<i>"I remember your eyes"</i>

1137
01:32:42,289 --> 01:32:49,422
<i>"I remember the romantic song"</i>

1138
01:32:51,965 --> 01:32:59,303
<i>"This is a love that is torn apart"</i>

1139
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:09,006
<i>"This is a love that is torn apart"</i>

1140
01:33:09,149 --> 01:33:15,782
<i>"The ending is so disappointing"</i>

1141
01:33:17,758 --> 01:33:25,392
<i>"That I can't hide away from that"</i>

1
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,580
Formula 1 - Engines on The Track

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:14,480
My heart's continuous signal of love

3
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,480
It's that way because
I want to embrace you

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,880
And as I waited I
decided to dance slowly

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,880
Both of us could
read each other's lips

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,180
We secretly bathed
in the moonlight

7
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,980
After the goodbye

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,430
You left without leaving a clue

9
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,680
Don't betray me Darlin'
She passed through the city

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,330
Nobody knows Love Affair

11
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,730
Together until the morning

12
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,230
Making Love and no more

13
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,830
I felt you when I
touched your hand

14
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,380
Your a woman

15
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,930
Love Affair

16
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,480
Together until the morning

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,180
Making Love and no more

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,780
Those words of love
that you want to hear

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,480
Your a woman

20
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,357
Eh?!
You did it!

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,037
Sempai!
Sempai!

22
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,758
- I've got big news for you!
- Huh?

23
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,197
He just called about
the President of the Federation!

24
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,669
He said that your driver's
license has been returned!

25
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,835
- Are you serious?
- You've gotta go and get it!

26
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,551
Sempai!

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,100
Gunma Draws the Line!
The Enemy's Compassion Is Bitter

28
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,909
So does that mean I
can participate in the next race!

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,116
Of course!
I went to the police ...

30
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,350
...and I have examined
the case in detail.

31
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,550
You were innocent.

32
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,154
However, keep in mind that I
made an exception to the rule ...

33
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,117
...and I can't do it again.

34
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,349
The drivers of the Federation
must have behave responsibly.

35
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,671
If you cause another fight,
I can't help you.

36
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,752
I Gunma Akagi act
whatever way I want!

37
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,998
- Gunma.
- I'm so happy!

38
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,036
They returned my license!

39
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,957
Please, sell me your car!

40
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,952
I was given back my license,
and now I can join the race!

41
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,234
Look, I'm asking you nicely!

42
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,155
- Hey, lady, we're dry!
- Coming.

43
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,834
You can't refuse
without a good reason!

44
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,636
Here you go!

45
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,837
The only way I can win
is to race with your car!

46
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,593
Look, I need it if I
want to switch to Formula 1!

47
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,194
Don't be like that!
Come on, tell me your price.

48
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,191
- One hundred million!
- Eh ?!

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,675
- One hundred million?
- One hundred million is my price,

50
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,270
then you can have the car.

51
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,028
What are you crazy? Do you
think I have that kind of money?

52
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,839
Even if I had that money,
I wouldn't come here with it.

53
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,589
Then you can just forget about it.

54
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,436
Hey!
Wait a minute!

55
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,478
- Hey, you still have to pay!
- How much is it?

56
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,357
Wait for me! Don't go!
Eijiro!

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,478
Sempai!
I'm glad to have met you!

58
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,596
I warn you that
right now I'm furious!

59
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,274
That madman doesn't
want to sell the car!

60
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,948
- I can convince him!
- How?

61
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,076
I sold my old race car ...

62
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,116
...and got a
bit of money for it.

63
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,919
I did it because
we need the money.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,877
They gave me ten million!

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,356
- Quick, follow me Kishida!
- Yes,sempai.

66
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,915
As agreed!
We have the one hundred million.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,958
- What ?! One hundred million ?!
- Consider this a down payment!

68
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,628
You will get the rest
in the coming days.

69
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,268
Sempai, what are you crazy?

70
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,436
Come on, take the money!

71
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,350
- I want all the cash now.
- For now I can only give you this.

72
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,318
But I'll have the rest
in a couple of days.

73
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,356
Well.

74
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,675
Ah, grab it.

75
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,597
- Sempai! Just don't stand there.
- Yes, yes.

76
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,800
D-damn...

77
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,230
We can't possibly get
the rest of the money.

78
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,356
We only have ten million.

79
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,829
And the race is
only two days away.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,036
However, with this money...

81
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,714
...we could find
someone and rent a car.

82
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,509
No one will let us hire a car
if we don't have enough money.

83
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,037
Listen, I have to drive with
his car no matter the cost.

84
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,953
I'll never be able to
beat Hiziri without it.

85
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,036
I willing to beat that if I
had that car all my problems...

86
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,076
...would just disappear.

87
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,879
And my former friend
Tamotsu would be filled with envy.

88
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,755
He thinks he's so smart.

89
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,832
I just need to prove
that I can do it without him!

90
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,118
Answer me! I have a score
to settle with those two,

91
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,156
but to do
that I need his car.

92
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,914
What's wrong with you,
you could have hurt me.

93
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,359
Why are you so insistent!

94
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,199
I will not give it to some freak...

95
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,158
It's mine, get lost.

96
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,359
You will never get my car.

97
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,635
Even if you got on
your hands and knees.

98
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,788
Don't you ever give up?
Listen I will...

99
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,836
...take it by force if necessary.

100
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,188
- Kishida came to see you.
- Right..

101
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:44,550
He asked me if I knew
someone who could hire a car.

102
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,758
I don't think it's possible.
It's too late.

103
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,800
The deadline to
register for the next race...

104
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,871
...will end tomorrow.

105
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,837
I can't help him.

106
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,911
It isn't your fault.

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,753
- You did everything you could!
- Maybe you're right!

108
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,558
Hey, Yasu, do you know
the origins of Gunma?

109
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,552
The only thing I know about
Gunma is that he comes from the suburbs.

110
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,748
What do you know about his
friend Tamotsu, Hiziri's chief mechanic.

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,355
Wasn't it true that the
Gunma and him were best friends.

112
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,268
Indeed! They were good friends.
They spent their childhood together.

113
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,470
Why are you asking these questions?

114
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,914
Because there is something
about this story that intrigues me.

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,275
- What do u mean?
- Listen, Yasu ...

116
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,675
I really need a change of scenery.

117
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,955
Can you spend a few days with me?

118
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,553
The gasoline consumption is
expected to decrease with this setup.

119
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,029
Listen...

120
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,515
I need him to stay alive.

121
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,392
Only you can do it!
Prevent him from driving in the race!

122
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,278
I could never do that to him.

123
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,278
Hiziri trust me and
I cannot betray him.

124
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,551
I didn't agree to
work for him out of pity.

125
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,676
But because I wanted to...

126
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,716
help him obtain his best...

127
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,950
performance that he deserves.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,073
And to get to this job,
I broke my friendship with Gunma.

129
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,116
That can never be undone.

130
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,595
Please, stop it.

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,276
Don't make me say it again.

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,436
After what happened, I don't
know what the right decision is.

133
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,075
As his mechanic
I want him to drive,

134
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,355
but as his friend
I want him to stop.

135
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,431
- Your thinking very deeply.
- Salve, Ruiko!

136
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,750
You know, I was
thinking about the next race!

137
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,236
You haven't slept in two nights!

138
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,959
I've been real busy as of late.

139
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,270
The tests will begin
in two hours at the most!

140
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,673
Okay! By the way, I have some
news that will make you happy.

141
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,270
The President of the Federation
has given Gunma back his license.

142
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,431
- Are you serious?
- Of course!

143
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,473
A certain Junko
phoned asking for you.

144
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,836
- She said to call back!
- I'll do that.

145
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,272
Bye.

146
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,756
Hiziri!

147
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,433
I'm so hungry
that I can't stand.

148
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,957
I know that the car is important,

149
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,031
but you should at
least find time to eat.

150
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,951
Formula 3 is waiting for me!

151
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,634
I must participate
no matter the cost.

152
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,916
- We'll go out after we're full!
- Right!

153
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,790
Thank you for what you did, Tamotsu!
Gunma was so depressed!

154
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,235
Since the license was returned to him,

155
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,276
he has started smiling again.

156
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:40,430
And all this is because of you and Hiziri!

157
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,357
Gunma!

158
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,270
"And all this is
because of you and Hiziri!"

159
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,471
Explain what you mean!

160
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,036
Explain what you mean!

161
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,469
Don't tell me I only
got my license back....

162
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,199
...because Hiziri
intervened on my behalf.

163
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,036
I'm waiting for you to answer me!

164
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,636
Well, Gunma ... I ...

165
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,836
Hurry up and answer me!

166
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,115
- Sempai!
- Back off!

167
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,558
- What's happing?
- Why are you doing this?

168
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,195
I want to know why Hiziri and
Tamotsu is involved in this matter.

169
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,993
Gunma!
Let go of Junko immediately!

170
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,753
- Out of my way!
- I'll tell you...

171
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,956
As long as you stay calm!

172
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,677
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,358
You see, I was the
one that asked Tamotsu ...

174
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,398
...to convince Hiziri to talk
to the President of the Federation.

175
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,074
- What?!
- I chatted with Tamotsu ...

176
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,799
..and I told him that,
since your his friend,

177
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,314
that he should help.
And since Hiziri ...

178
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,277
...knows the President...

179
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,552
What were you thinking?
Who said you could act like that?

180
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,598
You have humiliated me
in front of Tamotsu and Hiziri!

181
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,557
We didn't have much choice.

182
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,200
They were the only
ones who could help.

183
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,676
That's just an excuse!

184
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,117
How the hell am I gonna race on
the track when you've humiliated me!

185
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,158
I understand your feelings,
but that isn't the case ...

186
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,629
- so don't treat her like that!
- Shut up!

187
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,792
Instead of shouting at her
you should be thanking her.

188
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,156
You should be grateful!
She was trying to help you!

189
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,154
As usual, you two
don't understand anything.

190
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,071
Stop it!

191
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,917
Don't blame them,
it wasn't there fault.

192
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,355
Although, it was unfair...

193
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,159
...for you to be punished for
something you didn't do.

194
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,595
I don't care!
You didn't have the right,

195
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,433
- to take action without telling me!
- But still...

196
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,276
Did you want me to do nothing?

197
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,636
Stop being a bully.

198
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,032
Your friends have
always been there for you.

199
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,589
And without Hiziri
you'd be a goner!

200
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,109
As usual you just
react in a violent manner.

201
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,316
And that's why your
father kicked you out!

202
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,278
- What?!
- Even your family couldn't stand you!

203
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,517
How dare you! You know
nothing about me...

204
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,636
...so how dare you
talk about my family.

205
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,597
Let alone my father.

206
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,277
Stop it!

207
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,597
I want to tell you that
you're a selfish, violent human ...

208
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,558
...being, and you need
to learn to respect others.

209
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,077
I am selfish!

210
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,956
I am violent!

211
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,436
And I'm the lowest of the low!

212
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,038
Say whatever you want,
but I will never change.

213
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,153
I act this way
because this is who I am.

214
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,517
You can never
understand why I act like this.

215
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,431
Are you still here?

216
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,230
We've been
waiting a long time!

217
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,955
We haven't met in years, Eijiro.

218
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,754
I don't know why you
want to see me again.

219
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,676
I'm here to help Gunma Akagi.

220
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,075
I'm asking you to
give him your car.

221
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,429
How did the great Kuroi
get put in a wheelchair?

222
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,431
I can't tell you why.
I'm sure you understand.

223
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,231
I'm sorry, but I'm not
selling it even if you ask.

224
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,279
I just knew that
would be your answer.

225
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,511
I'm not 100 percent sure...

226
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,353
...if Gunma Akagi is the
best driver for your car.

227
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,631
But I'm telling you right
now that he's really good.

228
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,075
No one's getting that car.

229
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,957
You know what?

230
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,793
There is no driver in
the world who knows how to...

231
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,757
- ...handle it!
- Look, Eijiro...

232
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,037
We should all get along with each
other since we're from the same country.

233
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,588
How dare you talk about friendship.

234
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,359
- That's not like you at all!
- Listen ...

235
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,439
Maybe you don't remember but Gunma
Akagi is just like you when you were young.

236
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,834
That's the reason I
care about him so much.

237
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,838
He wants to prove that
he can win without Tamotsu.

238
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,036
NEXT YEAR, HIZIRI, WILL
FACE THE EUROPEAN FORMULA 3?

239
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,958
HIZIRI TOGETHER WITH
HIS MECHANIC, TAMOTSU

240
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,077
T-Tamotsu!

241
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,437
Am I doing the right thing?

242
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,512
This isn't fair.
What if he finds out.

243
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,108
You see, as soon as
he does a few laps,

244
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,829
his car will stop and he will
think that you have failed him.

245
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,400
Gunma will also drive in that race ...

246
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,560
...but I am Hiziri's mechanic.

247
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,358
If I used the remote
control to stop his car,

248
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,916
Hiziri might think that I've
come up with some trick...

249
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,956
...to help my friend Gunma.

250
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,428
But why did I put
myself in this mess?

251
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,517
What should I do?

252
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,950
Sempai, try to calm down a bit!

253
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,836
- Sempai!
- Damn!

254
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,751
Junko should
not have done that.

255
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,751
It was my business.

256
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,070
She should have told me first.

257
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,677
Even if...

258
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,149
... Tamotsu
and Hiziri helped me...

259
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,957
- I will not race!
- But you can't do that, sempai.

260
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,995
You've come too
far to quit now,

261
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,356
You can't give up when
you've almost reached your goal.

262
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,271
- I know that...
- Huh!

263
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,237
I'm doing it because...

264
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,515
...my brain tells me
to do it. That's why.

265
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,433
Sempai, I totally understand
how you feel but...

266
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,511
Don't tell me what to do.

267
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,989
- But I just wanted to say that...
- Listen to me!

268
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,196
I will not go
because of my pride...

269
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,157
...since they helped me!

270
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,117
Soichiro Akagi, has another son...

271
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,829
Gunma Akagi, who lives away from home. Soichiro Akagi...

272
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,195
- is a candidate for the elections.
- Sempai.

273
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,311
ELECTION!
SOICHIRO AKAGI

274
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,196
It's you again.

275
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,836
You may control the world,
but you'll never control me.

276
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,595
You can bet on it!
I am strong.

277
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,274
And soon you'll realize
what I'm capable of.

278
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,716
- Shoma!
- That's just like you,

279
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,631
...to disrespect father...

280
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,597
...with your selfish behavior.

281
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,274
What do you care?
What are you doing here?

282
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,558
- Yuki has disappeared!
- What ?!

283
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,271
- Sempai!
- Take this!

284
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,030
I  loved Yuki...

285
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,554
...more than anything else!

286
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,518
But I lost her.
And it's all your fault!

287
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,236
If she loved you so
much why did she run away!

288
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,596
Bastard!
She's gone...

289
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,558
Because of you!
It's all your fault!

290
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,109
If you cared about
her, you should have...

291
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,350
Knew how she felt about father...

292
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,829
And that she hated him
and how you imitated him.

293
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,188
But how do you know?
You only blame others!

294
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,758
I'm blaming you
because it's your fault!

295
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,673
This wouldn't have
happened if you were here.

296
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,189
- It's all your fault!
- Stop it please!

297
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:58,671
It's your fault! It's
your fault! It's your fault!

298
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,918
What, what did I do wrong?

299
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,279
You see, even when I
explained everything to him...

300
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,436
I'm just glad he's happy.

301
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,554
If I was in your place I
would have done the same.

302
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,950
The rain makes me sad!

303
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,199
Damn! That asshole Shoma ...

304
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,031
Sempai.

305
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,669
- Don't worry about me, I'm alright!
- Sempai!

306
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,589
I told you I'm fine!

307
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,672
Gunma! Hold on a little longer.

308
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,552
Yuki...

309
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,956
Yuki!

310
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,356
Yuki...

311
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,877
Gunma...

312
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,912
- Sempai! Sempai!
- Gunma!

313
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,358
Gunma, in the race, I will show
you something interesting!

314
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,268
- What?!
- I challenge you!
- You can do it, Gunma!

315
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,316
Today we will see
who is the strongest!

316
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,277
In the next episode:

317
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,998
Gunma vs. Hiziri!
Final Countdown

318
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,514
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

319
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:29,250
I saw you crying after
you were abandoned

320
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:36,150
Let's climb that hill
and look back down

321
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:40,250
In the big world it's undeniable

322
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:51,000
Yesterday's pain is
not visible anymore

323
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,500
OK Let's start it

324
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,500
In order to grieve

325
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,700
Ah It's as if we weren't born

326
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:15,950
You are my energy, You are my energy

327
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,350
Courage come out

328
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:27,650
By just being with you

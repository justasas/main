1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,150
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,150
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,500
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,700
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,000
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,000
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,250
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,750
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,250
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,679
Dear Tamotsu, how are you
doing? I hope so.

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,077
Every time I think of that snob,

17
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,037
I get ticked off!

18
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,031
I will defeat him eventually.

19
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,277
It's great not being around my father!

20
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,351
For what he did to my mother,
would you forgive him?

21
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,116
Even though I've left my home,

22
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,276
I don't miss it, not one bit!

23
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,071
Anyway, I'm glad I came to Tokyo!

24
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,037
I went to driving soon
as soon as possible...

25
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,475
...and I got my license within a day.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,276
Also the women in
Tokyo are really nice!

27
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,269
I even found an apartment
with a large luxury condo.

28
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,277
Don't worry, there's room for you too!

29
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,436
Tamotsu, you should hurry up and join me!

30
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,757
I have a lot of money available,

31
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,276
all I need is you to
form the best team ever!

32
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,600
Double-dealing his friendship,
Still his dream is the best in the world!

33
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,516
A white building...
A white building...

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,277
A white building?!

35
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,949
Hey, look over there! !
He's been round six times!

36
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,118
Who's house?
I don't know!

37
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,675
Perhaps you mean this house!

38
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,629
It's not what you imagined, then!

39
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,949
- Eh? Your looking for Gunma.
- That lunatic?!

40
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,150
Excuse me.

41
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,394
Gunma!
Gunma, it's you!

42
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,756
I'm your best friend!
Wake up! Wake up, please!

43
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,358
Hi!

44
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,955
I gave you quite a scare, didn't I?

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,719
Tamotsu?
Tamotsu, you're finally here!

46
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,439
Hurray! Hurray! I'm
really glad you came!

47
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,594
I've been waiting
for so long, Tamotsu!

48
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,551
This is great!

49
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,192
Here! This rice was grown
in my plantation.

50
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,670
It's all genuine stuff.
I really hope you like it!

51
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,356
Thank you so much, it's really good!

52
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,869
It's so hard to find genuine things!

53
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,117
Eat up or else it'll get cold!

54
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,919
- Actually, ...
- Eat everything and don't say a word!

55
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,353
Don't you know she is
the best cook in the world?

56
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,789
It's about time that
I've eaten great food!

57
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,836
Enjoy your meal!

58
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,030
- Hey, Gunma.
- Enjoy.

59
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,556
You're really rude!

60
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,438
Where are you going, Junko?
Get back to the table!

61
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,517
You haven't finished!

62
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,750
Don't worry,
she'll be back!

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,958
Excuse me, ma'am, I need
to make a phone call.

64
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,634
Where can I find a phone?

65
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,280
I have a phone!
You can use it, if you want!

66
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,033
Really ...
I'll start calling then.

67
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,753
- More please!
- Sure!

68
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,835
Don't be so loud...

69
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,876
... when you wake me up.

70
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,150
Oh, stop complaining!

71
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,356
Come see what
I've prepared for you.

72
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,079
MARIOKA MOTORS

73
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,116
This is it.

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,675
- Hey, Gunma.
- I'm watching! I'm watching!

75
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,554
- This way!
- Eh?!

76
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,836
This car is a special model!

77
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,958
It has a capacity of
1600 cubic centimeters!

78
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,549
And an aspirated
engine with four valves!

79
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,475
The tires aren't for racing,
they'll need to be changed.

80
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,152
You'll also have to
modify the cooling system!

81
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,153
The shell is made of
aluminum and carbon fiber.

82
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:11,031
This is our first step towards Formula 1.

83
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,270
- Nobody will beat me!
- Hey, Tamotsu!

84
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,197
- Oh, Morioka!
- So you finally decided to come!

85
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,271
This is the engine
you've been waiting for.

86
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,676
Oh I'm sorry.

87
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,751
This is my dear
friend Gunma Akagi.

88
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,631
Hello, pleased to meet you!

89
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,676
Morioka will help...

90
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,638
... us get into the
world of motor sport.

91
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,676
He knows everything.

92
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,751
- Hi there!

93
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,277
As you can see, I tried
to do my best to satisfy you.

94
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,754
Although it is used,
the engine is not bad.

95
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,074
And just because it's you,
I decided to sell it ...

96
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,037
...at the bargain
price of ten million,

97
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,997
Though it's worth way more.

98
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,275
Tamotsu sure knows
a lot about  engines.

99
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,833
I'm sure that he will turn
this car into a great one!

100
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,671
- Well. Who's driving it?

101
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,517
I wish you luck!

102
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,758
He's really good, you know.

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,956
You got that right!

104
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,951
Hey, Gunma, our dream
is becoming a reality.

105
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,117
I still can't believe it.

106
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,156
I was going to let it go,

107
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,071
but then you gave
me the...

108
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,869
...push I needed!
We will be a great team!

109
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,436
I know that the road to success ...

110
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,556
...will be a hard one.

111
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,757
However, we will give it our all!

112
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,036
You will become a great driver!

113
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,277
We should have enough money!

114
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,914
- How?
- How do you think...

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,833
- ... isn't your family rich?
Your father too...

116
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,354
..I'm pretty sure
they could spare some!

117
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,438
- What did I said?
- Forget about it!

118
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,159
Hey, you know that...

119
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,959
...that care.
I love it!

120
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,640
Now calm down,
we don't need to hurry!

121
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,474
From now on we'll need money.

122
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,029
I have managed to
put some savings aside.

123
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,511
I think you should go
home and think for a bit.

124
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,989
Theres no time to lose...

125
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,116
- ...we'll sell the car?
- Alright!

126
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,839
Then we will buy
a brand new car!

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,675
It would cost a lot more,
but it's better for racing!

128
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,714
Even so money isn't the only ...

129
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,439
...problem we have!
Understand?

130
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,557
HOUSE AKAGI

131
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,596
- So you need ten million?
- Yes!

132
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,636
That's the truth!

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,434
So it's only money you want,

134
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,476
your such a let down!

135
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,835
Shoma, will you satisfy his madness?

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,956
Of course not!

137
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,478
- I know your there!
- Gunma!

138
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,950
He doesn't have time for you!

139
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,276
He's already busy with the elections!

140
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,196
- Yuki, get his overcoat.
- Sure!

141
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,597
- Yuki!
- Yes!

142
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,517
Since our father is so overworked,

143
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,353
Can you give it to me.
It should be alright!

144
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,755
Are you not the
heir of the great empire?

145
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,150
Of course!
As far as you're concerned,

146
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,196
you have no right to the money!

147
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,669
You've made a fool of dad.

148
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,031
Remember one thing,
you no longer belong to this family!

149
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,759
So stay away from this house.

150
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,793
What a treat!
This magazine contains ...

151
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,077
a lot of valuable advice!
Just what I needed.

152
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,470
As soon as I get home
I'll get right to work!

153
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,471
Isn't this that mysterious driver!

154
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,271
I haven't seen Gunma all day.

155
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,235
I wish I knew where he went.

156
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,111
I'm the fastest!
No one will ever beat me!

157
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,472
- Gunma!
- Hey there, Tamotsu!

158
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,914
- Did you get the money?
- Nope!

159
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,356
So your going now then?

160
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,075
I wanted to sell the tractor and with the proceeds ...

161
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,435
...I could buy that race car.

162
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,915
Only with that much money...

163
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,275
... will will be able to buy it.

164
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,276
- What's that?
- Give it back, Gunma! Give it back!

165
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,916
You bought a car magazine ...

166
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,036
...and you wanted to read it first?

167
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,714
Gunma, give it back now!

168
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,633
- Give it to me!
- No, I want to read it first!

169
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,675
Stop it, Gunma! Stop it!

170
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,594
- You don't understand!
- Is it that precious to you?

171
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,677
We'll have to dismantle the engine.

172
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,276
Hi, guys, is that okay?

173
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,277
What's with the funeral face?

174
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,631
- What's that?
- Don't you recognize a tractor?

175
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,676
Some teacher you are.

176
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,319
We'll, lets see what it can do!

177
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,277
- So ...
- Don't touch her!

178
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,709
Matsuura is right!
If you don't have a driver's license,

179
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,439
- you can't do it!
- What?

180
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,636
You heard me, go away!

181
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,789
Who cares if I don't have a license?

182
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,836
I can still work with engines!

183
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,559
Also know that I'm
not going to deal with it!

184
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,073
What's wrong with you!
I was only trying to help!

185
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,913
Every time I do something
you always shout,

186
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,560
even though I was only helping!

187
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,757
Thanks for the offer.

188
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,752
- In any case, we don't need you.
- Hey! Tamotsu!

189
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,796
Take a look at the motor!

190
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,314
Look, Tamotsu is a true magician.

191
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,675
He's a master with machines!

192
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,440
- Uhm ...
- Come on, show him!

193
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,954
- Gunma!
- You can trust him!

194
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,029
Where will I find all that money?

195
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,956
I need an idea!

196
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,548
But my brother could
also give me a bit of money!

197
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,673
All I need to do is try!

198
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,189
But this magazine
speaks only of engines!

199
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,076
Oh, I'll never understand any of this stuff.

200
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,512
Tamotsu, are you
sure you can fix it?

201
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,036
I know whats wrong.

202
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,953
The trouble is that in the piston
the cylinder does not flow well.

203
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,036
It'll be easy!

204
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,680
The engine overall okay,
it'll be easy,

205
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,155
only that the cylinder
does not work properly!

206
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,198
If we fix that it'll
be good as new.

207
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,839
It seems Gunma
was right about you.

208
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,797
You are a magician.

209
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,270
- Your exaggerating.
- And your being modest!

210
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,430
- He's great

211
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,956
Your young and yet so talented.

212
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,470
Though you might
need a bit more experience,

213
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,869
Stop it,
your making me blush!

214
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,475
Dammit! I don't know
if I can live like this!

215
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,034
I will become a great driver!
You'll see.

216
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,194
From now on we'll need money.

217
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,754
I have managed to
put some savings aside.

218
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,036
"I've put savings aside"?!

219
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,473
I'm sorry, Tamotsu,
but I have to!

220
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,199
Where is it?
Where is it?

221
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,673
Oh! His savings account!

222
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,156
Ten million?!
Where did he get all that from?

223
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,276
Hey, Tamotsu,
we're sorry.

224
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,356
We only did it because
you were his friend.

225
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,910
It doesn't matter,
nobody's a fool!

226
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,673
In this house,
we're all friends.

227
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,957
We all share the same passions!

228
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,759
That's not true!
And you know it!

229
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:39,037
How dare you!
Young people have a duty...

230
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,111
...to hold each others hands!

231
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,077
And if memory serves me correctly,

232
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,628
I remember
you two were kissing!

233
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,030
Don't mention that again!
You got it, Grandma?

234
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,429
My niece, as you
already know is very pretty,

235
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,034
works as an instructor
at the driving school ...

236
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,759
...and Gunma kissed her!
- What?!

237
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,157
So she's that girlfriend
that Gunma write about...

238
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,708
...that beautiful brunette was her?

239
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,836
What did you say!

240
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,674
Granny, what have you prepared to eat?
I'm as hungry as a wolf!

241
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,516
What's the matter?

242
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,631
- This time I'll get you!
- Oh yeah?!

243
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,598
You are a great liar!
How dare you say ...

244
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,717
... such a thing? What's next marriage?

245
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,836
Who said you could...

246
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,876
...write such a thing?

247
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,555
You withdrew all my
money from my bank account!

248
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,636
Why did you do this,
Gunma?

249
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,033
Why did you withdraw all my money?

250
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,156
Tell me why?

251
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,755
To... buy a car!

252
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,951
I just had to buy it!

253
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,276
How could you do this?

254
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,914
Didn't I tell you not to rush.

255
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,996
Deducting the money for the trip,

256
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,236
the money to enroll in driving school,

257
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,074
rent money and
some other small items,

258
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,636
this is all that is left.

259
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,199
But Gunma ...
You betrayed me!

260
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,074
In your letter you
told me a lot of lies.

261
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,355
You tricked me
into coming here!

262
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,114
You told me you got
your license in one day...

263
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,839
... and that you were in
love with your instructor!

264
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,631
And you lied about
your father giving you money!

265
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,555
You told me only lies!

266
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,034
Bingo!
It's all true!

267
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,351
but you wouldn't have come if I didn't...

268
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,954
...and our dreams would
have never come true.

269
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,278
Your behavior is truly unforgivable!

270
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,757
You deceived us
to only benefit yourself!

271
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,994
- More!
- Who do you think you are?

272
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,356
How can you act as
if nothing happened,

273
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,671
while your friend is
suffering because of you.

274
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,116
Stop it!

275
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,758
I'm leaving. I can't stay
a minute longer in this place!

276
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,034
You will see, I will
become a great driver.

277
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,560
And when I win,
everyone will love me!

278
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,675
I will do anything
as long as I win!

279
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,837
I'm nothing like you!
I'm better than you all!

280
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,231
I won't hide behind
the skirt of my mother!

281
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,636
I'll do whatever I want!

282
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,836
No one can stop me!

283
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,436
Tamotsu, this goes for you too.

284
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,277
I don't believe it!

285
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,910
Goodbye, my friend.
I wish you good luck, Gunma.

286
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,153
Well, I knew he would act that way.

287
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,270
I understood from the
beginning that it was all lies.

288
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,279
Gunma has always
been good at telling lies!

289
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,598
Tamotsu!

290
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,916
Are you alright?

291
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,236
I'm alright, Junko.

292
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,348
And because I trust you,
I'll tell you a secret.

293
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,550
Gunma doesn't know,

294
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,677
that the money he spent
was not mine, but his.

295
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,234
His brother Yuma handed
me the money before I left.

296
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,111
I hid my savings under here. Look!

297
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,156
I had to do this.

298
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,119
Gunma has a bad temper
and it is best to go along...

299
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,276
...or it would have gotten worse.

300
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,353
So this is why all of this has happened.

301
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,077
Wait a minute, Junko!

302
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,192
Listen carefully. Will you would be
willing to do me a big favor?

303
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,872
- What is it?
- Today Gunma said ...

304
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,669
...that I was a magician with engines,
however this is not true!

305
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,670
The truth is...
The truth is that the magician is Gunma!

306
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,150
- And you have to help him!
- Really?!

307
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,908
Please, Junko!
I beg of you...

308
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,956
...to help him
pass the driving test.

309
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,957
Gunma is unstable,

310
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,679
and will be thrown
out of any driving school.

311
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,710
The only way he'll
be able to pass is,

312
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,031
if you stay with him.
You have to, Junko!

313
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,031
You must help.

314
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,349
- But this isn't right.
- Please, Junko!

315
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,517
Don't worry.
I'll help you.

316
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,480
I'm gonna get private lessons!

317
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,676
This is my first step
towards stardom!

318
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,836
I'll show all of you!

319
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,430
In the next episode:

320
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,557
"Junko's Private Lessons".

321
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,473
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

322
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,550
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

323
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:19,500
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

324
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,800
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

325
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:35,600
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

326
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,500
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

327
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,200
These feelings
just flare up

328
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

329
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,200
The fantasy penetrates through you

330
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

331
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:15,250
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

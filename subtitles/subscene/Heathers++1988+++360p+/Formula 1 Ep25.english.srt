Formula 1 - Engines on The Track

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,800
My heart's continuous signal of love

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,800
It's that way because
I want to embrace you

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,200
And as I waited I
decided to dance slowly

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,200
Both of us could
read each other's lips

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:35,500
We secretly bathed
in the moonlight

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,300
After the goodbye

8
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:44,750
You left without leaving a clue

9
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,000
Don't betray me Darlin'
She passed through the city

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,650
Nobody knows Love Affair

11
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,050
Together until the morning

12
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,550
Making Love and no more

13
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:59,150
I felt you when I
touched your hand

14
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,700
Your a woman

15
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,250
Love Affair

16
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,800
Together until the morning

17
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,500
Making Love and no more

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,100
Those words of love
that you want to hear

19
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,800
Your a woman

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,033
10 days have passed since
Kuroi brought the boy here.

21
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,074
And they've done nothing but drive the car!

22
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,751
However, I must admit
this guy is a tough nut!

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,230
The first day he complained
and tried to attack Kuroi,

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,994
but then asked him
to climb aboard again.

25
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,835
I personally think
that this guy is an idiot!

26
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,350
He's all brawn and no brains!

27
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,152
You don't say?

28
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,100
The Vicious Horse Rides an F-3

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,830
Kuroi, how long must I wait
before racing in Formula 3?

30
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,510
You have very little experience!

31
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,751
But you'll let me drive in
the next Formula 3 race, right?

32
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,554
Don't kid yourself,
you've still a way to go!

33
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,676
You'll have to wait at least two years!

34
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,670
What?! I can't wait that long!
I want to be in the next race.

35
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,677
I'm tired of waiting, you know?

36
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,797
Hey, even if you made
a good result in your category,

37
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,836
you still need patience, friend!

38
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,995
To race in Formula 3 takes brains!

39
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,429
You don't win with
just a great desire!

40
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,236
That's what a professional is!
Believe me.

41
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,517
What?! Who do you think
you are giving me advice,

42
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,068
You've never come
first in your entire career?

43
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,430
- Shut up!
- You slowpoke!

44
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,440
- Stop it!
- Now listen up,

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,557
we don't we race?
Let's see who is the strongest.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,956
I told you to shut up.

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,630
Sempai!
I came to get you! Oh!

48
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,872
Hey you!
You better listen to me,

49
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,916
there are two
races left this year.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,436
I will race in Formula 3 and
no one can stop me, understand?

51
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,994
Well, he sure is
the determined one?

52
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,350
I agree!
What do you say, Gordon?

53
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,630
There's no turning back now.

54
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,950
Well, our sponsor has left me ...

55
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,873
...to choose who
participates in the races.

56
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,597
- What do you say, are you up to it?
I'll think about it.

57
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,757
Will he seize the
opportunity or just stand still.

58
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,078
It depends if he's
ready to face him.

59
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,634
Well, I wonder if he'll
face him or just give up.

60
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,837
I my entire life I've never
made a decision like that.

61
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,076
Maybe I'm just a wimp!

62
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,678
Hello, this is Kuroi Racing.
Ah, it's you!

63
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,350
Yes, he's been here for ten days.

64
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,838
I don't know,
the chances are 50%!

65
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,150
- That's all I can tell you.
- Understood.

66
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,831
- I'll contact you when I have more news!
- Okay! Goodbye.

67
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,757
I'm really happy!

68
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,677
Was that news
about your sweetheart?

69
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,951
- Eh?! Why?
- Didn't you notice,

70
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,589
- you get prettier everyday!
- You flatter me!

71
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,194
Look, today I just want
to give you a dress!

72
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,636
What are you saying.
We should be buying it for you.

73
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,029
No! It's alright!
I have a closet full of them.

74
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,157
And then again
you've been so nice to me.

75
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,515
- You're embarrassing me!
- What do you prefer?

76
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,636
An elegant dress
or a sporty outfit?

77
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,518
I would love a red
dress and a sleeveless one!

78
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,437
This is peaceful.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,560
Since Gunma left,
things are back to normal...

80
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,756
...and the house is
quiet for once.

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,078
Oh, yeah!

82
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,758
Tell me ...
Are you sure your alright?

83
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,029
Don't you miss him?

84
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,950
What are you talking about?

85
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,354
You like Gunma, don't you?

86
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,278
- Grandma ...
- Take my advice,

87
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,113
You should marry Gunma!
You'll be happy...

88
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,236
with him, don't you understand?

89
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,311
Hey, what's got into you?

90
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,755
Listen, I'm being serious.

91
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,440
I know that your suffering...

92
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,470
...like the rest of us,
thinking about Gunma!

93
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,836
Grandma ...

94
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,757
Hey, girls!

95
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,996
- Eh?!
- Hi there.

96
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,999
- Hi,
- Gunma!

97
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,909
Why are you here?
Don't tell me...

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,594
Don't worry, Junko,
I didn't run away!

99
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,995
Tomorrow, the track will
be very busy...

100
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,992
Well, you could have at
least called beforehand?

101
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,231
Have you eaten yet?

102
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,591
Where are the others?

103
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,319
They are out,
they have to work all night!

104
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,915
Anyway could you leave for a bit,
we need to have a talk!

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,437
- What's this all about?
- Wow, your really dense!

106
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,358
Those two need to be alone,
so why don't you stay with me!

107
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,356
So, how was it?

108
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,030
Well, it was fun!

109
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,675
I was stuck in
the old Formula 1 ...

110
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,716
and was
squeezed like a lemon!

111
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,631
What is it?
Don't laugh...

112
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,597
because I almost
died of fatigue!

113
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,477
No, that's not it.

114
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,596
I just suddenly remembered...

115
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,636
...the first time I met you.

116
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,960
With a straight face you
told me: "Let me drive!"

117
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,917
And with no driver's license!

118
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,430
I though: "Who is this crazy guy?"

119
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,433
Even after six months
you're aiming for Formula 3!

120
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,996
Yeah! You can
bet that I'll get...

121
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,152
- ...get there real soon!
- I'm sure of it.

122
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,155
Provided I don't exceed
the weight limits allowed!

123
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,835
- Oh, Kuroi...
- Oh, Gordon!

124
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,077
Why are you here so late?

125
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,515
I thought it might
be worth the risk.

126
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,319
The risk?
What are you talking about?

127
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,436
Stop pretending you don't understand.

128
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,992
- You know what I mean!
- Okay, Gordon.

129
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,196
Tell me what you have in mind.

130
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,555
If you got into
Formula 3 for one year,

131
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,428
you would become an important person,
and probably wouldn't talk to us!

132
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,153
That's what happened with Robert.

133
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,160
Suddenly, he had
created a kind of void!

134
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,191
A void.

135
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,077
He created an unbridgeable gap ...

136
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,833
...between those who succeeded
and those who didn't.

137
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,434
A void even love could not fill.

138
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,997
It was impossible to fill that void...

139
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,071
...and then you suddenly appeared.

140
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,553
As impossible as it
may seem, we won't give up.

141
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,352
That's the truth.

142
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,076
You're shaking ...

143
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,313
Hello. Is this Gunma,
this is Kuroi.

144
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,159
Gunma, be here at six
o'clock tomorrow morning.

145
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,160
You'll drive in Formula
3 just like you wanted!

146
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,310
Eh?! What? Are you serious?

147
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,597
What changed your
mind all of a sudden?

148
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,429
Since you challenged Gordon,
he wants to race with you!

149
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,235
Well, I never imagined
that he had the guts...

150
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,356
...to do a race with me.

151
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,596
I'll see you at six then!

152
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,069
-  But on one condition!
- What condition?

153
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,557
If I win, let me participate
in the next Formula 3 race.

154
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,351
Well, what's your answer?
If you don't agree...

155
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,236
Hey, what's wrong?

156
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,918
I was waiting for your response!
So what is it?

157
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,273
- Fine, I'll agree to it!
- Great! See you soon!

158
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,476
See you tomorrow morning at six o'clock!

159
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,714
Understand, after the first ten laps...

160
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,677
whoever is in the lead wins.

161
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,591
Now remember, you need...

162
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,671
to wait until
the tires are warmed up!

163
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,117
Hey, Gordon, I don't know
why you accepted this challenge,

164
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,158
but I'm ready to
drive with you forever.

165
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,970
Or until you can't take it.

166
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,000
Try not to be so cocky, boy!

167
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,236
I'll show you who's a pro!

168
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,031
Don't be so sure of yourself!
Until now, professionals,

169
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,076
I race always bite the dust.

170
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,233
Oh, my!
Look how he's driving!

171
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,950
Whats happening?
What's wrong with this clutch?

172
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,556
I can't control it!

173
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,477
What's the matter, Gunma?
Have you forgotten how to drive?

174
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,434
TRUTH AND LOYALTY

175
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,352
- I am very sorry!
- Fortunately, your father has noticed.

176
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,591
It would have been a
mess if someone else told him.

177
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,831
Yes!
I am truly embarrassed!

178
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,150
How could you be so stupid?

179
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,430
You've let yourself get
fooled by that girl ...

180
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,193
...and you gave her
large amounts of money...

181
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,555
...that was for my election!

182
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,915
Please give me a little time!

183
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,877
I'll fix everything.

184
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,997
Try to be careful.
The elections are approaching.

185
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,875
You must immediately return the money!

186
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,076
And I also want to see that girl!

187
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,750
Yes! I have already
taken all the necessary steps!

188
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,909
Gordon is going too fast!
His tires are very hot!

189
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:46,900
He's doing his best.

190
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,917
It's not all his fault!

191
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,594
No driver can better
control a Formula 3 ...

192
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,831
- ...when it's first time!
- Wow, it's that much different?

193
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,149
Of course, ma'am! Each category is
completely different from one another.

194
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,830
You see how he is sliding,
that's proof of it.

195
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,860
What's wrong with it?
Why is it moving on it's own?

196
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,154
The machine slides when
the driver is unable to control it.

197
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,589
There is too much
power being sent to...

198
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,750
...the ground and the steering
wheel is feeling the feedback.

199
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,876
He needs better control.

200
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,151
Make up your
mind you hunk of junk.

201
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,155
He hears that the
engine emits strange noises?

202
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,151
He can't stay in control.

203
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,959
This means that he is
driving with the wrong gear!

204
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,270
The engine of the Formula 3 car should ...

205
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,316
...be between the 4000 and the 7000 rpm!

206
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,630
It should not go
either fast or slow!

207
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,673
He looks like an
idiot driving like that.

208
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,957
Though, I still don't understand
what is wrong with Gordon.

209
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,755
Even if he wanted
to do this race ...

210
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,358
- Nice shot!
- ...it won't improve his driving!

211
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,436
I wouldn't be so sure.

212
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,318
Apparently, Gunma
Akagi is learning fast!

213
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,951
I did it!
I did it! I did it!

214
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,994
Finally!
So this is a Formula 3 car!

215
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,438
The driving style!
The most suitable position!

216
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,076
And with the right gear!
The engine screams!

217
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,436
This is so beautiful!

218
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,316
Hey, this is amazing!

219
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,868
And he's only done
three laps on the track!

220
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,553
- Look! He has already
found the right set!
- Extraordinary!

221
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,673
- Sempai!!
- Gunma!

222
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,269
You know, Yasu,
I think this guy ...

223
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,749
...might have potential after all.

224
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,439
Even though Gordon
has had time to improve ...

225
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,670
...he still hasn't
improved his driving style.

226
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,953
But instead Gunma Akagi, after a few laps ...

227
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,076
...has perfect
control over his machine.

228
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,075
It seems that, in his life,
he hasn't ...

229
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,116
...drove like that before.

230
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,516
Now that my
tires have warmed up...

231
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,830
...my speed will increase!
What do you say, Mr. Gordon?

232
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,190
He's accelerating
and wants to overtake Gordon.

233
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,157
He's amazing!

234
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,031
He beat me! !
I've been beaten!

235
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,236
For three years
I've drove these cars ...

236
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,316
...and I've been
beaten by an amateur ...

237
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,516
...who's driving a
formula 3 car for the first time.

238
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,351
I've won!

239
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,940
Now I will make my debut in Formula 3!

240
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,155
It's my time!
No one will ever beat me!

241
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,117
Sempai!

242
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,037
Did you see?
Gunma is a champion now!

243
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,237
You could lose him.

244
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,756
Don't worry, Grandma.

245
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,919
Even if this were to
complicate things between us,

246
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,068
Gunma showed me
that with the will ...

247
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,515
...you can do anything!
I won't give up.

248
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,672
You've become a strong girl!
I'm proud of you!

249
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,838
Yes! I've decided to make
him drive in the next Grand Prix.

250
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:07,599
- I know, but do you think he will do it?
- Of course!

251
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,350
He's good, I wanted to
let you know that. Goodbye.

252
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,030
Yes ... We have completed
the investigation right now.

253
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,157
Okay! Did you find out
what happened to that money?

254
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,317
The money was handed
over to the Kuroi Racing Team, sir.

255
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,670
A Racing Team ?!
Who's the driver?

256
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,837
There are two: Gordon
Turner and Gunma Akagi!

257
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,355
What ?! Gunma Akagi?!

258
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,552
Yuki...

259
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,670
Gunma,
I hope that you win.

260
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,996
Damn you Gunma!

261
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,990
I won't let you
get away with this!

262
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,356
Gunma...

263
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,950
Gunma, everything
will be all right ...

264
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,871
..even if we are separated.

265
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,714
But please,
be careful...

266
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,750
I hope your
dream becomes true!

267
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,272
It's terrible!
The team was attacked!

268
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,237
Kuroi is seriously injured!

269
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,313
- The cars were set on fire ?!
- Who was it? Who the hell was it?

270
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,470
In the next episode:

271
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,357
Just before the F3 Debut Gunma's
Visited by the Black Devil's Hand

272
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,352
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

273
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:28,800
I saw you crying after
you were abandoned

274
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:35,700
Let's climb that hill
and look back down

275
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,800
In the big world it's undeniable

276
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:50,550
Yesterday's pain is
not visible anymore

277
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,050
OK Let's start it

278
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,050
In order to grieve

279
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:02,250
Ah It's as if we weren't born

280
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:15,500
You are my energy, You are my energy

281
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:20,900
Courage come out

282
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:27,200
By just being with you

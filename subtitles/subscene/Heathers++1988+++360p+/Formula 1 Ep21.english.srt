1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:02,670
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,670
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,320
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,320
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,670
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:28,570
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,570
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,870
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,170
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,670
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:51,170
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,420
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:01,920
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:07,420
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,392
I will be able to win without...

16
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,153
...your help.
I don't need it anymore.

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,500
Desert-colored heart?
Gunma Makes His Second Start Alone

18
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,916
Kojima, how much money will
it take to enter Formula 3?

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,434
Let me think ...
The machines are very expensive.

20
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,670
If you aren't covered by a sponsor,

21
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,637
...it will be near impossible!

22
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,110
However, I think this figure
will be enough for at least a year!

23
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,670
- What?! 30 million ?!
- No! You forgot a zero.

24
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,270
- 300 million!
- Eh?! That's just too much.

25
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,756
Sempai, Formula 3 is
reserved only for professionals!

26
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,836
You need to have a sponsor ...

27
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,559
...or become part of a team!

28
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,636
Sempai, isn't your motto,

29
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,836
"I will win no matter the cost"?

30
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,151
The only way to get into
Formula 3 is to always win!

31
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,108
Now concentrate,
you've got to win the remaining races!

32
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,672
Yes, you're right.
Morioka told me the same thing.

33
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,836
I know you can do it.

34
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,516
You'll see that when your famous
you'll be able to get a sponsor!

35
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,916
I'm sure I will win!

36
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,596
I'll make it to the top
and then I'll be the champion!

37
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,677
That's the spirit.

38
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,834
- Aren't you training today?
- Yes!

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,230
Tamotsu...
Is he alright...

40
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,436
- ...without his friends?
- He'll manage.

41
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,677
He knows how to
win the sympathy of everyone.

42
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,837
- Is something wrong?
- I'm alright.

43
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:30,000
It's already been a week!
I wonder how he's doing?

44
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,436
You know what...

45
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,517
You see how he just
hire a new mechanic?

46
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,239
Even though we can do any job...

47
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,914
- he gives us...!
- I don't know where he's from,

48
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,958
but it will be ten years
before he touches that motor!

49
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,350
Well!
Let's go grab a bite!

50
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,391
Hope you can handle it.

51
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,552
- Wash mine too!
- Why me?

52
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,314
Don't complain!
The newcomers...

53
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,150
...always do the washing!

54
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,159
By the way, don't forget
to wash the other stuff!

55
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,356
I see they're making you work,

56
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,030
They are good mechanics,
but it's also their first time in...

57
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,510
- ...Formula 3!
- Don't worry about me,

58
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,556
I can take care of myself.

59
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,429
Gunma, my friend,
what are you doing right now?

60
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,348
I've never seen Gunma so determined!

61
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,908
Though he's probably just brooding.

62
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,555
Since Tamotsu left after his victory.

63
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,234
I can understand how he feels.

64
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,280
Before he could count
on the support of Tamotsu.

65
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,450
He came down the
track calm and relaxed,

66
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,800
and he knew that he
would always be there for him.

67
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,556
Unfortunately, now,
Tamotsu is gone!

68
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,633
You know?
He's just like a mountain climber,

69
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,550
worrying if his rope will break.

70
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,112
Well, this shows that
even Gunma has a heart ...

71
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,873
- ...and also suffers!
- He's not back yet?

72
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,914
No, he's still out.
Even in this rain.

73
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,070
Running like a madman will
do nothing to calm his anger.

74
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,220
He needs confidence, otherwise
he probably won't make it.

75
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,830
Come on, turn off the engine!
Hurry it up!

76
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,033
I think this motor
needs a full overhaul.

77
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,350
- I was thinking the same thing.
- Who's doing it?

78
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,317
Aren't you the chief mechanic?

79
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,356
Yeah, but I don't know how to.

80
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,431
Eh?! And you?

81
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,435
- Then who's gonna do it.
- You know!

82
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,034
None of us are that
experienced, right?

83
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,917
So who will prepare
the car for the next race?

84
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,556
- What are you doing?
- Hey,

85
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,710
Now that you no
longer have bandages,

86
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,950
your nothing but
a guy wearing glasses.

87
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,554
It's true!
And your really short!

88
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,269
Don't you dare change the subject!
The race is coming up soon.

89
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,910
If Tamotsu were here,
he would have already solved the problem.

90
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,398
Well, he left because
he could no longer...

91
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,436
- ...stand Gunma!
- Hey!

92
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,472
There's water?
Where's it coming from?

93
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,748
- I see.
- You need to fix it.

94
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,150
Yeah, but it might be broken.

95
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,589
Excuse me,
who's the expert here?

96
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,831
Now disassemble the
engine and repair the fault!

97
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,758
You know very well
that we can't fix it!

98
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,270
- We aren't experts you know!
- Yeah!

99
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,910
What?! Then who
will prepare my car?

100
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,111
Maybe he can fix it!

101
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,555
- He can't!
- Why not?

102
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,835
Don't you remember
that you said...

103
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,037
that you could win
without the help of Tamotsu?

104
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,918
Morioka will only
help if he wants to,

105
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,195
so don't worry
about the setup.

106
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,880
But that doesn't meant that
you should depend on him.

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,230
You must understand this.

108
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,675
Any other problem
you can do yourself!

109
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,234
Gunma!
It's time to prove your worth!

110
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,108
- Yeah, good luck with that!
- Why don't I show you,

111
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,634
In fact, I bet that you're dying ...

112
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,915
...for me to teach you a lesson!

113
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,072
Come on! Let's get this
done by midnight.

114
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,037
- Eh?!
- If your...

115
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,509
part of the team,
then you'll do it.

116
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,400
I'm not feeling too good today.

117
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,557
I knew it.

118
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,150
I should have known that ...

119
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,231
...you were just a layabout.

120
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,119
Maybe I should send
you to the hospital,

121
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,156
is that what you want?

122
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,674
It would be quite the show.

123
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,955
Why are you saying such things?

124
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,150
We're all trying our best here.

125
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,196
Everyone else is in Formula 3!

126
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,111
I'm the only one left.

127
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,031
They're all laughing at me.

128
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,076
That's why I've gotta win!

129
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,352
Sempai.

130
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,397
Ouch, my head.

131
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,109
What the hell is wrong with you?

132
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,760
You shouldn't walk
around with a wrench!

133
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,752
And who do you think are?!

134
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,834
Look who's talking!
Who do you think you are!

135
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:17,794
- What ?! Allergic to oil?
- Yes! It's your fault!

136
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,757
You did all this!

137
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,109
Look at the suspension!
It's covered with oil.

138
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,077
And the coolant is leaking!

139
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,151
This is quite the mess.

140
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,959
Change the coupling of the
machine or the engine will melt!

141
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,952
The coupling?

142
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,477
It's cracked.

143
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,670
I'm sorry, are you a mechanic?

144
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,030
I see that your not from around here...

145
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,509
...but I'm the best mechanic in the area!

146
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,989
You could say I'm a magician of sorts.

147
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,116
You probably didn't even know of me.

148
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,433
Stop talking!
Can you fix this problem!

149
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,876
Don't be afraid!
I said I was good!

150
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,554
...and everybody around here trusts me!

151
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,560
In fact, I'm probably the best ever.

152
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,595
Oh, my arm is getting all red!

153
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,677
Wow!

154
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,436
I hope your as
good you said.

155
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,671
You obviously aren't doing this for free!
What's your price.

156
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,268
D-Don't you trust me!

157
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,237
I charging you a good price,

158
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,595
you'll be lucky to
even get half price!

159
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,270
- I'm so stressed!
- You better be good!

160
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,550
I've never seen a mechanical like you.

161
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,279
Your not even manly!

162
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,950
Watch your mouth or I'll
take a hammer to your engine!

163
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,996
Calm down, guys!

164
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,277
If you say so!
I replaced the seals.

165
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,880
Now we have to remove
the oil from the piston!

166
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,595
But my arm is covered in red dots!

167
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,833
- I'm ruined!
- Tamotsu, my friend ...

168
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,916
I have a vague feeling that we'll be...

169
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,036
working in
the fields with your mother!

170
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,995
You better do the job right.

171
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,913
- I want it fixed!
- Hey! That's my bike.

172
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,116
Is this clean enough?

173
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,668
I said to remove all the oil!

174
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,551
Here he is.

175
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,272
- Why is he returning?
- He only did three laps!

176
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,997
On home stretch,
at full speed,

177
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,514
the rear wheels
had abnormal vibration.

178
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,517
And when you brake for the
bend, the car swerves.

179
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,394
Strange. I don't know why that happened.

180
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,516
- Maybe something is loose.
- It's possible...

181
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,909
...that one of the brakes were loose.

182
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,077
We'll get this fixed now!

183
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,675
- Tamotsu, get me a wrench!
- Do you want my opinion?

184
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,556
We don't have the time to waste!

185
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,517
Tamotsu, speak up.

186
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,595
You see, the temperature
of the right bearing ...

187
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,557
...is different from the left.

188
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,279
It's likely that the
bearings are not suitable.

189
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,436
We'll need to replace them.

190
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,155
How can you know this?
Anything could be wrong,

191
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,152
There may be a loose screw
or something else may be broken!

192
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,437
Didn't you hear me, we
obviously know what's wrong with it.

193
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,072
If the car skids when
the brake temperature rises,

194
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,277
- that means temperatures are different.
- I know that!

195
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,270
Okay.
Proceed as planned.

196
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,956
Replace those bearings immediately.
Then I'll do a test drive.

197
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,117
Just as I imagined.

198
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,829
It seems that Tamotsu will work
in Formula 3 for at least ten years!

199
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,156
This is great.

200
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,434
You did a great job!
Congratulations!

201
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,476
I didn't do anything fancy!

202
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,196
- What's the time?
- 01:05:02!

203
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,271
Five more seconds to go!

204
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,477
He needs to improve.

205
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,636
It's like the engine is on fire.

206
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,756
That engine has just been serviced,

207
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,037
its performance should be
improved by at least 10%.

208
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,270
If he cannot improve his time,

209
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,476
he can at least get seventh place.

210
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,276
If he keeps going at this rate,

211
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,153
he won't improve,
because time is running out.

212
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,516
If Tamotsu were here
things would better!

213
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,034
- Enough! Stop complaining!
- Right.

214
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,632
What an idiot!

215
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,836
I heard a rumor
that your mechanic has left you.

216
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,151
I hear that he went
and worked for Hiziri.

217
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,118
Well it is hard to refuse Hiziri!

218
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,036
Mind your own business!

219
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,909
You should concentrate on the race!

220
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,672
By the way, you know
what I find very funny?

221
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,075
It's about this guy
that  repaired the car.

222
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,952
He once worked for
a very popular garage,

223
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,315
but one day he was just fired.

224
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,277
And do you know why?

225
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,118
Because there was something wrong with him.

226
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,430
- Wanna know what?
- Does he have, shortcomings?

227
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,436
- What do you mean?
- He's really a great mechanic,

228
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,717
but just don't do
anything to tick him off,

229
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,553
Because he will ruin your engine.
That's not all,

230
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,837
They say he repairs the
machines but they still break,

231
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,115
...after ten laps at full speed.

232
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,031
W-What?

233
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,836
The results were announced.
You start in ninth position.

234
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,153
Well, do your best during the race.

235
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,152
- So, Gunma?
- What is it?

236
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,516
We need to talk about the machine.

237
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,233
It's okay overall,
but there's some problems ...

238
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,676
- when it turns the curve.
- The machine is the same.

239
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,752
Since Tamotsu has left,
and nothing has changed!

240
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,029
That's where you wrong.
It's different.

241
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,354
In my opinion, it's a purely
psychological one, sempai.

242
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,358
What did you say?

243
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,637
Hey, is that a puddle of water?

244
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,915
Another machine probably left it!

245
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,275
I'm not so sure.
Check it now!

246
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,119
That fault from before
has already been fixed!

247
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,873
The engine is a real gem!
It's real quiet.

248
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,673
I saw you drive
during the qualifications.

249
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,758
Your driving isn't aggressive at all!

250
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,633
You looked like a
total pansy out there!

251
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,836
- What did you say?
- The truth!

252
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,350
So you poured the
coolant under his car ...!

253
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,437
Well, you can't drive if you...

254
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,476
...don't trust your mechanic.

255
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,758
Now that Hiziri has moved to
Formula 3 the real champion is me!

256
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,513
On the track you
gotta give it your all!

257
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,190
Anyway I'm done here!
My payment please.

258
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,390
- Eh?!
- Where is it?

259
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,040
You still have to pay me, remember?

260
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,236
Uhm, sure.

261
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,076
- What are you doing?
- Your not getting it yet!

262
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,029
You'll get your money after I
have finished the race safely.

263
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,277
What's the meaning of this?
Don't you trust me?

264
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,039
You shouldn't worry,
your good with ....

265
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,076
engines, aren't you?

266
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,755
Don't you trust me?

267
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,359
Of course I do.
I'll do anything you like.

268
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,550
Don't do anything to tick him off,

269
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,915
Because he will ruin your engine.

270
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,560
But that's not all!
They say he repairs the machines,

271
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,552
...but they still break after 10 laps.

272
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,940
I have to do this! I'll get to
Formula 3 no matter the cost!

273
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,950
I cannot afford to
lose this championship!

274
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,679
Of course I do.
I'll do anything you like.

275
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,030
I'm willing to bet...

276
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,350
that water came
from my radiator.

277
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,756
I'm sure of it.

278
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,670
Oh, Tamotsu, I'm in trouble!

279
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,629
Now that your with Hiziri,

280
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,234
I'm stuck with Konpon to do the repairs...

281
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,276
...and now my mechanic.

282
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,510
Why did you leave, Tamotsu!

283
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,956
I'll make it without you!

284
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,996
I will become the
champion of Formula 3!

285
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,435
Hey! Where are the others?

286
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,950
Where are they?

287
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,277
Hey, the situation is
getting really desperate!

288
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,237
Is there no way out?

289
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,232
- Leave it to me, I have an idea! !
- Eh?!

290
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,836
In the next episode:

291
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,797
Has Tamotsu Returned?
Gunma's Dramatic Change

292
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,077
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

293
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:14,550
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

294
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:20,500
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

295
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:26,800
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

296
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:36,600
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

297
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,500
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

298
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:51,200
These feelings
just flare up

299
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

300
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,200
The fantasy penetrates through you

301
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,400
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

302
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:16,250
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,700
Formula 1 - Engines on The Track

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,600
My heart's continuous signal of love

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,600
It's that way because
I want to embrace you

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,000
And as I waited I
decided to dance slowly

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Both of us could
read each other's lips

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,300
We secretly bathed
in the moonlight

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,100
After the goodbye

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,550
You left without leaving a clue

9
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,800
Don't betray me Darlin'
She passed through the city

10
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,450
Nobody knows Love Affair

11
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,850
Together until the morning

12
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:56,350
Making Love and no more

13
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,950
I felt you when I
touched your hand

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,500
Your a woman

15
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,050
Love Affair

16
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,600
Together until the morning

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,300
Making Love and no more

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,900
Those words of love
that you want to hear

19
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,600
Your a woman

20
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,509
- He's in third place!
- What time did he get?

21
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,477
01:02:08!

22
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,757
Great! He's improved!
He's perfect today!

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,100
Gunma's Winning Everything!
Finally, an Invitation to F-3...

24
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,431
My warmest congratulations!

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,556
It must have been hard for you,

26
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,676
to win on the day of your debut.

27
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,759
Look, what was thing you
couldn't mention on the phone?

28
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,674
Sempai
I will see if everything is alright...

29
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,591
... during the next meeting.

30
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,069
There are still two races
until the end of the Season ...

31
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,516
...and if you win both,
nobody in the world...

32
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,036
...will be able to challenge you
since you've won three races already.

33
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,030
After all, with a combination
 of great drivers I'm sure

34
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,350
the championship 
will be quite the spectacle.

35
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,835
The commission will have
nothing to complain about.

36
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,516
Thank you very much.

37
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,234
I can't understand
why your in a hurry.

38
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,108
They are many people who
would be willing to sponsor

39
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,670
You can get great results
if you have the patience.

40
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,713
Thank you for your advice,
but I prefer to do my own thing.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,560
- Your here too?
- I'm sorry, but I don't have,

42
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,518
time to waste!
Formula 3 is waiting for me!

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,354
I should be like that!
Though I'm pushing my car to the max!

44
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,517
Damn, this isn't fair.

45
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,759
Hooray! He passed mark and is
second with three laps to go!

46
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,550
So, what did he say?

47
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,518
He said it will be
discussed in the next meeting.

48
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,556
I want to change category.

49
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,108
The President,
has placed a condition:

50
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,555
I must win the next two races.

51
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,831
And so everything is
going as you wanted.

52
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,148
Next year you'll race in Formula 1!

53
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,948
Provided that my
illness does not betray me.

54
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,429
But I need to get to
Formula 1 no matter the cost.

55
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,636
Also to prove to myself ...

56
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,678
...that I am up to
the challenge, I must win.

57
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,637
I'm on the last lap now.

58
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,553
I am the fastest and no
one will ever beat me!

59
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,872
- He did it!
- He did it!

60
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,957
Sempai!

61
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,917
- You did it!
- It's the second win in four races!

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,956
If you manage to win the last race,

63
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,235
you will become the
champion in this category!

64
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,869
Yeah, I know!
Now stop fretting!

65
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,390
These are not the
victories that excite me!

66
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,199
I'm sick of this!
These races are for amateurs!

67
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,830
There is no satisfaction,
no one opposes me!

68
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,876
It's too easy to win.

69
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,239
You're right! The fact that
you win easily against amateurs,

70
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,356
means you're a step up!

71
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,030
Who the hell are you?

72
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,680
You know, the automobile
world does not end here!

73
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,872
This category, after all,
is only a stepping stone.

74
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,957
What do you say, Gunma Akagi,

75
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,429
Are you ready for Formula 3?

76
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,748
Are you ready for Formula 3?

77
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,435
What kind of question is that?

78
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,108
Of course I will
compete in Formula 3!

79
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,674
Well then, here's my business card.

80
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,196
"Kuroi Racing Team"!

81
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,196
The name "Kuroi" is a guarantee!

82
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,914
I choose you because
your car goes fast!

83
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,435
I have a very close-knit team.

84
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,750
Join me an you'll go places.

85
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,031
You are an exceptional driver,

86
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,429
I know that you
are up to the challenge.

87
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,558
For this reason I've
decided to become your sponsor.

88
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,400
Somethings going on here.

89
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,631
I'll give you a couple
of days to think about it.

90
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,549
I expect you to call soon.

91
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,193
What luck! This is his first
big opportunity to shine!

92
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,710
I can't believe it!
It's like a dream!

93
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,030
Exactly, sounds a little fishy.

94
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,270
We just need to wait and see.

95
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,836
Why do you guys always
see the negative side of things?

96
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,911
Gunma is good, his car too...

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,956
...it's about time someone noticed him.

98
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,076
Wait a second, if he accepted this job,

99
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,072
he would be forced to
become part of a team.

100
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,079
Don't think about it too much.
We'll find another way.

101
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,957
I know this Kuroi.

102
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,634
In the past he had the
nickname "Terror of the tracks."

103
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,358
Eh?!

104
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,949
You may not know it,
but it's been several years since then.

105
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,551
I remember very well that
every race was a spectacle!

106
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,756
He was a reckless driver!

107
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,348
But he always managed to keep calm.

108
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,830
I don't want to be a buzz killer,

109
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,275
- but is your opinion true?
- Maybe.

110
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,949
I must admit that he
always was a honest driver.

111
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,037
Don't take him lightly.

112
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,236
He sounds like a legend,

113
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,834
- but he seems suspicious!
- I agree!

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,753
We should give him a pass,
since we can always...

115
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,717
...find another sponsor.

116
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,870
No!
It's my decision.

117
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,755
Think this through, Gunma.

118
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,998
You can't stop me?
In the end, it's my decision,

119
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,958
- don't you get that!
- How can you act like this!

120
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,634
He's right!
We care about your future ...

121
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,518
- and you should trust us!
- Don't you understand!

122
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,194
He told me that
I had great talent.

123
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,755
And that I was a great driver.

124
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,672
Looks like I'll take up his offer.

125
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,677
I'd be a fool to refuse!

126
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,550
I need to get to
Formula 3 no matter what.

127
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,593
I can't wait any longer, I should take
up his offer while I still can.

128
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,279
I absolutely want to race
in Formula 3 with Tamotsu!

129
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,915
Hey, are you ready?

130
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,359
Come on, let's go
celebrate my victory!

131
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,431
I want it to
be a memorable evening!

132
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,435
Hey, but Gunma!

133
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,269
Excuse me!
Sempai!

134
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,677
What an idiot!
Who is he kidding.

135
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,712
Tell me, Junko,
what do you think?

136
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,349
- About what?
- About Gunma of course!

137
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,908
He's moving away from us all...

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,956
...and we'll see him less.

139
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,156
He'll become like Ryuji!

140
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,750
What do you think, Junko?

141
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,473
I doesn't matter what I think.
It's his life...

142
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,836
...and he must seize the opportunity.

143
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,278
But you're hurting!
I can feel it!

144
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,955
Don't suffer like this.

145
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,156
Junko!

146
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,076
Just a moment!
You're forgetting the bags!

147
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,789
They contain your suits,
clothes and linen.

148
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,916
Less luggage I have, the better!

149
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,753
In the end,
I won't be gone forever.

150
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,233
Yes, but you're
going away for ten days.

151
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,834
Go now or you'll be late for work.

152
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,036
I asked for a day off.

153
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,272
Well ... since the
tests are starting today,

154
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,109
I'll come too, if you allow it.

155
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,670
I don't need dead weight, and I
mean you and the suitcases.

156
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,268
But I would like to be with you.

157
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,596
I promise I won't
give you any trouble.

158
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,636
Please let me come with you!

159
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,269
Oh, Junko...
I love you!

160
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,476
Wake up, it's time!

161
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,759
Damn, you woke
me up at the climax.

162
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,598
Come on,
the fateful day has arrived!

163
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,280
- Goodbye, I'll see you soon!
- Bye!

164
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,433
Oh, what luck!
I arrived just in time!

165
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,437
Why are you here?

166
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,591
Well, take this.

167
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,750
Consider it a liquidation.

168
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,915
Thank you, Morioka. I feel
sorry leaving, you'll be helpless

169
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,753
Don't mention it.
You should concentrate..

170
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,354
...on winning!
I wish you good luck.

171
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,910
- On becoming a professional!
- I'll make it!

172
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,754
Until yesterday you
were just an amateur,

173
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,796
but now everything will change.

174
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,118
You must not ever give up!
You have to keep winning ...

175
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,873
...and show everyone
your talent and skills,

176
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,355
Otherwise throw in the towel.

177
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,029
There's no going back now.

178
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,357
I got it.

179
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,357
Sempai!

180
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,757
Hi, did I make you wait?

181
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,956
Let's start the introductions.

182
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,349
This guy is an excellent driver.

183
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,431
His name is Gunma Akgai.

184
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,919
This is Gordon Turner,
the first pilot of our team

185
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,156
Hi there, my name's Gordon.

186
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,397
It's my pleasure!

187
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,470
What car is that?

188
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,280
A twenty year old Formula 1 car.

189
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,955
An old Formula 1 car?!
But then ...

190
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,917
Is that the car
which I will be racing with?

191
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,877
You got that right.

192
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,360
- What are you doing?
- Sempai!

193
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,037
What is this all about?

194
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,435
I didn't say you would be using it.

195
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,557
In this way you will experience
first hand the acceleration,

196
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,552
and deceleration and
as you go round a curve.

197
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,598
- This is necessary for racing
in Formula 1! - What?!

198
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,675
And just to let you know this car's...

199
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,833
speed varies from 300 kilometers
per hour to about 70 miles.

200
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,150
I assure you that
you will have the feeling ...

201
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,117
...of having your eyes removed.

202
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,749
Then your gut will
come up to you're throat.

203
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,434
Then you'll really want to drive!

204
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,956
Well, let's go!

205
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,270
Damn it!
I can't breathe!

206
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,229
We'll be turning to the right next...

207
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,949
We are on a straight line.
Let's go over 300 km/h!

208
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,959
My back is breaking!
I can feel it cracking!

209
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,600
Here we go! Deceleration!

210
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,957
I can't take it.

211
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,554
Excuse me, are you Gunma's girl?

212
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,234
Ah!
We're just good friends ...

213
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,436
...because we stay in the same building.

214
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,677
I don't see any difference!

215
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,595
Tell me, is he serious about...

216
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,194
-  becoming a great pilot?
- Of course!

217
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,357
Gunma really wants to
go to Formula 1!

218
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,271
Heading to Formula 1...!
He'll need some luck!

219
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,598
It would be wise
to take my advice.

220
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,916
You'll see when he comes off that car...

221
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,594
...that he'll be knocked out...

222
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,952
Well, he will recover,
but it will take time,

223
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,833
because believe me he'll
lost confidence in himself ...

224
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,435
...and never want to race again!
From then on he'll...

225
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,670
...need you to help
and encourage him.

226
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,753
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Miss?

227
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,517
In a nutshell, he'll probably
tell you he's going to quit,

228
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,750
and you should just let him quit.

229
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,998
You see, in Formula 3,
there are plenty of guys ...

230
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,036
...who believe they're good drivers...

231
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,237
...because they're friends
keep thinking they are.

232
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,511
Right, Gordon?

233
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,279
You know very well that every driver,
has their limits.

234
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,153
Changing category is not a joke!

235
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,750
If he leaves now he might
still leave with some pride.

236
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,673
A driver must have
the will to make it.

237
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,030
That is why it is
dangerous to let him believe ...

238
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,076
...that he's an excellent driver.

239
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,948
You understand? In this
sport, any error, is fatal!

240
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,671
Stay awake, boy?

241
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,036
Well! This is the last round!

242
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,597
It may seem despicable,

243
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,069
but I suggested to
Kuroi to use this method.

244
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,670
Twenty years ago, his dream
of going to Formula 1 was stalled.

245
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,836
Though he was a smart driver.

246
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,071
He is the best person to
tell us if your friend has talent!

247
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,351
Tell me, what will you do if
Gunma doesn't want want to quit?

248
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,675
This "method", as you called it,

249
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,678
may be torture but
it will make him better.

250
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,549
I can assure you
he will not give up.

251
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,870
What a temper! It's rare
to meet a girl so strong!

252
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,556
Yasu, you can untie him now.

253
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,277
- Gunma!
- Sempai!

254
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,271
Nothings wrong, calm down.

255
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,197
If I had really gone to
300 he would be dead.

256
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,756
I just tried to scare him,

257
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,671
by driving at a high speed.

258
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,437
This is amazing!
So far he's the only guy...

259
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,239
- ...to not get knocked out!
- What?

260
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,392
What were you
trying to do, kill me!

261
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,436
Stop it!
What's wrong with you?

262
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,349
- S-Sempai!
- Gunma!

263
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,957
Say what?! In Formula 3?!

264
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,713
Where did you find the money?
Tell me...

265
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,356
Well, I found a great sponsor.

266
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,277
Someone finally realized my talent.

267
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,031
I don't need you anymore.

268
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,156
I found a way
without your help!

269
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,277
- I'll soon be in Formula 1!
- Gunma.

270
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,430
- Oh!
- Gunma, what's wrong? Gunma!

271
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,589
Just where is sempai going?

272
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,831
Leave him alone! Some fresh
air may do him good.

273
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,753
He needs some
after a day like this.

274
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Ah, what are you doing?

275
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,116
Is there something wrong sir?

276
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,431
No, the line was just cut.
Though I'm short on cash.

277
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,636
- What's wrong?
- Hiziri!

278
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,678
Gunma just told me
he's going to Formula 3!

279
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,673
But he didn't have time
to go into the details.

280
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,429
Well then, do you regret
joining me now?

281
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,109
Absolutely not!

282
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,513
By the way, do me a favor
and study these carefully.

283
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,436
They are new engine schematics.

284
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,038
- They gave you a new car?
- Yes! And next year ...

285
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,588
...I'll change category.
I'll still need your help.

286
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,312
Hiziri!
I hope...

287
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,551
...you don't let your illness
stop you from winning.

288
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,756
- A challenge ?!
- That's right Gunma...

289
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,990
...and if you win
you'll be in the next race.

290
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,594
It will be your first Formula
3 race, isn't it a bit early?

291
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,148
You shouldn't underestimate me!

292
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,071
In the next episode:

293
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,957
The Vicious Horse Rides an F-3

294
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,634
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

295
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:29,100
I saw you crying after
you were abandoned

296
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:36,000
Let's climb that hill
and look back down

297
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,100
In the big world it's undeniable

298
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:50,850
Yesterday's pain is
not visible anymore

299
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,350
OK Let's start it

300
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,350
In order to grieve

301
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:02,550
Ah It's as if we weren't born

302
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:15,800
You are my energy, You are my energy

303
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:21,200
Courage come out

304
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,500
By just being with you

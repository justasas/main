1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,150
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,150
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,500
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,700
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,000
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,000
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,250
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,750
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,250
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,314
Thank you, and
I'm sorry for troubling you.

16
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,952
Your very kind.

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,953
Your always asking
favors from others...

18
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,110
Does he mean that much to you?

19
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,151
I don't care about the guy...

20
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,152
...but his car.

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,650
Gunma's in a Pinch!
Rival Hiziri Approaches Tamotsu

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,756
Can the next patient enter.

23
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,436
Sit down on the couch.

24
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,036
Stay still.

25
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,636
It's a radiograph.

26
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,431
Your bone hasn't cracked.

27
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,756
Thank God!
Though it would be fun ...

28
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,149
...if I got treatment from that cute doctor.

29
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,478
MORIOKA MOTORS

30
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,594
What?
He injured his left foot?!

31
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,677
So did he participate?

32
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,109
Well since his
left foot was unusable,

33
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,510
he had to use his right!
And that's not all!

34
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,913
Are you saying that he threw ...

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,276
...a shoe at Haitani
during the race?

36
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,278
Yeah!
Unfortunately theres more, Morioka!

37
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,551
When he was in the pits,
he started fighting with Haitani!

38
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,269
We had to call the
police to separate them.

39
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,394
So, what was the verdict?
There...

40
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,438
Must have been
some kind of punishment.

41
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,078
In fact, they should
have revoked their license's,

42
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,550
but they were saved by
the intervention of another rider!

43
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,911
It may seem unbelievable,
but it's true!

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,150
The pilot was the
great champion Hiziri!

45
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,071
Hiziri? I know him.

46
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,355
He won the championship twice in a row.

47
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,396
His father is a  doctor!

48
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,592
That was kind of him.
Otherwise it would have ended badly.

49
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,394
Now Gunma won't lose his license.

50
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,436
He has the skill to do it.

51
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,152
However, the jury haven't
announced their decisions.

52
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,677
Hiziri is a kid at heart.

53
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,196
- Is Gunma his friend?
- No, not yet,

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,271
though I hope they will be.

55
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,513
I wonder why Gunma acted that way.

56
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,953
- I wish I knew!
- Hey, hey , Tamotsu.

57
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,156
You didn't do anything wrong.

58
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,835
Thanks for letting me work with you.

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,639
You've even helped out a lot,
even with Gunma.

60
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,518
Instead of being grateful
he just causes trouble!

61
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,160
I just hope he doesn't
create anymore trouble.

62
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,438
I know you two have a lot of talent.

63
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,589
But Gunma can't keep causing trouble.

64
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,037
Don't you agree, Tamotsu?

65
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,597
He must change!

66
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,276
And there's more problems.

67
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,909
To stay in this sport
you will need a lot of money.

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,036
More money than what you have.

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,992
In any case, Tamotsu,
take my advice ...

70
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,753
...and try to keep Gunma under control.

71
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,597
It's absolutely critical
that a mechanic and pilot ...

72
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,671
...get along well.

73
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,275
- What did she say?
- She said the swelling ...

74
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,954
...will decrease in a
few days if it heals right.

75
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,751
Are you alright?

76
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,030
Do you mind if I lean on you?

77
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,395
I'm still not used to the crutches.

78
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,758
Okay!

79
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,675
- No!
- Serves you right!

80
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,196
Just leave me alone!

81
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,830
Hey, wait!
Stop, Junko!

82
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,277
Come on, Junko!

83
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,193
- You can't leave me like this.
- You can walk on your own!

84
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,076
Oh, don't do this.

85
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,630
Hey, what about a...

86
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,676
...walk on the beach?
Alright.

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,117
Don't even think about it!
I've no time to lose!

88
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,316
I only came because
Grandma asked me to,

89
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,436
She had to ask me to come.

90
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,115
Now get back to work!
You can't let Tamotsu do it all.

91
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,596
As usual! You just let
everyone else do all the work,

92
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,433
while you do nothing!
Goodbye!

93
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,551
Wow, what bad luck!
I wonder if she's okay!

94
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,357
Hey, Gunma!

95
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,676
Hey, Kishida!

96
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,275
I was worried about your foot.

97
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,316
I rang and they told me you were here.

98
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,233
Fortunately the bone wasn't broken,
I'll get well soon!

99
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,917
- Yeah!
- But you can't participate ...

100
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,355
...in next weeks race.

101
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,796
A toast to your speedy recovery!

102
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,190
I'm so sorry that you
can't participate in the race!

103
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,914
How was I supposed to know!
Why didn't you tell me?

104
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,754
- Damn!
- Let go of me! I'm suffocating!

105
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,398
Well, after thinking for a while,

106
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,597
I decide to enroll
and take part in the race!

107
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,236
They say that in this competition ...

108
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,357
...the two champions
Hiziri and Haitani will participate!

109
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,158
What?

110
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,352
Alright!

111
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,350
- That's means I have to race too!
- What?!

112
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,995
But to enter I'll need money.

113
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,230
What about lending me some money?

114
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,117
Well ... Actually ...

115
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,156
If you don't
lend me money then...

116
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,196
...I'll race in your place, Kishida!
Right?

117
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,516
But you can't!

118
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,948
If you want the loan,
you gotta be ready,

119
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,433
Though you won't be able to drive with that foot!

120
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,437
Don't worry about it,

121
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,795
I'll be in perfect shape for the race.

122
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,075
- I'm sure I will!
- Well...

123
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,628
Even if I'm not
healed in time I'll...

124
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,950
- ...just use my right foot!
- Right!

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,275
Hit the break!

126
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,758
- What are they crazy!

127
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,275
- Are you alright?
- Idiot!

128
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,438
Hey wait...
Isn't that Haitani's car!

129
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,916
Sempai!

130
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,557
It's him.

131
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,236
What the?

132
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,437
The two of us have
a matter to settle.

133
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,273
Sorry, but today I'm in a hurry.

134
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,756
I don't have time for you and I have to...

135
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,791
...get ready for the race!

136
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,996
You will not win,

137
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,117
the same thing applies to your friend Hiziri.

138
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,156
- What?!
- Listen to me, you two have...

139
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,198
...no chance of winning.
I'm the best...

140
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,669
...and no one can beat me!
You got that, Haitani?

141
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,189
But you already know that.

142
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,190
Listen kid, on the track
your words mean nothing.

143
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,550
Real drivers don't brag.

144
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,316
- You idiot!
- By the way ...

145
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,914
If the jury decides
to withdraw your license,

146
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,355
You can say goodbye
to your career as a driver.

147
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,400
Don't complain,
you asked for it!

148
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,757
See you later.

149
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,357
I can't stand him.

150
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,273
Damn you!
Now you've really done it.

151
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,392
- I'm home!
- You're finally here!

152
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,358
This poor guy's
been waiting for hours.

153
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,749
- Hello!
- Hiziri?!

154
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,789
Gunma still hasn't
returned from the hospital!

155
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,429
This gentleman told me
what happened in the race.

156
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,357
right...

157
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,034
Just where is that crazy Gunma?

158
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,831
By the way,
Gunma will have to write a letter!

159
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,275
- What?!
- Yes, that's right!

160
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,630
Hiziri was very kind.
He intervened...

161
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,029
..with the Commission
and achieved the impossible!

162
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,839
In short, he managed to
convince them that Gunma was sorry.

163
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,912
But it is necessary that he
has to write a letter of apology?

164
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,350
Is it that serious?

165
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,199
Even though I intervened.

166
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,509
Gunma will still
have to write a letter,

167
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,591
then the commission will be happy.

168
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,836
I don't know how to thank you!

169
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,036
Guys, I'm home!

170
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,948
It's about time Gunma!
What took you so long?

171
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,196
Hiziri has been waiting all afternoon.

172
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,157
What!? Hiziri?

173
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,431
LETTER OF APOLOGY

174
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,198
What are you waiting for?
You've got write that letter.

175
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,953
Come on, write!
Don't be stubborn.

176
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,000
...I went out of my way to help you,

177
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,757
If I didn't,
you would have lost your license.

178
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,752
...and then you wouldn't
be able to race anymore!

179
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,951
Not only here, but all over the country!

180
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,629
Has Haitani also written a letter?

181
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,314
Because if he hasn't,
then I don't...

182
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,356
..see the point in me writing one!

183
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,436
Do you want to end your career!

184
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,117
It's true, that Haitani is also to blame,

185
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,077
-  but you started it.
- That's not true!

186
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,754
He threw the first punch!
Just ask him!

187
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,440
Don't you remember he
pushed me against the rails!

188
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,393
I wasn't the one looking for a fight!

189
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,311
He's responsible!

190
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,356
He tried to force me off the track!

191
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,829
It's easy to see why he did it,

192
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,275
he couldn't tolerate that I was faster!

193
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,753
Why should I have to write a letter?

194
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,429
Alright.
Haitani will also write a letter!

195
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,750
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

196
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,356
Fine.
Then go and tell him the good news.

197
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,396
You'll find him in bed!

198
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,316
What did you do?
Gunma!

199
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,109
I don't think he's recovered
from the blow I gave him!

200
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,117
He's swollen like a ball!

201
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,078
Me and him had
a slight problem.

202
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,076
- What did you do?
- I had a problem.

203
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,948
Hiziri, why did you help me out?

204
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,038
Why did you poke your
head into other peoples business?

205
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,277
Unless you want something.

206
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,555
Tell me what it is.

207
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,677
Let me guess.
You probably realized that...

208
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,751
...I am such a skilled driver!

209
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,354
A driver like me is only born...

210
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,556
...once in a hundred years!

211
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:50,119
Yes, I'm sure that's why.

212
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,555
Are you trying to be my
friend so ...

213
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,676
...you can learn my secrets.

214
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,958
You'll be applauding me
when I become the champion.

215
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,750
Your right about that.

216
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,520
I knew it!
I'll write the letter now.

217
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,318
SINCERELY GUNMA AKAGI

218
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,156
There you go!

219
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,437
Perfect!
I'll send it right away.

220
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,158
Listen, Hiziri ...

221
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,236
I'll give you a
preview of the news:

222
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,788
witness my triumph in the race ...

223
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,440
- ...in two weeks.
- What are you saying, Gunma?

224
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,438
Didn't you hear me Tamotsu.

225
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,517
I will be racing.

226
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,477
Are you crazy, Gunma?

227
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,709
Don't you understand,
you're still injured!

228
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,836
And where will you get the money?

229
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,389
You're not getting my savings!

230
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,233
No! Kishida was the one
who gave me money!

231
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,912
How?
Anyway your not ready...

232
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,150
..for the race!
You need to train,

233
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,437
many hours more!
You won't be able...

234
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,511
...to train because of your foot.

235
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,670
Cut me some slack!

236
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,636
Grandma, I'm hungry,

237
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,154
Make me some food.
Now!

238
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,674
Why are you in such a hurry?

239
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,916
What?
I'm not!

240
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,956
Because of your stupid speeches,

241
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,996
I always eat late.

242
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,197
Thanks again for everything.

243
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,277
I'm sorry for Gunma behaving rude,

244
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,476
I don't know how to apologize.

245
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,912
- But nothing serious happened!
- But he ...

246
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,516
- I saw your car!
- Eh?!

247
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,836
The one you prepared for Gunma.

248
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,640
I was very interested in it.

249
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,676
During the race I saw ...

250
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,149
...how his car was as equal as mine.

251
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,840
You must be a genius ...

252
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,071
- ...with cars.
- I'm actually a beginner.

253
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,951
Why don't the two of use become friends?

254
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,471
See you soon, Tamotsu!

255
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,350
I just knew it.

256
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,589
Where is Gunma?

257
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,108
Maybe he went for a checkup at the hospital?

258
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,837
Whether or not he's racing,
you have to talk to him!

259
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,751
You have ten days to do so.

260
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,796
He will only listen to you!

261
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,437
Yes, this is Morioka.

262
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,756
Sure, he's right here.

263
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,474
- It's Hiziri, he wants to talk.

264
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,594
I wanted to tell
you that I sent the letter.

265
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,916
I've done my part.

266
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,956
There should be no problems.

267
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,557
Thank you very much!

268
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,558
I'll tell you one thing that might surprise you:

269
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,120
in a couple of days somethings coming from Europe.

270
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,077
... a brand new car.

271
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,670
I want you personally to set it up.

272
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,836
You really want me.

273
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,233
I hope you agree...

274
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,278
...otherwise you won't get to drive it.

275
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,277
In short, I want you,

276
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,316
...because you have talent.

277
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,470
You should...

278
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,275
because you'll develop even more skills.

279
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,917
You should seize this opportunity.

280
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,356
Call me soon.

281
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,597
I'll be waiting.

282
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,277
- What is it? Bad news?
- No, no, it's nothing.

283
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,676
That's okay then.

284
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,236
- It was a blonde?
- What are you thinking, Rita?

285
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,595
- I got you!
- I was just kidding!

286
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,269
So you spoke with Gunma's mechanic then?

287
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,755
He may be...

288
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,798
just like everybody else.

289
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,876
No, not this time.

290
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,355
This one really knows his engines.

291
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,274
- He really is the bomb!
- Wow, a real champion!

292
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,916
Damn!
I am the fastest!

293
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,150
No one will ever beat me!

294
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,355
You know those giant
tires on the F1 cars?

295
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,596
They only last for around 300 miles.

296
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,910
They are used once per race.
They are disposable!!

297
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,036
In the next episode:

298
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,997
"The Storm of Tsukuba Circuit, Another Genius Appears".

299
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,913
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

300
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,550
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

301
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:19,500
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

302
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,800
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

303
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:35,600
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

304
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,500
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

305
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,200
These feelings
just flare up

306
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

307
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,200
The fantasy penetrates through you

308
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

309
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:15,250
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

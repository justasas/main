1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,150
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,150
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,500
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,700
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,000
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,000
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,250
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,750
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,250
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,629
Please, make sure
he passes the test!

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,756
Gunma is unstable!
They will throw him out!

17
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,117
He can only get a license if,

18
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,156
you help him.
You have to!

19
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,357
I'm not sure about this.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,956
Please, Junko!
You've gotta help.

21
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,550
Don't worry.
I'll help you.

22
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,400
Junko's Private Lesson!
Now I've got my license

23
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,077
Wake up, Tamotsu!
You snooze you lose!

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,709
Why are you waking
me up at this time, Gunma?

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,312
Must you ask?
We're working out. Come on!

26
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,437
Come on! We've got the power, Gunma!

27
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,755
Sure! We're athletes after all!

28
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,229
We've got to keep in
shape in case we need to run.

29
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,951
I admire you, Gunma,
but you still have a way to go!

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,151
- And what's that?
- There are quizzes in driving school.

31
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,152
Now answer yes or
no to a few questions!

32
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,756
Stop with the bullshit!

33
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,589
To get a driving license,
first of all,

34
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,069
-  you need to pass a written exam!
- I know!

35
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,555
First question: "You
have a date with a girl...

36
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
...but your late.
On the way, you,

37
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,236
run into a series of red lights.

38
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,197
Do you drive through it?

39
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,549
- Of course!
- Be serious for once!

40
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,631
You know that you
stop at a red light!

41
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,473
You'll never get a
drivers license at this rate!

42
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,234
So sorry, friend, but when there's a girl involved...

43
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,515
...nothing can stop me!

44
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,636
Moving onto the second question:

45
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,189
"You are progressing
at a moderate pace ...

46
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,236
... attempt to overtake a car.

47
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,595
What do you let it pass?

48
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,955
Absolutely not!
No one can surpass me!

49
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,475
Third question:
"On the way ...

50
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,437
...you come near a bump.

51
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,751
The visibility is very poor, what
do you do? Slow down or not? "

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,548
I pass over the
bump since it's fun!

53
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,950
Fourth question: "There a
traffic jam in an intersection ...

54
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,235
not regulated by traffic lights.
In this case ...

55
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,436
do you comply with the rules?!"

56
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,956
Of course not!
No car will pass me!

57
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,994
Fifth question: "Do you
fall asleep, or keep driving?"

58
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,957
Fall asleep at the wheel!

59
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,396
Sixth question: "You are near a walkway.

60
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,836
There are pedestrians,
do you stop and let them cross?"

61
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,480
But in this case,
the pedestrian is ...

62
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,630
- ... a girl in a miniskirt!
- Stop!

63
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,991
- You'll stop?
- Am I wrong or do pedestrians...

64
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,036
...always go first?

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,039
You said stop! You stopped!
Finally you stopped!

66
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,357
- Was my answer funny?

67
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,514
You two sure are up early!

68
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,750
- Hello!
- Hello! , Junko!

69
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,954
- Hello, Tamotsu!
- Good Morning! Wait, Junko!

70
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,232
- About that matter yesterday evening ...
- Tamotsu, what are you doing? Come on!

71
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,356
Tamotsu!

72
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,553
I am not a magician
with engines, Gunma is!

73
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,432
He's the real genius!
And you have to help him!

74
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,916
What was that about?!

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,675
- Was he just saying hello?
- Junko, what was he talking about?

76
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,591
Nothing important.

77
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,349
You know, Tamotsu,
I want to do the exam today!

78
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,317
What?! This is madness!

79
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,356
You don't even
know the traffic rules!

80
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,954
Stop it!
You know that I have no time to lose!

81
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,476
Do not rush!

82
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,279
- I don't think it's worth it.
- What?!

83
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,436
- Please, Junko!
- Look, if you want I can give you ...

84
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,592
...driving lessons in the afternoon
It's my day off.

85
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,030
Junko, thank you!

86
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,834
Can't you at least thank her?

87
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,069
To be honest,
I'm doing it out of pity!

88
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,156
Tamotsu knows this,
so I promised to help.

89
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,671
I'll be in my room.

90
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,596
What was that?

91
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,556
This is wonderful!

92
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,154
It's so different from our room!

93
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,869
You can tell right
away that it's a girls room!

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,956
Please, sit down.

95
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,955
- Where are you two going?
- Get your hands off me!

96
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,679
If you hope to have her
all for yourself, you're wrong!

97
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,716
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,956
Have you already forgotten ...

99
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,190
...that me and you are studying together,?

100
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,396
Well, I've changed my mind!

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,956
- I think I know why!
- What?!

102
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,839
I'm sure you will take
advantage of the driving lessons ...

103
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,797
...and try to grope her.

104
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,074
How can you say that?
Did I look like a ...

105
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,230
- ...someone who would do that?
- Of course!

106
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,519
Well, anyway, that's enough,
Your annoying me!

107
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,356
So, Junko ...

108
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,753
Let's work as two good friends.

109
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,196
<i>Okay...</i>

110
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,636
Don't touch me!

111
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,799
Why are you looking
at me like that?

112
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,916
You're so cute!

113
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,037
Listen, before starting
our first lesson,

114
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,436
I would like to
clarify one thing:

115
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,279
I am nothing like you!

116
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,036
Remember it well!

117
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,756
You've got a strong character.
I like that.

118
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,357
Look! Up there?

119
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,151
There's nothing to worry about.

120
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,117
If Gunma had that in mind

121
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,430
he would lose he teeth.

122
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,080
Junko is tough, you know?

123
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,754
I get the impression
that he wants to, but...

124
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,677
Read the second part.

125
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,354
So: "Parking is prohibited in
the vicinity of curves or bumps."

126
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,268
Enough!
I've got a headache!

127
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,755
Let's do something
more fun, please.

128
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,717
Just keep reading!

129
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,753
Look here,
what does this mean?

130
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,276
Come on, do it like me!

131
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,949
- Do as I told you!
- Alright!

132
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,548
- Now don't move!
- What kind of game is this?

133
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,517
You'll see!

134
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,153
- No! No!
- Well, lets resume!

135
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,834
Hey, wait!
This is most unorthodox!

136
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,037
So ... "Parking is prohibited
in the following cases:

137
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,430
- When you are in the vicinity
of curves or bumps... - Well...

138
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,151
Good evening!

139
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,191
Hi, Tamotsu!
Did you finish the repairs?

140
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,716
Yes! And I did a general
overhaul of the engine.

141
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,995
You can test
drive it if you like.

142
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,348
Fantastic!
It's just like new!

143
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,671
You're great, Tamotsu!
By the way, where is Junko?

144
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,437
Junko... Uhm...
I don't know where she is!

145
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,796
What?! Are you saying that
she spent the whole afternoon ...

146
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,269
...studying with that guy!?

147
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,631
I bet she wasted her time!

148
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,552
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

149
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,958
Why didn't you stop them?

150
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,436
What are you looking at?

151
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,591
Isn't this enough?

152
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,953
- Gunma...
- Priority must be given ...

153
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,953
to those that come from the right.

154
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,354
Okay! You've learned that!
And now onto the practical test.

155
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,631
Let's move!

156
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,359
This lesson is important so don't fail!

157
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,835
I want to make sure
that the engine is working.

158
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,074
- Please, can I come too!
- Theres no room.

159
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,599
Oh, no!

160
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,275
Now reverse, turn
left and then right.

161
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,591
Now consider you
options very carefully!

162
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,310
Before leaving,
you should always look ...

163
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,630
in the rear view
and side mirror.

164
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,790
Then you can turn safely.

165
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,996
To turn left you
have to get closer ...

166
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,991
...to the middle of the road.

167
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,071
Now, to turn right, keep ...

168
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,948
Who told you to do that?

169
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,036
It's time, guys!

170
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,477
Where are they going?

171
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,871
- Stop right there!
- It's time to have fun!

172
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,428
I'd had enough of
all this useless chatter!

173
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,154
You're a fool!
That is not the way we do it ...

174
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,276
- ...in driving school! !
- Watch out!

175
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,278
I have to turn right, right?

176
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,314
You could have killed him!
Do something, you two!

177
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,955
What's with all the screaming?
I haven't done anything.

178
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,949
Stop! I told you to stop!

179
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,514
Hey, look over there!
It's suicidal ...

180
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,556
... to drive in this traffic!

181
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,280
Watch out! There is a huge truck!

182
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,753
I have to turn left, right?

183
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,435
Left or right?
Left or right?

184
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,359
These three are
knocked out cold!

185
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,836
Don't try that again!

186
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,157
- How you doing, Gunma?
- Not bad!

187
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,595
Grandma, to do these exams you need,

188
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,671
to have lots of luck!

189
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,276
Is that all?

190
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,637
Grandma just copied
Gunma and got it all wrong!

191
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,118
- That's funny!
-Oh, poor me!

192
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,156
I'll never have enough luck!

193
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,229
Gunma's finally ready!
Do you think he'll pass the exam?

194
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,189
He'll have no problem passing it!

195
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,238
- I hope everything goes well!
- Of course it will!

196
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,153
He can't fail again!

197
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,156
Gunma is late today.

198
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,957
Maybe he went home.

199
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,039
I told you he wouldn't show!

200
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,997
I won the bet.

201
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,036
We've got to see if he comes first!

202
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,473
Stop this you guys!

203
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,350
Is this the car that
Gunma spent all that money on?

204
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,229
- Does the engine work?
- Of course it works!

205
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,471
Obviously it's a used engine,
but it's great,

206
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,437
almost good as new.

207
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,914
Have you got news
about Gunma's exam?

208
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,195
- Not yet.
- He's still not here?!

209
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,357
It's already four!

210
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,676
Stay calm,
he'll be here...

211
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,672
...it's not like he
jumped off a bridge!

212
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,956
Were you talking about me?

213
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,517
Gunma!

214
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,629
How come it took you so long?

215
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,676
We were all worried about you!

216
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,276
Sorry, I was tired.

217
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,629
I've never seen him so down.
I don't think he passed.

218
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,952
I wonder how Gunma did?
He looks sad, maybe he failed!

219
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,108
I'm think I lost the bet!

220
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,196
That's my lunch.

221
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,431
So, don't keep us in suspense!
How was the exam?

222
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,196
Tamotsu, you see, I ...

223
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,158
Excuse me.

224
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,796
Ready? Yes, I'm Martin.
Hello, Mr. Jordan!

225
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,350
Yes! I understand perfectly.
That's fine. I understand!

226
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,596
We'll take the car tomorrow!

227
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,757
Gunma!

228
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,350
Here! My dream!

229
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,833
I have a mad desire to
hear the song of your engine.

230
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,438
Tamotsu! Could you
turn it on, please?

231
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,558
Certainly.
But tell me, how as the exam?

232
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,872
Perhaps it is best to humor him.
We all know,

233
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,757
- how it went.
- Yes, but...

234
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,308
If he gets angry
all hell will break loose!

235
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,312
Maybe he's just trying to be brave.

236
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,752
Excuse me.

237
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,596
You've failed, didn't you, Gunma?

238
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,070
And this is the gear shift, right?

239
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,559
Tell me, what's wrong with you?

240
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,956
Its a melancholy roar!

241
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,358
I don't understand this strange behavior.

242
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,756
I lost the bet!

243
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,956
Here we go!

244
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,956
Damn, I didn't expect this!

245
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,076
This is too much!

246
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,637
Your really...
You really something!

247
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,359
- Where did he go?
- Probably to the police station.

248
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,556
Then turn that way!

249
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,511
What's happening?

250
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,636
The body is touching the ground!

251
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,668
Stop! That's an order! Stop!

252
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,637
You won't catch me!

253
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,678
I am the fastest
driver in the world!

254
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,038
What's wrong with you?
Get out of the car! Now!

255
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,429
What?!
You told me to get out!

256
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,513
I hope your expecting resistance!

257
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,074
He's crazy!
Don't waste your time with him.

258
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,669
Hey, hey, hey!
Wait a minute!

259
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,109
I am in possession
of a valid driving license!

260
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,357
So what?
Arrest him!

261
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,518
How can you?
You can't do this! Help!

262
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,556
That's what he gets.

263
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,234
For him, it's just
business as usual.

264
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,836
Let me go!
Let me go, I said!

265
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,797
For once I'm right!

266
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,836
Can't you see my license!

267
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,591
All drivers need a license,

268
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,591
though you can't go full speed!

269
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,511
So don't break the rules!

270
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:45,114
What?!
I already knew the rules?

271
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,277
In the next episode:

272
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,316
"Junko's Love! He's the Guy
Who Saw the Limit of Speed".

273
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,437
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

274
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,550
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

275
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:19,500
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

276
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,800
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

277
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:35,600
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

278
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,500
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

279
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,200
These feelings
just flare up

280
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

281
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,200
The fantasy penetrates through you

282
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

283
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:15,250
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

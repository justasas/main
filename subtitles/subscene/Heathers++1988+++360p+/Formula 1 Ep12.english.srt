1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,150
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,150
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,500
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,700
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,000
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,000
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,250
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,750
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,250
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,590
You know, Haitani,
I'm glad you're healed.

16
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,997
I'm furious!
He almost made me into a cripple!

17
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,196
- ...and wrecked my car!
- For real?!

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,236
That cars very important to me.

19
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,199
- I'll kill him if he does it again!
- It's that guy...

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,236
- he's participating in the race!
- What?!

21
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,276
GUNMA AKAGI

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The Blaze of Elimination Matches!
Aim for the Pole Position!

23
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,157
As you can see,
in this drawing ...

24
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,470
...I've highlighted the
key points of the track.

25
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,030
I have indicated each
curve for which gear,

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,951
and likewise when going straight.

27
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,191
Try to memorize the plan!

28
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,272
By doing so, you'll make a lap
in one minute and three seconds!

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,635
For now, the track
record belongs to Hiziri.

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,872
He did it in 1:01:47!
Even if you don't beat him,

31
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,916
You can always
get a good result!

32
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,116
Gunma, what's so funny?

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,756
Where are you going?
Don't you remember that the race is tomorrow?

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,639
Of course I remember!
Let me go!

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,390
- Hey, guys!
- Glad to see you!

36
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,153
So ...
Did you do a good job on my car?

37
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,151
Sure! The car is perfect!

38
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,231
Though I wouldn't say
the same about the driver!

39
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,676
Well, what do you think?

40
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,756
It's monstrosity!

41
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,759
I like it very much!
You could not have done any better!

42
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,509
Now I'll rule all of the circuits!

43
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,915
- Do you really like it, Gunma?
- Totally!

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,436
With this car my victories
will be remembered by the audience!

45
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,189
Your victories?!
Gunma, listen to me when I talk to you!

46
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,030
I've told you a thousand times.
When you enter a curve ...

47
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,271
...you better use the right
gear or you'll lose time!

48
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,349
Tamotsu, you're unbearable!
You always...

49
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,635
...have something to say!

50
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,719
Now tell me!
Is this the right gear?

51
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,268
You probably found
that in some manual!

52
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,636
Well, actually I've studied a lot...

53
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,950
..even how Hiziri became number one!

54
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,038
Everything will work out
if you follow the plan.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,230
So I'll be like Hiziri...

56
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,629
...if I follow that plan,

57
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,678
and I'll beat
his last years record.

58
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,392
But this mean I
could also beat his time!

59
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,517
It's decided,
I'll make a better record!

60
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,758
- Gunma...
- Wait a second!

61
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,791
Even if I followed
your precious scheme,

62
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,236
I should go even faster
thanks to our perfect setup.

63
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,117
That's impossible!

64
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,760
Hiziri's can is far too powerful!

65
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,796
...our car can't be faster than his!

66
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,757
That's just your opinion!

67
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,751
I will beat him, I will!

68
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,910
Is that clear?
I'll win!

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,673
But you're already one of
the highest-rated pilots, Gunma!

70
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,076
But I want to be the best!

71
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,598
- Gunma!
- Racing is not a game!

72
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,519
Shut up!
I'll do as I please!

73
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,477
I'll do what I want to...

74
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,516
...and I'll turn the way I want to!

75
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,757
Gunma!

76
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,353
MORIOKA MOTORS

77
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,716
Come on, guys, eat up!
There's plenty for everyone!

78
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,756
Thanks for the food!

79
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,473
Hurry Tamotsu!
Or there won't be any left!

80
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,677
I'll be right there!

81
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,556
Your always working!

82
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,033
They're under pressure!
I thought being under pressure ...

83
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,031
...was normal for them...

84
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,680
...though all young people are like that!

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,116
That's quite normal.

86
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,270
It may seem strange
because you're not used to it,

87
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,316
but that's what it's like for drivers!

88
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,994
Driver's come after
work and have little time...

89
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,719
- ... To fix their engines.
- And they aren't using the facilities...

90
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,678
...at the circuits.
And they've also got to store them.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,675
And they don't even have
enough room for all the drivers.

92
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,349
If they were rich they
would have no problems,

93
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,076
But money isn't everything.

94
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,350
Yes your right,
but what can we do?

95
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,678
- All we can do is cover them in bags!
- Great idea!

96
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,436
I finally finished.

97
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,516
What are you thinking?

98
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,595
Nothing, I was just
staring at the fire.

99
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,951
Actually I lied,
I was thinking about something.

100
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,153
I am very worried about someone.

101
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,158
- I'm afraid something will happen to him.
- Junko!

102
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,549
Junko!

103
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,190
- Junko!
- Come on, Gunma, get up.

104
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,750
If you sleep in the car you'll have
back problems in the morning!

105
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,076
Come on, get up!

106
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,031
Junko!

107
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,030
What did I do?
I was only sleeping!

108
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,355
Yes, but you tried to
kiss her in your sleep!

109
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,228
When you are sleeping you are
not responsible for your actions.

110
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,276
The same goes for you.

111
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,350
- Sempai!
- Hey, hows it going?

112
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,277
Hey guys,
wanna know something?

113
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,436
Well...

114
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,835
Who does he think he is?

115
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,799
Gunma,
just forget about that car!

116
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,599
Not a chance!

117
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,950
We'll see who's the fastest!

118
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,156
You idiot!

119
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,071
Come on, bring it!

120
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,989
- It's Haitani!
- I came looking for you ...

121
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,640
...because we have a score to settle!

122
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,150
I'll get you this time!

123
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,319
It's about time I had some fun!

124
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,233
What?!
Don't you even think about it!

125
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,631
Stop! stop it!

126
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,758
- That's enough!
- Get off me!

127
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,676
What's this?

128
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,473
- Come on, stop it!
- Sempai

129
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,837
Stop this at once!

130
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,472
What are you doing here?

131
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,516
Hiziri!

132
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,757
Hiziri?

133
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,832
I hope you've learned your lesson!

134
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,751
That goes for all of you,

135
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,149
so behave
better from now on!

136
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,357
Hiziri!

137
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,429
I wanted to apologize for last night.

138
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,276
Hiziri.

139
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,671
Your of no use to him.

140
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,360
What do you know?

141
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,956
Don't take it the wrong way!
You could always team up with me,

142
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,959
But remember no
fooling around on the track.

143
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,751
Just remember: mess with
me and you'll regret it!

144
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,958
This isn't the last you'll hear of me!

145
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,517
Just remember to be
careful in the early rounds. Okay?

146
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,236
Just remember that..

147
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,232
it's important to be up front.

148
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,989
Do that and you'll win.

149
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,674
Just don't mess around with Haitani!

150
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,319
Stop lecturing me!
If you keep it up

151
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,550
- ...I'll end up falling asleep.
- Remember ...

152
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:50,359
Pay attention and
don't be caught off guard.

153
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,751
Remember your
training and you'll win.

154
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,314
Hey, Kishida, are you ready?

155
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,278
Is your seatbelt fastened?

156
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,314
- Yes, of course!
- Hey there...

157
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,278
- ...don't be going too fast!
- Sempai!

158
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,552
Just remember to remain behind me.

159
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,916
Sure!
This waiting is making me nervous!

160
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,630
I wonder if this is the tension that
stimulates the desire for conquest,

161
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,550
or is the desire to create tension ...!

162
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,949
I wish you good luck.

163
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,276
Thanks, I'll need it!

164
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,554
Gunma, we're cheering for you!

165
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,356
Come on, let's go!

166
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,150
Let's do this!

167
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,679
Sempai, wait for me!

168
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,433
Here we go again.
I wonder how many...

169
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,670
... times I've done this circuit!

170
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,916
A thousand times?
Ten thousand times?

171
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,955
Who knows?
Who cares?

172
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,155
Curse that troublemaker!

173
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,754
It's his fault that Hiziri hit me.

174
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,650
And it's his fault that
Hiziri doesn't like me now!

175
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,270
Why should I
drive just like in practice?

176
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,396
I know what I'm doing.

177
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,950
A real driver isn't
scared of a little speed!

178
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,953
I want to win and
become number one!

179
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,869
I hope Gunma doesn't have an accident!

180
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,788
I wonder what if fear ...

181
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,838
...affects ones desire for conquest?

182
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,031
Look!

183
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,276
Come on!
Give it your all!

184
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,276
The rookie is gaining on me!

185
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,755
I'll show him who's boss!

186
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,430
You won't win this time!

187
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,951
In a duel like this,
misconduct is allowed!

188
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,629
Throw all the helmets
and shoes you want,

189
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,518
- you won't win!
- Whatever!

190
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,875
Don't you remember
last nights lesson?

191
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,436
This is between me and you.

192
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,835
It seems that you still don't understand.

193
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,275
Stop acting like an idiot on the track!

194
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,439
He hasn't passed yet!
I wonder what happened?

195
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,117
Look! Here he comes!

196
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,549
- Are you crazy?
-  Get out of the way!

197
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,518
- I am the fastest?
- Sorry about that Gunma!

198
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,397
You started it!

199
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,755
How can you say such a thing?

200
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,394
But it's true,
you started it!

201
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,353
Two minutes, and thirty seconds!

202
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,154
What? Did you say two minutes?!

203
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,435
If they don't speed up they'll lose!

204
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,790
Well, the race isn't over yet!

205
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,950
They should speed up soon!

206
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,951
They've got two minutes to improve!

207
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,828
This is disappointing!
I'd though they would win!

208
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,830
I can't wait for them to finish,
then I can go home!

209
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,916
Gunma's a real driver!

210
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,276
Didn't you see how he handled that other guy!

211
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,239
Dear mother, something
tells me that ...

212
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,834
...I'll soon be back in the fields!

213
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,355
Damn, this guy is just unstoppable!

214
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,232
I'll show you!

215
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,115
Slow down!
It's too dangerous for you!

216
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,471
Sure, Sempai!
Your wish is my command!

217
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,517
Luck be with me!

218
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,596
Watch out!
On your left!

219
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,916
He's crashed!

220
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,756
Kishida!
Kishida!

221
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,599
- Kishida, are you okay?
- Kishida!

222
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,233
Sempai.
You go on and win without me!

223
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,668
Listen, Gunma,
did you see what happened?

224
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,428
You were reckless out there.

225
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,753
And poor Kishida
has bruises all over his body,

226
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,276
and he had to be
taken to the hospital.

227
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,116
He asked me to tell you one thing:

228
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,760
You are the greatest
driver he's ever seen!

229
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,312
- I've got information.
- Are these the results?

230
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,197
Look!
Hiziri is in front!

231
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,511
Hurrah! Gunma still managed
to arrive in the second to last place!

232
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,034
This is great!
Even though he had problems,

233
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,588
Gunma, did you hear?
One minute and five seconds!

234
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,557
You have qualified!

235
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,110
Before each race, the drivers must
undergo a medical examination.

236
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,509
If they were in poor physical condition
or had too much to drink ...

237
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,036
...the night before, the verdict
would be the same: "Rejected!"

238
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,869
In the next episode:

239
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,791
Finally a decisive match! Gunma
vs Hiziri, the Ultimate Dead Heat

240
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,599
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

241
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:12,150
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

242
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:18,100
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

243
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:24,400
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

244
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:34,200
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

245
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:43,100
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

246
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:48,800
These feelings
just flare up

247
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,800
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

248
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:00,800
The fantasy penetrates through you

249
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:06,000
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

250
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,850
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

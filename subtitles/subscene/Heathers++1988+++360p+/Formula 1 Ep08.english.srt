1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,150
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,150
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,500
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,700
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,000
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,000
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,250
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,750
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,250
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,950
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

16
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,675
Yuki, I hope your watching!

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,275
I will become the
fastest man in the world!

18
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,675
In the world!

19
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,000
Collision! Gunma vs
Hiziri!! The Axles Scream!

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,596
The streets are my playground ...

21
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,910
...and nothing in this world can stop me!

22
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,719
- The means you are among the best!
- Are you in a good mood today!

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,956
Today is a great day!

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,116
The suit Morioka
gave me is fantastic!

25
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,276
It makes me important!
Don't you think so?

26
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,673
Right!

27
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,594
There sure are some
crazy people at the track!

28
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,235
His behavior is
typical of a beginner.

29
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,869
Though he'll soon compete
with the best drivers!

30
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,916
I think Gunma will have a good

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,956
chance at wining the race!

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,756
I don't think so!

33
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,031
It's one thing to train for
a race but it's an entirely

34
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,156
different from competing in one!

35
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,234
Even so, Gunma has the talent necessary.

36
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,108
And his passion will
overcome any obstacle. I know it.

37
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,034
One day Ryuju
said something strange,

38
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,750
Who knows, though
I think Gunma will...

39
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,956
...become a driver sooner or later.

40
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,233
Please, change the subject.

41
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,350
Hey, guys, you want a push?

42
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,438
You monkey,
how dare you overtake me!

43
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,636
Wait until I catch you!

44
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,439
- Brake!
- What the hell are you doing, Tamotsu?

45
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,670
Remove your foot from the pedal!

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,356
Listen, Gunma, we need to
talk before we get to the circuit.

47
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,756
- Could you slow down?
- Why didn't you say so?

48
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,234
- Now there far away!
- I have to talk to you ...

49
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,276
... about the rules of the race.

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,237
Now listen carefully.

51
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,517
What is it? I thought
I only had to drive!

52
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,909
Open your ears and remember one thing.

53
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,630
This is a dangerous sport
based on mutual respect.

54
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,316
It's common in all sports,
but especially in motor sport,

55
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,233
in particular,
collaboration is essential!

56
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,516
You must respect your colleagues,

57
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,438
and the engineers and mechanics ...

58
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,750
And especially the director of the race!

59
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,272
You must abide by these rules
if you want to become a good driver.

60
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,276
Follow these rules.

61
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,555
Or else you'll be thrown out!

62
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,672
Or worse, you could
injure the other drivers!

63
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,189
This is why must
show respect to others...

64
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,113
and for their safety ...!
So, are we clear?

65
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,708
In other words should I behave exactly ...

66
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,756
... like a lady!

67
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,519
You know, this
time I think your right!

68
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,951
This is a very dangerous sport ...

69
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,918
...and I must follow the rules.
Am I right, Tamotsu?

70
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,668
Gunma, tell me that this is not a dream!

71
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,236
I've never been more serious in my life!

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,788
You know, Tamotsu, I promise
that I'll follow the rules and win!

73
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,678
I'm scared...can I wake up now!

74
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,629
I'm going to talk to
the owner of the garage.

75
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,196
So while I'm there,
go pay the rent.

76
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,357
I'll go with you.

77
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,552
I must say hello too.
If I'm not mistaken it is the duty

78
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,756
...of a gentleman!
It's true!

79
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,994
Don't be silly!
Now you need to focus ...

80
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,719
...on the race.
Then you've gotta hit the track.

81
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,677
...for practice!
Understand.

82
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,678
Where can I get a
bite to eat around here?

83
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,674
Hey, man,
is there something wrong with it?

84
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,156
- The motor isn't working.
- Why don't you call a mechanic?

85
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,077
- Look, I'm sorry!
- Yes, what do you want?

86
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,151
I would like to know where ...

87
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,279
Where can I get something
to drink! I'm dehydrated!

88
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,911
Tell me:
are you new around here?

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,956
Well, I ...
You see.

90
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,831
If you are looking for a toilet,
it means that you're new here!

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,912
- Yeah!
- It's forbidden to pee outdoors!

92
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,839
The Tsubuka circuit is no
longer what it once was!

93
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,508
Hey my friend, are you a driver?

94
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,636
Yes, of course!
Here, this is yours!

95
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,752
Don't get offended,
but you don't look like one.

96
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,276
Your not the first to say that.

97
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,516
In fact, even I'm not convinced.

98
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,839
In fact I am a student
of the faculty of psychology.

99
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,912
I came here to improve
my introspective analysis ...

100
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,070
...of the interactions of human beings ...

101
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,277
...including their
obvious passion for engines.

102
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,630
Simple, is not it?
You know what?

103
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,757
I am convinced that here
is where I will find my answers!

104
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,594
My focus is on the human attitude ...

105
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,638
...against space!
I will speak of this in detail ...

106
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,518
...in my thesis:
"Why conquer space"?

107
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,670
Scientists have scrutinize the skies for years,

108
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,031
and everyone is trying
to go higher! Why is that?

109
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,196
Why is this happening?

110
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,829
They say it is human curiosity,
but that's not the only answer!

111
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,195
There must be a
more complex explanation!

112
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,511
And I must discover it!
I must, I have to!

113
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,591
I must!
And so on, and so forth!

114
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,118
Look, "Einstein", why don't you
calm down? People are looking!

115
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,037
So sorry if I disturbed you,

116
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,839
I got carried away a
bit with my enthusiasm.

117
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,830
A few years ago I
decided to use my time ...

118
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,912
... to solve the problems plaguing mankind.

119
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,517
The drivers
always driver towards danger,

120
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,477
just to win and...

121
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,075
this makes them more daring!
For them, danger doesn't exist!

122
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,630
I think this sport symbolizes
the conquest of space.

123
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,513
It's for this reason that I
became interested in engines!

124
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,556
Hey, are you hungry?

125
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,674
Is there a restaurant near here,
why don't we go and eat?

126
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,395
Yes, it's a great idea!
I hope I did not offend you ...

127
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,835
- ... so I'll buy lunch.
- Don't expect anymore!

128
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,117
Well, take advantage of this opportunity ...

129
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,350
to talk about
the Rules of the circuit.

130
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,756
- Now I'm a veteran!
- Let's start the presentation!

131
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,877
-  My name is Hideo Kishida!
- My names Gunma Akagi.

132
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,190
You'll remember this when I'm famous!

133
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,074
Listen carefully and remember that,

134
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,196
you have to follow what they say!

135
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,031
And we must obey
their orders without question!

136
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,111
That's the most important thing!

137
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,590
When did you first start racing?

138
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,711
When I was a child.

139
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,758
So have you been racing since then?

140
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,794
I've looked at the
list of drivers in the race's ...

141
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,075
...last year and the year before that,

142
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,119
and your name wasn't on the list!

143
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,278
Maybe they forgot to put me on it.

144
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,357
That's the great Haitani!

145
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,871
Where is he?

146
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,916
The guy with the glasses!

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,275
I remember him?
So he races too.

148
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,914
Eh?! You mean you know him?

149
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,749
He's one of the best drivers in the world!

150
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,278
- Look! There's Hiziri  too!
- Hiziri ?!

151
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,198
He hasn't lost a race this year,

152
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,236
A true champion!

153
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,708
Aren't I lucky!
I never imagined ...

154
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,950
that I would see
my idols in the flesh!

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,673
Sorry, you're Hiziri
and Haitani, aren't you?

156
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,674
And who might you be?
I don't know you.

157
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,156
Behold, my name is Kishida.
I have the honor to take part ...

158
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,277
...and race with you.
It's good to have met you.

159
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,519
Don't worry, I'll go easy on you.

160
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,353
You look like no Champion I've saw!

161
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,268
- You'll get what you deserve.
- What do you mean, Gunma?

162
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,835
If you think you're the fastest,
then think again!

163
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,957
You know what?

164
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,676
Your no real driver,
your just an ordinary man!

165
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,916
- Do you remember me?
- Of course!

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,198
- I remember.
- I'm glad you remember.

167
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,158
Now you know who will beat you!

168
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,232
How dare you?
Do you know who your speaking too?

169
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,233
Hey you, you only won
because I was driving a truck!

170
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,356
I'll win against you this time.

171
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,319
Yes, in fact I remember passing a truck ...

172
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,470
...that moved really slow.
So it was you!

173
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,434
Good-bye, gentlemen,
see you on the track!

174
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,678
- Hey, wait a minute!
- Leave him alone, Haitani.

175
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,075
Listen to what I have to say,

176
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,037
I'm listening!

177
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,918
When you race with
great drivers like us,

178
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,549
remember the rules,
though I don't expect you to remember!

179
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,710
- So what?
- I seem to have been ...

180
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,917
...too kind to you!
Is there anything else?

181
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,356
What were you thinking?

182
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,395
- I do not know, Hiziri.
- Just tell me next time!

183
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,472
Didn't you know
that he's just a rookie?

184
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,910
Don't go looking for trouble.

185
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,436
I'll get you.

186
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,916
Defend yourself!

187
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,598
I advise you to keep
your energy for the race.

188
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,752
Assuming that you're going.
Do you understand, boy?

189
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,034
It will not end here,
Hiziri, I assure you.

190
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,153
Perfect! Now I can
listen to music!

191
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,471
What wonderful news!

192
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,349
That's really great!

193
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,677
Yeah it is, though
I'm alright for now

194
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,438
Gunma!

195
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,231
- Gunma!
- Where is he?

196
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,437
It's lunch time!
I knew this would happen!

197
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,677
Gunma!

198
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,631
Thats it's!
I just gotta remember the curves.

199
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,359
I'll show that idiot who's best!

200
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,591
- Look! Look over there!
- What is it?

201
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,151
He's really good.

202
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,595
Be careful, your turning a curve!

203
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,837
Where the hell did Gunma go?

204
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,916
I'd like to know too.

205
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,036
Don't worry,
I'll look for him.

206
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,078
- You go and grab a bite.
- Great idea!

207
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,633
Here he is!
Gunma is written on the suit!

208
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,870
He took the curve
without skidding! Amazing!

209
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,757
He's crazy!

210
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,076
He's not bad.

211
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,357
Excuse me.

212
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,279
Are you friends with Gunma Akagi?

213
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,310
- Why did you call us?

214
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,356
I thought there was no need for you!

215
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,471
But he challenged Haitani,

216
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,438
and said he would
beat him on the track...

217
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,353
...and him and Hiziri,
got into a scuffle!

218
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,910
I never thought that he would do it.

219
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,639
Gunma said he was racing for years!

220
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,749
Though I never imagined such a thing!

221
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,791
Gunma got angry and was beaten.

222
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,555
Haitani hit him, but
Hiziri stopped the fight.

223
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,913
I advise you to keep
your energy for the race.

224
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,276
Assuming that you're going.
Do you understand, boy?

225
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,109
And fortunately they left.

226
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,555
I knew it!
He is an idiot!

227
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,597
However, even if he was wrong,

228
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,194
Gunma showed
everyone that he has guts!

229
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,076
You're finally back!

230
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,077
How did you
get permission to use my bike?

231
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,116
Why are you so angry?

232
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,272
Because I've got no
time to do a test drive!

233
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,357
Is that is.

234
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,550
What's wrong with you!

235
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,596
Gunma, where are you?

236
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,717
I came a long way to get
here and participate in this race,

237
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,439
- Do you understand?
- Give it a rest!

238
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,117
Now who will pay for the damages?

239
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,151
My new bike!
What will I do?

240
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,273
- Gunma!
- Nice day, isn't it?

241
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,197
That's just like you.

242
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,274
Did you happen to see that one?

243
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,114
You mean the one that
got beat by Haitani and Hiziri.

244
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,755
He must not know the rules,

245
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,116
He's probably a beginner.

246
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,153
He just looks like a fool!

247
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,756
Where did he get that from?

248
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,275
For a rookie,
he has a good car!

249
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,234
Today, I'll show you defeat.

250
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,276
The first in a long series!

251
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,913
Are you satisfied now Gunma?

252
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,595
Why don't you ever listen to others?

253
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,958
This is the first time
I've see such behavior.

254
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,909
Didn't I tell you how to behave!

255
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,231
Get it over with, Tamotsu!
when a pilot ...

256
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,197
...like me has natural talent,

257
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,874
the rules become secondary!

258
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,469
I'm a champion
and I'll prove it!

259
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,356
Let's see what you've got!

260
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,916
I hope you win,

261
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,199
Tamotsu!
This is kinda hard to drive.

262
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,675
Don't worry,
you'll adjust during the race!

263
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,673
- Is something wrong?
- No just wondering!

264
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,071
And, we're off.

265
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,509
I hope he learned his lesson...

266
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,034
- ...and won't cause more trouble.
- Give him time,

267
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,237
- he'll come around.
- I'm not so sure!

268
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,516
What are you doing here?

269
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,309
I've been waiting for you, I though it would be disrespectful..

270
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,356
...if I went onto the track first.

271
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,599
That's touching! !
Come on, get behind me.

272
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,036
When do I accelerate?

273
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,349
You start small in the beginning.

274
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,596
And work your way
to becoming a champion.

275
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,110
It'll probably take a year.

276
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,231
You gotta learn
to use the car first.

277
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,198
Though setbacks could
happen at any time.

278
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,836
We have a way to go,

279
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,958
we need to tune the
engine and perfect it,

280
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,198
and improving handling...
Then we'll become competitive.

281
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,156
Why isn't Gunma here yet?

282
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,550
Yeah, it's weird. He should
have been here by now.

283
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,757
Look, there's a car now!
It could be him.

284
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,676
It's not him, that's Hiziri.

285
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,676
If this continues he'll will the race.

286
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,637
He's currently in first place,

287
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,359
Yes, but Gunma should
be in the top three!

288
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,957
Here comes another one!

289
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,636
It's still not him!

290
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,433
- He's driving like mad!
- I think that's Haitani!

291
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,636
I'm staring to get worried.

292
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,269
Where are you Gunma?

293
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,556
It's not over yet!

294
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,673
Hey, Gunma,
can't you go faster?

295
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,077
Shut up, Kishida!

296
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,838
What's wrong?
Are you running low of fuel?

297
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,230
I hope your not afraid,
In this circuit ...

298
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,278
...there's no place for tricycles!
Bye, Bye!

299
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,436
Damn this piece of junk!

300
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,556
That hurt my foot!

301
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,031
No one can go
faster than Gunma Akagi!

302
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,355
I cannot stand to see
them pass me by!

303
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,678
There must be something
wrong with this thing!

304
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,629
The speed of an F1 car
exceeds 350 km/h,

305
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,189
though for safety reasons
we race at 200 km/h!

306
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,277
Just like a train!

307
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,356
In the next episode:

308
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,396
"I am a Genius!
Gunma's Drive of Certain Death".

309
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,358
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

310
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:13,550
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

311
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:19,500
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

312
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:25,800
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

313
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:35,600
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

314
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:44,500
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

315
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,200
These feelings
just flare up

316
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

317
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:02,200
The fantasy penetrates through you

318
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,400
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

319
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:15,250
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

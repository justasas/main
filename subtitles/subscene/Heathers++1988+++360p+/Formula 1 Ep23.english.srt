1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,600
Formula 1 - Engines on The Track

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,500
My heart's continuous signal of love

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,500
It's that way because
I want to embrace you

4
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,900
And as I waited I
decided to dance slowly

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,900
Both of us could
read each other's lips

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:35,200
We secretly bathed
in the moonlight

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,000
After the goodbye

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,450
You left without leaving a clue

9
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:48,700
Don't betray me Darlin'
She passed through the city

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,350
Nobody knows Love Affair

11
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,750
Together until the morning

12
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,250
Making Love and no more

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,850
I felt you when I
touched your hand

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:03,400
Your a woman

15
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,950
Love Affair

16
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,500
Together until the morning

17
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,200
Making Love and no more

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,800
Those words of love
that you want to hear

19
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,500
Your a woman

20
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,430
- What's wrong?
- Oh, dear.

21
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:45,750
Gunma vs. Hiziri!!
I Am the Champ!

22
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,110
Sempai, I've got drinks!

23
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,910
There is orange and bitter orange.
Which one do you prefer?

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,550
Sempai, what's wrong?

25
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,430
I don't know why Sempai did that!

26
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,670
An article on Hiziri.

27
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,550
Take a break, Tamotsu,
you've been working for hours.

28
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,960
I saw that the light was
on and thought I'd enter.

29
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,550
I'm sorry but I'm pretty busy.
Tomorrow will be the big debut!

30
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,110
I brought you some coffee.
Come on, help me up.

31
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,030
Uhm...

32
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,860
I know you can do it!
Though I'm pretty heavy, you know.

33
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,950
- I'm not sure about this.
- It's alright.

34
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,180
Uhm...Uhm...

35
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,270
- You okay?
- Ruiko...

36
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,430
- You're heavy!
- I'm sorry.

37
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,430
- I told you, I'm pretty heavy!
- Yeah.

38
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,070
By the way I'm almost finished here...

39
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,630
Look, is there a way you can
make it not drive tomorrow?

40
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,670
- Why would you want that?
- Uhm...

41
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,750
...the car isn't yet fully developed.

42
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,870
But you can't ask that of me!

43
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,350
There is a danger...

44
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,550
...that Hiziri might have
an attack during the race.

45
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,830
What kind of attack?

46
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,950
But he has never felt like
that during any of the tests!

47
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,670
- Your thinking too much!
- I'm not.

48
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,550
Just today he had an attack!

49
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,830
It happened right after training.

50
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,510
He's fully recovered,
but no matter,

51
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,350
these attacks are
becoming more frequent.

52
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,270
Thanks. But didn't Hiziri know
that this would of happened?

53
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,950
You were the one...

54
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,670
that convinced me to take this job.

55
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,830
That night, you revealed
everything about his illness!

56
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,430
Your right.
I was the one that insisted...

57
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,150
...because you saw
the condition he as in...

58
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,150
I was hoping that
you were gonna help.

59
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,460
Hiziri is very sick.
You know?

60
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,180
- He's sick ?!
- Yes, he has a serious illness.

61
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,270
But unfortunately there
is no remedy to cure him.

62
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,900
Little by little...

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,270
...the condition of his eyes
and heart will weaken.

64
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,670
Now you know
what is happening to him...

65
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,110
...and why he insisted
on you working with him.

66
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,670
This is why he must pass Formula 3...

67
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,430
...and win the championship.

68
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,510
He only has so long left.

69
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,270
This is his last chance, you know?

70
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,030
Help him, Tamotsu!
Make sure that he wins!

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,950
Please!

72
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,100
That evening, Hiziri,
went on a rampage!

73
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,150
But I still think
I made the best ...

74
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,590
...decision, because you finally...

75
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,750
...became part of the team.

76
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,700
However, there was another
reason why I wanted you to join.

77
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,350
- Huh?
- I wanted an ally!

78
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,510
If he withdraw from
the world of racing,

79
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,430
He could live for at least
four or five more years.

80
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,470
At this point I don't
care who wins,

81
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,670
just that he remains
at my side for longer!

82
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,790
I beg you, Tamotsu, try to
make it not drive tomorrow!

83
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,440
But I can't!
I could never do that!

84
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,750
I gave my word to
Hiziri and I won't betray him.

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,230
And I didn't accept this
job because I felt sorry for him,

86
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,550
I agreed to become his mechanic ...

87
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,180
because I wanted to improve
my skills and become stronger!

88
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,270
That's why!
And this...

89
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,470
decision has cost me dearly ...

90
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,830
because I lost the
love of my dearest friend!

91
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,150
I beg you!
Only you can stop him!

92
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,500
Listen..
I can't do it.

93
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,430
- What did you say? He was angry?
- Yes.

94
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,830
Knowing Gunma,
I bet that he went to the circuit!

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,150
Doesn't Hiziri make ​​his
debut in Formula 3 tomorrow!

96
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,630
- Oh, yeah!
- That article probably...

97
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,910
...probably sent Gunma into a rage!

98
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,510
But how do we know he won't...

99
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,950
- ...do something stupid!
- We don't!

100
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,750
When it comes to Gunma
we don't know what he'll do!

101
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,180
He's quite capable of entering the circuit ...

102
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,430
...and doing something
stupid in front of everyone!

103
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,510
We've gotta find him.

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,910
Oh my!
She was like a lightning bolt!

105
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,550
She must really be in love...

106
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,430
...since she went to look for
him in the middle of the night.

107
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,940
- Hiziri!
- Just today, he had an attack.

108
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,150
It happened right after training.

109
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,550
Hiziri, why are you here alone?
Are you felling alright?

110
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,830
Have you finished your work?

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,950
Relax!
Have a drink with me!

112
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,550
Don't worry about my health,

113
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,940
I went out just to
get some fresh air!

114
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,750
Hiziri, can I ask you a question?

115
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,030
- Sure!
- You see...

116
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,580
...Martin  said that drivers
always try to surpass themselves ...

117
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,190
...for taking revenge on someone.

118
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,750
I want to know what drives you!

119
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,180
Does each driver want his own destiny?

120
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,150
Do we just drive?
You think it's stupid, right?

121
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,870
- That's not it! You misunderstood me.
- So why do I drive?

122
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,940
By the way, Tamotsu, I will not
take pole position tomorrow!

123
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,950
Why don't you want the
Pole-Position? Are you crazy?

124
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,630
Aren't you going to
be first like always?

125
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,430
Don't you want to
overtake them and win big?

126
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,070
You're right. I should win big.

127
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,670
But I can only do
that with your help.

128
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,950
Tamotsu, Tamotsu.

129
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,670
Hey! Can you see Gunma?

130
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,670
No, he's not here!

131
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,750
Yesterday I called them and
they said they didn't see him.

132
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,150
- Look it's Tamotsu!
- Eh?!

133
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,430
I haven't seen him in a while.

134
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,030
- He looks relaxed and calm!
- Good.

135
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,740
02:08:57!
Something must be wrong!

136
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,670
Hey Chief, are you sure
you did a good job?

137
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,030
- I did everything I could.
- He's coming back to the pits!

138
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,020
What is it, Hiziri? Engine trouble?
You need to do better.

139
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,150
No, the cars perfectly!
It's a true masterpiece!

140
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,950
But don't you want to
achieve pole position?

141
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,030
Right now any
position is fine for me.

142
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,620
Pole-Position is a
bit too much for me.

143
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,900
Great! Let's take a break too.

144
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,270
Sure!
Boss knows what's right.

145
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,190
- Tamotsu!
- Hi!

146
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,630
- Hi, how you doing?
- Junko and Kishida!

147
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,590
I didn't know you were here.

148
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,110
But how did you all get in here!

149
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,350
They just don't let anybody in!

150
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,430
Well, we used this pass, you see!

151
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,350
- That's how we got in!
- Is Gunma also with you?

152
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,950
- Probably!
- Huh.

153
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,350
In fact, we came here
because we thought ...

154
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,350
...you could tell us where Gunma is!

155
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,270
Sorry if we've disturbed!
You must be busy.

156
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,350
- Let's go, Kishida?
- Yes.

157
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,630
- Good luck!
- Goodbye, Tamotsu!

158
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,230
Hey, wait a second!

159
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,020
Let me know if Martin and
Gunma are still angry with me.

160
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,950
If they are, they have their reasons.
I betrayed their trust!

161
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,230
But I have not given up on
the dream I share with Gunma:

162
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,150
Him a formula 1 driver
and me as his mechanic.

163
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,620
Please tell him!
I will come back to work with him ...

164
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,670
- ...when the time is right!
- When the time is right?

165
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,910
- What does that mean?
- I can't tell you anymore for now!

166
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,750
But, please, take care
of Gunma until then!

167
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,110
- I beg of you.
- Tamotsu.

168
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,750
The race has begun and
we haven't even seen Gunma!

169
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:40,110
I would love to know
if he even came here.

170
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,030
Did you see something, Kishida?

171
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,070
Hiziri...

172
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,590
This is awesome!

173
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,950
In Formula 3 you race completely different!

174
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,550
Just you wait. I'm coming.

175
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,670
02:07:24!

176
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,220
He gets faster and
faster on each lap!

177
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,590
- It would be better if I left!
- Eh?!

178
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,750
I just can't stand this.

179
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,230
I hope you understand.

180
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,910
I can't help but look at
him and think that ...

181
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,150
Ruiko ...

182
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,830
I have to admit that
you ain't half bad, Hiziri!

183
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,180
However, you won't remain the
undisputed champion for much longer!

184
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,150
What?!
There's a man on the bridge?

185
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,870
You idiot!
You talked with the mic on!

186
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,550
Hey, they said that
there is a man on the bridge!

187
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,590
Who is that crazy guy?

188
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,550
- I dunno!
- Let's see!

189
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,030
What the hell are
you people looking at?

190
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,510
Huh
It's Gunma!

191
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,750
I've participated in a few races ...

192
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,630
...and realized that you
need to finish first.

193
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,230
Well he'll need
more luck that that.

194
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,070
Just answer yes
or no to my question.

195
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,670
I hope the answer is yes.

196
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,710
Okay, proposal accepted!
But I do things my way!

197
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,180
So I won't be taking responsibility...

198
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,150
if this project turns
out to be a waste of money.

199
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,070
Fine then.
It'll be there in a few days.

200
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,910
And remember don't
try to discover my identity!

201
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,630
Remember that.

202
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,550
Gunma Akagi...

203
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,350
Come down or they'll be trouble!

204
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,430
I can't let them take me!

205
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,030
Get down here now!

206
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,030
You didn't think I would fly!

207
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,750
Let's hope that didn't hurt!

208
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,870
- Come on, Kishida, let's go!
- Yes.

209
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,260
Remember, if the drivers are to be strong,

210
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,590
it's only because they are
motivated by the spirit of revenge!

211
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,830
Hiziri!

212
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,030
How can I explain to him that,

213
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,630
it's been an entire year
since I've known something was wrong.

214
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,350
The numbness isn't limited to my hands but also...

215
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,430
to my legs and knees ...

216
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,470
Sometimes my vision blurs
and my ears start to ring.

217
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,540
Every time, the
pain gets more intense.

218
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,230
And every time...

219
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,030
Death is slowly getting closer,

220
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,000
but he won't let me die.

221
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,230
He knows that I don't want to drive,

222
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,910
for fame or money!
I don't know what to do!

223
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,590
The reason I'm driving is ...

224
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,830
The reason I'm driving is
only a race against time ...

225
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,580
...because I'm trying
to escape my situation.

226
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,430
I'm helpless!

227
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,830
The very fact of
going a second faster,

228
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,630
gives me the illusion of
being able to stop my fate!

229
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,030
At that precise moment I felt ...

230
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,150
That I was the absolute ruler of time!

231
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,430
This is why I continue to
drive and I'll never stop!

232
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,510
- Great job!
- Congratulations Hiziri!

233
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,470
You did it!

234
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,860
This is truly amazing,
he won Formula 3

235
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,630
on his first try!
He's one of a kind.

236
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,340
From now on, thanks to him,
the league will be more exciting!

237
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,290
Tell us: are you excited?
What are your future plans?

238
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,590
Well, I will be aiming high!

239
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,670
Sorry, but could you
explain it a little more?

240
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,830
I already said it.

241
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,310
So does that mean that
you will go to Formula 1!

242
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,910
Drivers are always unpredictable.
Excuse me, I've gotta go.

243
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,630
You've heard him!
The strongest driver of the last decade,

244
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,750
will go and race in Formula 1!

245
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,190
Well, that race and
interview has left me very tired.

246
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,510
If you don't mind,
I'll be heading home.

247
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,060
Sure, go ahead.
We'll take care of everything.

248
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,590
- It's Gunma!
- Sempai!

249
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,670
Gunma?!

250
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,270
What ?! Formula 3?

251
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,710
They came to propose
to race in Formula 3!

252
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,950
Finally they've realized the
talent of the great Gunma!

253
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,270
In the next episode:

254
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,230
Gunma's Winning Everything!
Finally, an Invitation to F-3...

255
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,630
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

256
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:28,950
I saw you crying after
you were abandoned

257
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,850
Let's climb that hill
and look back down

258
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:39,950
In the big world it's undeniable

259
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:50,700
Yesterday's pain is
not visible anymore

260
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,200
OK Let's start it

261
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,200
In order to grieve

262
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:02,400
Ah It's as if we weren't born

263
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:15,650
You are my energy, You are my energy

264
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,050
Courage come out

265
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:27,350
By just being with you

1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,150
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,150
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,500
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,700
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,000
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,000
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,250
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,750
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,250
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,910
Don't kid yourself.
You'll never be the fastest,

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,750
- not even in you're wildest dreams!
- You're just some asshole!

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,950
Gunma!

18
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,950
There are tons of people who are
a lot faster than you in the world of racing!

19
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,470
Hey brother,
Once the plane touched down,

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,750
- I was moved to tears!
-Be quiet, Yuma!

21
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,070
- Mr. Gunma!
- That is so moving...

22
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,750
...a picture perfect family!
Can I come in too?

23
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,150
- Why not? Sit next to me!
- Yuki, bring some dinner!

24
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,270
Wait a minute
and dinner will be served!

25
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,830
Don't even think
about serving him here!

26
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,710
As usual, Yuki.
Bring it to his usual place.

27
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,750
- But madam...!
- Today is a special occasion,

28
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,910
I just returned from America!
Let him sit with us.

29
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,950
There is a big difference
between him and you.

30
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,110
Gunma knows this, but he
doesn't want to understand.

31
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,870
- Mom!
- Don't say anymore, please!

32
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,510
Fine then! Where does
it matter where you eat?

33
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,350
- Yuki! Fill it!
- Yes!

34
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,430
So...
Someone advised me to...

35
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,630
...run as a candidate for
the House of Representatives.

36
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,020
- But I'm not sure about it!
- What did you say?

37
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,920
They must have found out
about you're skills as a politician.

38
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,100
And so, before accepting,
I wanted to know you're opinion.

39
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,150
It's really great, Dad!

40
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,190
- More please, Yuki!
- Alright!

41
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,950
Go for it. Of course you will be elected!
I know you can do it!

42
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,100
So you are not opposed to
my candidacy, Shoma?

43
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,830
Of course, if I am elected,

44
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,950
I will no longer be able
to take care of my other duties.

45
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,150
So, since you're
the eldest son,

46
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,350
all the responsibilities
of the company...

47
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,430
... will fall on you're shoulders.

48
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,950
Of course, Dad!
I'm ready!

49
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,950
- More please!
- Alright!

50
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,430
Dad, I'll always be by you're side.
I'll gladly accept this assignment.

51
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,590
You're my golden boy, Shoma,

52
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,630
- You're very responsible.
- Thank you very much.

53
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,670
- Give me some tea!
- Right away!

54
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,710
Don't forget
that when Yuma grows up...

55
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,670
he'll be able to help you too!

56
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,270
Though he'll have to
finish high school first.

57
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,230
Sure thing! I'll work with him!

58
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,030
- I'm done! Yuki, prepare me a bath!
- Yes!

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,910
Wait, Gunma!
I've got something to say to you.

60
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,260
I'm not interested in
the company or you!

61
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,830
As I suspected.

62
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,110
In fact, I wanted to talk to
you about you're bad behavior!

63
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,630
I want to go to Parliament,

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,950
but to be able to get elected,

65
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,990
the behavior of the
family must be acceptable...

66
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,350
...or I won't be accepted.
I'm warning you:

67
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,430
don't you get into trouble,
you hear me, young man?

68
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,940
- How cruel!
- Hey, father...

69
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,950
but couldn't you have
used a nicer tone with him?

70
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,030
Quiet, Yuma!

71
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,430
It's been five years,

72
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,550
since you're poor
mother passed away,

73
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,670
you haven't changed one bit,
in fact you've only got worse!

74
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,510
I was hoping that you hadn't
inherited any traits from that woman!

75
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,060
Don't you dare insult my
mother, you hear me?

76
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,950
I wouldn't if you
would behave better!

77
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,510
- How dare you!
- Please stop!

78
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,950
- Let go of me!
- Calm down, Gunma!

79
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,190
Now you listen to me!

80
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,870
She was mad at you and
yet she was still in love with you.

81
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,110
Now watch what you say about her,

82
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,430
if not then I
might just go berserk!

83
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,150
Now I can say with confidence ...

84
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,270
...that no one can
make you change!

85
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,590
All my attempts have failed miserably!

86
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,660
I'll give you anything
you want... just leave!

87
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,030
- I have nothing more to add.
- I'll go with pleasure!

88
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,670
- Mr. Gunma!
- Yuki! Stay here!

89
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,620
Take this!
Fill the bowl!

90
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,390
Yes.

91
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,400
Mr. Gunma.
Mr. Gunma. Are you there?

92
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,430
Where could he have gone?

93
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,910
You love him, don't you, Yuki?

94
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,350
I know about love.

95
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,070
Believe me, it's worth it!

96
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,030
But him... He is
nothing but irresponsible.

97
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,070
It's very different for my father.

98
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,230
That's not true, it's nothing but lies!
I don't want to hear it!

99
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,150
It's useless to discuss it now!!
Maybe one day you'll understand!

100
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,350
Okay, sir.

101
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Flashback talk

102
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,900
Way to go!
Now overtake him!

103
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,750
Speed up, move forward!
You've almost got him!

104
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,790
No! Don't slow down!
Then you'll never get by him!

105
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,750
That drivers a real idiot!
A child could do better than him!

106
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,670
So, how is it?

107
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,670
Overall not bad, but
there are still some problems ...

108
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,910
...to fix. For example,
the turning needs fixed,

109
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,950
but otherwise everything is fine.

110
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,340
We'll find a solution.
Make another round!

111
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,670
Hey, you stressed out
drivers, listen up!

112
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,430
Who gave you you're license?
Where did you learn to drive?

113
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,550
Never seen such a
bad driver in my life!

114
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,990
Did you know you're a
disgrace to the track!

115
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,550
That car should have been able
to surpass the other one easily!

116
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,590
- Stop this now!
- What? And you are?

117
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,310
We are grateful for the
advice that you have given us,

118
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,510
but could you go away now.

119
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,910
I hate busybodies!

120
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,590
Then I'm leaving,
I'll do another lap then.

121
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,670
Good luck!
You try you best now!

122
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,430
Hey, wait, let me do it!
I'll show you how!

123
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,900
I'll show you how to
drive a car like that!

124
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,110
Enough is enough, stop this!

125
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,950
We have no time to waste!
There is still much to do!

126
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,030
Let him go!
Let him go, I said!

127
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,030
Don't you realize what you're doing?

128
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,190
Help me, Kinoshita!
- Enough! Let him go!

129
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,430
I'll leave him alone if I can drive.

130
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,670
Are you out of you're mind, kid?

131
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,750
Maybe I overdid it!

132
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,350
- You're right about that.
- What the...?

133
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,630
Hey, did I hurt you?
I'm sorry about that. Honest.

134
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,950
I understand perfectly
you're passion for racing cars.

135
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,150
But you see, it's hard for us too!

136
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,430
We need to shell out a
large amount of money to drive,

137
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,510
so we don't have time
to waste. Understand?

138
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,520
You must still
be in high school.

139
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,350
Do you have a driver's license
or have you yet to take the test?

140
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,150
You must know that to be
able to race on a circuit like this...

141
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,620
...have obtained a special driving license!

142
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,110
Hey! Are you listening?

143
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,950
Hurry!
I think he's fainted after that blow!

144
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,630
This guy's just a pain in the ass,
what a waste of time!

145
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,750
- What! What did you say?
- Huh...

146
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,830
So I'm a pain in the ass?
Wait til I get you!

147
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,870
Get back here!

148
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,390
- Damn-it!

149
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,350
- Hey you, let me in!
- What are you doing?

150
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,950
- Where do you think you're going?
- Out of the way!

151
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,830
Damn-it!
He's chasing me!

152
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,620
Stop!
Stop, I say!

153
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,630
I'll get you!
Sooner or later I will!

154
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,910
Oh, no!
That guy's catching up to me!

155
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,030
The race isn't just a simple test drive!

156
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,270
Damn it!

157
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,150
What an idiot!
He can't even handle the curves!

158
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,670
I knew it!
All bark and no bite!

159
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,910
Perfect!
We're coming up on the corner!

160
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,030
He's right in front of me!
All right!

161
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,550
Move, you piece of junk!

162
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,430
I'm the best!
No one will ever beat me!

163
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,950
- He'll end up going off the track!
- Such power!

164
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,030
I knew it, you're just a beginner!
I'm the real driver here!

165
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,470
That's the guy
from the other day!

166
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,670
I have to
show off my skills!

167
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,950
Hey you! Are you okay?

168
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,350
Where? Where?

169
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,870
Just where did that guy get to?

170
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,510
Calm down! You've interrupted
the trials and smashed a car!

171
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,630
You've done enough, haven't you?

172
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,020
Have you quenched you're thirst for speed?

173
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,190
Not that I care but...

174
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,110
tell me who you are
and then you'll have to leave!

175
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,390
- How dare you speak to me like that?
- Didn't I tell you...

176
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,430
...to leave!
Take him away!

177
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,350
Let me go!

178
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,830
This morning, you're
family sent me this letter.

179
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,750
APPLICATION FOR WITHDRAWAL FROM SCHOOL

180
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,230
I'm sorry you have to leave so suddenly...

181
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,950
- ...and interrupt you're studies.
- Right!

182
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,550
I've already learned a lot here!

183
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,750
"He must quit for
using excessive force."

184
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,310
Father, I know you have
something to do with this!

185
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,430
Of course, I know it's been rough for you!

186
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,750
Don't you feel even a little
sad since you've left the house?

187
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,950
Not at all!

188
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,750
As you know, five years ago
I decided to come back here.

189
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,590
I wanted to talk to him
about what he had done to my mother.

190
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,190
For this reason I have no regrets,

191
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,660
in fact, I'm almost glad
that I got him to kick me out.

192
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,510
Can you even believe that?

193
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,830
Everyone knows you
misbehaved on purpose!

194
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,550
Maybe it's better that way!

195
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,830
Suddenly finding yourself
living alone and without help...

196
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,270
- ...will make you more responsible.
- I hope so.

197
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,550
Even so I'm not going!

198
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,230
That's just the easy way out!

199
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,070
Gunma, try not to think
about such things right now.

200
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,750
You know, today at the circuit...

201
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,670
- I saw that guy again.
- Which one?

202
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,430
- That one who chased us last night.
- Really?

203
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,310
I need to tell you something important.

204
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,150
I've made a decision:

205
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,430
I want to be on the
track for the rest of my life!

206
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,110
Cut it out already!

207
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,350
What did you say?

208
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,630
You know, this is the only
way I can talk to anyone!

209
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,950
Surprised?

210
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,030
Though I will need you're help!

211
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,070
Because you're a genius
when it comes to engines!

212
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,030
I can't keep doing this,
Gunma!

213
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,510
I can't leave my mother
alone to work in the fields!

214
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,950
- But, Tamotsu, you've gotta help me!
- I just can't!

215
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,660
First of all, you'll
need a lot of money,

216
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,500
a really big amount!
But you'll never have enough!

217
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,430
Would you say that
even if I had a mountain of money?

218
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,190
Gunma...

219
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,270
Why don't you use
you're brain for once!

220
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,430
What would you do
with that amount of cash?

221
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,710
And why should I give it to you?

222
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,950
When have you ever
done anything for our family?

223
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,510
Stop acting ridiculous!

224
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,590
But I'm not asking
for all the money, Shoma.

225
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,750
I just want to talk to Dad.

226
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,430
That's not necessary!
From now on...

227
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,270
...I'll be the one in
charge of our company!

228
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,110
Anyway, Dad wouldn't even
give you a penny!

229
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,590
Damn!

230
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,350
What's wrong, Yuki?

231
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,950
Mr. Gunma!

232
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,470
What a lovely surprise!
It about time that you...

233
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,670
...became responsible
for something, Shoma!

234
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,150
- Yes, it's really something!
- Now, Mr. Akagi,

235
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,830
can apply for the
House of Representatives.

236
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,830
- Shoma, please serve them drinks.
- Right.

237
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,270
Thank you!
Thank you!

238
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,500
It's time to say goodbye.

239
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,580
That lady...
A short while ago she told me...

240
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,460
...that I have to prepare you're suitcase!

241
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,910
Please, do not cry Yuki!

242
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,430
Are you leaving for good?

243
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,230
Yes, but I don't want to say goodbye!

244
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,670
Gunma, don't!

245
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,670
Gunma?

246
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,350
What's the meaning of this,
Gunma?

247
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,910
As you can see I'm obeying you're orders,
I'm going away aren't I!

248
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,550
I hope that I will
never see you again, Dad!

249
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,670
Soon you'll just forget about me...

250
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,630
Just like how you
forgot about my mother!

251
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,030
Please,
don't play the victim,

252
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,390
because, deep down, you
know you're not so different from me.

253
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,350
Understand these
words in memory of me.

254
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,220
Take a good look at my face.
You have a son a lot like you,

255
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,830
that bears the same name as you!

256
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,030
Fine then, I'll remember that!

257
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,670
Gunma.

258
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,030
Gunma?

259
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,910
Mr. Gunma!

260
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,750
Mr. Gunma.

261
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,590
Mr. Gunma...

262
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,830
Mr. Gunma...

263
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,030
Do you know how many
circuits are there in Japan? Eight!

264
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,550
And the best one of
all is the Suzuka circuit!

265
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,060
That's where this years
Formula One Grand Prix will be held!

266
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,550
In the next episode:
"Dear Mr. Tamotsu!".

267
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,590
"There are a lot of little Girls in Tokyo...".

268
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,630
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

269
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:14,200
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

270
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:20,150
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

271
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:26,450
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

272
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:36,250
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

273
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:45,150
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

274
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:50,850
These feelings
just flare up

275
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:55,850
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

276
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:02,850
The fantasy penetrates through you

277
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:08,050
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

278
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:15,900
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

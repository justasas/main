1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,500
STRENGTH...

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
WEAKNESS...

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,150
VANITY...

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,150
COHERENCE...

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,500
FORMULA 1 ENGINES ON THE TRACK

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Riding on the Asphalt,
with an unknown speculation

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Is it really okay to wonder why

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,700
My body always feel frustrated

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:38,000
You always know
when you're DOWN

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,500
(Going down) I just can't stop (by any chance)

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,000
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:56,250
(Driving, all right) Kid there's
only a little more left

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,750
(Getting, all right) Just as you
wanted I'll let you try

14
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,250
(Driving, all right) You gotta run
be ahead of the times

15
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,633
If you think you're the fastest, then try and take the lead!

16
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,436
You know what?

17
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,158
Your just one
asshole out of a thousand!

18
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,556
- Do you remember me?
- Yes!

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,792
- I never forget a face.
- I'm glad you do.

20
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,758
Now remember the face
of the man who will beat you!

21
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,718
Do you know
who you're talking to?

22
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,759
You only won because
I was driving a truck!

23
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,035
I'll beat you on the track!

24
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,951
What were you thinking?

25
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,635
- I do not know, Hiziri.
- I wasn't expecting this!

26
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,757
Can't you see that
he's just a rookie?

27
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,591
Don't go looking for trouble!

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,150
I'll get you.

29
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,156
Defend yourself!

30
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,554
I advise you to keep
your energy for the race.

31
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,837
Assuming that you're going.
Do you understand, boy?

32
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,100
I am a Genius!
Gunma vs. Hiziri! The Axles Scream!

33
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,356
Isn't that Gunma!

34
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,199
Gunma, could you
please go a bit faster!

35
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,436
Oh, shut up!

36
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,837
Damn it!

37
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,029
Gunma, do you even
know what you're doing?

38
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,675
- Go faster!
- I said shut up!

39
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,514
Alright, now I'll do it!

40
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,674
Ouch, my foot!
I feel sick...

41
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,716
...damn it all!

42
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,479
Gunma!
You alright?

43
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,437
Why aren't you going faster?

44
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,279
Will you shut up!
Either be...

45
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,999
...quiet or just go away!

46
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,878
It seems to me that
you're really annoyed!

47
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,110
I'm younger so
I have to follow you!

48
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,749
I would never dare to get ahead of you!

49
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,837
Then stay where you are!

50
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,640
There's no way I'll
be able to change gears!

51
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,439
Why is Gunma moving so slow?

52
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,670
Maybe he has gear problems?

53
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,475
There must be something
wrong with his machine!

54
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,676
If his machine keeps going...

55
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,910
so slow the engine could melt.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,955
Right!

57
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,437
Sorry, Gunma, but we are moving ...

58
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,909
... at an average speed of 5 km / h!

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,956
Cut it out!

60
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,600
If you don't like it just go on ahead!

61
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,756
But ... But you're crying!

62
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,356
Are you hurt?

63
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,757
I came a long way to get
here and participate in this race,,

64
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,195
- Do you understand?
- Give it a rest!

65
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,270
Now who will pay for the damages?

66
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,840
I would give anything
to have automatic transmission!

67
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,628
Damn it!
My eye is swelling!

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,116
And I also have a fever!

69
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,995
Gunma, listen!
I think I've discovered ...

70
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,389
...why your moving so slow.

71
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,631
- Are you using your left foot?
- Mind your own business?

72
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,836
I'll tell you for your own good,
Gunma!

73
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,753
With one foot
hurt its impossible...

74
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,832
...to change gear!
You have my sympathy!

75
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,870
I know this isn't my business,

76
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,996
but you better come into the pits...

77
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,755
...so we can heal you.
Gunma, I'm sorry...!

78
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,277
That was a close one!

79
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,157
Gunma!

80
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,236
You gotta go to the pits.

81
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,356
Your foot could get worse!

82
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,590
Stop being a pain in the neck!

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,430
Wait... I could try using my right foot!

84
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,352
What?

85
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,356
Are you crazy!

86
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,435
I am the fastest!
Nobody in the world can beat me!

87
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,597
What is he doing?

88
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,554
I can do it with my right!
Lets see what else I can do!

89
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,675
Alright!
Fear me!

90
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,512
I can't believe my eyes!
He sure is lucky!

91
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,268
Everyone, eat my dust!

92
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,517
Out of my way!

93
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,755
I am the fastest!
I am the best in this race!

94
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,269
I've finally become a champion!

95
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,749
Look! It seems the rookie
has found some courage!

96
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,954
Okay, champion ...
it's me and you!

97
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,951
Damn it!

98
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,233
- Look, Peter! He's coming! N- Gunma!

99
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,273
GUNMA, PIT IN!

100
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,196
- Wow! Did you see that?
- He's amazing!

101
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,869
Am I wrong or was
he driving with one leg?

102
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,997
He seemed to be.

103
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,234
This is crazy!
What is he thinking?

104
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,430
I've never seen driving like that.

105
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,953
He must be pretty good!
Anyway what do I care!

106
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,356
Let's see what he can do,
he's only a little boy.

107
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,029
Is he drunk?
What is he thinking?

108
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,596
He's driving like a mad man!

109
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,556
I want to try too!

110
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,311
Damn it!
How can he...

111
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,436
...go round curves like that?

112
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,836
I'm coming for you, Haitani!

113
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,833
That mad man's coming!
He's behind Haitani!

114
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,549
- You will not succeed!
- We'll see!

115
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,591
- Once more!
- Help!

116
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,434
If you want my advice go back to...

117
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,909
...the nursery and drive your  tricycle!

118
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,357
You shouldn't have done that!

119
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,475
Look,
I have a bad feeling about this!

120
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,553
They'll both end up getting hurt!

121
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,518
- What can we do?
- You know that Gunma ...

122
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,670
...gets angry when he's in trouble!

123
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,198
We must act,
otherwise it will be too late!

124
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,036
When he gets angry
he's capable of anything!

125
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,514
You know, I am a perfect gentleman!

126
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,915
The most polite circuit driver.

127
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,358
Take this!

128
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,351
What do you think?
Was I polite enough?

129
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,357
- What do you mean?
- I hope that ...

130
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:33,599
I am wrong about
this whole thing though,

131
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,876
I doubt it!

132
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,870
I can't stand this!
How could he insult me like that!

133
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,270
Anyway, I've gotta move.

134
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,039
I won't give up this easily!

135
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,355
You will never overtake me!

136
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,357
You won't get away
with this! You'll see.

137
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,914
Frankly, I don't give a damn!

138
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,514
Go! Go! Go!
It's Hiziri I want!

139
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,515
Now it's just me and you, Hiziri!

140
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,272
I see, he finally
managed to overcome Haitani.

141
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,558
Though he is still behind by three laps.

142
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,596
Though in this round...

143
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,752
- ... he's was faster than Haitani! !
- I think he's in trouble!

144
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,909
Even though Gunma's
ahead he still has laps to do!

145
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,468
And he might not have enough time.

146
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,670
And he might run out of energy.

147
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,275
If this continues,
we may need a replacement.

148
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,278
Hang in there, my friend!
You can do it!

149
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,914
Damn it!
Another stupid curve!

150
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,035
I can't afford
to go off track.

151
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,511
And it's even harder
because I'm only using one leg!

152
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,512
I'll have to slow
down or else I'll crash!

153
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,352
But I can't slow down
because Haitani will overtake me!

154
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,677
This time I'll get you!

155
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,357
There is no alternative!

156
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,559
Hey, Haitani! Here's
another gift! Take it!

157
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:03,110
Perfect! It hit him!
Bye bye!

158
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,956
Damn!

159
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,757
Eh?! It's Gunma!

160
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,109
Hey, Kishida,
how's it hanging?

161
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,592
What!?
How dare he say that!

162
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,150
Gunma Akagi is phenomenal!

163
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,550
Even though he's in poor condition,

164
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,676
he managed to surpass Haitani!

165
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,276
Oh, finally! Here he is!

166
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,552
Hey, what happened?
Did you have an accident?

167
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,952
Thank goodness you weren't hurt!
I was worried!

168
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,878
- I'll take off your helmet for you!
- I'm fine!

169
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,793
- Gunma had an accident!
- Gunma had an accident?

170
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,916
I didn't notice!
What happened to him?

171
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,195
Apparently he can't
use his left foot!

172
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,556
- For real?!
- He's driving with his right foot!

173
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,359
So that's why he had
trouble about turning corners!

174
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,194
But, despite everything,
he managed to overcome Haitani!

175
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,915
Yes, he really does have
the Haitaniings of a champion!

176
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,152
Yet I still have a bad feeling about this.

177
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,680
Gunma, please don't take any risks!

178
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,958
Here he is!

179
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,276
Where are you, Hiziri?

180
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,751
GUNMA,
REMEMBER THAT YOU ARE A GENTLEMAN!

181
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,552
Cheers!

182
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,153
That car's starting to intrigue me.

183
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,676
If he keeps this up
he'll catch up to me,

184
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,431
he must really have a
great engine and mechanic!

185
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,077
He should work for me.
I'll contact him sooner or later!

186
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,872
Just you wait kid,
the race has only begun.

187
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,599
I've got you! You'll be
heading round the bend soon!

188
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,910
Perfect!
I'll show you!

189
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,359
- This is it!
- He won't stand a chance!

190
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,752
Okay!

191
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,277
Come on!

192
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,757
This is it!

193
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,677
I'm the fastest! Nobody
in the world can beat me!

194
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,514
Wonderful!
That engine is perfect!

195
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,277
What is he doing?

196
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,708
You idiot!
Out of the way!

197
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,268
It's time for my payback,
Gunma!

198
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,272
Take this!

199
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,596
Goodbye, brat!

200
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,959
Damn!
This isn't over yet!

201
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,030
Hey, kid, what are you doing?

202
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,029
No!

203
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,557
What are you doing?

204
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,556
- Isn't it obvious?
- Don't be stupid!

205
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,757
- Gunma!
- Sempai!

206
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,671
You're a lunatic!

207
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,194
I've done nothing
but return the favor!

208
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,116
- Stop it, Gunma!
- Just remember,

209
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,351
- You started it first! !
- What?! You provoked me!

210
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,193
You pushed me
to the edge of the road!

211
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,511
And you were the one
who started throwing shoes!

212
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,319
You don't understand!
That was in self-defense!

213
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,755
- Calm down, Gunma!
- Get off me! Get off me!

214
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,796
I'll have to teach you some manners.

215
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,871
- If I catch you, I ...
- That's enough!

216
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,837
This isn't over yet!

217
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,514
I'll give you a crash
course in manners!

218
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,114
- Please don't be reckless! !
- Don't worry!

219
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,156
I'll obey the rules!

220
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,760
No one can scold
me over my behavior!

221
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,758
I only responded
to his provocations!

222
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,356
Get your hands off of me!

223
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,319
I'd like to know which one
of you guys is his mechanic!

224
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,279
- Gunma!
- Stop being so barbaric!

225
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,870
You can't keep acting like this,
Gunma!

226
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,357
Sempai!

227
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,950
I'll teach you!

228
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,470
I'm dreaming!
This is just a dream!

229
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,595
For heaven's sake! Someone wake
me from this bad nightmare!

230
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,351
The cars used in F1
are not made from metal,

231
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,357
but from carbon fiber,

232
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,635
a special material
that is light and robust.

233
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,358
In the next episode:

234
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,271
"Gunma's in a Pinch!
Rival Hiziri! Approaches Tamotsu".

235
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,272
I will not let anybody,
to overtake me!

236
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:13,900
Freak-Out Tonight,
It's Forbidden

237
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:19,850
Freak-Out Tonight,
Dangerous Motion

238
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:26,150
I want to forget that
lonely and loud me

239
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:35,950
Like Clockwork, don't be a
loner in the crowd

240
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:44,850
Don't you let
anyone ever stop you

241
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:50,550
These feelings
just flare up

242
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:55,550
Let's FREAK-OUT Together,
Beyond the night

243
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:02,550
The fantasy penetrates through you

244
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:07,750
Keep FREAK-OUT Forever,
don't be afraid of you're wounds

245
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:15,600
You must unravel
the past, Far Away

1
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:10,928
Hey, what about her?
She's so hot!

2
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,329
Not really.

3
00:01:12,872 --> 00:01:13,930
What about her?

4
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,941
Foreigner, Foreigner!
Oh, mother father!

5
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,145
Not interested.

6
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,941
What about her?
Over there, Wow.

7
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,713
Not looking for beauty, man.

8
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:28,816
How about her?
Right there!

9
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:30,013
Man, she's perfect!

10
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,517
What? Have you lost your mind?

11
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,628
Why not, man. Look at her face.
Doesn't she look like a nice person?

12
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,422
Come on.

13
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,139
Excuse me!

14
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,113
Wha... what is it?

15
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:00,517
Oh my...

16
00:02:00,653 --> 00:02:02,314
Sorry to bother you, but...

17
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:06,519
- Can I ask you a favor?
- A favor?

18
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,421
Can I get some breast milk?

19
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:12,131
What?

20
00:02:12,565 --> 00:02:14,533
I know it's embarrassing.

21
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,431
It's not for me.

22
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,628
What the...

23
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:22,434
What do you take me for?
Do I look that easy to you?

24
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,338
You look so normal and nice.

25
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:28,436
Why don't you breastfeed him
yourself? Forever!

26
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,315
Man, you're driving me nuts.

27
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,922
Would it kill you
to just drink formula?

28
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,025
Man, stop crying!

29
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,631
You are driving me crazy.

30
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,536
Can someone get me
some breast milk?

31
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:09,311
Baby & Me

32
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:15,321
7 days earlier

33
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,111
Didn't I tell you to stay out of trouble or what?

34
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,618
Nah, man. They started it
first.

35
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:19,214
And he hit me in the head. It hurts
real bad, man!

36
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,723
Are you in a gang?

37
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,630
No, sir.

38
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:32,534
Then, are you trying
to be a fighter like Fedor?

39
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:40,538
No, I want to father...

40
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,545
Fa... ther...?

41
00:04:56,863 --> 00:04:58,831
Father!

42
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:13,642
What's the matter with you?
You'll kill him, for real!

43
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,915
You're just as bad, tough guy!

44
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,418
If you're just gonna be trouble
all the time, go get married

45
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:25,115
and have a son just like you.
You'll know what a pain that would be.

46
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:46,742
Best School of the Year
For Sex Education & Good Manners

47
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,032
Hey!

48
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,139
Do you have a death wish
or something?

49
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,012
What are you doing?

50
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:44,027
I'm 01020853055.
What's yours?

51
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,539
What the hell?

52
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,341
Yo, man!

53
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,913
Yes, sir!

54
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,711
Valet!

55
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,322
Same place I parked it last?

56
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,617
Okay.

57
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:23,137
What are you?
Students or gang members?

58
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,143
It hasn't even been a week
since you guys were punished.

59
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,041
Ma'am, it wasn't our fault.

60
00:07:28,181 --> 00:07:30,706
Those jerks called us first.

61
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:35,018
If you hadn't done anything,
why would they call you out, huh?

62
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:37,122
It takes two to tango,
don't you know?

63
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,225
Tomorrow,
the committee will decide

64
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,526
whether to suspend
or expel you idiots.

65
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,329
Just be ready!

66
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,234
One last thing.
Bring your parents tomorrow!

67
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:56,535
Tell Gi-Seok he'd better be
at school tomorrow.

68
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,515
Going to school now.

69
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,021
Hurry up.
Don't beat up any kids today.

70
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,427
Numbers 2 through 5 are
at school.

71
00:08:17,563 --> 00:08:21,522
No. 1 went out,
6 is here, 7 here,

72
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:26,336
9 here...
Wait, where's 8?

73
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:31,336
Honey, No. 8 is missing.

74
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:33,035
Look again.

75
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,342
Kim Bohm!

76
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,021
There you are.
Come here.

77
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,328
Mom!

78
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,225
Did you go out
in your pajamas again?

79
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,825
I want to go to school!

80
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,538
What'd she say?

81
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,131
She wants to go back to school!

82
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:03,435
School?

83
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:28,132
This is Byeol Kim. She will be
joining our class starting today.

84
00:09:28,267 --> 00:09:29,427
Hi!

85
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,528
She used to go to
the prestigious Science High School,

86
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:34,731
which you guys
can't even dream to get in.

87
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:37,342
She stayed at the top of
her class the entire time.

88
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,137
Feel free to ask her
any questions!

89
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:43,442
Let's see.
The best seat for you is...

90
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:54,222
That is actually
the very worst seat.

91
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,922
What?

92
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,531
Hi, we meet again.
I'm Byeol Kim.

93
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:01,826
This must be
what they call 'destiny'.

94
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:09,235
Since she chose to sit next to you
make sure you be good to her, okay?

95
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:12,444
That'll be all.

96
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,739
- Attention!
- Enough with your brown-nosing.

97
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:31,021
Go find some place else,
when you have a chance, ok?

98
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:35,431
Go away!

99
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,832
Go!

100
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,729
You have mucus in your eye.

101
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,538
What?

102
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:48,942
I knew that...

103
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:52,216
Not there, the left eye.

104
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,420
Did you get a hold of Gi-Seok?

105
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,620
He's not answering his phone.
I'll stop by his place later.

106
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,733
Tyson might expel him
for good this time.

107
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:09,732
Man, seemed serious.

108
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,532
Why can't he just come to school?

109
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,438
Got a smoke?

110
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,337
- Yeah, you got a light?
- Yeah.

111
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,609
Hey, what are you doing?

112
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,311
Smoking is against school policy.
Students must not smoke.

113
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,615
In a cigarette, there are 2,000
chemicals bad for your health.

114
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,418
It is so toxic that it's already
classified as drugs in the U.S.

115
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,825
And smokers are twice as likely
to get cancer than non-smokers.

116
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:40,227
Hey, shut up.
Go away!

117
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,833
Give it back!

118
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,529
Especially smokers who start smoking
before the age of 20 are more likely to develop

119
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,934
lung cancer, laryngeal cancer, oral cancer,
esophageal cancer, bladder cancer,

120
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:50,531
pancreatic carcinoma and
other cancer like diseases.

121
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:53,839
Yo, get outta here!

122
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,408
Well, it's still bad for you!

123
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,518
Where the hell did
that alien come from?

124
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:04,721
She hit me in the head!

125
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,318
What, did Tyson send you?

126
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,024
Tyson didn't seem
to have a choice.

127
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,534
She tried her best, but...

128
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,831
the vice principal is
really on our case.

129
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:24,340
Well, so be it. I can live without
a high school diploma.

130
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,337
You know it's like not that.

131
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,609
Show your face
at school once in a while.

132
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,417
If I had time for that,
I'd get another part-time job.

133
00:12:52,471 --> 00:12:53,631
Mom!

134
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:57,035
Dad!

135
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,820
Dear Joon-Soo,
You're too much for us to handle.

136
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,022
So we are...
leaving home.

137
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,134
Your school called again.

138
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:28,732
I'm tired of showing up
at your school everyday.

139
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:40,111
The day you pull yourself together
and clean up your mess, we will be back.

140
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,720
Until then, GOOD LUCK!

141
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,719
Of course,
the credit card is suspended.

142
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:50,022
$100 is a lot of money.
Be frugal.

143
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,433
What the hell?

144
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:01,631
Hey, this is a total joke.
What is this, a TV sitcom?

145
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:07,635
Maybe it's better this way.
No one at home is bothering me.

146
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,307
What, mud snail?

147
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,111
Tell Gi-Seok
we're having a party tonight.

148
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,812
It's been a while. We are
gonna get it on tonight!

149
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:21,224
Girls? No, thanks.

150
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,823
I don't believe in
your idea of pretty girls.

151
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:30,725
Hey, enough. Tonight, it's going
to be just three of us, okay?

152
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,417
What's this?

153
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:52,417
We have a 5
to 6 months old male infant

154
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:56,119
in our custody
at the customer service office.

155
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,729
Ifyou are
looking for your baby boy,

156
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:01,128
please come
to the customer service office.

157
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,734
How long do I have to wait here?

158
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,929
I'm kinda busy, you know?

159
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:10,135
Why can't you guys look for
the baby's mother?

160
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,738
If the baby's mother
doesn't show up,

161
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:18,009
we have to call the police
and need you here as a witness.

162
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,917
Well, I haven't witnessed anything!

163
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:27,820
Then, write down where you go
to school and your homeroom.

164
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,824
Why?

165
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:34,025
Aren't you a little annoying?
It's all part of the procedure.

166
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,534
Look. There is a note.

167
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,937
Myung Seong High School
Senior, Han Joon-Soo

168
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,739
I thought it'd be best for the baby
to be raised by his father...

169
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,245
The father is
a high school student?

170
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,409
Young kids these days...

171
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:54,719
Are you done?

172
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,115
Give it to me.

173
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:01,419
Myung Seong High School
Senior, Han Joon-Soo

174
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,925
Myung Seong High...

175
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:06,826
It's you! Han Joon-Soo!

176
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,011
He is absolutely and completely
the copy of you everywhere.

177
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,210
There's no question about it.

178
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,822
No need for DNA test.
This is it!

179
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:33,516
Would you mind shutting up?

180
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,526
Who invited her?

181
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,032
Well, I ran into her
in front of the grocery store.

182
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,932
When I said I was coming to
your place, she just...

183
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,438
Hey, what do you want?

184
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,210
I was a bit disappointed in you.

185
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:01,911
But if this is a test from God,
I shall gladly endure it.

186
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,318
You know what they say.
'If you can't avoid it, just enjoy it. '

187
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,018
I'm this close to losing it.

188
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:12,130
So stop bugging me
and mind your own business.

189
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:15,927
I thought this was our business.

190
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:17,228
Hey!

191
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:21,332
Why are you yelling?
You startled the baby.

192
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,532
Don't worry, sweetie. It's okay.

193
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,007
So, what are you gonna do now?

194
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:36,016
Like he has a choice?
He'd better raise him well.

195
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,321
I don't know.

196
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,326
Yo, who could be the mom? Think!

197
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,627
Be quiet!

198
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,628
I am thinking already, alright?

199
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:54,931
Nice bedroom!

200
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,135
Woo-Rahm is asleep now.

201
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,445
Hey, what are you still doing here?

202
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,046
But I'm your BFF!

203
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:05,207
BFF my ass...

204
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:08,615
Be nice. You should be thanking her
for watching Woo-Rahm.

205
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,419
- Want a beer?
- No thanks.

206
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:13,718
Alcohol reduces
the white blood cell count,

207
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,326
which deteriorates
the immune system

208
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,328
and impairs judgment, and also...

209
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:20,022
You, get out!

210
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,623
The way I see it, the baby
matters the most right now.

211
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,930
A new life deserves to be blessed.

212
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:28,835
Think about what you can do
to raise him well, as his father.

213
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:31,738
I said, GET OUT!

214
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,640
OK, Wooram's daddy.

215
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:41,010
What? Daddy? Me?

216
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,711
Does that make sense?

217
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,117
Yup.

218
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,223
Mother?

219
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,927
Get back inside, if you're not gonna
help. You're getting in my way.

220
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:58,525
How would you feel about
a son-in-law, who's got a kid?

221
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,933
Are you working on
a soap opera script, now?

222
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,234
Mother!

223
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,034
Maybe not.

224
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,725
Welcome.
Come this way, please.

225
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:24,829
Two guests going in.

226
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,930
Han Joon-Soo...

227
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,128
What are you doing here?

228
00:19:33,772 --> 00:19:35,831
It's been a long time.

229
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:38,539
How have you been?

230
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,637
What brings you here?

231
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,408
Are you possibly...
this baby's mom?

232
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,710
What?

233
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,513
What in the world do you
think you're doing?

234
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,827
What's happening to me?

235
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:00,430
Who is she then?

236
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,232
Who are you?

237
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,529
I'm going crazy!

238
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,536
Keep it down.
I'm making your food now.

239
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,314
Hey, don't you wanna eat?
Why are you kicking your meal?

240
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:25,518
What are you, a gangster? Huh?

241
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,919
Where the hell did you come from?

242
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,723
What are you?

243
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,430
Don't you move, buddy.

244
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:40,836
Come on... be quiet!

245
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,941
I'll be right back!

246
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:59,613
When a baby cries, the first
thing you do is check his diaper.

247
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,024
Then you feed him.

248
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,924
And hold him...

249
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:08,226
After that, put him down and
massage his tummy.

250
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:11,632
Now, sit him down straight,
and gently pat him on his back.

251
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,528
Before you feed him, if you're
not sure whether he's hungry yet,

252
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:19,838
bring your finger over
to the baby's mouth like this.

253
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:23,448
If he opens up his mouth and
follows your finger, he's hungry.

254
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,815
I know how you feel.

255
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:38,421
But you're better than your dad.
At least, you know how to smile at me.

256
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,637
Attack!

257
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,210
Can't we just go stay
at the country house?

258
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,711
How can we sleep here?

259
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:07,418
He's not stupid.
Wouldn't he check there, too?

260
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:10,421
Besides, I can't sleep
thinking about him.

261
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:15,732
Whose idea was it to run
away from home anyway?

262
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:23,331
I wonder if he's eating
alright. Oh, my son!

263
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:46,331
Stop crying. Enough!

264
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:53,832
You're driving me crazy!
Hey, I said enough!

265
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:23,130
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

266
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,430
Goodbye.

267
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:36,636
Hey mister.
You, in the hat.

268
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,717
Regular trash days are Tuesdays,
Thursdays, and Saturdays.

269
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:46,222
If you leave it out any day,
you can be fined.

270
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,326
Pick it back up already!

271
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,231
Sir, I'm not throwing this away.

272
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,128
This is a baby. A baby!

273
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,532
I was just checking out
the recycling bins.

274
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,128
Why would they throw out
perfectly good stuff?

275
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,432
I was just gonna take this, here.

276
00:24:04,576 --> 00:24:07,044
This seems usable, right?

277
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,147
Good night!

278
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,734
I must be out of my mind.

279
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:40,540
Having a baby at this age...

280
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,115
Putting this tiny bundle of joy
through hell...

281
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:52,520
If I said I had a baby because
I couldn't afford a condom,

282
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,719
who would believe me?

283
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,725
I should just kill myself

284
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:10,630
after sending this little
one to an orphanage.

285
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:16,538
I have been thinking this for
a while until today I met you.

286
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:24,113
You changed my mind.

287
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,923
At least, you're still young.

288
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,623
What couldn't you do
to keep this baby fed?

289
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:42,537
Don't you give up.
Don't ever give up!

290
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:50,241
Hey, you there!

291
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,914
Come over here. Come.

292
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:03,119
So, you mean...
you live around here?

293
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:07,320
Do I look like someone
who would abandon

294
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:10,628
his child at an orphanage
like you two?

295
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,728
Yes.

296
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:17,035
Who could do that
to their own kid?

297
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:18,938
Is that what a parent should do?

298
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,816
At least,
it's better late than never.

299
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:31,820
Stop by sometime.

300
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,525
Newspaper!

301
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,737
Come on, drink up!

302
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:55,038
Say ah!

303
00:26:57,549 --> 00:26:59,414
I should have
just left you there last night.

304
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:04,515
Come on. Just drink it.

305
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,617
Don't drink it then.

306
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,223
Hello?

307
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:13,331
Who told you to turn off
your cell phone, huh?

308
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,933
I told you.
I can't come to school today.

309
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:19,230
Are you kidding me?
Where are you?

310
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:22,230
I'm at Gyeongpodae right now.

311
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:24,239
I came to visit a friend
in the south coast.

312
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:27,743
What did you say,
Gyeongpodae beach?

313
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:29,744
That's in the east coast,
not south, you fool!

314
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,213
Come right away. Got it?

315
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:37,219
I appreciate you pointing that out,
but I can't go to school.

316
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,414
Listen. Ifyou don't show up,

317
00:27:39,557 --> 00:27:41,718
you're going to be expelled,
for real.

318
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,721
I really can't!

319
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:48,822
You don't want to test me.
Sprint over here in 3 seconds. Hop to!

320
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:52,130
Hello? Hello?

321
00:27:55,974 --> 00:27:58,340
How do you suppose
I go to school with you?

322
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,729
Just stay right here.
I will be right back, OK?

323
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:32,837
I said I'll be there in a minute.

324
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,811
No person allowed.

325
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,729
I'm really sorry.

326
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,234
What is this, a party?
Kids...

327
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,438
So you were saying...

328
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:09,338
the baby you're holding
right now is yours, correct?

329
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,709
Yes.

330
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:14,819
What?

331
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:16,814
You crazy son of a b...

332
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,025
Have you completely
lost your mind?

333
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:29,231
Let's say he's yours.
But why did you bring him to school?

334
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:30,732
Where are your parents?

335
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:34,532
- They ran away from home.
- What? They ran away?

336
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:46,912
Enough now.

337
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,814
You're gonna make him cry.

338
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:53,014
Wait a second.
Oh, this smell...

339
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,622
Who farted?
The stink's got some kink.

340
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,333
He pooped.

341
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,635
Don't you guys poop?

342
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,208
Hey!

343
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:20,012
Do you think
the school is some day care?

344
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,413
Get rid of that thing already!

345
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:46,436
Hey!

346
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,811
Do your feces smell
like perfume?

347
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,923
I'm going to get you!

348
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,122
It's a brand new book.

349
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:12,534
There's no need
to even discuss this.

350
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:14,729
Come on, this is inconceivable.

351
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,034
Before this matter
affects other students,

352
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,733
we will accept
his voluntary resignation.

353
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:22,945
This is strictly
a matter of privacy.

354
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:26,608
We shouldn't jump
to any conclusion.

355
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,711
A student is still a human being.

356
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:33,224
This young man accepted
his responsibility as a father,

357
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,916
and came back to school.

358
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,921
Shouldn't we, as teachers,
try to embrace him?

359
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,722
Look, Miss Cho.

360
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,433
Isn't Joon-Soo the one who
always gets in trouble?

361
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:47,126
Have you any idea how much damage
he's done to our school's reputation?

362
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:51,936
If we let him be like this,
the parents will protest without a doubt.

363
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:55,346
Let's take care of this
according to the school policy.

364
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,812
Yes, you should follow
the school policy.

365
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,008
But there is no relevant policy.

366
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:03,120
Like you said, you should follow
the school policy,

367
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:07,919
which prohibits hair coloring
and accessories,

368
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:11,324
short pants. See?

369
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,430
No school policy
against babies in here.

370
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,023
What are you doing?

371
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:16,929
What do you need, Byeol Kim?

372
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:19,628
I don't have your picture
for my photo phonebook.

373
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:25,739
Oh my. Off you go, now!

374
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:28,744
- Run along! Now!
- Okay.

375
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:32,611
But teachers,

376
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:38,116
there really isn't any
school policy against babies.

377
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,819
Let... Let me take a look
at that school policy.

378
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,131
Please, sir.
Just one more week.

379
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:56,138
If she is discharged, she'll die.

380
00:32:56,274 --> 00:32:59,641
Give me just one week. I'll
find a way to pay you back all of it.

381
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,146
You know I gave you a break.

382
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:05,306
I can't help you anymore.

383
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,011
Just one more week. Please?
I'll pay back for sure this time.

384
00:33:09,554 --> 00:33:11,112
You're making this
difficult for me.

385
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,314
- Please. Give me one more chance.
- I said I can't.

386
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,720
Just this once, please?

387
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,923
Why didn't you say anything?

388
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,427
It's nothing to brag about.

389
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:26,731
And this isn't the first time...

390
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:30,638
Well, I just became
a father to a baby

391
00:33:30,775 --> 00:33:33,141
and have been looking everywhere
for his mom.

392
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:38,010
My parents ran away from home.
Just great, great...

393
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:47,918
Take it.

394
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,627
What is this?

395
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:56,232
When you make a lot of money,
buy me a new bike.

396
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,937
I'm taking off.
Take good care of your mother.

397
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,533
Let's go.

398
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,339
Bye.

399
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,328
This stop is Beotigogae,
Beotigogae.

400
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:28,728
The exit doors for this stop are
on your right.

401
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:45,411
Haven't ridden the subway
in a while. I'm so tired.

402
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:55,716
Oh, NO!

403
00:34:57,662 --> 00:35:01,928
Stop!

404
00:35:08,072 --> 00:35:12,736
No, this is an opportunity
from heaven.

405
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,038
I shouldn't turn that down.

406
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:23,114
Bye, okay... okay...

407
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:11,023
Don't get tempted.
Who cares?

408
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:33,718
Han Joon-Soo,
what's gotten into you?

409
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:59,113
So, you're saying...

410
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:02,515
you were tired,
so you dozed off and fell asleep.

411
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:07,022
Then you heard the announcement.
So, you woke up startled,

412
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:13,722
and ran off the train, at which point
you forgot the kid. Is that right?

413
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:30,036
Thank god, you were taped
by a surveillance camera.

414
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:34,309
Hey, bring out the kid.

415
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:45,020
Woo-Rahm! Oh my son!

416
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:49,726
What has this world come to?

417
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:50,925
Even I don't have a kid.

418
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:54,731
And this high schooler is
running around making a baby.

419
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:57,340
Who says I'm running around
making a baby?

420
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:03,142
Listen, kid! Didn't you
just say you're his father?

421
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:05,206
Do you think I wanted to make him?

422
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:08,614
Things happened and
life just got this way...

423
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:11,312
Excuse me!

424
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:14,420
How may I help you?

425
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,820
Joon-Soo!

426
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:26,330
- The kid's mom?
- What?

427
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,631
Well, you're much older, yet

428
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,331
you take this high school teen
and turn him into a father.

429
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:32,339
How beautiful!

430
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:38,310
Isn't this illegal?
What on earth? Man...

431
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,014
Han Joon-Soo!

432
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:49,916
Sir, where are my bag
and his hanger?

433
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:56,728
Sir?
I'm not even married!

434
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:09,843
I didn't mean to...

435
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:12,408
I'm sorry.

436
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:36,236
He's not eating. I think we need
to get him some breast milk.

437
00:39:38,576 --> 00:39:39,736
Hey!

438
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,744
What?

439
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,516
You're nowhere near
ready to be a dad.

440
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,618
How can you have
an appetite right now?

441
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:53,722
Parents are supposed to give up
their own food for their children.

442
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,826
I can see where this is going...

443
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:15,540
What are you looking at?

444
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,016
Excuse me.

445
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,816
How may I help you?

446
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:31,717
Could I possibly
get addresses of people

447
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:34,228
who recently registered
birth certificates?

448
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:35,525
What?

449
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:41,136
This one can't drink formula milk.

450
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:44,833
His mom died while giving birth.

451
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:51,206
My baby can't drink formula milk,

452
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:54,806
...but only breast milk.

453
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:59,412
He's got such a delicate taste.

454
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,429
Which house... could you...

455
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:10,929
Wait right there.
I'll look it up.

456
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:15,034
Please, hurry...

457
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,106
Who is it?

458
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,012
I'm here for some breast milk...

459
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,209
What?

460
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:50,235
Who is it?

461
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:53,741
Hello there. I'm here
for some breast milk...

462
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:54,845
What?

463
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,922
Someone's busy
running around all day

464
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:15,123
while someone's busy
just eating.

465
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:19,532
You, little pig
Eat up, okay?

466
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,537
Really,
does it taste that good?

467
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:35,009
Internet Baby Care Group
Single Daddy's Club

468
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:39,612
Hello, fellow members who
are hard at caring for babies.

469
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:42,726
Today marks our 14th gathering.

470
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:46,318
I'd like to say welcome
to our new members.

471
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,624
Hi, good to see you.

472
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,433
Today we have a speaker,

473
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,231
who is an instructor from
Korea Babycare Association...

474
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,430
Oh, you made it.

475
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,735
Come in. Here.

476
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:01,344
We'll do introductions later.

477
00:43:01,478 --> 00:43:04,914
Take the empty seat over there.

478
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:12,215
Hey!

479
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:14,819
You, that student?

480
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,525
You're the youngest.

481
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:24,025
Ok, now. Let's begin the class.

482
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:27,626
For babies, it's important
to make sure they get vaccinated

483
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,432
at the right time.

484
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:36,045
Baby Han Woo-Rahm!
Please come in!

485
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:41,008
Let's go to your dad.
Here's daddy.

486
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:47,417
What a cute young couple!

487
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,724
- How many kids do you have?
- Us? Nine.

488
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,129
That young girl
already has nine kids.

489
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:03,535
Oh my... How is that possible?

490
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:08,535
Thank you.

491
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:19,414
Finally, all-in.

492
00:44:37,574 --> 00:44:38,836
Aren't you coming?

493
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:41,342
Go ahead.
I gotta stop by somewhere.

494
00:45:04,768 --> 00:45:09,728
Hey, Gi-Seok.
Yeah, I'm on my way.

495
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,909
Drink up, man.

496
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,917
Here you go, drink up.

497
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,918
Have some of this. Say aahhh!

498
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:33,430
- This squid is kinda hard to chew.
- You like that, huh?

499
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:39,529
- Hey, you! Come here.
- Yes, sir?

500
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,035
Come here.

501
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,339
'Daddy'?

502
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:48,434
Selling your kid out
to make money?

503
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,805
What a hard working young man.

504
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,917
I like what you got going here.

505
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:58,010
I usually don't tip waiters, but...

506
00:45:58,155 --> 00:45:59,122
That's hot.

507
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:02,419
30 dollars Here.

508
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:04,220
Thank you, sir. Thank you!

509
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,329
Live hard, okay?
Buy some milk with that.

510
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:08,431
- You may go. Sure.
- Have a great time, sir.

511
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,226
- Ready for another shot?
- Yes, yes.

512
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,138
I win! Okay, I got this.

513
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:22,741
One for you, one for you...

514
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,610
Hey ladies.
I have to go pass out fliers.

515
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:27,717
Could you please watch my kid?

516
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,512
What are we, babysitters?

517
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:34,824
We are on call,
so hurry back.

518
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:38,018
Thank you! Here you go.

519
00:46:38,562 --> 00:46:40,029
I'll be right back.

520
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,039
You like that?

521
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:52,036
Please visit our bar.

522
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:54,838
I'll give you a discount.

523
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,240
Please visit our bar.

524
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,405
Remember 'Daddy'.
'Daddy' is the name.

525
00:46:58,549 --> 00:46:59,914
As an opening event,

526
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,711
we're giving away a bottle
of liquor for free. Free!

527
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:10,620
Ladies! Thank y...

528
00:47:15,365 --> 00:47:17,424
Come to papa.

529
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,537
Who did this to you?

530
00:47:27,778 --> 00:47:29,643
What am I doing?

531
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,614
Sorry.

532
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:39,113
I won't ever
bring us back here, okay?

533
00:47:39,256 --> 00:47:40,723
Don't cry. Don't cry.

534
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:49,032
Well, for the price
of having a son

535
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:51,031
who is the top of the class
and a homeroom rep

536
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:54,433
My mom had to bear the cross
of being the PTA president.

537
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:58,332
'Always be number 1 '

538
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:00,443
That's my family's motto.

539
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:03,705
Then, what will happen
to Joon-Soo?

540
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:09,708
Isn't it obvious?
A trouble maker causing trouble...

541
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:11,821
We can't just sit back
and watch.

542
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,922
Well, it's not a pleasant subject.

543
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,526
I have a study group to go to.

544
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,026
Hey!

545
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:28,638
What?

546
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:30,740
You! I'll get you!

547
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,235
How? By telling your mommy?

548
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,007
Like you are tough.

549
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,617
And you know what? If you ever
make the top of the class again,

550
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,721
I'm going to change my name.

551
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,516
Who does she think she is?

552
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:50,218
'Who does she think she is'?

553
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,123
Creep!

554
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,431
Your posture is very academic.

555
00:48:59,569 --> 00:49:03,130
Mommy.

556
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:06,242
Besides, mood swings!

557
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:17,620
You know this is a very
critical time for all students.

558
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,722
To be fair to the majority,

559
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:22,216
the school decided to
suspend you for a while.

560
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:40,639
You drink one, too. Cheers!

561
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,318
Who are you, huh?

562
00:49:55,759 --> 00:50:00,924
I am your father. Okay?

563
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:07,831
Listen, my name
is Han Joon-Soo,

564
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:12,935
You are Han Woo-Rahm.
You and me. That's all we got.

565
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:14,338
Hey, keep it down.

566
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,513
I'm sorry.

567
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:33,026
My name is Han Joon-Soo,
and this here, is Han Woo-Rahm.

568
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:39,727
I am 18 years old.
And he is my son...

569
00:50:41,171 --> 00:50:50,045
I don't understand why
people don't welcome us.

570
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:52,408
Why?

571
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,510
Hey, man. Are you alright?

572
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:56,915
You, I will take care of,
forever.

573
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,818
I am not a student anymore.
I'm a dad. A father!

574
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:08,122
If you don't want to end up like
Han Joon-Soo, study harder!

575
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,837
Hey, what are you?

576
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,438
I am Byeol Kim.

577
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:21,840
You're in the middle of class.
Go back to your seat!

578
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:23,536
No, this is self-study.

579
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,808
I can self-study at home.
So I'm going home.

580
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:30,011
Who transferred someone
like you here?

581
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:31,620
Go back to your seat now!

582
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:34,519
What you're asking us to do is
forced-study, not self-study.

583
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:37,320
And it's against the law.

584
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:40,521
I'll file a complaint to
the Board of Education.

585
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:43,633
Isn't this clearly a violation of
the education guidelines?

586
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:53,136
And sir, please make sure
you enunciate R from L,

587
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,642
and P from F correctly.

588
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,519
Be quiet!

589
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,923
~ 36 bottles of
beer on the wall.

590
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:14,520
~You take one down,
and pass it around.

591
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:18,330
~ 35 bottles of
beer on the wall.

592
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:23,235
~ You take one down,
and pass it around.

593
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:36,817
Won't you take some, too?

594
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:40,818
Thank you.

595
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,427
For what?

596
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:50,830
Thank you for making Byeol go
back to school and being nice to her.

597
00:52:52,469 --> 00:52:56,030
Nah, I always give her
such a hard time.

598
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:01,543
People don't understand those

599
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,511
who are a little different
from them, you know?

600
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:11,209
- Teacher, I have a question.
- Sure. What is it?

601
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:17,020
I know a little bit about
the Pythagorean theorem.

602
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:21,028
So I looked through some books,

603
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:23,724
but I couldn't really prove it.

604
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:31,137
How can I prove
the logarithm between

605
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,333
x=mm-nn, y=2mn, and z=mm+nn?

606
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,009
Teacher!

607
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:43,814
Teacher!

608
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,215
Just a quick question on
this proof theorem.

609
00:53:46,356 --> 00:53:50,918
You don't need to know this
in middle school.

610
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,326
Okay?

611
00:53:54,764 --> 00:53:56,732
- Teacher!
- Oh dear!

612
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:42,136
Letter ofVoluntary Resignation
- Byeol Kim

613
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,406
So she dropped out of school,

614
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,712
then one day, suddenly
insisted on going back to school.

615
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,009
I couldn't figure out
what had gotten into her...

616
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:51,211
YOU!

617
00:54:53,857 --> 00:55:01,423
It was because of you.
You're a handsome fella.

618
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:10,528
Be good to my daughter, okay?

619
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:16,439
What a good looking kid, eh?

620
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:49,945
Cheer up!
I'm here for you.

621
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,605
I'll always be on your side
- Byeol

622
00:56:21,578 --> 00:56:23,546
Now, that's a real family.

623
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,709
I miss Joon-Soo!

624
00:56:27,751 --> 00:56:31,312
Hey stop right there.
Hold it!

625
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:33,222
Oh my goodness.
What are you doing?

626
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:35,324
Hey, you! Come here boy.

627
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,426
Who says you could run around here?
Walk slowly.

628
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,427
Look what you've done.
Be careful next time, okay?

629
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,428
I'm sorry, ma'am.

630
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:44,724
Make sure you walk on your tiptoe.

631
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:46,335
- Mommy.
- Oh, I'm really sorry.

632
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:47,629
You, get over there.

633
00:56:47,771 --> 00:56:50,638
- Ugh, so cold. Yick.
- Whew, I'm so sorry.

634
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:53,334
How many kids
did you bring here?

635
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:57,412
Obviously they're not
disciplined to be out in public.

636
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:01,107
What did you say?

637
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:03,812
Hey, accidents happen.
They're just kids.

638
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:05,614
Who are you to bring up
my kids' discipline?

639
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,019
Who do you think you are
raising your voice to?

640
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:12,721
I can raise my voice if I please.
How old are you anyway?

641
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:14,830
I asked you first.
How old are you, how old? Huh?

642
00:57:14,964 --> 00:57:18,127
- Come here, I'll show you.
- Oh goodness... Get off me!

643
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:24,434
Ma'am, please calm down.
We can talk it over.

644
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:27,236
- No need to get physical here.
- Sweetie, stop it. STOP.

645
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:29,845
Bring it. Out of my way!

646
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:34,108
Sergeant Han?

647
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,209
Sissy boy?

648
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:40,816
- Salute!
- Salute!

649
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:46,418
Honey, he's my senior from
the marines. Sergeant Han!

650
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,634
Korea Construction... CEO?

651
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:56,732
Wow, that's great.
I knew you'd make it.

652
00:57:56,873 --> 00:58:00,639
You were always so driven.
This is great.

653
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:06,706
Hey, you know...
I'm sorry about earlier.

654
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:15,115
It's okay. Sometimes
you step in dog poop.

655
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:21,325
Anyway, don't worry about it.

656
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:25,434
What's taking Byeol so long?

657
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:27,035
Maybe she went to see Woo-Rahm?

658
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,933
She'll be here soon, I guess.

659
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:33,736
Woo-Rahm?
Do you have another kid?

660
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:38,714
Oh no... We don't.
Sit. Sit down.

661
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:42,511
My daughter,
who is a high school senior,

662
00:58:42,652 --> 00:58:44,415
has this friend who had a baby.

663
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:46,317
They don't know who the mother is.

664
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:49,516
And for some reason,
his parents are not around.

665
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:51,422
So my daughter goes over to
babysit sometimes.

666
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:53,620
- Just to help out...
- You know.

667
00:58:53,763 --> 00:58:56,926
What?
A high school senior has a kid?

668
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,332
Honey...

669
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:04,236
What in the world is going on?

670
00:59:04,674 --> 00:59:09,134
A student has a baby
even without a mother?

671
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,010
His parents are even worse.

672
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,413
No discipline whatsoever! None!

673
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:33,732
Mom... Dad...
Your son is suspended again.

674
00:59:36,472 --> 00:59:41,842
I didn't beat up anyone.
I didn't smoke at school.

675
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:49,514
They just told me not to come.
Because of your grandson.

676
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:59,118
Just because
he may distract other students,

677
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,523
they told me not to come.

678
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:11,234
Man, seriously.
You guys can't even call once?

679
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,335
Don't you miss your own son?

680
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:22,914
What about your grandson?
What has he done wrong?

681
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,217
What has he done wrong?

682
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:40,126
I miss you guys.

683
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:24,705
Who are you?

684
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,407
Me? Who are you?

685
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:30,213
Do you live here?

686
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,321
No, I'm just babysitting.

687
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:35,117
Baby? Whose baby is it?

688
01:01:35,258 --> 01:01:36,725
The owner of this house.

689
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:37,826
What?

690
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:46,025
Oh, you crazy old man.
I'm gonna...

691
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:51,037
Okay, he's coming.

692
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:53,142
Hey, let's get going!

693
01:01:54,677 --> 01:01:57,805
- I'm coming, I'm coming.
- Okay, okay. Hurry up!

694
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:01,110
Just because you got
suspended doesn't mean

695
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,615
that I can be late
for the exam, alright?

696
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:06,313
Okay. Come here.
Come to daddy.

697
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:08,219
By the way,
what kind of job is it?

698
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:11,121
That's none of your business.
Good luck on your exam.

699
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,420
Let's go.

700
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:25,531
Where do you get the appetite?

701
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:27,233
Who is she?

702
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:29,144
What are you talking about?

703
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:31,212
Who did you get knocked up
this time?

704
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:34,009
Aren't you a little old for this now?
Making Joon-Soo's little brother, huh?

705
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:42,324
You crazy old fool!

706
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:58,132
Teacher, I'm sorry.
I really don't know anything.

707
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:06,505
Hey, at least
fill in your name, you fool.

708
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:08,207
Ahh, my name...

709
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:17,121
I knew it.

710
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:22,725
You, lazy bum.
Wake up, Kim Byeol!

711
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:48,113
Sleep. Sleep tight...

712
01:03:55,965 --> 01:03:58,832
This is an English exam.

713
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:04,429
Shouldn't you at least
write this in English?

714
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,307
Don't you even know that?

715
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:15,810
Sleep. Sleep.

716
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:22,715
Come on, man. No.

717
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,520
Not with that baby.

718
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:27,325
Sir, please. I'll make sure
he doesn't get in the way.

719
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:29,431
No! Really!

720
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:31,724
Ma'am, I can really
do a great job here.

721
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,529
You can't work in the kitchen
with a baby.

722
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:34,533
Get outta here. Quick!

723
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:36,729
This isn't the place for babies.

724
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,135
Get going, now!

725
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:39,935
I'll do anything.
Just let me do it.

726
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:42,840
No, I can't let you work here.
What can you do here with a baby?

727
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:44,810
Come on, I said, no.

728
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:48,007
You can't come to work
with a baby.

729
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:50,118
Sir, I can assure you.
I'm really good at this.

730
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:52,414
I said NO!

731
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,818
Sir! Sir!

732
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:00,019
Welcome.

733
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:03,425
I'm a high school student,
and I have a baby.

734
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,329
It would be hassle for me
to work here, right?

735
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:08,130
Why do you ask?
You know that, already!

736
01:05:36,465 --> 01:05:39,229
- How much is the milk?
- 50 cents.

737
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:43,236
What about the chocolate milk?

738
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:40,124
Damn!

739
01:06:40,763 --> 01:06:42,628
God Damn!

740
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:44,130
God damn!

741
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:53,031
You ain't the only girl
in the world, you!

742
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,032
Hey, what are you doing?

743
01:07:22,171 --> 01:07:26,437
You, hold it right there.
I said stop!

744
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:31,806
Hey, you!
Bring me back my wallet!

745
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:37,913
Wait, taxi!

746
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:45,727
Go, go! Hurry!

747
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,829
Let's go!

748
01:08:04,346 --> 01:08:07,907
Excuse me. I'm looking for
a student named Han Joon-Soo.

749
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:10,519
- Are you the baby's mother?
- Pardon me?

750
01:08:11,153 --> 01:08:15,317
How long have you been
starving the poor kid?

751
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,824
I thought
my nipples were coming off.

752
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:19,921
Is she the mother?

753
01:08:20,062 --> 01:08:21,029
Oh geez. No!

754
01:08:21,163 --> 01:08:24,326
Breast-feed him, okay?
It's best for the baby.

755
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:31,639
Han Joon-Soo!

756
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,036
Excuse me, baby's mom?

757
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:35,234
How many times do I have to
tell you? I'm not his mother!

758
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:37,811
Ask anybody.
You totally look the part.

759
01:08:57,066 --> 01:09:00,035
Look at you.
A pickpocket...

760
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:02,428
I told you, it was a mistake.

761
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,337
A mistake?

762
01:09:06,775 --> 01:09:08,834
I had no choice.

763
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:12,414
And, I did give the wallet back
to the owner. So it's over.

764
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:17,315
Are you out of your mind?

765
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:19,120
Are you testing my patience, huh?

766
01:09:19,855 --> 01:09:24,815
Go home.
And I really am sorry.

767
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:33,935
Han Joon-Soo!

768
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:35,626
Sorry to put you through this.

769
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:43,935
Daddy shouldn't be like this.

770
01:10:57,453 --> 01:11:00,911
- Can I get a carton?
- Of which cigarettes?

771
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:11,633
Nah, I'll just take
another can of formula.

772
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:18,133
It's milk time. Excited?

773
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:27,913
By the way, that baby...
Whose is it?

774
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,109
Whose could it be? It's yours.

775
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:36,523
Well, he's mine, dad.

776
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:41,022
There was...

777
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:48,630
There was this girl
I used to date.

778
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:53,633
And she just left him with me.

779
01:11:58,347 --> 01:12:02,010
I really wanted to give him away.

780
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,711
But it wasn't so easy.

781
01:12:06,555 --> 01:12:08,216
Look at the poor thing.

782
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:15,622
Imagine how sad he'd be
when he realizes that

783
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:17,823
he had no parents?

784
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:28,342
I did my best... my very best to
raise him properly...

785
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:38,416
It's okay.
I understand how you feel.

786
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:41,814
These past few days
must have been hard on you.

787
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:47,327
Now stop crying.
A father doesn't cry.

788
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:49,831
Father...

789
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:04,512
First, we get you back in school.

790
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:08,714
For the time being, your mom
and I will take care of the baby.

791
01:13:10,252 --> 01:13:13,016
So please stop
getting in trouble.

792
01:13:15,457 --> 01:13:19,018
Thank you, father.

793
01:13:19,962 --> 01:13:21,930
Okay then. Stand up.

794
01:13:24,967 --> 01:13:26,229
Ready for a round?

795
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:29,328
Sir?

796
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:33,032
Your mom doesn't know
where we are.

797
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:49,223
Do you have a cold?

798
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:52,919
No, I'm okay. I'll just
take some medicine.

799
01:13:54,563 --> 01:13:58,124
- Are you sure?
- Oh, I'm fine.

800
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:04,430
I said I'm fine.
Just go to school. Go!

801
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:10,143
- I'm going now.
- Okay. Go.

802
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:16,317
Hi, sweetie.

803
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:24,518
Sorry to have put you through
so much because of my family.

804
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,425
Don't mention it.

805
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:32,022
It is unacceptable for a student
to have a baby.

806
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:35,532
It is even worse to
bring the baby to the school.

807
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:40,734
Other students might learn.
Learn!

808
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:42,537
I'm really sorry.

809
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:45,908
However, sir...

810
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:49,008
Teachers should never,

811
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:53,019
under any circumstances,
kick a student out of school.

812
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:58,024
They should remain
inside the school.

813
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,527
You must not kick a student out
of the school, on to the streets.

814
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:05,128
Just because a student
happened to have a baby,

815
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:07,733
you suspended him for that?

816
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,138
- Father.
- Let go.

817
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:15,642
Excuse me, Mr. Han.

818
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:19,406
Then, is it acceptable to you
for a student to have a baby?

819
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:23,807
At this school,
we must consider other students.

820
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:25,818
That's why we just followed
the school policy.

821
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:28,320
- School policy!
- Mr. Vice Principal!

822
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:30,823
I told you there aren't any rules
against babies in the school policy.

823
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:38,330
There... isn't?

824
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:41,930
It's not even school policy,
and you suspended him?

825
01:15:42,971 --> 01:15:45,030
I'm going to report this school
to Board of Education.

826
01:15:45,173 --> 01:15:47,437
- Father...
- Let go of me.

827
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:49,644
Your phone is ringing.

828
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:54,411
Hello?

829
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:56,310
What?

830
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:12,729
What happened?
How sick is he?

831
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:16,736
Well, he just spiked a fever.

832
01:16:18,373 --> 01:16:20,238
So? How is he?

833
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:22,537
They're still running
some tests on him.

834
01:16:23,378 --> 01:16:25,209
Guess we'll have to wait.

835
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,614
Why did you insist on babysitting
him when you have a cold?

836
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:31,719
What did I say this morning?
Didn't he catch it from you?

837
01:16:31,853 --> 01:16:34,219
If anything happens to him,
it's going to be your fault.

838
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:35,516
YOURS!

839
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:38,720
How dare you speak to
your mother like that!

840
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:53,340
I'm sorry, father.

841
01:16:56,178 --> 01:17:03,209
Parents are all the same,
young or old.

842
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:07,720
If the kid is sick,
I feel the pain, too.

843
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:13,226
I think I should've been in pain
rather than the kid is in pain...

844
01:17:15,063 --> 01:17:17,122
Don't stay too angry
at your mom.

845
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:25,131
Your mom is all smiles,
but she went through a lot.

846
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:29,837
You and I gave her so much grief.

847
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:38,013
I put her through so much.

848
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:41,413
Joon-Soo is suffering
from pneumonia.

849
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,110
How hard it must be
for such a tiny baby!

850
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:49,413
A mom's heart is torn to pieces.
Wonder when he'll get better...

851
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:53,018
The doctor says
we'll know after tonight.

852
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:55,527
Hope he can pull through this.

853
01:18:56,064 --> 01:19:00,933
God, please give him the strength.

854
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:44,509
I'm sorry, mom.

855
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,421
Have you eaten?

856
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,121
Why so blue?

857
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:42,730
Give it.

858
01:20:48,877 --> 01:20:50,902
Hey, hang in there, man.

859
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:54,309
Look at me.
I'm doing okay, aren't I?

860
01:20:59,454 --> 01:21:00,216
I'm sorry.

861
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:04,225
About what?

862
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:28,808
Sorry.
I couldn't raise him by myself.

863
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:30,713
I just came in
from the States for a bit.

864
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:35,619
But I'm leaving again, soon.
Please take good care of him for me.

865
01:21:43,164 --> 01:21:44,131
What's this?

866
01:21:56,378 --> 01:21:57,811
You bastard!

867
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:02,314
Get up! Get up!

868
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:06,116
If you're human,
if you're a friend...

869
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:08,222
you couldn't have done that.

870
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:17,222
Say something!
Why would you do that?

871
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:36,415
I'm so sorry.
I should be killed.

872
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:38,712
You crazy fool.
Is that all you can say?

873
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:46,619
Listen, man.
I, too, wish

874
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:50,324
I was born into money like you,

875
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:53,935
and do whatever the hell I want.
You know?

876
01:22:55,770 --> 01:23:00,434
But no, I can't.
Screw poverty.

877
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:03,341
I had to give up my friend,
friendship,

878
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:06,514
and even my own baby. See?

879
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:12,008
Cut the BS,
and raise him well.

880
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:17,821
It is my last wish as a friend.

881
01:23:42,650 --> 01:23:43,617
Hey, you're here.

882
01:23:47,255 --> 01:23:48,222
Let's go.

883
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:50,622
Go where?

884
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:55,926
Come on, hurry.
They found his real parents.

885
01:23:56,064 --> 01:23:57,031
What?

886
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:04,133
Newspaper!

887
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:37,429
I'm coming, Woo-Rahm.
I'm coming.

888
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:41,440
Joon-Soo, are you up?

889
01:24:53,254 --> 01:24:55,722
Man...

890
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:13,040
I'm going to school.

891
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:18,712
- Joon-Soo, what about breakfast?
- Joon-Soo!

892
01:25:19,647 --> 01:25:21,012
I'm okay.

893
01:25:25,253 --> 01:25:28,916
Poor thing.
He did try his best as a father.

894
01:25:29,357 --> 01:25:31,416
I know...

895
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:52,803
Hey, cheer up!

896
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:00,912
Look over there. See?

897
01:26:01,055 --> 01:26:02,522
First rank: Kim Byeol

898
01:26:02,657 --> 01:26:09,221
How can you have no flaws
in your grade?

899
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:13,122
I have not once, in the past 3 years
seen him take second place.

900
01:26:15,069 --> 01:26:17,435
You're awesome, for real!

901
01:26:47,268 --> 01:26:49,236
Woo-Rahm is out of the hospital.

902
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:56,238
Don't you want to go?

903
01:26:57,245 --> 01:27:01,204
I think he misses you a lot.
He's all fussy.

904
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:06,712
He found his real dad.
What's he got to be fussy about?

905
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:10,023
You're a coward.

906
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:12,726
What?

907
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:15,222
You know who
misses Woo-Rahm the most,

908
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:17,627
and whom he misses
the most right now.

909
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:22,225
- It's you!
- What do you know, huh?

910
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:25,733
Do you think I miss him?

911
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:28,738
Who put me through hell?

912
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:30,610
Why would I miss him?

913
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:48,929
Joon-Soo...

914
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:52,933
What?

915
01:27:53,968 --> 01:27:56,334
Well, you know...

916
01:27:58,773 --> 01:27:59,831
What?

917
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:06,402
He is... Woo-rahm is...

918
01:28:10,051 --> 01:28:12,212
Why don't you just shut up, okay?

919
01:28:16,357 --> 01:28:17,722
Hey, Han Joon-Soo!

920
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:23,529
Your kid is leaving the country
tomorrow for an adoption. Alright?

921
01:28:53,261 --> 01:28:57,220
I think sending Woo-Rahm overseas
for adoption may be worse than

922
01:28:57,365 --> 01:28:59,629
abandoning him to Joon-Soo.

923
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:02,827
It must be hard,
but think about it.

924
01:29:21,255 --> 01:29:27,023
Woo-rahm,
have a good life there. Okay?

925
01:29:29,163 --> 01:29:33,930
There, you must forget daddy
and grandma, and live a good life.

926
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:44,410
Mom, I just wanted to watch
Woo-Rahm grow up, you know?

927
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:51,710
At Joon-Soo's, I really thought
they'd take good care of him.

928
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:23,307
I'm at the airport.

929
01:30:23,451 --> 01:30:26,113
If he leaves now,
we may never see him again.

930
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:28,119
Don't you think you should
at least say goodbye?

931
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:30,224
Let's not leave any regrets.

932
01:32:04,051 --> 01:32:06,212
Woo-Rahm!

933
01:32:06,654 --> 01:32:08,622
Where were you?

934
01:32:11,058 --> 01:32:13,618
- Hey!
- Han Joon-Soo!

935
01:32:15,263 --> 01:32:18,721
Wait. Hold on!
Hey, get him! Stop!

936
01:32:37,351 --> 01:32:42,015
Let me go! Let go of me!

937
01:32:43,257 --> 01:32:48,320
Give me my baby!
Woo-Rahm, Daddy's here!

938
01:32:49,263 --> 01:32:50,924
You're not going anywhere!

939
01:32:51,465 --> 01:32:55,231
Give me back my baby! Woo-Rahm!

940
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:03,434
Give me my baby!

941
01:33:04,445 --> 01:33:10,714
Let go of me!
Daddy's right here!

942
01:33:14,655 --> 01:33:17,123
I thought I'd never see him again.

943
01:33:17,258 --> 01:33:19,317
- Thanks, mom!
- See you again, mother.

944
01:33:19,460 --> 01:33:21,621
I'm so full!

945
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:25,129
Your mom is really a good cook!

946
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:28,326
So delicious! These mini
octopuses and hot sauce... yum.

947
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:34,130
Joon-Soo, I owe you man.
I will do my best to raise Woo-Rahm.

948
01:33:34,275 --> 01:33:36,835
Why are you the only one
raising him? He's my son, too!

949
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:42,416
This week,
he's staying at my place.

950
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:49,617
Then, shall we celebrate these
two dads with a beer party?

951
01:33:49,757 --> 01:33:50,724
NO!

952
01:33:50,858 --> 01:33:52,120
Alcohol reduces
the white blood cell count,

953
01:33:52,259 --> 01:33:53,521
which deteriorates
the immune system...

954
01:33:53,661 --> 01:33:57,028
and impaires judgment, which can
result in second and third Woo-Rahm!

955
01:33:57,365 --> 01:33:59,128
Fine, I get it. Forget it.

956
01:33:59,567 --> 01:34:01,728
Why don't you and Gi-Seok
go get some soda?

957
01:34:05,072 --> 01:34:08,633
Oh, okay. Let's go.

958
01:34:09,377 --> 01:34:10,810
Hey, hurry back!

959
01:34:13,948 --> 01:34:15,916
You were pretty cool today.

960
01:34:18,252 --> 01:34:21,915
Great! My mom doesn't have to
have a single dad as a son-in-law.

961
01:34:22,957 --> 01:34:24,219
What are you talking about?

962
01:34:24,558 --> 01:34:27,220
- I've got something for you.
- What is it?

963
01:34:53,754 --> 01:34:59,021
When Joon-Soo's Mom was
a senior in high school

964
01:35:21,949 --> 01:35:26,511
I'm sorry. I think the baby
should be raised by you.

965
01:35:26,654 --> 01:35:30,215
His name is Han Joon-Soo.
Young-Sook.

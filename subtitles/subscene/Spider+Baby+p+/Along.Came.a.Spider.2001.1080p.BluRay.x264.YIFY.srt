1
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,990
Tonight was your first
time at the club, wasn't it?

2
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,830
No, I've
been there a few times before.

3
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,630
Really? Well, how come
I haven't seen you?

4
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,040
I noticed you
the first night I walked in.

5
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:42,770
You always stand out.

6
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,840
Well, thank you.

7
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,180
Well, how come it took you
till tonight to talk to me?

8
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,350
You're not shy, are you?

9
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,080
Maybe a little.

10
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,640
You, uh,
you okay with this?

11
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,910
Just taking off
with someone you hardly know.

12
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,980
I trust myself.

13
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:18,620
- What do you mean?
- Well, I believe in human nature.

14
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,650
You know, that people
are basically good.

15
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,720
You're right.
Most people are.

16
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,280
Tracie, you spell that
with a "Y"or "l-E"?

17
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,020
"L-E. " Guys are always
assuming I'm a T-R-A-C-Y.

18
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,690
- Oh, I hate guys who assume.
- Me too.

19
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,740
You look like a James.

20
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,470
Nope, just Jim.

21
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,540
- How about Jimmy?
- No, just Jim.

22
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,920
Oh, come on, you are shy.

23
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:19,570
Look, um, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

24
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,040
I think you have
beautiful hair.

25
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,580
- Oh, you think so?
- Yeah.

26
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,850
Brown Bag, this is
Brown Bird. We have audio-visual.

27
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,980
Do you think it's sexy?

28
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,420
Brown Bag,
close into one click.

29
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:36,950
Yeah. There's nothing sexier than
short hair on a beautiful woman.

30
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,160
What is it about big hair
that turns men on?

31
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,800
What is it about big hair
that turns guys on anyway?

32
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,110
Bad taste?

33
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,310
Look at me.

34
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,850
I want to see your eyes.

35
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,390
Innocent.
Just the way I like 'em.

36
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:03,960
That's him.
That's our man.

37
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,200
Car is registered
to a Jim Gelway.

38
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,640
Brown Bird,
this is Brown Bag, move in.

39
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,020
Mmm.

40
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,650
Mmm.

41
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,990
He's testing, Tracie.

42
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,360
Tell him...

43
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,420
he's got the Midas touch.

44
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:30,490
You got the Midas touch.

45
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,870
That's 'cause
I'm God's gift to women.

46
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,210
You know what I think
you are?

47
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,350
I think you're
a natural-born cocksucker.

48
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,080
And I think it's time you did
what you were born to do.

49
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,990
No.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,760
What is this?

51
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,890
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh, shit.

52
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,200
- You fucking bitch!
- Bust him.

53
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:01,640
Brown Bird,
Brown Bag, move in! Take him!

54
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,740
Take him now. Now!

55
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,800
Pull your vehicle to the side,

56
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,940
- your hands where I can see them.
- Fuck!

57
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,650
Police!
Pull over... now!

58
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,490
I got him, Alex.

59
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,980
- Call for help now!
- Tracie! Hold on!

60
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,620
Don't move, stay where you are!
Stay still!

61
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,660
Alex.

62
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,790
Hold on,
we're going to get you.

63
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,770
- Come on, guys, help out.
- There's nothing to hook onto.

64
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,440
Hold on!

65
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,310
Alex?

66
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,350
Tracie!

67
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,920
- Hey, Hannah.
- Hi, Megan.

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,250
I hope we don't have
that big math test.

69
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,950
- Jezzie.
- Hey, Megan.

70
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,460
Jezzie, guess who
called me again last night?

71
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,460
Oh, let's see, um...

72
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,630
Ah, good morning, Dimitri.

73
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,190
Hey, Megan, I downloaded
some really cool GIFs.

74
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,760
- You want to see them?
- Yeah, sure, what are they?

75
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,900
Agent Flannigan.

76
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:08,320
- Check in Starodubov and Rose.
- Check.

77
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,620
Jezz, what do we call Russkies these
days? Russians? Former Soviets?

78
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,570
- I forget.
- New world order, Devine.

79
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,130
Get used to it.

80
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:24,450
Charles Lindbergh, Lucky Lindy
or the Lone Eagle as he was called,

81
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,810
is our subject today
because he was...

82
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,820
the first man to... what?

83
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,150
- Megan?
- Fly over the Atlantic?

84
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,220
Very good. First man to fly solo,
nonstop from New York City to Paris,

85
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,270
and that was 1927.

86
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,600
An astonishing accomplishment, which
brings us to today's assignment.

87
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:48,870
Let's see which of you can
navigate, or fly if you will,

88
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,880
from our home base
to our hero's website here...

89
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,620
in the fewest number
of links, all right?

90
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,420
And you're off.

91
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,720
Well, that's very clever,
Dimitri.

92
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,800
Megan, might I have
a word with you?

93
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,710
- Save me a seat, okay?
- Okay.

94
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,770
Come to my office.

95
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,590
Take a seat.

96
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,130
Now, Megan, you know I understand...

97
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,600
the particular pressures
of your life.

98
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:23,730
Your father being who he is,
and the enormous expectations...

99
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,170
all adds up to
rather a lot, doesn't it?

100
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,150
- Yes, sir.
- Hmm. But, none of that excuses...

101
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,150
- your breaking the honor code.
- What?

102
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,920
I know all about
you and Dimitri, Megan.

103
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:40,020
We don't tolerate cheating,
now do we?

104
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,000
Cheating? Mr. Soneji,
there's been a mistake.

105
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,330
We only pass notes,
you know, jokes and stuff.

106
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,670
Megan, before you go
any further,

107
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,270
you best have a look
at that.

108
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,010
- Mr. Soneji?
- Yes?

109
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:00,080
This essay,
it isn't mine.

110
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,820
Beg your pardon?

111
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,460
What do you mean?

112
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,860
Oh, my.

113
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,930
Oh, dear girl, I'm...

114
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,870
Oh, dear, dear.

115
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,200
Gary, why is
the door locked?

116
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,800
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- She's collapsed.

117
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,870
She's collapsed.
I tell you what, you stay with her.

118
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,610
- I'll get some help.
- Okay. Megan?

119
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,320
Hey, sweetheart, can you hear me?
Megan?

120
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,520
- Hey, Jezzie.
- Hi, Kila.

121
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,590
Hey, Hannah,
where's Megan?

122
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,660
She's with Mr. Soneji.

123
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,350
Control, I'm en route
to Soneji's classroom.

124
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:23,420
I'm sure it's just
a meeting that went long.

125
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,230
Well, it's against procedure.
Mr. Soneji should know better.

126
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,160
His office.

127
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,510
Mr. Soneji,
Secret Service, open up.

128
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,920
Mr. Soneji?

129
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,700
Do you have a key?

130
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,800
I'm sorry, there seems to
be something stuck in here.

131
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,040
Stand back.

132
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,330
Control, shut down, stop all
vehicles. Lock on Soneji and Rose.

133
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:33,370
So, how many of these boats you have
to make before you become shipshape?

134
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,580
I have never seen a man
work so hard at looking busy.

135
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,020
- Alex, it's been eight months.
- Hmm?

136
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,090
It's time
you forgave yourself.

137
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,540
Vickie,

138
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:07,610
you know that forgiving yourself
is the one thing a person cannot do.

139
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,800
... choose to make contact.

140
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,130
We are currently trying to put the
pieces together as to how and why...

141
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:27,970
this man would murder a teacher
and kidnap a young student.

142
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,640
Here's a photograph
of the missing student.

143
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,090
Megan Ann Rose is 12 years old,
blond hair with hazel eyes.

144
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:38,790
She's 3'5" tall
and weighs about 52 pounds.

145
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,260
She was last seen inside the school
with the suspect around noon today.

146
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,630
We have just
received information...

147
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,230
that senior F.B.I.
And Secret Service officials...

148
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,170
have arrived at the family home
of Senator Rose.

149
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,040
We will go there live as soon
as we have our satellite feed.

150
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,210
Technicians are setting up extra
telephone lines in the Rose home,

151
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,280
all in preparation
should the kidnapper...

152
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,430
Mom...

153
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:46,040
please,
I just wanna go home.

154
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,210
The F.B.I. And police are on the
lookout for this man, Gary Soneji.

155
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,050
- This is a recent photograph...
- We only know that he has...

156
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,120
disappeared with the 12-year-old
daughter of Senator Hank Rose.

157
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,130
How and why is on the minds...

158
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,790
Police are trying to find out
who this man really is,

159
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,860
his motives for killing
teacher Amy Masterson...

160
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,880
We go back live to join...

161
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,110
reporter Alison Peretsky,
who has been at the scene...

162
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,380
since law enforcement
officials arrived.

163
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,790
- Yeah?
- Mom...

164
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:25,730
please,
I wanna go home.

165
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,900
Hello?

166
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,640
You tuned into me,
Dr. Cross?

167
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:38,280
Sounds like
Alison Peretsky at WNKW Action News.

168
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,980
- Gary Soneji?
- That'll do for now.

169
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,360
How'd you get this number?

170
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,920
Unlisted numbers? Come on, Alex,
there's no such thing.

171
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,200
It's all out there in the air. You
just have to know how to grab it.

172
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,840
Hey, how do you feel about
my kidnapping being bigger news...

173
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,610
than your little tragedy
with Jim Gelway?

174
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,780
You ought to give an interview
about what happened that night.

175
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,450
You know what they say about sharing
your pain. It's very cathartic.

176
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:14,470
- Thanks, but I'm doing okay.
- That's good to hear. Very good.

177
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,300
I thought for a while there
you wouldn't be able to get...

178
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,310
your act back together,
and that would be a great shame.

179
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,110
I've been planning for a long,
long time to involve you...

180
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,310
in the fate of our
little Miss Muffet.

181
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,690
Megan. Do you have trouble
saying her name?

182
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:39,160
First-name rapport?
Hostage negotiations 101?

183
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,730
Now come on, Alex, you can do
better than that, can't you?

184
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,240
You think you're gonna dissect me
in three blinks of an eye?

185
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,540
I'm not that easy.

186
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:52,140
But with a little patience
and a little help,

187
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,210
you just might
profile me to a "T."

188
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,380
What makes you think
I'm interested?

189
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,060
They say that when I die,
the case will die.

190
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,570
They say it'll be
like a book I close.

191
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,800
But the book,
it will never close.

192
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,880
Very poetic.
What the hell is it?

193
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:23,850
I've left something for your visit
with the Roses tonight.

194
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,800
You'll find it in your cold,

195
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:31,460
corrugated mailbox.

196
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,480
Time to get back to work,
Dr. Cross.

197
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,980
Megan. Do you
have trouble saying the name?

198
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,210
Sorry, Detective,
this is a federal case.

199
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,670
I've been invited.

200
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,780
We have a detective who may have
evidence pertinent to the case.

201
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,850
- What should we do about it?
- Alex?

202
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:05,480
Special Agent Craig.
Well, I'll be.

203
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,790
Dare I ask?

204
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:14,360
- In my mailbox.
- Anything else?

205
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,010
That'll get you inside.

206
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,380
Terry,
get this to MacArthur.

207
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,390
Who's in charge?

208
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,390
Ollie MacArthur.
Pedigree "Feebie."

209
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,560
Made his bones busting
wackos in the Seattle office.

210
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,620
Soneji, clean?

211
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,400
Clean? Squeaky. Fibers look
generic, fingerprints, nada.

212
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:41,310
The whole school's
a goddamn forensic vacuum.

213
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,680
All he left us was one
very neatly strangled teacher.

214
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,780
Heads are gonna roll
with the Secret Service.

215
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:55,250
Oh, Jezzie Flannigan,
Alex Cross.

216
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,300
Agent Flannigan was in charge of the
Secret Service detail at Cathedral.

217
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,300
- Dr. Cross.
- Agent Flannigan.

218
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,700
I've read your books
on profiling.

219
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,420
Obviously,
not close enough, but...

220
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:12,010
Kyle, this shoe was I.D. 'd
by the Roses. It's Megan's.

221
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,550
Dr. Alex Cross,
special agent in charge...

222
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,580
- Oliver MacArthur.
- How do you do, sir.

223
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,050
Alex, I'll catch you later.

224
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,490
- Forensics.
- Yes, sir.

225
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,190
Senator and Mrs. Rose
are through here.

226
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:29,430
Before we talk to them, you any
idea why Soneji is involving you?

227
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,840
- Not at all.
- This way.

228
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,740
Uh, excuse me, shouldn't Agent
Flannigan be in the room with us?

229
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,580
Not a good idea.
Miss Flannigan is not welcome.

230
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,280
But she's
a material witness.

231
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:46,220
She failed the Roses,
and she failed the Service.

232
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,420
I think Agent MacArthur
has a point.

233
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:51,120
No, he's missing
the point.

234
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,290
You saw Soneji every day,
five days a week, for how long?

235
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,700
Two years.

236
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:00,260
You have no idea how much
you know about this case.

237
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,340
Agent Flannigan.

238
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,460
They say that when I die,
the case will die.

239
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:20,260
They say it'll be
like a book I close.

240
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,670
But the book,
it will never close.

241
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,110
Very poetic. What the hell is it?

242
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,980
I've left you
something for your visit...

243
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,040
with the Roses tonight.

244
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,080
You'll find it in your cold,
corrugated mailbox.

245
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:47,030
Well, for what it's worth,
that's Soneji.

246
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,970
His speech pattern's
the same.

247
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,980
Is he, um...

248
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:57,210
Are we dealing with
a sex maniac?

249
00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:00,810
Someone who might,
you know...

250
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,060
No, sir.

251
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,620
This man has no such interest
in your daughter.

252
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,890
She's merely a means
to an end.

253
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:11,160
What do you mean?

254
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,970
I see no standard procedure
in anything he's done.

255
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,040
I disagree.
This is a professional kidnapping.

256
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:21,140
It's going to be about money,
which is good.

257
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:24,890
But you're saying
it isn't about money.

258
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,650
I think he wants to
draw this out.

259
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:34,170
From what he said,
whatever his motives...

260
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,840
it's very unusual.

261
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,780
What did he mean
about the book?

262
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,340
That it will never close?

263
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,790
I honestly don't know.

264
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,520
Well, I think I do.

265
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,700
Let me tell you
what this Gary Soneji is up to.

266
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:05,400
The last thing he wants
is good crisis management.

267
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,310
What he wants is to confuse.
Rancor,

268
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:11,780
mixed signals, disorientation,
those are his tools.

269
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,380
So, he calls a local cop.

270
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,260
A damaged cop, shouldering
some heavy baggage.

271
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,760
He's using Dr. Cross
as his messenger...

272
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:23,930
Excuse me. The man that kidnapped
our daughter didn't call you.

273
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,940
So your agenda is what?

274
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,470
- To insult the man he did call?
- Mrs. Rose, I never intended...

275
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,810
No, you wait a second.
A madman has our daughter,

276
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,080
and for some reason
he contacted this man.

277
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,120
Do you know why?

278
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,300
No, ma'am. Not yet.

279
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,750
Hello.

280
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,980
You okay?

281
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:31,610
You, uh...

282
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:36,390
got any tips
for helpless situations?

283
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,530
Well, you could
smoke a carton a day.

284
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:45,040
Or you could bounce back.

285
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,780
Yeah, well, I don't see
anywhere to bounce to.

286
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,220
Like to get out of here?

287
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,630
Can I ask you something?

288
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,690
Sure.

289
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:11,640
What did MacArthur mean
when he referred to you as damaged?

290
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,440
Last summer, I let a sting operation
get out of control.

291
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,620
My partner was killed.

292
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:41,620
Hello, Megan.
How are you?

293
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,850
Coming to see you.

294
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,920
Do you recognize my voice?

295
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:53,020
It's me.

296
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,830
Mr. Soneji. Hmm?

297
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,870
I brought you that.
A lovely cup of tea with honey.

298
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,850
I know your throat is sore.
It'll make you feel better.

299
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,720
There you go.
It's all right.

300
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,490
You have nothing
to be scared of, Megan.

301
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,550
I'm not scared.

302
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:21,370
Good. But you're wondering
what's going on.

303
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,670
I know what's going on. You're a
kidnapper, and you're a sick weirdo.

304
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,750
Megan, you're the most
opinionated girl in my class.

305
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,260
- Think you got that from your mom?
- I wanna go home.

306
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:40,660
You will. Just promise me
you're going to behave yourself.

307
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:45,540
Okay?
So, now listen,

308
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:49,410
if you need to use the bathroom
or anything, just press that, okay?

309
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,410
I wanna go home! Now!

310
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,080
- I brought you some fresh clothes.
- Please!

311
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:58,080
Mr. Soneji, please!

312
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,680
This is a fine gun.

313
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,530
It's Turkish.
Handmade, 1924.

314
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,760
That is nice.

315
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,830
My daddy won it in a game
of poker. Aces and eights.

316
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,270
Dead man's hand.

317
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,470
That's about as much
as I know about my father.

318
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:22,040
Have a seat.

319
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:31,950
Do you know of any relationship
between Amy Masterson and Soneji?

320
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:36,190
Amy? No way.
Why do you ask?

321
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,640
He strangled her.

322
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,570
It's an act of passion.

323
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,580
It's a demonstration
of will.

324
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,140
A message.

325
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,320
Take me seriously.
What do you see?

326
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,330
- Dr. Cross...
- Alex.

327
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:58,690
Alex. Woman's intuition,
third eye, sixth sense...

328
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,700
whatever it is,
I don't have it.

329
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,830
Sure you do, you just
don't look at it right.

330
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,900
Every face has two aspects.

331
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,600
Now try looking at it down
the middle, one side at a time.

332
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,050
Would you say this man
was confident?

333
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,950
- Yeah.
- Narcissistic?

334
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:18,350
- I-I wouldn't know.
- Ever see any flashes of hatred?

335
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,790
- No. No. No!
- Anger? Hostility?

336
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:26,300
Look, everything about him
was right.

337
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,530
He was always patient, he was
pleasant. He had a sense of humor.

338
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,940
I mean, he was
the perfect teacher.

339
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:40,820
What do you see?

340
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,160
I see...

341
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,630
No, I mean about me.

342
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,890
What do you see about me?

343
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,940
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

344
00:28:55,010 --> 00:29:00,910
Size me up. Evaluate
your primary material witness?

345
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,020
I see that you're about
to start an argument.

346
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,950
I need to help get her back.

347
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,790
What makes you think
I want a partner?

348
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,160
- You don't. I can understand that.
- That's right.

349
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:16,360
- No, you can't.
- Can I tell you why I don't care?

350
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,240
Shoot.

351
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:29,750
Look, when I was
assigned to Cathedral,

352
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,810
it was a job
I didn't want.

353
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:35,520
It's a far cry from working
rope lines or flying Air Force One,

354
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:39,120
but I have been there
for three years.

355
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,000
I have been responsible
for Megan for three years.

356
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,230
And that little girl means
more to me than even a partner.

357
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,970
Can you understand that?

358
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,750
I suppose so.

359
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,150
Even if I say no, you'll probably
follow me around wherever I go.

360
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,330
So, if it's a choice between
having you as a partner...

361
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:12,070
or as a stalker, I guess I'll
take my chances with a partner.

362
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,180
Thank you.

363
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,930
The student drop-off is there.
That's my morning post.

364
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Students sign in. Cameras are
there, there, there and there.

365
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,570
Motions sensors
all around the periphery.

366
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,410
Foolproof way to keep
the kooks out.

367
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,680
Exactly. We were always looking
in the wrong direction.

368
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,560
- Which door did he go out?
- Uh, that one there.

369
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:53,290
It's a straight shot
to his parking space.

370
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,030
Let's go in.

371
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,340
- His classroom.
- Mm-hmm.

372
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:13,750
He was teaching how everything
on the Internet is connected.

373
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,000
Alex, you got a sec?
Sure.

374
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:23,090
Listen, I think turf wars
are a total waste of time.

375
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:26,770
If I was out of line
last night, I apologize.

376
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:29,840
Don't. I've been there.

377
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,280
- Anything you need, let me know.
- Sure, Mac.

378
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,820
Dr. Cross,
you might want to see this.

379
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,410
- This was Megan's desk?
- Yeah.

380
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:53,440
- What are you doing?
- Scoping GIFs.

381
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:57,970
Graphic Interchange Formats.
They're all Stego-encrypted.

382
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:01,180
Somewhere among the billions of
zeros and ones making this image...

383
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:04,420
- is a string of text.
- I know about this.

384
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,930
It's the cutting-edge method
of passing notes in class.

385
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,060
It's driving the teachers nuts.

386
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,130
How long before
you can access it?

387
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,260
Try never.

388
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,400
You don't crack Stego
without a password.

389
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,440
Would you take me
to his office?

390
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,750
Oh, when you find Soneji,
ask him for the password.

391
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,260
He planted a monitoring virus
on the girl's hard drive.

392
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:33,260
Every keystroke Megan hit,
Soneji was recording it.

393
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:42,200
Good move, Jezz.

394
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,410
Angling for a position
with the D.C.P.D. I like that.

395
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,680
Dr. Cross,
Agent Ben Devine.

396
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,620
Agent Devine is security
systems supervisor.

397
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,130
Well, for now.

398
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,190
We're going to be thrown
to the wolves,

399
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,790
as soon as they find
Megan Rose dead in a ditch.

400
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,300
Now what makes you so sure
that's what's going to happen?

401
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:05,570
Me getting fired
or the girl in a ditch?

402
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,910
Sorry.

403
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,750
I'm having
a pessimistic day.

404
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,480
Tell me,

405
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:19,360
Soneji, did he... did he ever show
any interest in what you do?

406
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,890
How you do it?

407
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,590
The man never talked to me.
I never talked to him.

408
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:31,300
Well, thanks
for your time.

409
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,820
Hello.

410
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,890
What?

411
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:18,430
What do you think
that is?

412
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:26,280
- An empty frame.
- Mm-hmm.

413
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:28,690
Otherwise known as...

414
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,990
A missing picture.

415
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,920
You onto something?

416
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:47,220
Our missing picture.

417
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,230
Mm-hmm.

418
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:54,130
Our Mr. Soneji
has a sense of humor.

419
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,400
He didn't just kidnap a little girl,
he turned it into a game.

420
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,470
Okay.

421
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,550
Let's see what you know,
Mr. Lindbergh.

422
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,600
- My, my.
- What do you got?

423
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,660
Dr. Cross isn't
in cyberspace anymore.

424
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,270
You're at a live site,
looking through a video camera.

425
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:27,340
Those arrows down there
move it.

426
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:34,850
Where are we?

427
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,990
I would guess
we're in Soneji's home.

428
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:42,690
Now we're supposed to
find out where that is.

429
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,700
Oliver MacArthur's office.

430
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,710
Yeah, it's me. Hold on.

431
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:49,770
How about the files?

432
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:03,160
- There... on the wall.
- There's a...

433
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,160
Can you zoom in there?

434
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,800
- "Jonathan... M"...
- "E"...

435
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,970
- "M-E"...
- "L "?

436
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,880
You can't move that around,
can you? It's stationary.

437
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,440
No, there's something
somewhere else, I guarantee that.

438
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,450
- Right there.
- There.

439
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,490
- You can...
- Focus.

440
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,860
- Bingo.
- M-E-R...

441
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,860
"Merc"...

442
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:32,990
"Mercusio.
M- E-R-C-U-S-I-O. "

443
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:36,200
- "Fourteen... thirty-two... "
- "Thirty-five... "

444
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,540
- Granville.
- Gary Soneji is also known as...

445
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,840
Mercusio, Jonathan,
1435 Granville Street.

446
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,350
Well done, Alex.

447
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:55,220
In, in, in!

448
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,230
Eyes open!

449
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:01,660
There.

450
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,650
Not until we get the go-ahead.

451
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,370
His surveillance
was better than ours.

452
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,440
He's been at this
for years.

453
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:27,840
Imagine the patience,

454
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,050
the dedication.

455
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,920
You sound like
an admirer.

456
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:42,770
Well, he's...
he's like a spider.

457
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,420
And I happen to
like spiders.

458
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,850
He had
an elaborate setup here, boss.

459
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,860
Want to see how he
stayed clean at school?

460
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:02,590
It laminates a plastic veneer
over your hands.

461
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,000
Look at this.

462
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:11,010
It's foam rubber. Looks like he
was wearing prosthetic appliances.

463
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:16,480
I understand the Secret Service
are being cautious tonight.

464
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,490
There is speculation that a full
investigation is under way into...

465
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,720
Yes, Kevin,
one of the Secret Service agents...

466
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:48,320
Evening.
What's the problem?

467
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,090
Help! Help me!

468
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:54,660
You've got a rule 21 problem...
no running lights.

469
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,160
Again. I just replaced
the fuses yesterday.

470
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,990
Help! Help!

471
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,660
Sir, no running lights.
You're gonna have to follow us in.

472
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:08,430
Help!
Please, help me!

473
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,470
Well, let me see what I can do
with the fuse box.

474
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,410
Hold on. Hold on.

475
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,410
I'm in here! Help me!
I'm in here, help!

476
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:23,050
Help! Help!

477
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,570
How's that?

478
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,610
Thanks a lot, fellas.

479
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:47,080
Help!
Help me, please!

480
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:01,500
Help me, please!

481
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:03,840
Help me!

482
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:13,320
"And before the hood
was pulled over his head,

483
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:16,850
"he bragged
to his executioner,

484
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:20,330
"They think that when I die,
the case will die.

485
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,840
"They think it will be
like a book I close.

486
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,600
"But the book,
it will never close."'

487
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:35,050
Soneji was quoting the final words
of Richard Bruno Hauptman.

488
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,210
I'm sorry.
I don't follow.

489
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,560
1932. The infant son
of Charles Lindbergh,

490
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:46,760
America's greatest hero,
was kidnapped.

491
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,790
When Bruno Hauptman was arrested,
what followed became known as...

492
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,810
"the crime of the century. "

493
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,570
I believe that Soneji
wants to do the same thing.

494
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,550
You think we're dealing
with a copycat.

495
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:01,180
Something like that.

496
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,690
Dr. Cross...

497
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,920
what does he want
from you?

498
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:14,590
He's brought me in
and left this trail...

499
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:19,740
because he wants me to make sure
that he's properly appreciated.

500
00:43:20,850 --> 00:43:23,320
But in order for him
to achieve this...

501
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:27,790
he has to kill Megan.

502
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,290
No, no,
not necessarily.

503
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,490
The death of the Lindbergh baby
was accidental.

504
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,800
Nevertheless, it's critical
that we pull his strings.

505
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:39,860
The more we make him
a living legend,

506
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,930
the more likely he is
to keep Megan alive.

507
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,200
Dr. Cross,
you've been brought into this case,

508
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,340
what can you tell us
about Gary Soneji?

509
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:49,280
I can tell you that Soneji
is very determined,

510
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:53,650
obviously highly capable and we
consider him a serious adversary.

511
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,890
What about Megan Rose?

512
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,930
Megan Rose
is Gary Soneji's ace.

513
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,130
As long as he has her,
he's in control.

514
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,150
Sir, would you assign
as many agents to this case...

515
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,090
if she wasn't
a senator's daughter?

516
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,590
The size of our task force
is a reflection...

517
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,690
of who Gary Soneji is,
not Megan Rose.

518
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:28,030
Mr. Soneji.

519
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,040
You can parse
the words if you'd like...

520
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,840
Hello?

521
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,210
I need to
go to the bathroom.

522
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:37,040
All right.
Be right there.

523
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,060
Come on.

524
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,610
Come on.

525
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,560
Hey!

526
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,840
Help!

527
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:18,510
Please, help!

528
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:22,910
Help! Please!

529
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:25,020
Help!-

530
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:36,130
Help! Please!

531
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,610
Help me! Please!

532
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,850
Help! Help me!

533
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,560
Help, please!
Please, help me!

534
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:55,620
I'm comin'!
Hold on!

535
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:00,670
- Help!
- Hold on!

536
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:03,070
Please!

537
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,380
No!

538
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,880
No, please!

539
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:18,060
Please!

540
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:23,070
Please!
Help! Please!

541
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,440
Please!

542
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:34,920
Shh. This will keep you warm.
Here you go.

543
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:38,120
Megan, you promised me
you were going to behave yourself.

544
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:41,680
Because of you, what you've done,
that man is dead.

545
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:46,590
Now... promise me.

546
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:49,570
Promise me you're going to
be a good little girl, okay?

547
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,970
All right?

548
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,100
Say, "Yes, Mr. Soneji."

549
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,950
Say, "Yes, Mr. Soneji."

550
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:02,150
Y-Yes, Mr. Soneji.

551
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,160
Okay.

552
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,930
Let's go have
that cup of tea.

553
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:47,240
I'd say eight hours.
About 9:00 a.m.

554
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:50,770
Slugs are large caliber.
Shots hit him here, here.

555
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:52,820
Kill shot tapped him
crown of the head.

556
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:57,150
This here is Thomas Mathias.
He found all this. This way.

557
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,600
She's not in the water, Jezzie.
Soneji still has her.

558
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,610
There's no way
of knowing that.

559
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,310
Think about it.
Megan is precious cargo.

560
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,680
Soneji's not gonna let
some twist of fate bring her harm.

561
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,690
Right?

562
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:50,660
But why Megan?
Why her?

563
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,100
Come on.

564
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:00,110
Where are you going?

565
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,470
Back to the city.
We'll talk in the car.

566
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,740
You asked, "Why Megan?"

567
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:11,690
That's the question we should have
been asking right from the start:

568
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,560
Why Megan?

569
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:21,090
Who is Senator Hank Rose?

570
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:23,730
- He's...
- Nobody.

571
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,900
Most people don't even know
who he is. Never heard of him.

572
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,010
Couldn't pick him
out of a lineup.

573
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:35,380
This is front-page news now. Where
will it be in two months? Ayear?

574
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:39,760
Oblivion.
Know why?

575
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:44,560
Because Senator Hank Rose
is no Charles Lindbergh.

576
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:47,730
Well, okay,
then, who is?

577
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:52,370
Ah, there's
the troublesome question.

578
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:58,080
Come on, Jezzie. Two years,
five days a week. You know Soneji.

579
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:01,090
Who's a bigger fish
than Megan Rose?

580
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:37,500
Da.

581
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:06,340
Mm-hmm.

582
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,380
Dr. Cross, Agent Flannigan,

583
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:15,680
we appreciate your concern,
but, uh, Dimitri's fine.

584
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,750
Our security services
are more than capable...

585
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:21,630
of protecting the son
of the Russian president.

586
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:24,890
Can we at least
talk to him?

587
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:29,070
Nothing would please us more
than to be of help,

588
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:33,240
but speaking to Dimitri right now
would be inappropriate.

589
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,250
Thanks for your time.

590
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:07,120
What?

591
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:09,720
Well, MacArthur's
dragnetting the bay, right?

592
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,320
And, I mean,
he's not really missing us,

593
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,160
so I was thinking maybe
we could just stick around and,

594
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:18,300
you know, scope out
the place a bit.

595
00:53:20,810 --> 00:53:24,750
Agent Flannigan,
are you...

596
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:26,940
are you suggesting
a stakeout here?

597
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,750
Yeah, you know,
stale coffee, some doughnuts.

598
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:34,780
No, no. That's a first-class
stakeout, Agent Flannigan.

599
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:37,490
What you're talking about
here would be no frills.

600
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:40,900
You'd only get to think about
stale coffee and doughnuts.

601
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:45,040
Well, I can handle it
if you can.

602
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,690
I get the feeling
you've done this a lot.

603
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,750
Oh, yeah.

604
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:48,760
Every chance I get.

605
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:54,760
Especially when
it's cold and wet.

606
00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:10,350
- No parking here.
- We're on the clock, Officer.

607
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:13,720
- Everything okay?
- Everything is all right.

608
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,590
What's the problem?

609
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:54,510
Go ahead, Jezzie.

610
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,520
What?

611
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,720
Have one.

612
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,730
Thank you.

613
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:16,190
Alex, that's Dimitri.

614
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,770
Jezzie, it's him.

615
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:00,280
It's him!

616
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,580
Soneji, hold it
right there!

617
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:31,490
Jezzie, shoot the tires!

618
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:34,720
Jezzie!

619
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:53,750
Jezzie!

620
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:00,920
Police! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

621
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,720
Jezzie!

622
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,200
Jezzie, you're gonna
get Megan back, right?

623
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:34,640
Yes, we are.
I promise.

624
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,700
Use this
to get Mr. Soneji.

625
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,820
I will. Thank you.

626
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,750
You talk to Hal.
I want you to bring him up to speed.

627
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:49,760
Well done, guys.

628
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:51,990
Avert an international crisis
and paint Soneji into a corner.

629
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:54,000
Not bad for a night's work.

630
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:57,470
Soneji ditched a patrol car near
Reno Park. Hijacked a tan Sierra.

631
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,770
One bullet in the driver's head.
Last seen heading toward Route 50.

632
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:05,220
Annapolis. I knew it. Seventy-five
thousand boats. Other marinas?

633
01:00:05,290 --> 01:00:08,620
We're here. Dead fisherman here.
These, all the marinas.

634
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,780
All locked down.
Patrol boats in each of them.

635
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,290
All right, listen up.
We gotta move fast.

636
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:16,060
Roadblock Route 50 and triple
the surveillance in the harbors.

637
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:19,260
I want two choppers on the pad
in five minutes. Let's go!

638
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:36,480
What's wrong?

639
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:42,380
I blew it,
that's what's wrong.

640
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:49,170
I had a shot right before
he hit the hydrant.

641
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:53,700
But instead of pulling the trigger,
I was thinking. I was thinking.

642
01:01:53,770 --> 01:01:56,540
Yeah, you were thinking,
about your shot going astray...

643
01:01:56,610 --> 01:01:58,710
and blowing Soneji's head off,
in which case...

644
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,710
We would never find Megan.
I know that.

645
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:03,340
Well, then, don't beat
yourself up for being prudent.

646
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:07,020
You don't get it. I was trained
to shoot first and think later.

647
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:10,260
Jezzie,
for heaven's sake.

648
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:12,260
If you hadn't convinced me
to stay there,

649
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:14,270
Soneji would have
two victims instead of one,

650
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,960
plus we'd have an international
incident on our hands.

651
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:21,170
- You did good. You did good.
- Yes, but still...

652
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,470
- Anything?
- Oh, not yet.

653
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:27,540
We're sitting on the area.

654
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:30,610
Chief, Soneji's
on the phone.

655
01:02:42,470 --> 01:02:45,410
- Soneji?
- Detective Cross,

656
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:47,740
I want to explain
how the agenda's changed.

657
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:50,910
You're gonna bring me
ten million in diamonds,

658
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:53,710
point five carat,
color "D," clarity SI-2,

659
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:56,620
in a thermos
in nine hours.

660
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:00,320
If the stones are rigged, laser
tagged, irradiated, the girl dies.

661
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,920
- Does that penetrate?
- It does.

662
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:08,130
I'll call back,
4:00 p.m. Sharp.

663
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:10,900
He beat the trace.

664
01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:14,670
Clock's ticking, people.
Let's move this downtown. Let's go!

665
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,980
- Dr. Cross.
- I'm here.

666
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:49,990
The Watergate, 20 minutes.

667
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:52,960
There's a package for Mr. Antwerp.

668
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:55,430
Okay, people, let's move.

669
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:01,770
- Don't lose him, kiddo.
- You won't even see me.

670
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:45,890
- I'm on police business.
- Eddie, this way.

671
01:04:55,450 --> 01:04:57,380
Hi, how are you?

672
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:59,510
Do you have a package
for Mr. Antwerp?

673
01:04:59,590 --> 01:05:01,650
Yes.

674
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:07,330
Yes, sir.

675
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:13,110
Over there, that one.

676
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:27,350
- Cross.
- Leave the phone, leave the car.

677
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:31,260
Pennsylvania and Sixth,
the fountain, 14 minutes, run.

678
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:33,800
Thanks.

679
01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:36,340
- Mac, you there?
- Alex.

680
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,100
He made me ditch the car.
Looks like it's a running game.

681
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:42,200
I'm on my way
to Sixth and Pennsylvania.

682
01:05:44,450 --> 01:05:46,680
I'm left
and behind you, Alex.

683
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:10,740
Bearing onto Pennsylvania.

684
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:21,700
Cross.

685
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:25,260
Twelfth and Madison. Twelve minutes
will get you there. Go.

686
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:30,830
Unit three,
loop on 23rd Street.

687
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:33,350
Unit six, take "K" Street
and double back.

688
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:43,390
You've got four units
on top, Alex.

689
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:53,540
Cross.

690
01:06:53,610 --> 01:06:57,010
Four minutes, Union Station,
main entrance.

691
01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:01,780
Jezzie, Union Station,
main entrance.

692
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:07,790
It's rush hour.
He's drawing them into a crowd.

693
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,830
Hey! Hey!

694
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:40,060
Don't answer that!
I think it's for me.

695
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,900
Cross.

696
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:04,070
- Cross.
- Keep this phone, take the metro,

697
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:07,200
platform "A,"
you got two minutes, go!

698
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:17,980
Jezzie, metro,
downstairs, platform "A."

699
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:37,230
- Cross.
- Go to the center of the platform.

700
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:15,810
Track 15, go!

701
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,940
Go to the first car.

702
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,940
You there yet?

703
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:08,550
- Yeah, I'm there.
- Go to the left side.

704
01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:12,120
- Open the window.
- These windows don't open.

705
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:14,720
You're smart, Detective,
improvise.

706
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,730
Quickly.

707
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:20,230
- Police officer. Everybody, down!
- What?

708
01:10:20,310 --> 01:10:24,270
- Get down! Everybody, down!
- Come on, outta my way!

709
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:32,490
You ready?
All right, now, throw!

710
01:10:51,910 --> 01:10:54,780
We can neither confirm
nor deny that Gary Soneji...

711
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:57,790
was involved in the incident
on the MTA train this morning.

712
01:10:57,860 --> 01:10:59,850
We've heard that a ransom
was paid. Comment?

713
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,360
- I can't comment on any of that.
- What about Megan Rose?

714
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:06,020
I'm not going to go into
any details at this time.

715
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,130
What about Soneji's
state of mind?

716
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:11,140
I'm not going to comment
on his mental stability.

717
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:13,470
You can draw
your own conclusions.

718
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:18,280
Now, Senator Rose has agreed
to make a statement,

719
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:20,540
- So?
- The file on Soneji,

720
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:23,590
- is it still on your kitchen table?
- Yeah. Why?

721
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:25,590
I'm gonna have
another look at it.

722
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:29,490
This business about the diamonds,
money, I didn't see it coming.

723
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:35,500
I am grateful that
the F.B.I. is here,

724
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:40,510
with the objective expertise
to find out where my daughter is.

725
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:42,510
Secondly, I now...

726
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:50,950
This is worse than killing time.

727
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:55,930
Yeah, but you'd be amazed at how
often the small, neglected things...

728
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,300
become the most important.

729
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:02,930
I just got the feeling
we're missing something.

730
01:12:03,010 --> 01:12:06,470
Maybe I'm in
the wrong line of work.

731
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:09,990
Maybe I should take on
something less challenging.

732
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:12,250
You do what you are,
Jezzie.

733
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,190
You mean,
you are what you do.

734
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:19,160
No, I mean,
you do what you are.

735
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:22,560
You're born with a gift.

736
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:27,160
If not that, then you get good
at something along the way.

737
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:30,580
And what you're good at,
you don't take for granted.

738
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:32,770
You don't betray it.

739
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,790
What if you do
betray your gift?

740
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:43,760
Then, you betray yourself.
That's a sad thing.

741
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:52,810
- Who is it?
- Police.

742
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:03,620
Gary Soneji.

743
01:13:03,690 --> 01:13:06,320
Hi, Alex.

744
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:13,530
Now, right hand, thumb and
forefinger. Just give me the gun.

745
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:20,810
Alex, you can't shoot me.
You'll never find Megan.

746
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:38,530
Sit down, Alex.

747
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:49,580
I'm-I'm a little concerned, Alex.
I'm a little...

748
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:52,250
I'm a little worried
that you...

749
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,810
you don't really care
to understand me anymore;

750
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:57,050
that you won't paint
an accurate portrait.

751
01:13:57,130 --> 01:13:59,960
And I need you to convince me
that I'm wrong.

752
01:14:00,030 --> 01:14:03,130
In order to do that, we're going
to have to talk about Megan Rose.

753
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:08,300
No, no bargaining, Alex.
No cheap interrogation techniques.

754
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:10,870
It's transparent,
and it's clumsy.

755
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:13,970
This is between
me and you.

756
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:16,680
I want you to see.

757
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:22,660
I want you to look inside here
and tell me what the fuck you see!

758
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,990
I'm a gift to you, Alex.

759
01:14:26,070 --> 01:14:29,830
I'm a gift to you.

760
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:35,170
And you are beyond... pitiful
if you cannot understand that.

761
01:14:36,580 --> 01:14:39,240
I'm living proof
that a mind...

762
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,290
the mind is
a terrible thing.

763
01:14:53,970 --> 01:14:56,300
I see you've got
your sense of humor back.

764
01:14:56,370 --> 01:14:59,140
Yeah.

765
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:02,480
I wondered what happened to it
during the ransom drop.

766
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:07,820
The ransom drop.

767
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:10,620
That was
a well-earned 12 million.

768
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:14,460
Twelve million.

769
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,160
Senator Rose says
he can pull strings.

770
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:23,180
He says he can fix it so you
keep the 12 million and walk.

771
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:27,870
All you have to do is return
the child. Where is Megan?

772
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:33,030
Where's Megan?
Where is Megan?

773
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:38,310
Where's Megan? Where is Megan?
Where is Megan?

774
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:41,370
She's trapped on my boat, Alex,
isn't that right?

775
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:46,080
Or maybe she's stuck in a warehouse
somewhere or floating in a river.

776
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:49,090
Swinging from the end
of a rope, buried alive.

777
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,270
I envy her.

778
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:03,010
What would life had been like
with parents like that?

779
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:06,640
Come on, Gary, blaming your parents
for what you are?

780
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:09,350
I'm not blaming them, Alex.

781
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:13,120
They've been punished
already.

782
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:21,840
I burned down the house
while they slept.

783
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:29,380
I was 15 years old.

784
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:32,180
Was it what you expected?

785
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:36,920
Not really.
It was a new experience.

786
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:38,930
What, killing?

787
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,870
No, being
in the newspapers.

788
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:49,870
So, in your opinion, Doctor,

789
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:54,610
were my actions
triggered by nature...

790
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,740
or nurture?

791
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:00,320
If you want me
to be brutally honest...

792
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:06,420
I think you just have
a morbid desire to burn in hell.

793
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:13,400
We're done for today.

794
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:18,710
I'm taking her with me.

795
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:27,850
- You're not taking her anywhere.
- I'll send her back to you.

796
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:30,400
You just tell me
which piece you want first.

797
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:33,560
Aah!

798
01:17:33,640 --> 01:17:38,230
Ow! Oh, shit!

799
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:40,710
Damn it.

800
01:17:40,780 --> 01:17:43,580
Alex!

801
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:58,430
Oh, my God.

802
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:00,770
What have you done?

803
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:05,680
What have you d-done?

804
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:12,610
Residents of this normally
quiet suburb are still in shock...

805
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:15,990
as news of the shooting of Gary
Soneji, America's most-wanted man,

806
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:17,990
filtered through
their community.

807
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,400
Apparently, Soneji had attempted
to confront, or even harm...

808
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:22,990
members of the kidnapping
task force hunting him.

809
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:27,340
So, he came after Jezzie
as payback for Dimitri.

810
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:31,300
Ostensibly, yeah.

811
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:33,310
That's how you want it
on record?

812
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:36,150
Yeah, for now.

813
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,690
Here they come.

814
01:18:51,070 --> 01:18:54,980
Dr. Cross, tell me you have at least
an idea where my little girl is.

815
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:58,140
I'm sorry, sir, I can't.

816
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:00,680
You kill the one man
who has the answers,

817
01:19:00,750 --> 01:19:04,480
and you're telling me
you haven't a clue, not one clue?

818
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,690
The man walked in the fucking room,
and you shot him.

819
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,560
Senator...

820
01:19:09,630 --> 01:19:12,260
standing in his shoes, I'd have
done the same thing, sir.

821
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:16,470
That's your job, not his. He's
supposed to find my little girl,

822
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:19,700
not shoot the man
who knows where she is.

823
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:21,710
Senator.

824
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:30,020
It's not over.

825
01:19:32,290 --> 01:19:35,790
The book is not closed.

826
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:58,330
Alex...

827
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:03,260
thank you
for saving my life.

828
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,270
Good-bye, Jezzie.

829
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:15,790
- Wanna hear something funny, Mac?
- Sure.

830
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:19,520
Cheer me up.

831
01:20:19,590 --> 01:20:23,530
I congratulated Soneji
on scoring $12 million.

832
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,660
You mean ten million.

833
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:30,000
Exactly.

834
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:34,100
He had no idea
what I was talking about.

835
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:01,240
I know you.
You work at my school.

836
01:21:02,620 --> 01:21:04,550
Eat your food, Megan.

837
01:21:51,910 --> 01:21:54,440
Alex,
where is this going?

838
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:05,160
We've been through these tapes
backwards and forwards.

839
01:22:05,230 --> 01:22:07,430
I can't see how this is
helping us find Megan.

840
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:12,760
You know
what I see, Mac?

841
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:16,180
Someone was onto Soneji
long before we ever heard of him.

842
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:18,510
Look at this.
What do you see?

843
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:21,180
Agent Devine hauling ass
out to the front gate.

844
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:24,880
Mac, he could have shut this
whole place down from right there.

845
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,330
Now, you wanna tell me
why he didn't?

846
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:35,600
Good God.
Devine was in on it with him.

847
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:38,400
Then, when Soneji hit the embassy,
he pulled a double cross.

848
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:40,410
He ran his own ransom.

849
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:43,850
No, Soneji was a loner.

850
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,980
An accomplice would have
been beneath him.

851
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:48,720
I'll tell you
what happened.

852
01:22:48,790 --> 01:22:51,520
Soneji was hoodwinked.

853
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,790
And so were we.

854
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:59,330
Details are still emerging,
but this much is clear:

855
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,800
The manhunt that began over a
week ago in the nation's capitol...

856
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:05,170
came to a violent end yesterday,

857
01:23:05,240 --> 01:23:08,010
With the death of kidnapper,
Gary Soneji.

858
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:43,180
Don't move.

859
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:45,950
Turn around.
Hands on the wall. Feet apart.

860
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:47,960
Hi, Jez.
Where'd you come from?

861
01:23:48,030 --> 01:23:50,900
You know something, Devine,
you're pretty stupid.

862
01:23:50,970 --> 01:23:52,900
Your car in the driveway.

863
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:56,370
TV so loud, you wouldn't be able
to hear a SWAT team come in.

864
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,930
- What are you doing...
- Shut up!

865
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,470
Where's Megan?

866
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:20,400
She's in the barn.
She was so doped up,

867
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:22,670
I don't think she knew
I took her off the boat.

868
01:24:22,740 --> 01:24:25,800
She's still alive? You were
supposed to dump her in the river...

869
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:30,010
- after you got the diamonds.
- Yeah, well,

870
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:34,080
maybe killing a kid is something
I'm not prepared to do on my own.

871
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:36,960
Anyway, today, tomorrow, it's still
gonna look like Soneji killed her.

872
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:39,970
She can't die
after Soneji, you idiot.

873
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:43,490
It doesn't make any difference.
They're never gonna find the body.

874
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:52,270
Okay, I'll go do it now.
Will that make you happy?

875
01:24:52,350 --> 01:24:56,480
Yeah, it would. Wait!

876
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:02,220
Can I see them?

877
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:19,780
Hey, do you realize
we spent an entire year...

878
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:23,350
following Soneji's
every move?

879
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:25,830
I think
we deserve these.

880
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:34,030
That beats the hell out of
a Secret Service pension, huh?

881
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:38,370
Profiling the profiler.

882
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:40,850
Kidnap from the kidnapper.
That's brilliant.

883
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:44,210
You are a genius, Jez.

884
01:25:44,290 --> 01:25:47,480
Genius has nothing to do with it.
I'm just good at what I do.

885
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:53,960
Didn't hurt that everyone else
involved was a complete half-wit.

886
01:25:54,030 --> 01:25:56,430
You think Alex Cross
is a half-wit?

887
01:25:56,500 --> 01:26:00,200
You really believe that
he shot Soneji to save my life?

888
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:04,650
Cross pulled the trigger because
he knew Soneji didn't have Megan.

889
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:08,450
What are you saying?

890
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:11,920
I'm saying that sooner or later,
he's gonna figure it out.

891
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:14,460
He already knows Soneji
didn't run the ransom.

892
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:18,220
He's onto us already,
isn't he?

893
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:21,390
No, he's not onto us.

894
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:26,100
But I think
he's onto you.

895
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:13,770
It's Turkish. My daddy won it
in a game of poker.

896
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:16,850
That's about as much
as I know about my father.

897
01:29:59,860 --> 01:30:02,230
Megan?

898
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:04,360
Megan, it's me, honey.

899
01:30:04,430 --> 01:30:07,220
Jezzie?

900
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:10,350
Jezzie, Jezzie,
I'm in here! Jezzie!

901
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:13,160
Open up, honey. I'm gonna
take you home. It's all over.

902
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:15,960
Yeah, sure,
just hold on a second.

903
01:30:22,710 --> 01:30:26,050
- Jezzie?
- Yeah, honey.

904
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,810
What happened
to that other guy?

905
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:34,920
He's dead, Megan.
You're safe now.

906
01:30:34,990 --> 01:30:37,830
Open up.

907
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:41,300
- Jezzie?
- Yeah, honey.

908
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:43,930
Why isn't there
anyone else with you?

909
01:30:48,180 --> 01:30:52,340
Megan, it's me. Don't be
scared of me. Open the door.

910
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:00,690
Megan, I'm gonna ask you
one more time to open the door.

911
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:03,290
Right now, open the door!

912
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,890
Megan, open the door
for me.

913
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:08,440
Listen to me!
Open the door!

914
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:11,410
Megan, open the fucking door!

915
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:14,740
Open it, bitch!

916
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:23,650
Stop it! No!

917
01:31:23,730 --> 01:31:25,660
Stop it!

918
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,490
That was very clever,
Megan.

919
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:22,910
Shh, shh, shh.

920
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:08,710
Jezzie?

921
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:14,650
It's over.

922
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:16,660
Drop the gun.

923
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,500
Alex...

924
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:26,640
how-how did you, um...

925
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:29,040
Aces and eights, Jezzie.

926
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:32,670
Plus, your timing
was a little off.

927
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:34,680
I watched the tapes.

928
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:39,550
You and Devine could have
stopped Soneji at the school.

929
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:42,560
Just like you could have stopped
him at the Russian Embassy.

930
01:34:42,630 --> 01:34:45,060
But you had
a different agenda.

931
01:34:45,130 --> 01:34:48,260
You know something, Alex?

932
01:34:48,330 --> 01:34:50,430
When you said,
"You do what you are,"

933
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:53,030
you were right.

934
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:56,230
I'm living proof.

935
01:34:57,510 --> 01:35:00,000
Put the gun down, Jezzie.

936
01:35:05,790 --> 01:35:09,090
Would you kill
another partner?

937
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:11,890
You're not my partner.

938
01:36:27,030 --> 01:36:29,190
Are you all right?

939
01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:33,970
You're a very brave girl,
Megan.

940
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:37,140
Who are you?

941
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:40,150
I'm a policeman.

942
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:46,070
My name is Alex Cross.

943
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:48,700
I'm a friend
of your parents.

944
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,550
Can you take me to them?

945
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:58,750
Nothing would give me
greater pleasure.

946
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:06,270
Could you...
Ah, thanks.

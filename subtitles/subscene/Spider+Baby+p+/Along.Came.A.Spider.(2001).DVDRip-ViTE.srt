1
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,764
Tonight was your first
time at the club, wasn't it?

2
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:32,602
No, I've
been there a few times before.

3
00:00:32,674 --> 00:00:35,404
Really? Well, how come
I haven't seen you?

4
00:00:35,477 --> 00:00:37,809
I noticed you
the first night I walked in.

5
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:41,542
You always stand out.

6
00:00:41,616 --> 00:00:43,606
Well, thank you.

7
00:00:43,684 --> 00:00:46,949
Well, how come it took you
till tonight to talk to me?

8
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:49,114
You're not shy, are you?

9
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,852
Maybe a little.

10
00:01:05,104 --> 00:01:08,403
You, uh,
you okay with this?

11
00:01:08,474 --> 00:01:11,671
Just taking off
with someone you hardly know.

12
00:01:11,743 --> 00:01:13,733
I trust myself.

13
00:01:13,811 --> 00:01:17,372
- What do you mean?
- Well, I believe in human nature.

14
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:21,407
You know, that people
are basically good.

15
00:01:21,486 --> 00:01:24,477
You're right.
Most people are.

16
00:01:31,294 --> 00:01:36,026
Tracie, you spell that
with a "Y"or "l-E"?

17
00:01:36,098 --> 00:01:41,764
"L-E."Guys are always
assuming I'm a T-R-A-C-Y.

18
00:01:41,837 --> 00:01:45,431
- Oh, I hate guys who assume.
- Me too.

19
00:01:54,515 --> 00:01:56,483
You look like a James.

20
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,212
Nope, just Jim.

21
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:03,278
- How about Jimmy?
- No, just Jim.

22
00:02:04,357 --> 00:02:07,656
Oh, come on, you are shy.

23
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:18,300
Look, um, there's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

24
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,770
I think you have
beautiful hair.

25
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:23,306
- Oh, you think so?
- Yeah.

26
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:26,571
Brown Bag, this is
Brown Bird. We have audio-visual.

27
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:28,703
Do you think it's sexy?

28
00:02:28,779 --> 00:02:31,145
Brown Bag.
Close into one click.

29
00:02:31,215 --> 00:02:35,674
Yeah. There's nothing sexier than
short hair on a beautiful woman.

30
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:37,879
What is it about big hair
that turns men on?

31
00:02:37,954 --> 00:02:42,516
What is it about big hair
that turns guys on anyway?

32
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:46,823
Bad taste?

33
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:49,022
Look at me.

34
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:51,565
I want to see your eyes.

35
00:02:54,268 --> 00:02:59,103
Innocent.
Just the way I like 'em.

36
00:02:59,173 --> 00:03:02,665
That's him.
That's our man.

37
00:03:02,743 --> 00:03:04,903
Car is registered
to a Jim Gelway.

38
00:03:04,978 --> 00:03:07,344
Brown Bird,
this is Brown Bag, move in.

39
00:03:13,286 --> 00:03:15,719
Mmm.

40
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:18,348
Mmm.

41
00:03:18,424 --> 00:03:20,688
He's testing. Tracie.

42
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:23,057
Tell him...

43
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:25,118
he's got the Midas touch.

44
00:03:26,197 --> 00:03:29,189
You got the Midas touch.

45
00:03:31,536 --> 00:03:34,561
That's 'cause
I'm God's gift to women.

46
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:38,902
You know what I think
you are?

47
00:03:40,644 --> 00:03:44,044
I think you're
a natural-born cocksucker.

48
00:03:44,113 --> 00:03:46,775
And I think it's time you did
what you were born to do.

49
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:48,680
No.

50
00:03:50,686 --> 00:03:53,450
What is this?

51
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:55,580
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh. Shit.

52
00:03:55,657 --> 00:03:57,887
- You fucking bitch!
- Bust him.

53
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,325
Brown Bird,
Brown Bag, move in! Take him!

54
00:04:00,395 --> 00:04:02,420
- Take him now. Now!

55
00:04:02,497 --> 00:04:04,487
Pull your vehicle to the side,

56
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:06,624
- your hands where I can see them.
- Fuck!

57
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,328
Police!
Pull over... now!

58
00:04:09,403 --> 00:04:12,167
- I got him. Alex.

59
00:04:30,989 --> 00:04:34,651
- Call for help now!
- Tracie! Hold on!

60
00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:38,286
Don't move, stay where you are!
Stay still!

61
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,331
Alex.

62
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,459
Hold on.
We're going to get you.

63
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,436
- Come on. Guys. Help out.
- There's nothing to hook onto.

64
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:51,099
Hold on!

65
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:52,971
Alex?

66
00:04:54,677 --> 00:04:57,009
- Tracie!

67
00:05:28,507 --> 00:05:30,566
- Hey. Hannah.
- Hi, Megan.

68
00:05:30,643 --> 00:05:33,051
I hope we don't have
that big math test.

69
00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:40,750
- Jezzie.
- Hey. Megan.

70
00:05:40,825 --> 00:05:44,261
Jezzie. Guess who
called me again last night?

71
00:05:44,328 --> 00:05:46,261
Oh. Let's see. Um...

72
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:49,423
Ah. Good morning. Dimitri.

73
00:05:49,499 --> 00:05:51,990
Hey, Megan, I downloaded
some really cool GIFs.

74
00:05:52,068 --> 00:05:54,559
- You want to see them?
- Yeah. Sure. What are they?

75
00:05:56,705 --> 00:05:58,696
Agent Flannigan.

76
00:06:02,178 --> 00:06:07,114
- Check in Starodubov and Rose.
- Check.

77
00:06:07,182 --> 00:06:10,413
Jezz. What do we call Russkies these
days? Russians? Former Soviets?

78
00:06:10,485 --> 00:06:13,352
- I forget.
- New world order. Devine.

79
00:06:13,421 --> 00:06:15,911
Get used to it.

80
00:06:17,825 --> 00:06:23,229
Charles Lindbergh. Lucky Lindy
or the Lone Eagle as he was called.

81
00:06:23,297 --> 00:06:25,594
Is our subject today
because he was...

82
00:06:25,665 --> 00:06:28,600
the first man to... what?

83
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:30,932
- Megan?
- Fly over the Atlantic?

84
00:06:31,003 --> 00:06:34,995
Very good. First man to fly solo.
Nonstop from New York City to Paris.

85
00:06:35,073 --> 00:06:37,041
And that was 1927.

86
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:42,375
An astonishing accomplishment. Which
brings us to today's assignment.

87
00:06:42,447 --> 00:06:47,645
Let's see which of you can
navigate. Or fly if you will.

88
00:06:47,718 --> 00:06:51,654
From our home base
to our hero's website here...

89
00:06:51,722 --> 00:06:55,384
in the fewest number
of links. All right?

90
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,188
And you're off.

91
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:20,474
Well. That's very clever.
Dimitri.

92
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:57,541
Megan. Might I have
a word with you?

93
00:07:57,614 --> 00:08:00,447
- Save me a seat. Okay?
- Okay.

94
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:02,508
Come to my office.

95
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,322
Take a seat.

96
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:15,857
Now. Megan. You know I understand...

97
00:08:15,931 --> 00:08:18,331
the particular pressures
of your life.

98
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,461
Your father being who he is.
And the enormous expectations...

99
00:08:22,537 --> 00:08:24,903
all adds up to
rather a lot. Doesn't it?

100
00:08:24,973 --> 00:08:29,875
- Yes. Sir.
- Hmm. But. None of that excuses...

101
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:32,879
- your breaking the honor code.
- What?

102
00:08:32,947 --> 00:08:35,643
I know all about
you and Dimitri. Megan.

103
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:38,741
We don't tolerate cheating.
Now do we?

104
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,719
Cheating? Mr. Soneji.
There's been a mistake.

105
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,052
We only pass notes.
You know. Jokes and stuff.

106
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:46,386
Megan. Before you go
any further.

107
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:48,983
You best have a look
at that.

108
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:55,729
- Mr. Soneji?
- Yes?

109
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,792
This essay.
It isn't mine.

110
00:08:58,869 --> 00:09:00,530
Beg your pardon?

111
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,173
What do you mean?

112
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:07,573
Oh. My.

113
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:10,636
Oh. Dear girl. I'm...

114
00:09:10,714 --> 00:09:12,579
Oh. Dear. Dear.

115
00:09:37,904 --> 00:09:39,895
Gary, why is
the door locked?

116
00:09:39,973 --> 00:09:42,498
- Oh. My God. What happened?
- She's collapsed.

117
00:09:42,576 --> 00:09:44,567
She's collapsed.
I tell you what. You stay with her.

118
00:09:44,644 --> 00:09:47,305
- I'll get some help.
- Okay. Megan?

119
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,009
Hey, sweetheart, can you hear me?
Megan?

120
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:57,211
- Hey. Jezzie.
- Hi. Kila.

121
00:09:57,288 --> 00:09:59,279
Hey. Hannah.
Where's Megan?

122
00:09:59,357 --> 00:10:01,348
She's with Mr. Soneji.

123
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,032
Control. I'm en route
to Soneji's classroom.

124
00:10:20,109 --> 00:10:22,100
I'm sure it's just
a meeting that went long.

125
00:10:22,178 --> 00:10:25,909
Well. It's against procedure.
Mr. Soneji should know better.

126
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,828
His office.

127
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,174
Mr. Soneji.
Secret Service. Open up.

128
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,577
Mr. Soneji?

129
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:10,353
Do you have a key?

130
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,451
I'm sorry. There seems to
be something stuck in here.

131
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:20,689
Stand back.

132
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,974
Control. Shut down. Stop all
vehicles. Lock on Soneji and Rose.

133
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:31,993
So, how many of these boats you have
to make before you become shipshape?

134
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:40,198
I have never seen a man
work so hard at looking busy.

135
00:12:42,604 --> 00:12:45,630
- Alex. It's been eight months.
- Hmm?

136
00:12:45,707 --> 00:12:48,698
It's time
you forgave yourself.

137
00:12:57,884 --> 00:13:01,149
Vickie.

138
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:06,215
You know that forgiving yourself
is the one thing a person cannot do.

139
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,606
...choose to make contact.

140
00:13:19,677 --> 00:13:22,942
We are currently trying to put the
pieces together as to how and why...

141
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:26,780
this man would murder a teacher
and kidnap a young student.

142
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:29,444
Here's a photograph
of the missing student.

143
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,888
Megan Ann Rose is 12 years old.
Blond hair with hazel eyes.

144
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:37,586
She's 3'5"tall
and weighs about 52 pounds.

145
00:13:37,661 --> 00:13:42,063
She was last seen inside the school
with the suspect around noon today.

146
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:44,429
We havejust
received information...

147
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,025
that senior F.B.I.
And Secret Service officials...

148
00:13:47,102 --> 00:13:49,968
have arrived at the family home
of Senator Rose.

149
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:53,838
We will go there live as soon
as we have our satellite feed.

150
00:13:53,908 --> 00:13:57,002
Technicians are setting up extra
telephone lines in the Rose home,

151
00:13:57,078 --> 00:13:59,068
all in preparation
should the kidnapper...

152
00:14:37,214 --> 00:14:39,204
Mom...

153
00:14:40,316 --> 00:14:44,810
please.
I just wanna go home.

154
00:14:44,888 --> 00:14:48,983
The F.B.I. And police are on the
lookout for this man. Gary Soneji.

155
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:51,821
- This is a recent photograph...
- We only know that he has...

156
00:14:51,894 --> 00:14:54,886
disappeared with the 12-year-old
daughter of Senator Hank Rose.

157
00:14:54,963 --> 00:14:56,897
How and why is on the minds...

158
00:14:56,965 --> 00:14:59,558
Police are trying to find out
who this man really is,

159
00:14:59,634 --> 00:15:03,627
his motives for killing
teacher Amy Masterson...

160
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:05,638
- We go back live to join...

161
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:07,867
reporter Alison Peretsky,
who has been at the scene...

162
00:15:07,942 --> 00:15:10,136
since law enforcement
officials arrived.

163
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:19,541
- Yeah?
-  Mom...

164
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:24,487
please.
I wanna go home.

165
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,650
Hello?

166
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,394
You tuned into me.
Dr. Cross?

167
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:37,025
Sounds like
Alison Peretsky at WNKW Action News.

168
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:40,729
- Gary Soneji?
- That'll do for now.

169
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:46,108
How'd you get this number?

170
00:15:46,176 --> 00:15:49,667
Unlisted numbers? Come on. Alex.
There's no such thing.

171
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:52,942
It's all out there in the air. You
just have to know how to grab it.

172
00:15:53,015 --> 00:15:56,576
Hey. How do you feel about
my kidnapping being bigger news...

173
00:15:56,652 --> 00:15:59,347
than your little tragedy
with Jim Gelway?

174
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:03,517
You ought to give an interview
about what happened that night.

175
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:08,188
You know what they say about sharing
your pain. It's very cathartic.

176
00:16:08,263 --> 00:16:13,199
- Thanks. But I'm doing okay.
- That's good to hear. Very good.

177
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:16,031
I thought for a while there
you wouldn't be able to get...

178
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:19,038
your act back together.
And that would be a great shame.

179
00:16:19,106 --> 00:16:22,836
I've been planning for a long.
Long time to involve you...

180
00:16:22,909 --> 00:16:26,037
in the fate of our
little Miss Muffet.

181
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:30,411
Megan. Do you have trouble
saying her name?

182
00:16:33,185 --> 00:16:37,884
First-name rapport?
Hostage negotiations 101?

183
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,446
Now come on. Alex. You can do
better than that. Can't you?

184
00:16:40,524 --> 00:16:44,961
You think you're gonna dissect me
in three blinks of an eye?

185
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:47,259
I'm not that easy.

186
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:50,857
But with a little patience
and a little help.

187
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:53,926
You just might
profile me to a "T."

188
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:57,098
What makes you think
I'm interested?

189
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:03,772
They say that when I die.
The case will die.

190
00:17:03,846 --> 00:17:07,282
They say it'll be
like a book I close.

191
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:11,512
But the book.
It will never close.

192
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:16,588
Very poetic.
What the hell is it?

193
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:22,552
I've left something for your visit
with the Roses tonight.

194
00:17:23,563 --> 00:17:25,497
You'll find it in your cold.

195
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:30,160
Corrugated mailbox.

196
00:17:30,236 --> 00:17:34,172
Time to get back to work.
Dr. Cross.

197
00:18:27,555 --> 00:18:31,650
Megan. Do you
have trouble saying the name?

198
00:18:46,572 --> 00:18:48,870
Sorry. Detective.
This is a federal case.

199
00:18:51,342 --> 00:18:53,333
I've been invited.

200
00:18:55,313 --> 00:18:58,441
We have a detective who may have
evidence pertinent to the case.

201
00:18:58,516 --> 00:19:00,507
- What should we do about it?
- Alex?

202
00:19:02,152 --> 00:19:04,143
Special Agent Craig.
Well. I'll be.

203
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:08,450
Dare I ask?

204
00:19:10,527 --> 00:19:13,017
- In my mailbox.
- Anything else?

205
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:17,660
That'll get you inside.

206
00:19:19,835 --> 00:19:24,032
Terry.
Get this to MacArthur.

207
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:26,039
Who's in charge?

208
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:28,041
Ollie MacArthur.
Pedigree "Feebie."

209
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:31,202
Made his bones busting
wackos in the Seattle office.

210
00:19:31,278 --> 00:19:33,269
Soneji. Clean?

211
00:19:33,347 --> 00:19:37,044
Clean? Squeaky. Fibers look
generic. Fingerprints. Nada.

212
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:39,950
The whole school's
a goddamn forensic vacuum.

213
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,319
All he left us was one
very neatly strangled teacher.

214
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,415
Heads are gonna roll
with the Secret Service.

215
00:19:48,828 --> 00:19:53,890
Oh. Jezzie Flannigan.
Alex Cross.

216
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:56,934
Agent Flannigan was in charge of the
Secret Service detail at Cathedral.

217
00:19:57,002 --> 00:19:58,936
- Dr. Cross.
- Agent Flannigan.

218
00:19:59,004 --> 00:20:01,335
I've read your books
on profiling.

219
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:03,270
Obviously.
Not close enough. But...

220
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,259
Obviously.
Not close enough. But...

221
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:10,840
Kyle, this shoe was I.D. 'd
by the Roses. It's Megars.

222
00:20:10,911 --> 00:20:13,378
Dr. Alex Cross.
Special agent in charge...

223
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:15,414
- Oliver MacArthur.
- How do you do. Sir.

224
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,881
Alex. I'll catch you later.

225
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,316
- Forensics.
- Yes. Sir.

226
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,013
Senator and Mrs. Rose
are through here.

227
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:28,253
Before we talk to them. You any
idea why Soneji is involving you?

228
00:20:28,326 --> 00:20:31,658
- Not at all.
- This way.

229
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:35,563
Uh. Excuse me. Shouldn't Agent
Flannigan be in the room with us?

230
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:38,397
Not a good idea.
Miss Flannigan is not welcome.

231
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:41,097
But she's
a material witness.

232
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:45,039
She failed the Roses.
And she failed the Service.

233
00:20:45,108 --> 00:20:47,235
I think Agent MacArthur
has a point.

234
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,938
No. He's missing
the point.

235
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:53,106
You saw Soneji every day.
Five days a week. For how long?

236
00:20:53,182 --> 00:20:55,514
Two years.

237
00:20:55,584 --> 00:20:59,076
You have no idea how much
you know about this case.

238
00:21:05,092 --> 00:21:07,151
Agent Flannigan.

239
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:15,264
They say that when I die.
The case will die.

240
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:19,066
They say it'll be
like a book I close.

241
00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:23,472
But the book,
it will never close.

242
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:25,908
Very poetic. What the hell is it?

243
00:21:25,978 --> 00:21:29,778
I've left you
something for your visit...

244
00:21:29,849 --> 00:21:31,839
with the Roses tonight.

245
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:36,876
You'll find it in your cold,
corrugated mailbox.

246
00:21:42,326 --> 00:21:45,818
Well. For what it's won'th.
That's Soneji.

247
00:21:45,896 --> 00:21:48,763
His speech patterrs
the same.

248
00:21:48,832 --> 00:21:52,767
Is he. Um...

249
00:21:52,835 --> 00:21:55,998
Are we dealing with
a sex maniac?

250
00:21:56,072 --> 00:21:59,599
Someone who might,
you know...

251
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,839
No. Sir.

252
00:22:02,911 --> 00:22:05,402
This man has no such interest
in your daughter.

253
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,675
She's merely a means
to an end.

254
00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:09,944
What do you mean?

255
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:14,750
I see no standard procedure
in anything he's done.

256
00:22:14,822 --> 00:22:16,813
I disagree.
This is a professional kidnapping.

257
00:22:16,891 --> 00:22:19,917
It's going to be about money.
Which is good.

258
00:22:21,262 --> 00:22:23,661
But you're saying
it isn't about money.

259
00:22:26,332 --> 00:22:28,425
I think he wants to
draw this out.

260
00:22:30,003 --> 00:22:32,937
From what he said,
whatever his motives...

261
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:38,610
it's very unusual.

262
00:22:41,613 --> 00:22:43,546
What did he mean
about the book?

263
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:46,105
That it will never close?

264
00:22:49,353 --> 00:22:51,548
I honestly don't know.

265
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:54,283
Well. I think I do.

266
00:22:56,393 --> 00:23:00,454
Let me tell you
what this Gary Soneji is up to.

267
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:04,158
The last thing he wants
is good crisis management.

268
00:23:04,233 --> 00:23:07,066
What he wants is to confuse.
Rancor.

269
00:23:07,136 --> 00:23:10,537
Mixed signals, disorientation,
those are his tools.

270
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:13,130
So. He calls a local cop.

271
00:23:13,207 --> 00:23:17,007
A damaged cop, shouldering
some heavy baggage.

272
00:23:17,078 --> 00:23:19,512
He's using Dr. Cross
as his messenger...

273
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,673
Excuse me. The man that kidnapped
our daughter didn't call you.

274
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:24,683
So your agenda is what?

275
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:29,211
- To insult the man he did call?
- Mrs. Rose. I never intended...

276
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:32,554
No, you wait a second.
A madman has our daughter,

277
00:23:32,626 --> 00:23:35,822
and for some reason
he contacted this man.

278
00:23:35,895 --> 00:23:38,864
Do you know why?

279
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:44,033
No. Ma'am. Not yet.

280
00:24:21,036 --> 00:24:23,469
Hello.

281
00:24:23,537 --> 00:24:25,698
You okay?

282
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:30,333
You. Uh...

283
00:24:32,046 --> 00:24:35,105
got any tips
for helpless situations?

284
00:24:37,083 --> 00:24:39,244
Well. You could
smoke a can'ton a day.

285
00:24:41,121 --> 00:24:43,748
Or you could bounce back.

286
00:24:43,822 --> 00:24:47,485
Yeah. Well. I don't see
anywhere to bounce to.

287
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:49,925
Like to get out of here?

288
00:24:57,902 --> 00:25:01,338
Can I ask you something?

289
00:25:01,406 --> 00:25:03,396
Sure.

290
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:10,336
What did MacArthur mean
when he referred to you as damaged?

291
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:17,141
Last summer. I let a sting operation
get out of control.

292
00:25:18,988 --> 00:25:21,320
My partner was killed.

293
00:25:36,437 --> 00:25:40,305
Hello. Megan.
How are you?

294
00:25:40,374 --> 00:25:43,537
Coming to see you.

295
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,600
Do you recognize my voice?

296
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:51,706
It's me.

297
00:25:51,784 --> 00:25:54,513
Mr. Soneji. Hmm?

298
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:59,553
I brought you that.
A lovely cup of tea with honey.

299
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:02,525
I know your throat is sore.
It'll make you feel better.

300
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:06,393
There you go.
It's all right.

301
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:11,167
You have nothing
to be scared of. Megan.

302
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:14,226
I'm not scared.

303
00:26:14,304 --> 00:26:20,038
Good. But you're wondering
what's going on.

304
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:24,341
I know what's going on. You're a
kidnapper. And you're a sick weirdo.

305
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,411
Megan. You're the most
opinionated girl in my class.

306
00:26:31,487 --> 00:26:34,922
- Think you got that from your mom?
- I wanna go home.

307
00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:39,323
You will. Just promise me
you're going to behave yourself.

308
00:26:39,393 --> 00:26:44,193
Okay?
So. Now listen.

309
00:26:44,264 --> 00:26:48,064
If you need to use the bathroom
or anything. Just press that. Okay?

310
00:26:48,135 --> 00:26:51,070
I wanna go home! Now!

311
00:26:51,138 --> 00:26:53,732
- I brought you some fresh clothes.
- Please!

312
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:56,915
Mr. Soneji. Please!

313
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:01,508
This is a fine gun.

314
00:27:01,587 --> 00:27:06,353
It's Turkish.
Handmade. 1924.

315
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,585
That is nice.

316
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:11,651
My daddy won it in a game
of poker. Aces and eights.

317
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:15,095
Dead mars hand.

318
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:18,293
That's about as much
as I know about my father.

319
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:20,859
Have a seat.

320
00:27:26,675 --> 00:27:30,771
Do you know of any relationship
between Amy Masterson and Soneji?

321
00:27:30,846 --> 00:27:35,009
Amy? No way.
Why do you ask?

322
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:38,450
He strangled her.

323
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:41,386
It's an act of passion.

324
00:27:41,456 --> 00:27:44,391
It's a demonstration
of will.

325
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:46,949
A message.

326
00:27:48,328 --> 00:27:51,126
Take me seriously.
What do you see?

327
00:27:51,198 --> 00:27:54,133
- Dr. Cross...
- Alex.

328
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:57,499
Alex. Womars intuition.
Third eye. Sixth sense...

329
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,504
whatever it is.
I don't have it.

330
00:27:59,572 --> 00:28:01,631
Sure you do. You just
don't look at it right.

331
00:28:01,707 --> 00:28:03,698
Every face has two aspects.

332
00:28:03,776 --> 00:28:07,404
Now try looking at it down
the middle. One side at a time.

333
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:09,845
Would you say this man
was confident?

334
00:28:09,914 --> 00:28:12,747
- Yeah.
- Narcissistic?

335
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:17,150
- L-I wouldn't know.
- Ever see any flashes of hatred?

336
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:20,588
- No. No. No!
- Anger? Hostility?

337
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:25,094
Look. Everything about him
was right.

338
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:29,325
He was always patient. He was
pleasant. He had a sense of humor.

339
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:32,732
I mean. He was
the perfect teacher.

340
00:28:37,639 --> 00:28:39,607
What do you see?

341
00:28:41,977 --> 00:28:43,945
I see...

342
00:28:44,012 --> 00:28:46,411
No. I mean about me.

343
00:28:48,049 --> 00:28:50,677
What do you see about me?

344
00:28:50,751 --> 00:28:53,720
That's why you're here.
Isn't it?

345
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:59,692
Size me up. Evaluate
your primary material witness?

346
00:29:03,163 --> 00:29:05,790
I see that you're about
to start an argument.

347
00:29:05,864 --> 00:29:07,729
I need to help get her back.

348
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,563
What makes you think
I want a partner?

349
00:29:09,635 --> 00:29:11,933
- You don't. I can understand that.
- That's right.

350
00:29:12,004 --> 00:29:15,132
- No. You can't.
- Can I tell you why I don't care?

351
00:29:18,076 --> 00:29:20,010
Shoot.

352
00:29:23,347 --> 00:29:28,511
Look. When I was
assigned to Cathedral.

353
00:29:28,585 --> 00:29:30,576
It was a job
I didn't want.

354
00:29:30,654 --> 00:29:34,283
It's a far cry from working
rope lines or flying Air Force One.

355
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:37,883
But I have been there
for three years.

356
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,760
I have been responsible
for Megan for three years.

357
00:29:41,831 --> 00:29:44,994
And that little girl means
more to me than even a partner.

358
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:47,728
Can you understand that?

359
00:29:50,105 --> 00:29:52,505
I suppose so.

360
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:58,904
Even if I say no. You'll probably
follow me around wherever I go.

361
00:30:01,248 --> 00:30:05,082
So. If it's a choice between
having you as a partner...

362
00:30:05,152 --> 00:30:10,817
or as a stalker. I guess I'll
take my chances with a partner.

363
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,926
Thank you.

364
00:30:26,337 --> 00:30:29,670
The student drop-off is there.
That's my morning post.

365
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:34,734
Students sign in. Cameras are
there. There. There and there.

366
00:30:34,812 --> 00:30:37,302
Motions sensors
all around the periphery.

367
00:30:38,948 --> 00:30:42,145
Foolproof way to keep
the kooks out.

368
00:30:42,218 --> 00:30:46,415
Exactly. We were always looking
in the wrong direction.

369
00:30:46,488 --> 00:30:49,286
- Which door did he go out?
- Uh. That one there.

370
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:52,020
It's a straight shot
to his parking space.

371
00:30:55,764 --> 00:30:57,754
Let's go in.

372
00:31:04,972 --> 00:31:08,065
- His classroom.
- Mm-hmm.

373
00:31:08,141 --> 00:31:12,475
He was teaching how everything
on the Internet is connected.

374
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,713
Alex. You got a sec?
Sure.

375
00:31:17,783 --> 00:31:21,810
Listen. I think turf wars
are a total waste of time.

376
00:31:21,887 --> 00:31:25,482
If I was out of line
last night. I apologize.

377
00:31:25,558 --> 00:31:28,549
Don't. I've been there.

378
00:31:30,795 --> 00:31:33,992
- Anything you need. Let me know.
- Sure. Mac.

379
00:31:35,867 --> 00:31:38,528
Dr. Cross,
you might want to see this.

380
00:31:46,143 --> 00:31:49,111
- This was Megars desk?
- Yeah.

381
00:31:49,178 --> 00:31:52,147
- What are you doing?
- Scoping GIFs.

382
00:31:52,215 --> 00:31:56,674
Graphic Interchange Formats.
They're all Stego-encrypted.

383
00:31:56,751 --> 00:31:59,879
Somewhere among the billions of
zeros and ones making this image...

384
00:31:59,955 --> 00:32:03,118
- is a string of text.
- I know about this.

385
00:32:03,191 --> 00:32:05,625
It's the cutting-edge method
of passing notes in class.

386
00:32:05,694 --> 00:32:07,752
It's driving the teachers nuts.

387
00:32:07,828 --> 00:32:10,820
How long before
you can access it?

388
00:32:10,898 --> 00:32:12,957
Try never.

389
00:32:13,033 --> 00:32:15,092
You don't crack Stego
without a password.

390
00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:17,136
Would you take me
to his office?

391
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:24,442
Oh. When you find Soneji.
Ask him for the password.

392
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:27,945
He planted a monitoring virus
on the girl's hard drive.

393
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:31,949
Every keystroke Megan hit.
Soneji was recording it.

394
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,883
Good move. Jezz.

395
00:32:40,958 --> 00:32:44,086
Angling for a position
with the D.C.P.D. I like that.

396
00:32:45,529 --> 00:32:48,361
Dr. Cross.
Agent Ben Devine.

397
00:32:48,431 --> 00:32:51,298
Agent Devine is security
systems supervisor.

398
00:32:51,368 --> 00:32:53,802
Well. For now.

399
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,861
We're going to be thrown
to the wolves.

400
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:58,463
As soon as they find
Megan Rose dead in a ditch.

401
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,974
Now what makes you so sure
that's what's going to happen?

402
00:33:01,043 --> 00:33:04,240
Me getting fired
or the girl in a ditch?

403
00:33:04,313 --> 00:33:06,577
Sorry.

404
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:10,414
I'm having
a pessimistic day.

405
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:13,147
Tell me.

406
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:18,021
Soneji. Did he... did he ever show
any interest in what you do?

407
00:33:18,091 --> 00:33:21,549
How you do it?

408
00:33:21,628 --> 00:33:25,257
The man never talked to me.
I never talked to him.

409
00:33:26,967 --> 00:33:29,958
Well. Thanks
for your time.

410
00:34:08,593 --> 00:34:11,619
- Hello.

411
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:13,687
What?

412
00:34:15,166 --> 00:34:17,225
What do you think
that is?

413
00:34:20,537 --> 00:34:25,065
- An empty frame.
- Mm-hmm.

414
00:34:25,142 --> 00:34:27,474
Otherwise known as...

415
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:32,776
A missing picture.

416
00:35:17,923 --> 00:35:21,688
You onto something?

417
00:35:42,845 --> 00:35:45,973
Our missing picture.

418
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,982
Mm-hmm.

419
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:52,884
Our Mr. Soneji
has a sense of humor.

420
00:35:52,954 --> 00:35:56,151
He didn't just kidnap a little girl.
He turned it into a game.

421
00:35:57,225 --> 00:35:59,215
Okay.

422
00:36:02,896 --> 00:36:05,296
Let's see what you know.
Mr. Lindbergh.

423
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,334
- My. My.
- What do you got?

424
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:21,402
Dr. Cross isn't
in cyberspace anymore.

425
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:24,004
You're at a live site.
Iooking through a video camera.

426
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:26,073
Those arrows down there
move it.

427
00:36:30,321 --> 00:36:33,586
Where are we?

428
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:36,717
I would guess
we're in Soneji's home.

429
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:41,423
Now we're supposed to
find out where that is.

430
00:36:41,497 --> 00:36:43,431
Oliver MacArthur's office.

431
00:36:43,499 --> 00:36:45,433
Yeah. It's me. Hold on.

432
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:48,493
How about the files?

433
00:36:59,547 --> 00:37:01,879
- There... on the wall.
- There's a...

434
00:37:01,949 --> 00:37:03,883
Can you zoom in there?

435
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,513
-  "Jonathan... M"...
-  "E"...

436
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:12,683
-  "M-E"...
-  "L"?

437
00:37:12,759 --> 00:37:15,592
You can't move that around.
Can you? It's stationary.

438
00:37:15,662 --> 00:37:18,153
No, there's something
somewhere else, I guarantee that.

439
00:37:18,231 --> 00:37:20,164
-  Right there.
- There.

440
00:37:20,232 --> 00:37:22,200
- You can...
- Focus.

441
00:37:22,268 --> 00:37:24,566
- Bingo.
- [Hickley] M-E-R...

442
00:37:24,637 --> 00:37:26,571
[Agent]
"Merc"...

443
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:31,701
"Mercusio.
M-E-R-C-U-S-l-O."

444
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,904
- "Fourteen... thirty-two..."
"Thirty-five..."

445
00:37:34,979 --> 00:37:37,243
- Granville.
- Gary Soneji is also known as...

446
00:37:37,315 --> 00:37:40,545
Mercusio. Jonathan.
1435 Granville Street.

447
00:37:40,617 --> 00:37:43,051
Well done. Alex.

448
00:37:50,293 --> 00:37:53,922
In. In. In!

449
00:37:53,996 --> 00:37:55,930
Eyes open!

450
00:37:57,366 --> 00:38:00,357
- There.

451
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,341
Not until we get the go-ahead.

452
00:39:13,401 --> 00:39:16,029
His surveillance
was better than ours.

453
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:19,096
He's been at this
for years.

454
00:39:24,511 --> 00:39:26,502
Imagine the patience,

455
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,708
the dedication.

456
00:39:31,984 --> 00:39:34,578
You sound like
an admirer.

457
00:39:36,756 --> 00:39:41,419
Well. He's...
he's like a spider.

458
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:47,064
And I happen to
like spiders.

459
00:39:51,502 --> 00:39:53,493
He had
an elaborate setup here, boss.

460
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,504
Want to see how he
stayed clean at school?

461
00:39:57,674 --> 00:40:01,234
It laminates a plastic veneer
over your hands.

462
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,642
Look at this.

463
00:40:06,049 --> 00:40:09,644
It's foam rubber. Looks like he
was wearing prosthetic appliances.

464
00:40:11,486 --> 00:40:15,115
I understand the Secret Service
are being cautious tonight.

465
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:18,125
There is speculation that a full
investigation is under way into...

466
00:40:21,829 --> 00:40:24,354
Yes, Kevin,
one of the Secret Service agents...

467
00:40:43,715 --> 00:40:46,946
Evening.
What's the problem?

468
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:49,715
Help! Help me!

469
00:40:49,788 --> 00:40:53,279
You've got a rule 21 problem...
no running lights.

470
00:40:54,459 --> 00:40:57,965
Again. I just replaced
the fuses yesterday.

471
00:40:58,098 --> 00:41:00,793
Help! Help!

472
00:41:00,867 --> 00:41:04,462
Sir. No running lights.
You're gonna have to follow us in.

473
00:41:04,537 --> 00:41:07,233
Help!
Please. Help me!

474
00:41:07,307 --> 00:41:10,276
Well. Let me see what I can do
with the fuse box.

475
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:12,207
Hold on. Hold on.

476
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,210
I'm in here! Help me!
I'm in here. Help!

477
00:41:19,284 --> 00:41:21,843
Help! Help!

478
00:41:31,628 --> 00:41:34,358
How's that?

479
00:41:35,932 --> 00:41:38,400
Thanks a lot. Fellas.

480
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:45,869
Help!
Help me. Please!

481
00:41:56,017 --> 00:42:00,283
Help me. Please!

482
00:42:00,355 --> 00:42:02,618
Help me!

483
00:42:09,262 --> 00:42:12,094
"And before the hood
was pulled over his head.

484
00:42:12,164 --> 00:42:15,622
"He bragged
to his executioner.

485
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:19,102
"'They think that when I die.
The case will die.

486
00:42:19,171 --> 00:42:22,606
"'They think it will be
like a book I close.

487
00:42:22,674 --> 00:42:26,371
'But the book.
It will never close."'

488
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:33,812
Soneji was quoting the final words
of Richard Bruno Hauptman.

489
00:42:35,919 --> 00:42:37,978
I'm sorry.
I don't follow.

490
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:42,320
1932. The infant son
of Charles Lindbergh.

491
00:42:42,392 --> 00:42:45,520
America's greatest hero.
Was kidnapped.

492
00:42:45,595 --> 00:42:49,554
When Bruno Hauptman was arrested,
what followed became known as...

493
00:42:49,632 --> 00:42:51,565
"the crime of the century."

494
00:42:51,633 --> 00:42:54,329
I believe that Soneji
wants to do the same thing.

495
00:42:54,403 --> 00:42:57,304
You think we're dealing
with a copycat.

496
00:42:57,372 --> 00:42:59,932
Something like that.

497
00:43:00,008 --> 00:43:02,441
Dr. Cross...

498
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,673
what does he want
from you?

499
00:43:10,284 --> 00:43:13,343
He's brought me in
and left this trail...

500
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:18,483
because he wants me to make sure
that he's properly appreciated.

501
00:43:19,592 --> 00:43:22,059
But in order for him
to achieve this...

502
00:43:24,596 --> 00:43:26,530
he has to kill Megan.

503
00:43:26,598 --> 00:43:30,034
No. No.
Not necessarily.

504
00:43:30,102 --> 00:43:33,229
The death of the Lindbergh baby
was accidental.

505
00:43:33,304 --> 00:43:36,535
Nevertheless. It's critical
that we pull his strings.

506
00:43:36,607 --> 00:43:38,598
The more we make him
a living legend.

507
00:43:38,676 --> 00:43:40,667
The more likely he is
to keep Megan alive.

508
00:43:40,745 --> 00:43:42,939
Dr. Cross,
you've been brought into this case,

509
00:43:43,013 --> 00:43:45,072
what can you tell us
about Gary Soneji?

510
00:43:45,148 --> 00:43:48,015
I can tell you that Soneji
is very determined.

511
00:43:48,084 --> 00:43:52,383
Obviously highly capable and we
consider him a serious adversary.

512
00:43:52,455 --> 00:43:54,616
What about Megan Rose?

513
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:57,659
Megan Rose
is Gary Soneji's ace.

514
00:43:57,726 --> 00:44:00,854
As long as he has her,
he's in control.

515
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,870
Sir, would you assign
as many agents to this case...

516
00:44:15,943 --> 00:44:17,808
if she wasrt
a senator's daughter?

517
00:44:17,878 --> 00:44:20,312
The size of our task force
is a reflection...

518
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:23,405
of who Gary Soneji is.
Not Megan Rose.

519
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:26,745
- Mr. Soneji.

520
00:44:26,819 --> 00:44:28,753
You can parse
the words if you'd like...

521
00:44:28,821 --> 00:44:30,550
Hello?

522
00:44:30,623 --> 00:44:32,920
I need to
go to the bathroom.

523
00:44:32,991 --> 00:44:35,755
All right.
Be right there.

524
00:45:33,445 --> 00:45:36,744
Come on.

525
00:45:42,488 --> 00:45:46,287
- Come on.

526
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:04,233
Hey!

527
00:46:10,947 --> 00:46:13,506
Help!

528
00:46:14,883 --> 00:46:17,181
Please. Help!

529
00:46:18,553 --> 00:46:21,579
Help! Please!

530
00:46:21,656 --> 00:46:23,680
- Help!

531
00:46:31,098 --> 00:46:34,794
Help! Please!

532
00:46:34,867 --> 00:46:37,267
Help me! Please!

533
00:46:41,941 --> 00:46:46,502
- Help! Help me!

534
00:46:46,578 --> 00:46:51,208
Help. Please!
Please. Help me!

535
00:46:51,283 --> 00:46:54,274
I'm comir!
Hold on!

536
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:59,314
- Help!
- Hold on!

537
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:01,722
- Please!

538
00:47:03,194 --> 00:47:05,024
- No!

539
00:47:07,764 --> 00:47:09,527
No. Please!

540
00:47:14,536 --> 00:47:16,697
Please!

541
00:47:16,772 --> 00:47:21,709
Please!
Help! Please!

542
00:47:21,777 --> 00:47:25,075
Please!

543
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:33,551
Shh. This will keep you warm.
Here you go.

544
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,748
Megan. You promised me
you were going to behave yourself.

545
00:47:36,823 --> 00:47:40,315
Because of you. What you've done.
That man is dead.

546
00:47:42,095 --> 00:47:45,222
Now... promise me.

547
00:47:45,297 --> 00:47:48,198
Promise me you're going to
be a good little girl. Okay?

548
00:47:48,267 --> 00:47:50,599
- [Whimpering]
- All right?

549
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,729
Say. "Yes. Mr. Soneji."

550
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:56,573
Say. "Yes. Mr. Soneji."

551
00:47:56,641 --> 00:48:00,771
Y-Yes. Mr. Soneji.

552
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:02,779
Okay.

553
00:48:04,682 --> 00:48:07,549
Let's go have
that cup of tea.

554
00:48:43,217 --> 00:48:45,980
I'd say eight hours.
About 9:00 a.m.

555
00:48:46,052 --> 00:48:49,510
Slugs are large caliber.
Shots hit him here. Here.

556
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:51,557
Kill shot tapped him
crown of the head.

557
00:48:51,624 --> 00:48:55,889
This here is Thomas Mathias.
He found all this. This way.

558
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:34,323
She's not in the water. Jezzie.
Soneji still has her.

559
00:49:34,396 --> 00:49:36,329
There's no way
of knowing that.

560
00:49:36,397 --> 00:49:39,025
Think about it.
Megan is precious cargo.

561
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:42,399
Soneji's not gonna let
some twist of fate bring her harm.

562
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:44,404
Right?

563
00:49:46,606 --> 00:49:49,370
But why Megan?
Why her?

564
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,814
Come on.

565
00:49:56,882 --> 00:49:58,816
Where are you going?

566
00:49:58,884 --> 00:50:01,182
Back to the city.
We'll talk in the car.

567
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:06,450
You asked. "Why Megan?"

568
00:50:06,524 --> 00:50:10,392
That's the question we should have
been asking right from the start:

569
00:50:10,461 --> 00:50:13,259
Why Megan?

570
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:19,793
Who is Senator Hank Rose?

571
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:22,430
- He's...
- Nobody.

572
00:50:24,074 --> 00:50:26,598
Most people don't even know
who he is. Never heard of him.

573
00:50:26,676 --> 00:50:29,702
Couldrt pick him
out of a lineup.

574
00:50:29,779 --> 00:50:34,079
This is front-page news now. Where
will it be in two months? Ayear?

575
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:38,449
Oblivion.
Know why?

576
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:43,253
Because Senator Hank Rose
is no Charles Lindbergh.

577
00:50:44,326 --> 00:50:46,418
Well. Okay.
Then. Who is?

578
00:50:46,493 --> 00:50:51,055
Ah. There's
the troublesome question.

579
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:56,762
Come on. Jezzie. Two years.
Five days a week. You know Soneji.

580
00:50:56,836 --> 00:50:59,771
Who's a bigger fish
than Megan Rose?

581
00:51:33,003 --> 00:51:36,165
- Da.

582
00:52:03,030 --> 00:52:04,998
- Mm-hmm.

583
00:52:08,734 --> 00:52:11,032
Dr. Cross. Agent Flannigan.

584
00:52:11,103 --> 00:52:14,334
We appreciate your concern.
But. Uh. Dimitri's fine.

585
00:52:14,407 --> 00:52:17,398
Our security services
are more than capable...

586
00:52:17,475 --> 00:52:20,273
of protecting the son
of the Russian president.

587
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,538
Can we at least
talk to him?

588
00:52:23,615 --> 00:52:27,710
Nothing would please us more
than to be of help.

589
00:52:27,785 --> 00:52:31,881
But speaking to Dimitri right now
would be inappropriate.

590
00:52:31,955 --> 00:52:33,889
Thanks for your time.

591
00:53:03,818 --> 00:53:05,752
What?

592
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:08,344
Well. MacArthur's
dragnetting the bay. Right?

593
00:53:08,421 --> 00:53:10,946
And. I mean.
He's not really missing us.

594
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:13,788
So I was thinking maybe
we could just stick around and.

595
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,919
You know. Scope out
the place a bit.

596
00:53:19,431 --> 00:53:23,367
Agent Flannigan.
Are you...

597
00:53:23,435 --> 00:53:25,562
are you suggesting
a stakeout here?

598
00:53:26,938 --> 00:53:29,372
Yeah. You know.
Stale coffee. Some doughnuts.

599
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,399
No. No. That's a first-class
stakeout. Agent Flannigan.

600
00:53:33,478 --> 00:53:36,106
What you're talking about
here would be no frills.

601
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:39,512
You'd only get to think about
stale coffee and doughnuts.

602
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,652
Well. I can handle it
if you can.

603
00:54:41,078 --> 00:54:43,444
I get the feeling
you've done this a lot.

604
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:45,505
Oh. Yeah.

605
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:47,515
Every chance I get.

606
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:53,517
Especially when
it's cold and wet.

607
00:55:05,801 --> 00:55:09,099
- No parking here.
- We're on the clock. Officer.

608
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:12,469
- Everything okay?
- Everything is all right.

609
00:55:36,195 --> 00:55:38,321
- What's the problem?

610
00:55:50,674 --> 00:55:53,234
Go ahead. Jezzie.

611
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:55,244
What?

612
00:55:58,347 --> 00:56:00,440
Have one.

613
00:56:00,516 --> 00:56:02,450
Thank you.

614
00:57:12,548 --> 00:57:14,880
Alex. That's Dimitri.

615
00:57:52,951 --> 00:57:55,442
Jezzie. It's him.

616
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:58,955
- It's him!

617
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:22,239
Soneji, hold it
right there!

618
00:58:27,849 --> 00:58:30,146
Jezzie. Shoot the tires!

619
00:58:31,385 --> 00:58:33,376
- Jezzie!

620
00:58:49,835 --> 00:58:52,395
Jezzie!

621
00:58:56,975 --> 00:58:59,568
Police! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

622
00:59:18,695 --> 00:59:21,356
Jezzie!

623
00:59:27,236 --> 00:59:29,829
Jezzie. You're gonna
get Megan back. Right?

624
00:59:29,904 --> 00:59:33,271
Yes. We are.
I promise.

625
00:59:33,341 --> 00:59:35,332
Use this
to get Mr. Soneji.

626
00:59:37,645 --> 00:59:40,442
I will. Thank you.

627
00:59:43,784 --> 00:59:46,378
You talk to Hal.
I want you to bring him up to speed.

628
00:59:46,453 --> 00:59:48,387
Well done. Guys.

629
00:59:48,455 --> 00:59:50,615
Avert an international crisis
and paint Soneji into a corner.

630
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:52,624
Not bad for a night's work.

631
00:59:52,692 --> 00:59:56,093
Soneji ditched a patrol car near
Reno Park. Hijacked a tan Sierra.

632
00:59:56,162 --> 00:59:59,392
One bullet in the driver's head.
Last seen heading toward Route 50.

633
00:59:59,464 --> 01:00:03,833
Annapolis. I knew it. Seventy-five
thousand boats. Other marinas?

634
01:00:03,902 --> 01:00:07,235
We're here. Dead fisherman here.
These. All the marinas.

635
01:00:07,305 --> 01:00:09,397
All locked down.
Patrol boats in each of them.

636
01:00:09,473 --> 01:00:11,907
All right. Listen up.
We gotta move fast.

637
01:00:11,976 --> 01:00:14,672
Roadblock Route 50 and triple
the surveillance in the harbors.

638
01:00:14,745 --> 01:00:17,873
I want two choppers on the pad
in five minutes. Let's go!

639
01:01:33,252 --> 01:01:35,186
What's wrong?

640
01:01:38,557 --> 01:01:41,081
I blew it.
That's what's wrong.

641
01:01:44,429 --> 01:01:47,865
I had a shot right before
he hit the hydrant.

642
01:01:47,932 --> 01:01:52,391
But instead of pulling the trigger.
I was thinking. I was thinking.

643
01:01:52,469 --> 01:01:55,233
Yeah. You were thinking.
About your shot going astray...

644
01:01:55,305 --> 01:01:57,398
and blowing Soneji's head off.
In which case...

645
01:01:57,474 --> 01:01:59,408
We would never find Megan.
I know that.

646
01:01:59,476 --> 01:02:02,035
Well. Then. Don't beat
yourself up for being prudent.

647
01:02:02,111 --> 01:02:05,706
You don't get it. I was trained
to shoot first and think later.

648
01:02:05,781 --> 01:02:08,944
Jezzie.
For heavers sake.

649
01:02:09,018 --> 01:02:10,951
If you hadrt convinced me
to stay there.

650
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:12,953
Soneji would have
two victims instead of one.

651
01:02:13,021 --> 01:02:15,649
Plus we'd have an international
incident on our hands.

652
01:02:15,723 --> 01:02:19,853
- You did good. You did good.
- Yes. But still...

653
01:02:22,162 --> 01:02:24,153
- Anything?
- Oh. Not yet.

654
01:02:24,231 --> 01:02:26,222
We're sitting on the area.

655
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:29,292
Chief. Soneji's
on the phone.

656
01:02:41,146 --> 01:02:44,081
- Soneji?
- Detective Cross.

657
01:02:44,149 --> 01:02:46,413
I want to explain
how the agenda's changed.

658
01:02:46,485 --> 01:02:49,579
You're gonna bring me
ten million in diamonds.

659
01:02:49,654 --> 01:02:52,383
Point five carat.
Color "D." clarity Sl-2.

660
01:02:52,456 --> 01:02:55,289
In a thermos
in nine hours.

661
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:58,988
If the stones are rigged, laser
tagged, irradiated, the girl dies.

662
01:02:59,063 --> 01:03:02,589
- Does that penetrate?
- It does.

663
01:03:02,665 --> 01:03:06,795
I'll call back.
4:00 p.m. Sharp.

664
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:09,566
- He beat the trace.

665
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:13,335
Clock's ticking, people.
Let's move this downtown. Let's go!

666
01:03:42,067 --> 01:03:44,627
- Dr. Cross.
- I'm here.

667
01:03:44,703 --> 01:03:48,639
The Watergate. 20 minutes.

668
01:03:48,707 --> 01:03:51,607
- There's a package for Mr. Antwerp.

669
01:03:51,676 --> 01:03:54,076
Okay, people, let's move.

670
01:03:57,615 --> 01:04:00,413
- Don't lose him. Kiddo.
- You won't even see me.

671
01:04:10,494 --> 01:04:13,519
[Tires Squealing]

672
01:04:40,988 --> 01:04:44,514
- I'm on police business.
- Eddie. This way.

673
01:04:54,066 --> 01:04:56,000
Hi. How are you?

674
01:04:56,068 --> 01:04:58,127
Do you have a package
for Mr. Antwerp?

675
01:04:58,203 --> 01:05:00,262
Yes.

676
01:05:03,641 --> 01:05:05,939
Yes. Sir.

677
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:11,713
Over there. That one.

678
01:05:22,825 --> 01:05:25,953
- Cross.
- Leave the phone. Leave the car.

679
01:05:26,028 --> 01:05:29,862
Pennsylvania and Sixth.
The fountain. 14 minutes. Run.

680
01:05:29,932 --> 01:05:32,399
Thanks.

681
01:05:32,467 --> 01:05:34,935
- Mac. You there?
- Alex.

682
01:05:35,003 --> 01:05:37,699
He made me ditch the car.
Looks like it's a running game.

683
01:05:37,772 --> 01:05:40,798
I'm on my way
to Sixth and Pennsylvania.

684
01:05:43,043 --> 01:05:45,273
I'm left
and behind you, Alex.

685
01:06:06,698 --> 01:06:09,326
Bearing onto Pennsylvania.

686
01:06:18,972 --> 01:06:20,276
- Cross.

687
01:06:20,344 --> 01:06:23,835
Twelfth and Madison. Twelve minutes
will get you there. Go.

688
01:06:26,883 --> 01:06:29,408
Unit three.
Ioop on 23rd Street.

689
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:31,919
Unit six. Take "K" Street
and double back.

690
01:06:39,594 --> 01:06:41,960
You've got four units
on top. Alex.

691
01:06:49,837 --> 01:06:52,101
- Cross.

692
01:06:52,173 --> 01:06:55,573
Four minutes. Union Station.
Main entrance.

693
01:06:57,177 --> 01:07:00,340
Jezzie. Union Station.
Main entrance.

694
01:07:03,649 --> 01:07:06,345
It's rush hour.
He's drawing them into a crowd.

695
01:07:32,709 --> 01:07:35,370
Hey! Hey!

696
01:07:35,444 --> 01:07:38,607
Don't answer that!
I think it's for me.

697
01:07:38,681 --> 01:07:41,445
- Cross.

698
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:02,601
- Cross.
- Keep this phone. Take the metro.

699
01:08:02,669 --> 01:08:05,728
Platform "A."
You got two minutes. Go!

700
01:08:12,278 --> 01:08:16,509
Jezzie. Metro.
Downstairs. Platform "A."

701
01:08:32,699 --> 01:08:35,895
- Cross.
- Go to the center of the platform.

702
01:09:11,768 --> 01:09:14,463
Track 15. go!

703
01:09:37,524 --> 01:09:39,583
Go to the first car.

704
01:10:02,547 --> 01:10:04,571
You there yet?

705
01:10:04,648 --> 01:10:07,173
- Yeah, I'm there.
- Go to the left side.

706
01:10:07,251 --> 01:10:10,743
- Open the window.
- These windows don't open.

707
01:10:10,821 --> 01:10:13,346
You're smart, Detective,
improvise.

708
01:10:13,423 --> 01:10:15,356
Quickly.

709
01:10:16,792 --> 01:10:18,851
- Police officer. Everybody. Down!
- What?

710
01:10:18,928 --> 01:10:22,887
- Get down! Everybody. Down!
- Come on, outta my way!

711
01:10:26,668 --> 01:10:31,105
You ready?
All right. Now. Throw!

712
01:10:50,523 --> 01:10:53,390
We can neither confirm
nor deny that Gary Soneji...

713
01:10:53,459 --> 01:10:56,393
was involved in the incident
on the MTA train this morning.

714
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:58,452
We've heard that a ransom
was paid. Comment?

715
01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:01,966
- I can't comment on any of that.
- What about Megan Rose?

716
01:11:02,034 --> 01:11:04,627
I'm not going to go into
any details at this time.

717
01:11:04,702 --> 01:11:06,727
What about Soneji's
state of mind?

718
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:09,739
I'm not going to comment
on his mental stability.

719
01:11:09,807 --> 01:11:12,071
You can draw
your own conclusions.

720
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:16,875
Now, Senator Rose has agreed
to make a statement,

721
01:11:16,947 --> 01:11:19,142
- So?
- The file on Soneji.

722
01:11:19,216 --> 01:11:22,185
- Is it still on your kitchen table?
- Yeah. Why?

723
01:11:22,252 --> 01:11:24,186
I'm gonna have
another look at it.

724
01:11:24,254 --> 01:11:28,087
This business about the diamonds.
Money. I didn't see it coming.

725
01:11:31,093 --> 01:11:34,085
I am grateful that
the F.B.I. Is here.

726
01:11:34,163 --> 01:11:39,099
With the objective expertise
to find out where my daughter is.

727
01:11:39,167 --> 01:11:41,101
Secondly, I now...

728
01:11:47,407 --> 01:11:49,534
This is worse than killing time.

729
01:11:49,610 --> 01:11:54,513
Yeah. But you'd be amazed at how
often the small. Neglected things...

730
01:11:54,581 --> 01:11:57,879
become the most important.

731
01:11:57,950 --> 01:12:01,511
I just got the feeling
we're missing something.

732
01:12:01,587 --> 01:12:05,044
Maybe I'm in
the wrong line of work.

733
01:12:05,123 --> 01:12:08,559
Maybe I should take on
something less challenging.

734
01:12:08,627 --> 01:12:10,822
You do what you are.
Jezzie.

735
01:12:10,895 --> 01:12:13,762
You mean.
You are what you do.

736
01:12:13,832 --> 01:12:17,733
No. I mean.
You do what you are.

737
01:12:17,801 --> 01:12:21,134
You're born with a gift.

738
01:12:21,205 --> 01:12:25,732
If not that. Then you get good
at something along the way.

739
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:29,141
And what you're good at.
You don't take for granted.

740
01:12:29,212 --> 01:12:31,339
You don't betray it.

741
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:37,347
What if you do
betray your gift?

742
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:42,322
Then. You betray yourself.
That's a sad thing.

743
01:12:48,529 --> 01:12:51,362
- Who is it?
- Police.

744
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,174
Gary Soneji.

745
01:13:02,242 --> 01:13:04,870
Hi. Alex.

746
01:13:07,246 --> 01:13:12,081
Now. Right hand. Thumb and
forefinger. Just give me the gun.

747
01:13:14,953 --> 01:13:19,355
Alex. You can't shoot me.
You'll never find Megan.

748
01:13:34,805 --> 01:13:37,068
Sit down. Alex.

749
01:13:45,181 --> 01:13:48,115
I'm-I'm a little concerned. Alex.
I'm a little...

750
01:13:48,183 --> 01:13:50,777
I'm a little worried
that you...

751
01:13:50,852 --> 01:13:53,343
you don't really care
to understand me anymore;

752
01:13:53,421 --> 01:13:55,582
that you won't paint
an accurate portrait.

753
01:13:55,656 --> 01:13:58,489
And I need you to convince me
that I'm wrong.

754
01:13:58,559 --> 01:14:01,653
In order to do that. We're going
to have to talk about Megan Rose.

755
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:06,825
No. No bargaining. Alex.
No cheap interrogation techniques.

756
01:14:06,899 --> 01:14:09,390
It's transparent.
And it's clumsy.

757
01:14:09,469 --> 01:14:12,495
This is between
me and you.

758
01:14:12,572 --> 01:14:15,200
I want you to see.

759
01:14:15,274 --> 01:14:21,178
I want you to look inside here
and tell me what the fuck you see!

760
01:14:22,514 --> 01:14:24,505
I'm a gift to you, Alex.

761
01:14:24,583 --> 01:14:28,348
I'm a gift to you.

762
01:14:28,419 --> 01:14:33,686
And you are beyond... pitiful
if you cannot understand that.

763
01:14:35,092 --> 01:14:37,753
I'm living proof
that a mind...

764
01:14:39,429 --> 01:14:41,795
the mind is
a terrible thing.

765
01:14:52,474 --> 01:14:54,806
I see you've got
your sense of humor back.

766
01:14:54,877 --> 01:14:57,640
Yeah.

767
01:14:57,712 --> 01:15:00,977
I wondered what happened to it
during the ransom drop.

768
01:15:04,385 --> 01:15:06,318
The ransom drop.

769
01:15:06,386 --> 01:15:09,116
That was
a well-earned 12 million.

770
01:15:10,323 --> 01:15:12,951
Twelve million.

771
01:15:14,995 --> 01:15:17,656
Senator Rose says
he can pull strings.

772
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:21,666
He says he can fix it so you
keep the 12 million and walk.

773
01:15:21,734 --> 01:15:26,544
All you have to do is return
the child. Where is Megan?

774
01:15:27,678 --> 01:15:31,705
Where's Megan?
Where is Megan?

775
01:15:31,782 --> 01:15:36,980
Where's Megan? Where is Megan?
Where is Megan?

776
01:15:37,053 --> 01:15:40,045
She's trapped on my boat. Alex.
Isn't that right?

777
01:15:40,123 --> 01:15:44,753
Or maybe she's stuck in a warehouse
somewhere or floating in a river.

778
01:15:44,828 --> 01:15:47,762
Swinging from the end
of a rope. Buried alive.

779
01:15:52,968 --> 01:15:54,936
I envy her.

780
01:15:58,439 --> 01:16:01,670
What would life had been like
with parents like that?

781
01:16:01,743 --> 01:16:05,304
Come on, Gary, blaming your parents
for what you are?

782
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:08,007
I'm not blaming them, Alex.

783
01:16:08,081 --> 01:16:11,778
They've been punished
already.

784
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:20,489
I burned down the house
while they slept.

785
01:16:25,064 --> 01:16:28,032
I was 15 years old.

786
01:16:28,099 --> 01:16:30,829
Was it what you expected?

787
01:16:32,437 --> 01:16:35,565
Not really.
It was a new experience.

788
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,573
What. Killing?

789
01:16:37,641 --> 01:16:41,509
No. Being
in the newspapers.

790
01:16:44,782 --> 01:16:48,512
So, in your opinion, Doctor,

791
01:16:48,584 --> 01:16:53,248
were my actions
triggered by nature...

792
01:16:53,323 --> 01:16:55,382
or nurture?

793
01:16:56,492 --> 01:16:58,959
If you want me
to be brutally honest...

794
01:17:00,462 --> 01:17:05,058
I think you just have
a morbid desire to burn in hell.

795
01:17:09,837 --> 01:17:12,032
We're done for today.

796
01:17:14,809 --> 01:17:17,333
I'm taking her with me.

797
01:17:22,816 --> 01:17:26,479
- You're not taking her anywhere.
- I'll send her back to you.

798
01:17:26,553 --> 01:17:29,020
You just tell me
which piece you want first.

799
01:17:29,088 --> 01:17:32,182
Aah!

800
01:17:32,257 --> 01:17:36,853
Ow! Oh, shit!

801
01:17:36,929 --> 01:17:39,328
Damn it.

802
01:17:39,397 --> 01:17:42,195
Alex!

803
01:17:54,444 --> 01:17:57,038
Oh. My God.

804
01:17:57,114 --> 01:17:59,377
What have you done?

805
01:17:59,448 --> 01:18:04,283
What have you d-done?

806
01:18:07,189 --> 01:18:11,215
Residents of this normally
quiet suburb are still in shock...

807
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:14,591
as news of the shooting of Gary
Soneji. America's most-wanted man.

808
01:18:14,662 --> 01:18:16,596
Filtered through
their community.

809
01:18:16,664 --> 01:18:18,995
Apparently, Soneji had attempted
to confront, or even harm...

810
01:18:19,066 --> 01:18:21,591
members of the kidnapping
task force hunting him.

811
01:18:21,668 --> 01:18:25,934
So. He came after Jezzie
as payback for Dimitri.

812
01:18:27,408 --> 01:18:29,898
Ostensibly. Yeah.

813
01:18:29,976 --> 01:18:31,910
That's how you want it
on record?

814
01:18:31,978 --> 01:18:34,742
Yeah. For now.

815
01:18:39,151 --> 01:18:41,278
Here they come.

816
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:53,562
Dr. Cross. Tell me you have at least
an idea where my little girl is.

817
01:18:53,631 --> 01:18:56,725
I'm sorry. Sir. I can't.

818
01:18:56,801 --> 01:18:59,268
You kill the one man
who has the answers.

819
01:18:59,335 --> 01:19:03,066
And you're telling me
you haven't a clue. Not one clue?

820
01:19:03,139 --> 01:19:06,267
The man walked in the fucking room.
And you shot him.

821
01:19:06,342 --> 01:19:08,138
Senator...

822
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:10,838
standing in his shoes. I'd have
done the same thing. Sir.

823
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:15,043
That's your job. Not his. He's
supposed to find my little girl.

824
01:19:15,117 --> 01:19:18,279
Not shoot the man
who knows where she is.

825
01:19:18,352 --> 01:19:20,286
Senator.

826
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:28,594
It's not over.

827
01:19:30,864 --> 01:19:34,356
The book is not closed.

828
01:19:54,953 --> 01:19:56,887
Alex...

829
01:19:59,523 --> 01:20:01,821
thank you
for saving my life.

830
01:20:01,892 --> 01:20:03,826
Good-bye. Jezzie.

831
01:20:11,367 --> 01:20:14,336
- Wanna hear something funny. Mac?
- Sure.

832
01:20:14,403 --> 01:20:18,066
Cheer me up.

833
01:20:18,141 --> 01:20:22,076
I congratulated Soneji
on scoring $ 12 million.

834
01:20:22,144 --> 01:20:24,203
You mean ten million.

835
01:20:26,114 --> 01:20:28,548
Exactly.

836
01:20:28,616 --> 01:20:32,643
He had no idea
what I was talking about.

837
01:20:56,642 --> 01:20:59,769
I know you.
You work at my school.

838
01:21:01,145 --> 01:21:03,079
Eat your food. Megan.

839
01:21:50,423 --> 01:21:52,948
Alex.
Where is this going?

840
01:22:00,131 --> 01:22:03,658
We've been through these tapes
backwards and forwards.

841
01:22:03,735 --> 01:22:05,930
I can't see how this is
helping us find Megan.

842
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:11,264
You know
what I see, Mac?

843
01:22:11,342 --> 01:22:14,675
Someone was onto Soneji
long before we ever heard of him.

844
01:22:14,745 --> 01:22:17,009
Look at this.
What do you see?

845
01:22:17,081 --> 01:22:19,674
Agent Devine hauling ass
out to the front gate.

846
01:22:19,749 --> 01:22:23,378
Mac. He could have shut this
whole place down from right there.

847
01:22:23,453 --> 01:22:26,820
Now. You wanna tell me
why he didn't?

848
01:22:29,891 --> 01:22:34,089
Good God.
Devine was in on it with him.

849
01:22:34,162 --> 01:22:36,892
Then. When Soneji hit the embassy.
He pulled a double cross.

850
01:22:36,965 --> 01:22:38,899
He ran his own ransom.

851
01:22:38,967 --> 01:22:42,333
No. Soneji was a loner.

852
01:22:42,403 --> 01:22:44,462
An accomplice would have
been beneath him.

853
01:22:44,538 --> 01:22:47,200
I'll tell you
what happened.

854
01:22:47,275 --> 01:22:50,004
Soneji was hoodwinked.

855
01:22:51,745 --> 01:22:54,524
And so were we.

856
01:22:54,657 --> 01:22:58,058
Details are still emerging.
But this much is clear:

857
01:22:58,128 --> 01:23:01,528
The manunt that began over a
week ago in the natiors capitol...

858
01:23:01,597 --> 01:23:03,895
...came to a violent end yesterday

859
01:23:03,966 --> 01:23:06,730
With the death of kidnapper,
Gary Soneji.

860
01:23:39,732 --> 01:23:41,892
Don't move.

861
01:23:41,966 --> 01:23:44,662
Turn around.
Hands on the wall. Feet apart.

862
01:23:44,736 --> 01:23:46,670
Hi. Jez.
Where'd you come from?

863
01:23:46,738 --> 01:23:49,605
You know something. Devine.
You're pretty stupid.

864
01:23:49,674 --> 01:23:51,607
Your car in the driveway.

865
01:23:51,675 --> 01:23:55,076
TV so loud. You wouldn't be able
to hear a SWAT team come in.

866
01:23:55,145 --> 01:23:57,636
- What are you doing...
- Shut up!

867
01:24:13,895 --> 01:24:16,159
Where's Megan?

868
01:24:16,231 --> 01:24:19,098
She's in the barn.
She was so doped up.

869
01:24:19,167 --> 01:24:21,361
I don't think she knew
I took her off the boat.

870
01:24:21,435 --> 01:24:24,495
She's still alive? You were
supposed to dump her in the river...

871
01:24:24,572 --> 01:24:28,702
- after you got the diamonds.
- Yeah. Well.

872
01:24:28,776 --> 01:24:32,768
Maybe killing a kid is something
I'm not prepared to do on my own.

873
01:24:32,845 --> 01:24:35,643
Anyway. Today. Tomorrow. It's still
gonna look like Soneji killed her.

874
01:24:35,715 --> 01:24:38,650
She can't die
after Soneji. You idiot.

875
01:24:38,718 --> 01:24:42,175
It doesn't make any difference.
They're never gonna find the body.

876
01:24:46,925 --> 01:24:50,951
Okay. I'll go do it now.
Will that make you happy?

877
01:24:51,028 --> 01:24:55,158
Yeah. It would. Wait!

878
01:24:58,803 --> 01:25:00,895
Can I see them?

879
01:25:16,218 --> 01:25:18,448
Hey. Do you realize
we spent an entire year...

880
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:22,011
following Soneji's
every move?

881
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:24,490
I think
we deserve these.

882
01:25:28,997 --> 01:25:32,693
That beats the hell out of
a Secret Service pension. Huh?

883
01:25:33,934 --> 01:25:37,028
Profiling the profiler.

884
01:25:37,104 --> 01:25:39,504
Kidnap from the kidnapper.
That's brilliant.

885
01:25:39,573 --> 01:25:42,871
You are a genius. Jez.

886
01:25:42,942 --> 01:25:46,139
Genius has nothing to do with it.
I'm just good at what I do.

887
01:25:49,482 --> 01:25:52,609
Didrt hurt that everyone else
involved was a complete half-wit.

888
01:25:52,684 --> 01:25:55,084
You think Alex Cross
is a half-wit?

889
01:25:55,153 --> 01:25:58,850
You really believe that
he shot Soneji to save my life?

890
01:25:58,923 --> 01:26:03,291
Cross pulled the trigger because
he knew Soneji didn't have Megan.

891
01:26:05,162 --> 01:26:07,096
What are you saying?

892
01:26:07,164 --> 01:26:10,565
I'm saying that sooner or later.
He's gonna figure it out.

893
01:26:10,634 --> 01:26:13,101
He already knows Soneji
didn't run the ransom.

894
01:26:14,871 --> 01:26:16,862
He's onto us already.
Isn't he?

895
01:26:16,939 --> 01:26:20,033
No. He's not onto us.

896
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:24,741
But I think
he's onto you.

897
01:28:08,907 --> 01:28:12,364
It's Turkish. My daddy won it
in a game of poker.

898
01:28:12,443 --> 01:28:15,435
That's about as much
as I know about my father.

899
01:29:58,405 --> 01:30:00,771
Megan?

900
01:30:00,841 --> 01:30:02,900
Megan. It's me. Honey.

901
01:30:02,977 --> 01:30:04,981
Jezzie?

902
01:30:04,981 --> 01:30:05,913
Jezzie?

903
01:30:05,982 --> 01:30:09,042
Jezzie. Jezzie.
I'm in here! Jezzie!

904
01:30:09,118 --> 01:30:11,848
Open up. Honey. I'm gonna
take you home. It's all over.

905
01:30:11,921 --> 01:30:14,650
Yeah. Sure.
Just hold on a second.

906
01:30:21,396 --> 01:30:24,728
- Jezzie?
- Yeah. Honey.

907
01:30:24,798 --> 01:30:27,494
What happened
to that other guy?

908
01:30:30,037 --> 01:30:33,597
He's dead. Megan.
You're safe now.

909
01:30:33,673 --> 01:30:36,506
Open up.

910
01:30:36,576 --> 01:30:39,977
- Jezzie?
- Yeah, honey.

911
01:30:40,046 --> 01:30:42,606
Why isn't there
anyone else with you?

912
01:30:46,852 --> 01:30:51,016
Megan. It's me. Don't be
scared of me. Open the door.

913
01:30:56,227 --> 01:30:59,355
Megan, I'm gonna ask you
one more time to open the door.

914
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:01,955
- Right now. Open the door!

915
01:31:02,033 --> 01:31:04,557
Megan, open the door
for me.

916
01:31:04,634 --> 01:31:07,102
Listen to me!
Open the door!

917
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:10,071
- Megan. Open the fucking door!

918
01:31:10,140 --> 01:31:13,405
Open it, bitch!

919
01:31:19,181 --> 01:31:22,309
Stop it! No!

920
01:31:22,384 --> 01:31:24,317
Stop it!

921
01:32:34,181 --> 01:32:36,115
That was very clever.
Megan.

922
01:33:18,455 --> 01:33:21,515
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

923
01:34:04,963 --> 01:34:07,295
Jezzie?

924
01:34:10,769 --> 01:34:13,237
It's over.

925
01:34:13,305 --> 01:34:15,238
Drop the gun.

926
01:34:19,143 --> 01:34:21,077
Alex...

927
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:25,213
how-how did you. Um...

928
01:34:25,281 --> 01:34:27,613
Aces and eights. Jezzie.

929
01:34:27,684 --> 01:34:31,245
Plus, your timing
was a little off.

930
01:34:31,321 --> 01:34:33,255
I watched the tapes.

931
01:34:33,323 --> 01:34:38,123
You and Devine could have
stopped Soneji at the school.

932
01:34:38,193 --> 01:34:41,128
Just like you could have stopped
him at the Russian Embassy.

933
01:34:41,196 --> 01:34:43,630
But you had
a different agenda.

934
01:34:43,699 --> 01:34:46,826
You know something. Alex?

935
01:34:46,901 --> 01:34:48,994
When you said.
"You do what you are."

936
01:34:49,070 --> 01:34:51,595
You were right.

937
01:34:51,672 --> 01:34:54,800
I'm living proof.

938
01:34:56,076 --> 01:34:58,567
Put the gun down. Jezzie.

939
01:35:04,351 --> 01:35:07,649
Would you kill
another partner?

940
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:10,450
You're not my partner.

941
01:36:25,557 --> 01:36:27,717
Are you all right?

942
01:36:30,294 --> 01:36:32,489
You're a very brave girl.
Megan.

943
01:36:32,563 --> 01:36:35,657
Who are you?

944
01:36:35,733 --> 01:36:38,667
I'm a policeman.

945
01:36:41,838 --> 01:36:44,773
My name is Alex Cross.

946
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:47,400
I'm a friend
of your parents.

947
01:36:51,013 --> 01:36:53,243
Can you take me to them?

948
01:36:54,716 --> 01:36:57,445
Nothing would give me
greater pleasure.

949
01:37:01,155 --> 01:37:04,955
Could you...
Ah. Thanks.

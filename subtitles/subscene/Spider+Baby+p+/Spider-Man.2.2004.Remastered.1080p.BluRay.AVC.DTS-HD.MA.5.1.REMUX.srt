1
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:04,018
<i>She looks at me every day.</i>

2
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,978
<i>Mary Jane Watson.</i>

3
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:10,191
<i>Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.</i>

4
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:12,151
<i>But she can never know.</i>

5
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,780
<i>I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.</i>

6
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:18,241
<i>A life she can never be a part of.</i>

7
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:19,701
<i>Who am I?</i>

8
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:22,454
<i>I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.</i>

9
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,623
<i>And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.</i>

10
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,375
Parker. Parker!

11
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,794
No, no, no, stop! Stop!

12
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:33,881
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.

13
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,968
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.

14
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:39,429
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.

15
00:03:39,596 --> 00:03:42,390
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.

16
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:46,144
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.

17
00:03:46,311 --> 00:03:49,189
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.

18
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:52,316
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas...

19
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:55,153
...but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.

20
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,698
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.

21
00:03:58,865 --> 00:04:02,619
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.

22
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:04,829
This is your last chance.

23
00:04:04,996 --> 00:04:09,751
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.

24
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:13,338
Go!

25
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,195
Hey, what, are you stupid?

26
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:02,303
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!

27
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,605
I'm gonna get it!

28
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,581
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.

29
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.

30
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,960
See you.

31
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:36,421
Way to go, Spidey!

32
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:31,184
Pizza time.

33
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:37,523
You're late.

34
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:39,817
I'm not paying for those.

35
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,756
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.

36
00:07:02,048 --> 00:07:06,552
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.

37
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,721
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.

38
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:11,349
- You're fired. Go.
- Please, I need this job.

39
00:07:11,516 --> 00:07:14,143
- You're fired.
- Look, give me another chance.

40
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:24,570
<i>You're fired.</i>

41
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:26,989
- Parker, hello. You're fired.
- Why?

42
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:28,616
Dogs catching Frisbees?

43
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:31,077
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?

44
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:32,495
- Boss.
- Not now.

45
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:35,373
The <i>Bugle</i> could show another side
of New York for a change.

46
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,501
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.

47
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:42,046
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you-- Still not now!

48
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,841
I pay you because that psycho
Spider-Man will pose for you.

49
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,717
He won't let me take
any more pictures.

50
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:48,511
You turned the whole city
against him.

51
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:50,179
A fact I'm very proud of.

52
00:07:50,346 --> 00:07:54,100
Get your pretty little portfolio off my
desk before I go into a diabetic coma.

53
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:57,645
- It's your wife, she lost her checkbook.
- Thanks for the good news.

54
00:07:57,812 --> 00:08:01,149
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I need the money.

55
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:04,360
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.

56
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:06,237
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.

57
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:09,073
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:

58
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,075
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."

59
00:08:11,242 --> 00:08:13,619
- Some food got poisoned?
- I'm a little nauseous.

60
00:08:13,786 --> 00:08:15,663
All right, Mr. Jameson.

61
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,542
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.

62
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,335
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."

63
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,962
I told you, he's not a menace.

64
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:24,922
- I told you--
- I'll take care of it.

65
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:26,632
- I'll give you 150.
- Three hundred.

66
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:28,301
That's outrageous.

67
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,428
Done. Give this to the girl.

68
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:31,888
Thank you. Bye-bye.

69
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:33,764
Hi.

70
00:08:34,015 --> 00:08:35,433
Hey, Pete.

71
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:42,273
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.

72
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:44,609
- Right.
- Sorry.

73
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,028
Hey.

74
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,113
Chin up, okay?

75
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,669
Watch it, jerk!

76
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:16,224
Dr. Connors. Sorry.

77
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,975
Where were you headed, Parker?

78
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:19,477
To your class.

79
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:21,479
My class is over.

80
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:23,814
See me standing here?

81
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:27,818
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.

82
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,320
Then be here.

83
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:32,156
Look at you, Peter.

84
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:36,994
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.

85
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:40,081
You always appear exhausted.

86
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:43,584
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.

87
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:46,879
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.

88
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:50,216
Planning is not a major
at this university.

89
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,554
Octavius is a friend of mine.

90
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,890
Better do your research, Parker.

91
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:01,394
Get it done, or I'm failing you.

92
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:24,959
Surprise!

93
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:27,044
Well, say something.

94
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,504
What's the occasion?

95
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:31,215
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!

96
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:34,552
Whether you want
to remember it or not.

97
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:38,222
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?

98
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,349
- Hi, M.J.
- Hi.

99
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,226
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

100
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:43,602
Long time, no see.

101
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,648
So how's the play?
I read a great review.

102
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,525
It's going fine. It's going good.

103
00:10:49,692 --> 00:10:50,943
She's brilliant in it.

104
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,778
Harry sent me roses.

105
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:55,531
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.

106
00:10:56,991 --> 00:10:58,868
I've been busy.

107
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:02,580
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?

108
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:04,749
The less you see of that man,
the better.

109
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:08,377
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.

110
00:11:08,544 --> 00:11:09,795
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

111
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:12,089
So how are things going at Oscorp?

112
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:15,134
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.

113
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:17,428
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.

114
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:21,807
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.

115
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:23,267
Thank you.

116
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:27,396
We're actually funding
one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.

117
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:30,066
- I'm writing a paper on him.
- You want to meet him?

118
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:31,484
You'd introduce me?

119
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,862
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map...

120
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:37,073
...in a way my father
never even dreamed of.

121
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,158
M.J., could you give me a hand?

122
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,120
She's waiting for you, pal.

123
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,081
What do you mean?

124
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:47,708
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.

125
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,627
However you want to look at it.

126
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,129
I don't have time for girls right now.

127
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:53,631
Why, are you dead?

128
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:55,299
I've been kind of busy.

129
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,176
Taking pictures of your friend?

130
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,179
Could we get off that subject?

131
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,682
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.

132
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,476
Then be honest with me.

133
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,354
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?

134
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:33,504
May.

135
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:35,214
Oh, what, Ben?

136
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:38,509
Wait.

137
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,136
- Aunt May.
- Oh, my.

138
00:12:40,553 --> 00:12:45,766
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

139
00:12:47,977 --> 00:12:49,895
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

140
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:52,022
Did they have a good time?

141
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:53,774
I'm sure they did.

142
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:59,447
- You okay?
- Of course. But you go home.

143
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:05,202
And be careful. I don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.

144
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,121
I'm worried about you.

145
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:12,460
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.

146
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,212
Oh, my. You did?

147
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:17,047
Oh, well.

148
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:18,632
So?

149
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,843
I'm a little behind.

150
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:23,554
Everybody is.

151
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:27,224
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

152
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:31,145
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.

153
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:35,399
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

154
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,401
You need it more than I do.

155
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:40,112
- No, I can't take that from you.
- Yes, you can!

156
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:42,323
You can take this money from me.

157
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,242
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

158
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,912
And don't you dare leave it here.

159
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,997
Oh, I'm sorry.

160
00:13:51,207 --> 00:13:54,752
It's just that I miss
your uncle Ben so much.

161
00:13:56,795 --> 00:14:01,759
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?

162
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,263
I think to myself at times...

163
00:14:07,431 --> 00:14:11,769
...were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd...

164
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,813
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

165
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:22,947
Now...

166
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,618
...you better take
the rest of your cake home.

167
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:43,842
Hey.

168
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,178
Hey. You're still here.

169
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:48,931
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.

170
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,393
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

171
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,647
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

172
00:14:59,358 --> 00:15:01,694
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.

173
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:05,698
Oh, boy, yeah.

174
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:09,285
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

175
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,457
Nothing.

176
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:21,672
Do you want to say something?

177
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,263
I...

178
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:36,478
...was...

179
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,733
...wondering if you're still
in the Village.

180
00:15:49,867 --> 00:15:51,910
You're such a mystery.

181
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:03,964
Peter.

182
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:06,884
What?

183
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:13,599
Happy birthday.

184
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:24,443
I'm seeing somebody now.

185
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:27,446
You mean, like a boyfriend?

186
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:30,282
Well, like I like him.

187
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,828
What?

188
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:37,247
Nothing.

189
00:16:38,082 --> 00:16:41,335
That's good, you know?
Companionship...

190
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:44,713
May be more than that.

191
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:47,383
More?

192
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:49,551
I don't know.

193
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:53,097
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow night.

194
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:59,103
- You're coming?
- I'll be there.

195
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:01,772
Don't disappoint me.

196
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:04,900
I won't.

197
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,624
Rent.

198
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:27,131
- Hi.
- Hi. What's "hi"?

199
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,799
Can I spend it?

200
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,468
I have a paycheck due this week
and--

201
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:34,972
- You're a month late again. Again.
- I promise as soon as--

202
00:17:35,264 --> 00:17:38,642
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.

203
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:43,731
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All
I got is this 20 for the rest of the week.

204
00:17:44,398 --> 00:17:45,941
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

205
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:50,988
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.

206
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:55,534
- Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
- Hi, Pete.

207
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:43,957
Hello?

208
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,050
Rent?

209
00:18:58,138 --> 00:19:00,516
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.

210
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:04,561
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.

211
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:06,522
It's not about the prizes, Harry.

212
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,482
But you need money.
You need Oscorp.

213
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:09,942
Who do we have here?

214
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,860
This is my good friend
I called you about.

215
00:19:12,027 --> 00:19:13,695
He got me through
high-school science.

216
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,865
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for--

217
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,450
I know what you're doing here...

218
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:20,911
...but I don't have time
to talk to students now.

219
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,705
But Oscorp pays the bills, so...

220
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,208
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.

221
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,753
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.

222
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,508
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!

223
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,720
Interesting fellow, your friend.

224
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,014
I won't take much of your time.

225
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:45,561
Now I remember you. You're Connors'
student. He tells me you're brilliant.

226
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,438
He also tells me you're lazy.

227
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,691
I'm trying to do better.

228
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:54,444
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.

229
00:19:54,778 --> 00:19:57,948
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.

230
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:00,284
And you use it
for the good of mankind.

231
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,910
You want to try it back there?

232
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:04,288
So is that it?

233
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:08,876
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.

234
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:12,170
I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.

235
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:13,714
Sympathetic frequencies.

236
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:15,924
Harmonic reinforcement?

237
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,968
Go on.

238
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:22,097
An exponential increase
in energy output.

239
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,932
A huge amount of energy.

240
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:28,270
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

241
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:31,648
Are you sure you could stabilize
the fusion reaction?

242
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:35,152
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?

243
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,654
This is my life's work.

244
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:41,158
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

245
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:43,619
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to question you.

246
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:47,164
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

247
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:49,166
You can sleep soundly tonight.

248
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:51,043
Otto's done his homework.

249
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:54,338
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.

250
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:57,007
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.

251
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:59,343
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?

252
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:02,137
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

253
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,431
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the <i>5th?</i>

254
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:07,893
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

255
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,562
Rosie, I love this boy.

256
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:14,524
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?

257
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,152
Well...

258
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,655
I don't really know.

259
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:22,908
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?

260
00:21:23,158 --> 00:21:26,119
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

261
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:28,205
Love should never be a secret.

262
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:31,625
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...

263
00:21:32,376 --> 00:21:34,002
...gonna make you sick.

264
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:36,421
I finally got lucky in love.

265
00:21:36,588 --> 00:21:37,923
We both did.

266
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:41,802
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.

267
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:45,681
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.

268
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:49,101
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.

269
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,437
That's right. I was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.

270
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:55,107
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.

271
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,360
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.

272
00:21:58,527 --> 00:21:59,736
- Yes, you do.
- I'm serious.

273
00:21:59,903 --> 00:22:03,448
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.

274
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,953
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.

275
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:09,621
Poetry.

276
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:12,290
Never fails.

277
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,798
<i>A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie</i>

278
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,342
<i>Brightest green were all her garments</i>

279
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,886
<i>And her hair was like the sunshine</i>

280
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:27,931
<i>Day by day he gazed upon her</i>

281
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:26,823
Rent!

282
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,410
Where is my money?!

283
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:58,355
You seem jittery tonight.

284
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:00,315
You never know who's coming.

285
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:18,625
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.

286
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,144
How'd you do that?

287
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:42,440
Work out, plenty of rest.

288
00:24:42,691 --> 00:24:44,568
You know, eat your green vegetables.

289
00:24:45,402 --> 00:24:48,989
That's what my morn is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.

290
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:53,160
Come on. Go.

291
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:57,497
Keep it steady.

292
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,521
It's a web.

293
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:24,274
Go, Spidey, go!

294
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:33,617
We got trouble!

295
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,221
Get me down!

296
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,766
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.

297
00:25:57,933 --> 00:26:01,228
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

298
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:03,521
Then you think we should
forgive them?

299
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,068
Yes.

300
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,070
I mean, no.

301
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:18,662
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.

302
00:26:19,329 --> 00:26:20,664
Whatever.

303
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,834
Shoelace.

304
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,007
You might want to...

305
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:40,517
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I've come to see the show.

306
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:44,521
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.

307
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,024
It helps maintain the illusion.

308
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,821
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.

309
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:54,489
But not to come late.

310
00:26:56,908 --> 00:27:00,370
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the--

311
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,219
<i>A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man</i>

312
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:19,389
<i>A-does whatever a spider can</i>

313
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:22,559
<i>A-spins a web, any size</i>

314
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:25,103
<i>Catches thieves a-just like flies</i>

315
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,523
<i>Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man</i>

316
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:46,916
You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?

317
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,460
Yeah, I'm sure.

318
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:50,545
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.

319
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:52,422
- You were great tonight.
- Thanks.

320
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:57,510
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?

321
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:00,138
What are you doing here?

322
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:16,488
You hungry?

323
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:17,906
Starved.

324
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:10,458
What was that?

325
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:16,673
Okay.

326
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:57,797
Cool Spidey outfit.

327
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:00,884
Thanks.

328
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,137
Where'd you get it?

329
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:06,806
I made it.

330
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,395
Looks uncomfortable.

331
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,899
Yeah, it gets kind of itchy.

332
00:30:19,068 --> 00:30:22,155
And it rides up in the crotch
a little bit too.

333
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:16,292
<i>Hi. It's me.
Sing your song at the beep.</i>

334
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,378
Hi, M.J.

335
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:19,837
This is Peter.

336
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,466
<i>I was on my way to your show and...</i>

337
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:28,179
<i>Well, I was on my bike...</i>

338
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:32,725
<i>Are you there?</i>

339
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:38,231
I really was planning on it all clay.

340
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,067
And...

341
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:44,821
...I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.

342
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,781
Bingo.

343
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:49,492
<i>It's amazing, isn't it?</i>

344
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:53,246
<i>How complicated a simple thing...</i>

345
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:58,543
<i>...like being someplace at 8:00
can become.</i>

346
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:06,301
<i>Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.</i>

347
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:10,096
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.

348
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:11,806
<i>Your time has expired.</i>

349
00:32:11,973 --> 00:32:16,185
<i>Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.</i>

350
00:32:25,903 --> 00:32:28,031
I wanna tell you the truth.

351
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:31,576
Here it is.

352
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:34,245
I'm Spider-Man.

353
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:36,789
Weird, huh?

354
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:40,960
Now you know
why I can't be with you.

355
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:46,758
If my enemies found out about you...

356
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:52,847
...if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.

357
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:01,731
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.

358
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:14,494
Ladies and gentlemen...

359
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:18,498
...my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.

360
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:20,333
But first, before we start...

361
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,879
...has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?

362
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:26,798
Because we found the rubber band.

363
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:32,929
It's a terrible joke.

364
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:34,806
But thank you for coming.

365
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,391
Today...

366
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:41,104
...you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.

367
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:46,609
Safe, renewable energy
and cheap electricity for everyone.

368
00:33:47,944 --> 00:33:51,197
And now let me introduce
my assistants.

369
00:33:58,788 --> 00:34:01,791
These four actuators were
developed and programmed...

370
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:05,461
...for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.

371
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:08,131
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.

372
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:57,597
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

373
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:01,058
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum...

374
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:05,354
...allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction...

375
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:08,357
...in an environment
no human hand could enter.

376
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:10,943
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms...

377
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,904
...is as advanced as you suggest...

378
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,114
...couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?

379
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:16,532
How right you are.

380
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,785
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip...

381
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,329
...to protect
my higher brain function.

382
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:25,958
It means I maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.

383
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:28,586
And now on to the main event.

384
00:35:28,753 --> 00:35:30,671
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

385
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:54,111
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

386
00:35:54,278 --> 00:35:57,406
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

387
00:35:58,074 --> 00:36:02,245
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn
and Oscorp Industries for providing it.

388
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:04,330
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

389
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:19,679
Ladies and gentlemen...

390
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:24,100
...fasten your seat belts.

391
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:45,454
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

392
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:53,546
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

393
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:54,964
Thank you.

394
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:57,008
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

395
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:06,559
The power of the sun...

396
00:37:07,184 --> 00:37:09,312
...in the palm of my hand.

397
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:33,502
Keep calm! It's only a spike!

398
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:35,504
It'll soon stabilize!

399
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:44,013
Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear the room.

400
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,187
We have a containment breach!

401
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:56,025
Otto, please get back!

402
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:59,820
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

403
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:02,823
It will stabilize! It's under control!

404
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,867
I'm in charge here!

405
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:07,870
It's my money! I'm in con--

406
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:13,501
This doesn't change anything.

407
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:19,215
- What are you doing?
- Pulling the plug.

408
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:20,841
No!

409
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:41,362
Rosie!

410
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,227
Watch it.

411
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:14,603
That was too close.

412
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:18,858
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.

413
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,656
I'm ruined.

414
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:29,827
I have nothing left, except Spider-Man.

415
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:31,662
He saved your life, sir.

416
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:34,498
He humiliated me by touching me.

417
00:39:34,665 --> 00:39:37,293
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.

418
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,336
What was he doing here anyway?

419
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:58,189
Molten metal penetrated
the spinal cavity...

420
00:39:58,355 --> 00:40:00,483
...and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points...

421
00:40:00,649 --> 00:40:03,235
...including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

422
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:05,571
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.

423
00:40:05,738 --> 00:40:08,699
I suggest we cut off these mechanical
arms, slice up the harness...

424
00:40:08,866 --> 00:40:11,243
...and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy...

425
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,663
...with posterior spinal fusion
from C7-T1 to T12.

426
00:40:14,955 --> 00:40:16,248
We're ready, doctor.

427
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:21,378
Anybody here take shop class?

428
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:06,465
Help me! Help me!

429
00:42:17,536 --> 00:42:21,040
No!

430
00:43:12,508 --> 00:43:15,344
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumors.

431
00:43:15,511 --> 00:43:17,680
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.

432
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:20,683
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.

433
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:23,852
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.

434
00:43:24,311 --> 00:43:28,983
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?

435
00:43:29,149 --> 00:43:30,359
Hoffman!

436
00:43:32,403 --> 00:43:33,862
What are we gonna call this guy?

437
00:43:34,029 --> 00:43:36,282
- "Dr. Octopus."
- That's crap.

438
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:38,033
- "Science Squid"?
- Crap!

439
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:40,286
- "Dr. Strange."
- That's pretty good.

440
00:43:41,078 --> 00:43:45,291
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus."

441
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:47,751
- I like it.
- Of course you do.

442
00:43:47,918 --> 00:43:51,672
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
"Doc Ock."

443
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,841
- Genius.
- What, are you looking for a raise?

444
00:43:54,008 --> 00:43:55,676
Get out.

445
00:43:56,385 --> 00:43:57,636
Chief, I found Parker.

446
00:43:57,803 --> 00:44:00,014
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill.

447
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,474
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!

448
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:03,934
I heard Spider-Man was there.

449
00:44:05,102 --> 00:44:07,730
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.

450
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:09,189
Chief, the planetarium party.

451
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:11,066
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.

452
00:44:11,233 --> 00:44:12,776
What do you know
about high society?

453
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:15,237
- Oh. Well, I--
- Don't answer that.

454
00:44:15,404 --> 00:44:18,866
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.

455
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:21,994
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.

456
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:23,912
Could you pay me in advance?

457
00:44:32,963 --> 00:44:35,424
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?

458
00:44:35,591 --> 00:44:38,260
The planetarium, tomorrow night, 8:00.
There's the door.

459
00:44:53,317 --> 00:44:55,069
My Rosie's dead.

460
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:58,989
My dream is dead.

461
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:03,952
And these...

462
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:09,458
...monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...

463
00:45:12,294 --> 00:45:13,712
...along with me.

464
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:24,306
Something...

465
00:45:25,766 --> 00:45:27,267
...in my head.

466
00:45:30,938 --> 00:45:32,481
Something talking.

467
00:45:36,527 --> 00:45:37,986
The inhibitor chip!

468
00:45:41,407 --> 00:45:42,991
Gone.

469
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:49,039
Rebuild.

470
00:45:52,459 --> 00:45:54,128
No.

471
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:56,755
Peter was right.

472
00:45:59,091 --> 00:46:00,676
I miscalculated.

473
00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:09,351
I couldn't have miscalculated.

474
00:46:10,436 --> 00:46:12,354
It was working, wasn't it?

475
00:46:17,276 --> 00:46:18,694
Yes.

476
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:22,739
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.

477
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:25,200
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.

478
00:46:26,034 --> 00:46:27,870
But we need money.

479
00:46:29,663 --> 00:46:30,998
Steal it?

480
00:46:31,165 --> 00:46:33,000
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.

481
00:46:35,586 --> 00:46:36,920
That's right.

482
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:42,050
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.

483
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:47,347
We'll do it here.

484
00:46:48,056 --> 00:46:51,393
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

485
00:46:51,685 --> 00:46:54,188
Nothing will stand in our way.

486
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:55,689
Nothing!

487
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:03,739
- That's the social security.
- Yes, I see.

488
00:47:04,031 --> 00:47:05,741
My uncle Ben's life insurance.

489
00:47:05,908 --> 00:47:08,118
Yes, but I'm afraid...

490
00:47:08,285 --> 00:47:11,413
...it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.

491
00:47:11,705 --> 00:47:15,209
Oh, but I'm giving
piano lessons again.

492
00:47:15,417 --> 00:47:16,668
You are?

493
00:47:21,798 --> 00:47:25,052
We appreciate
that you've just opened up...

494
00:47:25,219 --> 00:47:27,804
...a new supersaver account
with us today.

495
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:29,264
But the fact is...

496
00:47:29,431 --> 00:47:33,769
...you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.

497
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:35,938
Well...

498
00:47:37,731 --> 00:47:39,566
At least we get the toaster.

499
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:43,779
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of 300 or more.

500
00:47:46,615 --> 00:47:47,950
Oh, yes, I see.

501
00:47:49,409 --> 00:47:51,036
Okay.

502
00:47:54,122 --> 00:47:56,208
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

503
00:48:13,517 --> 00:48:14,851
Peter?

504
00:48:16,603 --> 00:48:18,647
Don't leave me.

505
00:48:19,439 --> 00:48:21,858
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.

506
00:48:22,359 --> 00:48:23,610
Hold it!

507
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:27,030
Put your arms up! All of them!

508
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:51,638
Here's your change!

509
00:49:01,607 --> 00:49:03,191
Oh, no. Come on!

510
00:49:16,538 --> 00:49:18,707
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I have a knack for that.

511
00:49:18,874 --> 00:49:20,500
Not anymore.

512
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:52,032
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Freeze!

513
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:57,788
- Hold your fire!
- Don't follow me.

514
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,460
Wait a second.

515
00:50:21,186 --> 00:50:23,480
- Hand her over.
- Of course.

516
00:50:24,231 --> 00:50:25,482
Easy, now.

517
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:28,902
Butterfingers.

518
00:50:41,164 --> 00:50:42,457
Look out!

519
00:50:44,668 --> 00:50:46,586
Help me!

520
00:50:48,672 --> 00:50:51,299
- Help me!
- I'm coming!

521
00:50:56,513 --> 00:50:58,432
Hang on!

522
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:17,617
Help!

523
00:51:37,471 --> 00:51:39,139
Thank you.

524
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:43,685
Aunt May.

525
00:51:43,852 --> 00:51:46,855
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.

526
00:51:47,022 --> 00:51:50,066
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.

527
00:51:55,614 --> 00:51:57,240
Come on.

528
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:03,371
Shame on you.

529
00:52:35,779 --> 00:52:37,405
There you go.

530
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:41,743
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.

531
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:43,161
We sure showed him.

532
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:45,080
What do you mean, "we"?

533
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:51,586
- Take me with you, Spider-Man.
- Take me.

534
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:21,700
- May I?
- Sure. Go ahead.

535
00:53:22,701 --> 00:53:24,619
Penny! Over here!

536
00:53:29,958 --> 00:53:31,501
Leave it.

537
00:53:35,547 --> 00:53:38,049
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.

538
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:39,551
Why? It's a party.

539
00:53:39,718 --> 00:53:42,637
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot...

540
00:53:42,804 --> 00:53:46,141
...who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?

541
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:48,226
Not to mention your friend the bug.

542
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:50,020
Not tonight, Harry.

543
00:53:50,186 --> 00:53:53,648
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24/7.

544
00:53:54,149 --> 00:53:55,609
Parker!

545
00:53:56,276 --> 00:53:57,485
Parker!

546
00:53:58,028 --> 00:54:01,114
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.

547
00:54:01,281 --> 00:54:03,199
Think I'm paying you
to sip champagne?

548
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:05,410
Get a shot of my wife with the minister.

549
00:54:05,827 --> 00:54:07,078
Beautiful tie.

550
00:54:07,245 --> 00:54:09,497
Get a shot of us with the DA.

551
00:54:09,915 --> 00:54:11,416
Beautiful dress.

552
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:14,586
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.

553
00:54:15,921 --> 00:54:17,505
Wife.

554
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:21,801
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

555
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:25,013
The committee for
the Science Library of New York...

556
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,432
...is pleased to present
our guest of honor.

557
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,353
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.

558
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:35,607
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious...

559
00:54:35,774 --> 00:54:37,651
...Captain John Jameson.

560
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,863
Hi.

561
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:29,536
- You.
- Listen, I'm sorry.

562
00:55:29,703 --> 00:55:31,830
But there was a disturbance.

563
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,415
I don't know you.

564
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:39,295
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.

565
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:41,881
I've been reading poetry lately.

566
00:55:42,048 --> 00:55:43,425
Whatever that means.

567
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:47,429
<i>Day by day he gazed upon her</i>

568
00:55:47,846 --> 00:55:50,682
<i>Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day--</i>

569
00:55:50,849 --> 00:55:52,726
Don't start.

570
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:55,854
Can I get you a drink?

571
00:55:56,104 --> 00:55:57,897
I'm with John. He'll get me my drink.

572
00:55:58,565 --> 00:56:00,191
John.

573
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:04,279
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.

574
00:56:04,446 --> 00:56:07,407
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.

575
00:56:07,574 --> 00:56:10,076
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.

576
00:56:10,243 --> 00:56:11,453
Even my father.

577
00:56:12,704 --> 00:56:15,415
He came backstage to borrow cash.

578
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:21,421
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me...

579
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:23,757
...can't make an 8:00 curtain.

580
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:27,010
After all these years...

581
00:56:28,303 --> 00:56:30,930
...he's nothing to me but an empty seat.

582
00:56:56,414 --> 00:56:59,793
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider-Man and not to your best friend.

583
00:56:59,959 --> 00:57:03,213
I find him with my father's body,
and you defend him.

584
00:57:03,379 --> 00:57:05,381
- Take it easy.
- Don't push me.

585
00:57:05,548 --> 00:57:07,425
Don't act like you're my friend.

586
00:57:08,176 --> 00:57:10,178
You stole M.J. from me.

587
00:57:10,512 --> 00:57:12,472
You stole my father's love.

588
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:18,144
Then you let him die because you
didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right?

589
00:57:19,354 --> 00:57:21,606
Huh? Isn't that right?

590
00:57:21,773 --> 00:57:23,566
Huh, brother?

591
00:57:34,536 --> 00:57:37,288
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...

592
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:42,460
...that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.

593
00:57:52,971 --> 00:57:54,430
What a surprise.

594
00:57:54,597 --> 00:57:57,517
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!

595
00:58:24,586 --> 00:58:26,880
Oh, no. No!

596
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:40,101
Why is this happening to me?

597
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:09,399
You seem very okay to me.

598
01:00:10,108 --> 01:00:11,484
My diagnosis?

599
01:00:11,985 --> 01:00:13,444
It's up here.

600
01:00:16,155 --> 01:00:20,201
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?

601
01:00:21,369 --> 01:00:24,080
There is one dream where...

602
01:00:24,539 --> 01:00:25,999
...in my dream...

603
01:00:27,166 --> 01:00:28,543
...I'm Spider-Man.

604
01:00:28,918 --> 01:00:33,381
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.

605
01:00:37,093 --> 01:00:38,720
So you're Spider-Man.

606
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:40,096
In my dream.

607
01:00:40,263 --> 01:00:44,642
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.

608
01:00:46,936 --> 01:00:48,563
Somebody else's dream.

609
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,237
What about this friend?

610
01:00:56,404 --> 01:00:59,741
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

611
01:01:00,241 --> 01:01:04,162
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.

612
01:01:04,787 --> 01:01:08,583
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.

613
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,501
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.

614
01:01:11,294 --> 01:01:12,879
Listen...

615
01:01:13,755 --> 01:01:18,009
...maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.

616
01:01:18,426 --> 01:01:20,178
That's why you keep falling.

617
01:01:22,638 --> 01:01:24,599
You always have a choice, Peter.

618
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:28,519
I have a choice.

619
01:01:37,612 --> 01:01:40,615
<i>All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter...</i>

620
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:43,159
<i>...make me sad.</i>

621
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:46,621
Can't you understand?

622
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:49,624
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

623
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:53,503
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty...

624
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:56,798
...fairness, justice...

625
01:01:57,507 --> 01:02:02,261
Out of those times,
I counted on you to have the courage...

626
01:02:02,512 --> 01:02:06,349
...to take those dreams
out into the world.

627
01:02:07,475 --> 01:02:10,019
I can't live your dreams anymore.

628
01:02:11,187 --> 01:02:13,022
I want a life of my own.

629
01:02:13,189 --> 01:02:15,316
You've been given a gift, Peter.

630
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:19,862
With great power
comes great responsibility.

631
01:02:24,492 --> 01:02:26,160
Take my hand, son.

632
01:02:39,382 --> 01:02:41,050
No, Uncle Ben.

633
01:02:43,177 --> 01:02:45,388
I'm just Peter Parker.

634
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:48,891
I'm Spider-Man...

635
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:51,310
...no more.

636
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:53,855
No more.

637
01:03:02,113 --> 01:03:03,573
No more.

638
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:34,747
- You punk!
- Sorry.

639
01:04:35,456 --> 01:04:37,291
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

640
01:04:44,757 --> 01:04:45,967
Hurry up!

641
01:04:55,643 --> 01:04:59,355
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are...?

642
01:04:59,522 --> 01:05:01,274
Someone, please?

643
01:05:03,484 --> 01:05:05,736
.23 electron volts.

644
01:05:10,992 --> 01:05:13,869
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.

645
01:05:24,547 --> 01:05:27,466
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

646
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:30,469
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...

647
01:05:30,636 --> 01:05:32,597
...in a very inexcusable manner.

648
01:05:32,763 --> 01:05:34,932
I hope you have not been
leading a double life...

649
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:38,311
...pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.

650
01:05:38,477 --> 01:05:40,229
That would be hypocrisy.

651
01:05:41,272 --> 01:05:43,691
Of course, I have been
rather reckless.

652
01:05:49,488 --> 01:05:50,990
"I am glad."

653
01:05:51,824 --> 01:05:53,868
"I am glad."

654
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,911
"I am glad."

655
01:05:57,747 --> 01:05:59,874
Are you glad to hear it?

656
01:06:02,084 --> 01:06:04,420
I am glad...

657
01:06:04,587 --> 01:06:06,047
...to hear it.

658
01:06:06,213 --> 01:06:07,923
In fact, now you mention
the subject...

659
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:11,719
...I have been very bad
in my own small way.

660
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:16,641
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

661
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:18,851
You could've told me
you were coming.

662
01:06:19,018 --> 01:06:21,354
I was afraid you'd say,
"Don't come."

663
01:06:25,066 --> 01:06:26,734
You look different.

664
01:06:27,485 --> 01:06:32,406
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants,
did my homework.

665
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:34,450
I do my homework now.

666
01:06:36,577 --> 01:06:38,412
You wanna get some chow mein?

667
01:06:38,579 --> 01:06:39,997
Peter...

668
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:41,999
...I'm getting married.

669
01:06:46,921 --> 01:06:49,840
I always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.

670
01:06:50,132 --> 01:06:51,801
And who's the groom?

671
01:06:52,134 --> 01:06:53,844
You hadn't decided yet.

672
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:58,391
You think just because
you saw my play...

673
01:06:58,557 --> 01:07:00,935
...you can talk me out
of getting married?

674
01:07:01,227 --> 01:07:04,438
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.

675
01:07:04,605 --> 01:07:08,109
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.

676
01:07:08,567 --> 01:07:10,111
You're too late.

677
01:07:11,237 --> 01:07:12,613
Will you think about it?

678
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,115
Think about what?

679
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:16,283
Picking up where we left off.

680
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:17,785
Where was that?

681
01:07:17,952 --> 01:07:20,454
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.

682
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:21,997
I don't think it's that simple.

683
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:24,458
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.

684
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,252
You don't understand.

685
01:07:26,752 --> 01:07:29,171
I'm not an empty seat anymore.

686
01:07:29,755 --> 01:07:31,132
I'm different.

687
01:07:31,757 --> 01:07:33,759
Punch me, I bleed.

688
01:07:41,016 --> 01:07:42,518
I have to go.

689
01:07:49,608 --> 01:07:51,819
I'm getting married in a church.

690
01:07:59,535 --> 01:08:01,078
You are different.

691
01:08:15,968 --> 01:08:19,096
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding,
not go into bankruptcy.

692
01:08:19,889 --> 01:08:22,516
Caviar?
What, are we inviting the tsar?

693
01:08:22,683 --> 01:08:25,686
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail weenies.

694
01:08:25,853 --> 01:08:29,023
I got a garbage man here says he's
got something you might want to see.

695
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:32,777
If you have an extraterrestrial's head in
there, you're the third guy this week.

696
01:08:35,446 --> 01:08:37,281
Where the hell did you get that?

697
01:08:37,448 --> 01:08:38,991
In the garbage.

698
01:08:39,158 --> 01:08:40,576
In the garbage?

699
01:08:42,578 --> 01:08:44,371
He must've given up.

700
01:08:44,663 --> 01:08:49,376
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.

701
01:08:50,211 --> 01:08:53,464
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.

702
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:58,427
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.

703
01:08:58,594 --> 01:09:01,680
- Give you 50 bucks.
- I could get more than that on eBay.

704
01:09:01,847 --> 01:09:04,892
All right, 100. Give this man his
money and throw in a bar of soap.

705
01:09:05,643 --> 01:09:07,603
Your wife is still on that line.

706
01:09:09,021 --> 01:09:10,773
Flowers? How much?

707
01:09:11,398 --> 01:09:14,610
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.

708
01:09:14,777 --> 01:09:16,070
Get plastic.

709
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:18,781
Gotta go, big story.

710
01:09:29,875 --> 01:09:33,128
<i>Spider-Man
Spider-Man</i>

711
01:09:33,295 --> 01:09:36,298
<i>Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?</i>

712
01:09:36,465 --> 01:09:39,885
<i>Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?</i>

713
01:09:47,309 --> 01:09:49,645
Come on, man. Get the money.

714
01:09:51,313 --> 01:09:53,148
Come on, come on.

715
01:09:55,526 --> 01:09:57,027
Help!

716
01:10:00,948 --> 01:10:02,199
Come on!

717
01:10:08,706 --> 01:10:10,958
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.

718
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:13,294
He was a peaceful man.

719
01:10:15,296 --> 01:10:17,548
And it was all my doing.

720
01:10:50,372 --> 01:10:53,834
Aunt May.
You don't have to punish yourself.

721
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:56,003
Oh, I know I shouldn't.

722
01:10:56,378 --> 01:10:59,590
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway...

723
01:10:59,757 --> 01:11:01,926
...and he wanted to drive you.

724
01:11:02,259 --> 01:11:04,803
If only I had stopped him.

725
01:11:05,262 --> 01:11:08,432
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.

726
01:11:24,198 --> 01:11:25,699
I'm responsible.

727
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:30,871
For what?

728
01:11:31,872 --> 01:11:34,083
For what happened to Uncle Ben.

729
01:11:34,249 --> 01:11:36,543
But you were at the library.

730
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:38,671
You were doing your homework.

731
01:11:38,837 --> 01:11:41,966
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.

732
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,426
What do you mean?

733
01:11:45,177 --> 01:11:46,845
I went someplace else.

734
01:11:47,012 --> 01:11:50,015
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money...

735
01:11:51,183 --> 01:11:53,936
...to buy a car, because I wanted...

736
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:57,106
...to impress Mary Jane.

737
01:11:59,233 --> 01:12:01,276
It happened so fast.

738
01:12:02,403 --> 01:12:06,281
I won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.

739
01:12:07,783 --> 01:12:09,243
The thief...

740
01:12:10,244 --> 01:12:12,204
...was running towards me.

741
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:16,583
I could've stopped him, but I wanted...

742
01:12:17,334 --> 01:12:18,877
...revenge.

743
01:12:20,879 --> 01:12:22,423
I let him go.

744
01:12:24,299 --> 01:12:27,261
I let him get away.

745
01:12:33,100 --> 01:12:34,893
He wanted a car.

746
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:37,312
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.

747
01:12:38,605 --> 01:12:41,817
Uncle Ben said no...

748
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:45,487
...and then he shot him.

749
01:12:49,116 --> 01:12:52,786
Uncle Ben was killed that night...

750
01:12:54,413 --> 01:12:57,458
...for being the only one
who did the right thing.

751
01:13:00,669 --> 01:13:01,962
And I...

752
01:13:05,382 --> 01:13:07,426
I held his hand...

753
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:09,636
...when he died.

754
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:20,147
I've tried to tell you so many times.

755
01:14:16,745 --> 01:14:19,039
Just one more little chore.

756
01:14:26,547 --> 01:14:27,965
Where are you?

757
01:14:30,175 --> 01:14:34,012
- I'm leaving for the night, sir.
- Fine.

758
01:14:34,179 --> 01:14:36,890
Your father only obsessed
over his work.

759
01:14:37,057 --> 01:14:38,684
Good night, Bernard.

760
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:33,280
Hello, Harry.

761
01:15:33,447 --> 01:15:35,699
Otto. What do you want?

762
01:15:36,283 --> 01:15:37,868
That precious tritium.

763
01:15:38,785 --> 01:15:40,454
But I need more of it this time.

764
01:15:42,164 --> 01:15:46,168
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!

765
01:15:50,088 --> 01:15:52,049
Hey! Hey!

766
01:15:52,216 --> 01:15:55,302
Stop! Stop! All right!

767
01:15:55,719 --> 01:15:59,473
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.

768
01:16:09,358 --> 01:16:12,653
Kill Spider-Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.

769
01:16:13,487 --> 01:16:17,324
On second thought,
bring him to me alive.

770
01:16:17,491 --> 01:16:18,825
How do I find him?

771
01:16:20,035 --> 01:16:21,703
- Peter Parker.
- Parker?

772
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:24,206
He takes pictures of Spider-Man
for the <i>Bugle.</i>

773
01:16:24,373 --> 01:16:25,874
Make him tell you where he is.

774
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:32,965
Have it ready.

775
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,345
Don't hurt Peter!

776
01:16:51,525 --> 01:16:53,986
Somebody, help!

777
01:16:54,903 --> 01:16:56,530
Fire!

778
01:17:04,705 --> 01:17:07,708
Alisa, the Chens can't find
their daughter. Have you seen her?

779
01:17:09,084 --> 01:17:11,712
Somebody call the fire department!
Help!

780
01:17:12,462 --> 01:17:14,756
- Help!
- Is anybody in that building?

781
01:17:14,923 --> 01:17:17,551
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.

782
01:17:17,759 --> 01:17:19,428
Hey, where you going?!

783
01:17:40,615 --> 01:17:42,034
I'm coming!

784
01:18:06,558 --> 01:18:09,353
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

785
01:18:09,519 --> 01:18:12,022
Come on. Come on.

786
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:14,251
Mama.

787
01:19:26,263 --> 01:19:27,848
You got some guts, kid.

788
01:19:28,014 --> 01:19:32,602
Some poor soul got trapped
on the fourth floor. Never made it out.

789
01:19:32,853 --> 01:19:34,354
Oh, man.

790
01:19:37,232 --> 01:19:40,694
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.

791
01:19:40,861 --> 01:19:44,739
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this
equipment, let's go! Let's move it!

792
01:19:50,454 --> 01:19:53,457
Am I not supposed to have
what I want?

793
01:19:54,458 --> 01:19:55,917
What I need?

794
01:19:58,253 --> 01:20:00,714
What am I supposed to do?

795
01:20:07,387 --> 01:20:08,889
I shouldn't have without...

796
01:20:09,556 --> 01:20:10,807
...knocking.

797
01:20:15,395 --> 01:20:16,980
Come in.

798
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:22,569
- Hi.
- Hi.

799
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:28,825
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?

800
01:20:30,827 --> 01:20:32,078
Okay.

801
01:20:33,705 --> 01:20:35,415
And a glass of milk?

802
01:20:38,502 --> 01:20:40,086
That would be nice.

803
01:20:42,047 --> 01:20:44,174
Okay.

804
01:21:04,361 --> 01:21:06,196
Thank you.

805
01:21:10,951 --> 01:21:12,536
You got a message.

806
01:21:13,703 --> 01:21:15,163
It's your aunt.

807
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:17,123
Thanks.

808
01:21:33,181 --> 01:21:34,516
What's going on?

809
01:21:34,683 --> 01:21:38,478
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

810
01:21:38,645 --> 01:21:42,315
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.

811
01:21:42,566 --> 01:21:43,984
Why didn't you tell me?

812
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:47,445
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.

813
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:50,991
And Henry Jackson across
the street is giving me a hand...

814
01:21:51,157 --> 01:21:52,659
...and I'm giving him $5.

815
01:21:52,826 --> 01:21:54,452
That's Henry Jackson?

816
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:57,205
Yes. It's funny what happens
in two years.

817
01:21:57,497 --> 01:22:00,959
Nine years old, has great ambitions.

818
01:22:02,627 --> 01:22:05,797
Listen, about my last visit...

819
01:22:06,089 --> 01:22:08,425
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.

820
01:22:08,592 --> 01:22:13,179
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.

821
01:22:16,641 --> 01:22:20,437
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

822
01:22:20,687 --> 01:22:22,522
And I'm proud of you.

823
01:22:23,607 --> 01:22:26,026
And I thank you, and I...

824
01:22:27,277 --> 01:22:29,613
I love you, Peter.

825
01:22:30,864 --> 01:22:33,366
So very, very much.

826
01:22:52,844 --> 01:22:55,847
Hey. Where are all my comic books?

827
01:22:56,014 --> 01:22:58,933
Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.

828
01:23:01,936 --> 01:23:05,231
- I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you, Henry.

829
01:23:05,398 --> 01:23:06,900
- Hi, Peter.
- Hey, Henry.

830
01:23:07,150 --> 01:23:08,443
You're getting tall.

831
01:23:08,610 --> 01:23:12,739
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer.

832
01:23:12,906 --> 01:23:15,992
Okay. You take
Spider-Man's pictures, right?

833
01:23:16,910 --> 01:23:18,203
I used to.

834
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:19,579
Where is he?

835
01:23:19,746 --> 01:23:24,084
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.

836
01:23:26,002 --> 01:23:27,545
He...

837
01:23:29,631 --> 01:23:32,133
- ...quit.
- Why?

838
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:34,928
Wanted to try other things.

839
01:23:35,095 --> 01:23:36,638
He'll be back, right?

840
01:23:37,972 --> 01:23:39,265
I don't know.

841
01:23:40,684 --> 01:23:43,687
You'll never guess
who he wants to be.

842
01:23:44,104 --> 01:23:45,855
Spider-Man.

843
01:23:46,022 --> 01:23:49,943
- Why?
- He knows a hero when he sees one.

844
01:23:50,110 --> 01:23:53,822
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that...

845
01:23:53,988 --> 01:23:56,032
...saving old girls like me.

846
01:23:56,199 --> 01:23:59,994
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.

847
01:24:00,161 --> 01:24:03,039
Courageous, self-sacrificing people...

848
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:05,542
...setting examples for all of us.

849
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,336
Everybody loves a hero.

850
01:24:08,712 --> 01:24:12,132
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.

851
01:24:12,298 --> 01:24:16,469
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours...

852
01:24:16,636 --> 01:24:18,346
...just to get a glimpse of the one...

853
01:24:18,513 --> 01:24:21,975
...who taught them to hold on
a second longer.

854
01:24:23,309 --> 01:24:26,563
I believe there's a hero in all of us...

855
01:24:27,313 --> 01:24:29,149
...that keeps us honest...

856
01:24:29,816 --> 01:24:31,401
...gives us strength...

857
01:24:31,818 --> 01:24:33,695
...makes us noble...

858
01:24:34,821 --> 01:24:38,324
...and finally allows us to die
with pride.

859
01:24:39,492 --> 01:24:43,663
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady...

860
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:46,583
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

861
01:24:48,334 --> 01:24:50,253
Even our dreams.

862
01:24:52,172 --> 01:24:54,883
Spider-Man did that for Henry...

863
01:24:55,049 --> 01:24:57,510
...and he wonders where he's gone.

864
01:24:58,678 --> 01:25:00,472
He needs him.

865
01:25:04,934 --> 01:25:09,689
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?

866
01:25:10,106 --> 01:25:12,317
But don't strain yourself.

867
01:25:12,484 --> 01:25:14,110
Okay.

868
01:25:32,837 --> 01:25:35,048
Strong focus on what I want.

869
01:26:05,078 --> 01:26:06,663
I'm back!

870
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:08,248
I'm back!

871
01:26:25,807 --> 01:26:27,225
My back.

872
01:26:28,142 --> 01:26:29,519
My back.

873
01:26:53,668 --> 01:26:58,006
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?

874
01:26:58,548 --> 01:26:59,799
Peter Parker?

875
01:27:01,968 --> 01:27:03,219
Positive.

876
01:27:03,469 --> 01:27:04,679
Thought he was your pal.

877
01:27:05,013 --> 01:27:07,348
- Peter Parker?
- Yeah.

878
01:27:08,266 --> 01:27:10,852
He's just a great big jerk.

879
01:27:11,144 --> 01:27:12,979
The world's full of great big jerks.

880
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:16,274
You're adorable.

881
01:27:16,649 --> 01:27:18,276
It's just the uniform.

882
01:27:21,571 --> 01:27:23,656
Lean your head back for me.

883
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:26,409
- Put my head back?
- Yeah, just do it.

884
01:27:28,453 --> 01:27:30,121
Just put my head back?

885
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:32,457
Okay.

886
01:27:51,517 --> 01:27:53,019
Wow.

887
01:27:53,811 --> 01:27:55,563
I'm back on the moon.

888
01:28:00,193 --> 01:28:01,694
You up there with me?

889
01:28:22,507 --> 01:28:24,676
- Hiya.
- Surprised?

890
01:28:24,842 --> 01:28:26,344
Very.

891
01:28:26,511 --> 01:28:28,054
Thanks for coming.

892
01:28:28,388 --> 01:28:30,348
Everything okay?

893
01:28:31,349 --> 01:28:33,059
You might say so.

894
01:28:34,394 --> 01:28:38,189
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.

895
01:28:40,608 --> 01:28:43,236
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.

896
01:28:43,695 --> 01:28:47,573
- Tell me about it.
- Well, mine did a real number on me.

897
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:52,870
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night...

898
01:28:53,037 --> 01:28:56,582
...that you were different.
But I didn't want to listen.

899
01:28:57,458 --> 01:28:59,460
I was afraid to trust you.

900
01:29:01,129 --> 01:29:04,173
But I've been thinking about it--

901
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:08,011
Listen, there's more for me to say.

902
01:29:11,681 --> 01:29:15,893
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought--

903
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:18,688
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

904
01:29:19,397 --> 01:29:21,190
I'm saying...

905
01:29:27,363 --> 01:29:30,366
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary Jane...

906
01:29:30,908 --> 01:29:32,368
...but I can't.

907
01:29:35,788 --> 01:29:39,042
My mind was playing tricks too.

908
01:29:43,755 --> 01:29:46,340
Do you love me, or not?

909
01:29:53,389 --> 01:29:55,016
I...

910
01:29:58,269 --> 01:29:59,479
...don't.

911
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,319
You don't.

912
01:30:15,870 --> 01:30:17,121
Kiss me.

913
01:30:19,332 --> 01:30:20,833
Kiss you?

914
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:22,835
I need to know something.

915
01:30:25,421 --> 01:30:27,006
Just one kiss.

916
01:31:14,095 --> 01:31:16,305
What's happening?

917
01:31:26,566 --> 01:31:28,192
Peter Parker...

918
01:31:29,068 --> 01:31:30,736
...and the girlfriend.

919
01:31:31,154 --> 01:31:32,989
What do you want?

920
01:31:35,783 --> 01:31:38,035
I want you to find your friend
Spider-Man.

921
01:31:38,202 --> 01:31:40,830
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.

922
01:31:40,997 --> 01:31:43,166
I don't know where he is.

923
01:31:44,709 --> 01:31:46,210
Find him.

924
01:31:48,504 --> 01:31:51,340
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.

925
01:31:51,507 --> 01:31:53,551
If you lay one finger on her...

926
01:31:53,718 --> 01:31:55,052
You'll do what?

927
01:33:08,793 --> 01:33:12,505
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiancée.

928
01:33:12,672 --> 01:33:14,298
Sorry, Jonah.

929
01:33:15,341 --> 01:33:16,842
It's all my fault.

930
01:33:18,636 --> 01:33:20,972
I drove Spider-Man away.

931
01:33:21,222 --> 01:33:24,392
He was the only one who could've
stopped Octavius.

932
01:33:25,893 --> 01:33:27,144
Yes.

933
01:33:28,688 --> 01:33:32,024
Spider-Man was a hero.

934
01:33:33,234 --> 01:33:35,194
I just couldn't see it.

935
01:33:36,821 --> 01:33:38,239
He was a--

936
01:33:38,406 --> 01:33:41,075
A thief! A criminal!

937
01:33:42,660 --> 01:33:44,954
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!

938
01:33:45,121 --> 01:33:48,165
I want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!

939
01:33:48,332 --> 01:33:50,418
I want him strung up by his web!

940
01:33:51,919 --> 01:33:54,588
I want Spider-Man!

941
01:34:23,075 --> 01:34:24,410
Where is she?

942
01:34:24,577 --> 01:34:27,246
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.

943
01:35:18,464 --> 01:35:19,673
What the hell?

944
01:37:24,632 --> 01:37:26,717
You have a train to catch.

945
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:31,055
Help!

946
01:37:31,222 --> 01:37:35,601
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!

947
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:56,914
- It's Spider-Man.
- Oh, my God, this is it!

948
01:37:57,081 --> 01:37:58,624
Tell everyone to hang on!

949
01:37:58,791 --> 01:38:00,501
Brace yourselves!

950
01:38:21,689 --> 01:38:24,024
Any more bright ideas?

951
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:26,735
I got a few, yeah!

952
01:38:48,090 --> 01:38:49,883
Whoa, watch out!

953
01:39:20,539 --> 01:39:21,790
We're slowing down.

954
01:40:26,188 --> 01:40:28,148
Nice and easy, we'll go down.

955
01:40:29,149 --> 01:40:30,651
Slower. Gently.

956
01:40:35,906 --> 01:40:37,241
Is he alive?

957
01:40:40,994 --> 01:40:42,246
He's...

958
01:40:42,413 --> 01:40:43,997
...just a kid.

959
01:40:45,165 --> 01:40:47,000
No older than my son.

960
01:41:06,353 --> 01:41:08,147
It's all right.

961
01:41:12,568 --> 01:41:14,403
We found something.

962
01:41:23,787 --> 01:41:25,831
We won't tell nobody.

963
01:41:39,511 --> 01:41:42,014
It's good to have you back, Spider-Man.

964
01:42:02,034 --> 01:42:03,869
He's mine!

965
01:42:04,661 --> 01:42:07,372
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.

966
01:42:07,706 --> 01:42:09,041
And me.

967
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:11,043
Me too.

968
01:42:15,964 --> 01:42:17,549
Very well.

969
01:42:46,537 --> 01:42:48,497
Where do you want him?

970
01:42:56,296 --> 01:42:57,798
And the tritium?

971
01:43:12,312 --> 01:43:13,772
Yes.

972
01:43:43,802 --> 01:43:46,889
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.

973
01:43:49,641 --> 01:43:52,144
First we'll see who's behind the mask.

974
01:43:52,311 --> 01:43:54,771
I can look into your eyes as you die.

975
01:43:57,524 --> 01:43:59,067
Pete.

976
01:43:59,443 --> 01:44:01,153
No.

977
01:44:01,737 --> 01:44:03,155
It can't be.

978
01:44:09,703 --> 01:44:10,996
Harry.

979
01:44:12,539 --> 01:44:16,001
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?

980
01:44:17,336 --> 01:44:21,340
- He's got M.J.
- No. All he wanted was the tritium.

981
01:44:22,049 --> 01:44:23,342
Tritium?

982
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:27,346
He's making the machine again.

983
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:32,392
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.

984
01:44:32,559 --> 01:44:35,354
- Now, where is he?
- Peter...

985
01:44:36,521 --> 01:44:38,357
...you killed my father.

986
01:44:43,528 --> 01:44:47,616
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.

987
01:44:48,367 --> 01:44:51,119
Harry, please, I've got to stop him.

988
01:45:01,713 --> 01:45:03,423
Hey!

989
01:45:04,508 --> 01:45:06,176
Hey!

990
01:45:07,552 --> 01:45:09,346
I'm talking to you!

991
01:45:09,680 --> 01:45:13,183
You got what you needed for your little
science project, now let me go.

992
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:15,227
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.

993
01:45:15,394 --> 01:45:17,938
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider-Man's dead.

994
01:45:18,897 --> 01:45:20,357
He's not dead.

995
01:45:20,607 --> 01:45:23,235
- I don't believe you.
- Believe it.

996
01:45:41,003 --> 01:45:42,337
Surprise.

997
01:45:46,758 --> 01:45:48,427
As soon as you get free--

998
01:45:50,595 --> 01:45:54,558
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!

999
01:45:54,725 --> 01:45:57,769
Shut it down, Ock. You're going
to hurt a lot more people this time.

1000
01:45:57,978 --> 01:46:00,313
Well, that's a risk we're willing to take.

1001
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,316
Well, I'm not.

1002
01:46:35,849 --> 01:46:37,100
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1003
01:46:53,033 --> 01:46:54,284
Run!

1004
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:21,186
Let's see you scurry out of this.

1005
01:47:45,043 --> 01:47:47,254
Now what?

1006
01:48:17,367 --> 01:48:19,494
Dr. Octavius.

1007
01:48:22,706 --> 01:48:23,915
We have to shut it down.

1008
01:48:24,749 --> 01:48:26,334
Please tell me how.

1009
01:48:26,501 --> 01:48:27,919
Peter Parker?

1010
01:48:31,506 --> 01:48:33,550
"Brilliant but lazy."

1011
01:48:33,884 --> 01:48:35,260
Look at what's happening.

1012
01:48:36,261 --> 01:48:38,138
We must destroy it.

1013
01:48:43,768 --> 01:48:45,395
I can't destroy it.

1014
01:48:50,650 --> 01:48:51,985
I won't.

1015
01:48:57,574 --> 01:48:59,784
You once spoke to me
about intelligence.

1016
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:05,332
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.

1017
01:49:07,042 --> 01:49:08,460
A privilege.

1018
01:49:09,127 --> 01:49:12,172
These things have turned you
into something you're not.

1019
01:49:13,215 --> 01:49:15,091
Don't listen to them.

1020
01:49:20,972 --> 01:49:22,515
It was my dream.

1021
01:49:22,682 --> 01:49:27,187
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady...

1022
01:49:27,354 --> 01:49:29,898
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

1023
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:32,359
Even our dreams.

1024
01:49:38,365 --> 01:49:39,991
You're right.

1025
01:49:47,415 --> 01:49:49,292
He's right.

1026
01:49:51,002 --> 01:49:52,629
Listen.

1027
01:49:54,839 --> 01:49:57,092
Listen to me now.

1028
01:50:00,011 --> 01:50:02,347
Listen to me now.

1029
01:50:06,017 --> 01:50:09,020
Now, tell me how to stop it.

1030
01:50:10,105 --> 01:50:11,773
It can't be stopped.

1031
01:50:13,191 --> 01:50:15,193
It's self-sustaining now.

1032
01:50:15,443 --> 01:50:17,529
- Think!
- Unless...

1033
01:50:19,072 --> 01:50:20,824
The river.

1034
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:23,785
Drown it.

1035
01:50:25,745 --> 01:50:27,080
I'll do it.

1036
01:51:12,417 --> 01:51:15,128
No!

1037
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:28,767
Hi.

1038
01:51:29,434 --> 01:51:31,061
Hi.

1039
01:51:31,853 --> 01:51:33,313
This is really heavy.

1040
01:51:57,879 --> 01:51:59,839
M.J.

1041
01:52:00,632 --> 01:52:02,467
In case we die...

1042
01:52:02,634 --> 01:52:04,219
You do love me.

1043
01:52:04,803 --> 01:52:06,054
I do.

1044
01:52:07,013 --> 01:52:09,140
Even though you said you didn't.

1045
01:52:12,018 --> 01:52:14,479
I will not die a monster.

1046
01:53:19,711 --> 01:53:21,796
I think I always knew...

1047
01:53:22,881 --> 01:53:24,507
...all this time...

1048
01:53:25,675 --> 01:53:27,469
...who you really were.

1049
01:53:28,052 --> 01:53:30,638
Then you know
why we can't be together.

1050
01:53:31,848 --> 01:53:34,726
Spider-Man will always have enemies.

1051
01:53:36,644 --> 01:53:39,355
I can't let you take that risk.

1052
01:53:44,068 --> 01:53:45,403
I will...

1053
01:53:47,071 --> 01:53:49,365
...always be Spider-Man.

1054
01:53:52,118 --> 01:53:54,496
You and I can never be.

1055
01:54:42,877 --> 01:54:44,879
Mary Jane!

1056
01:55:47,984 --> 01:55:49,652
Hello?

1057
01:56:05,668 --> 01:56:07,003
Who's that?

1058
01:56:07,170 --> 01:56:09,088
Son.

1059
01:56:10,214 --> 01:56:11,549
I'm here.

1060
01:56:12,884 --> 01:56:14,510
Dad?

1061
01:56:15,553 --> 01:56:17,764
- I thought you were--
- No.

1062
01:56:18,264 --> 01:56:20,391
I'm alive in you, Harry.

1063
01:56:20,558 --> 01:56:21,768
Now it's your turn.

1064
01:56:23,353 --> 01:56:26,022
You swore to make Spider-Man pay.

1065
01:56:26,397 --> 01:56:28,066
Now make him pay.

1066
01:56:28,566 --> 01:56:30,193
But Pete's my best friend.

1067
01:56:30,401 --> 01:56:31,903
And I'm your father.

1068
01:56:32,904 --> 01:56:34,364
You're weak.

1069
01:56:35,365 --> 01:56:39,702
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.

1070
01:56:40,745 --> 01:56:43,581
Now you know the truth about Peter.

1071
01:56:44,540 --> 01:56:46,042
Be strong, Harry.

1072
01:56:47,085 --> 01:56:48,461
Avenge me.

1073
01:56:51,297 --> 01:56:53,341
- Avenge me!
- No!

1074
01:59:17,985 --> 01:59:19,403
Call Deborah.

1075
01:59:19,570 --> 01:59:21,405
The caterer?

1076
01:59:22,406 --> 01:59:24,492
Tell her not to open the caviar.

1077
02:00:05,867 --> 02:00:08,035
Had to do what I had to do.

1078
02:00:09,704 --> 02:00:11,038
Mary Jane.

1079
02:00:12,206 --> 02:00:13,457
Peter.

1080
02:00:14,709 --> 02:00:17,128
I can't survive without you.

1081
02:00:27,138 --> 02:00:28,973
You shouldn't be here.

1082
02:00:30,099 --> 02:00:33,144
I know you think we can't be together.

1083
02:00:34,270 --> 02:00:37,940
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?

1084
02:00:39,191 --> 02:00:41,027
I know there'll be risks.

1085
02:00:41,861 --> 02:00:44,447
But I want to face them with you.

1086
02:00:45,615 --> 02:00:48,993
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive...

1087
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:50,912
...half of ourselves.

1088
02:00:53,372 --> 02:00:54,999
I love you.

1089
02:00:57,293 --> 02:01:00,212
So here I am,
standing in your doorway.

1090
02:01:01,964 --> 02:01:05,051
I've always been
standing in your doorway.

1091
02:01:12,099 --> 02:01:15,645
Isn't it about time somebody
saved your life?

1092
02:01:21,567 --> 02:01:23,402
Well, say something.

1093
02:01:25,905 --> 02:01:28,407
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.

1094
02:01:44,590 --> 02:01:46,384
Go get them, tiger.

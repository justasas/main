1
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:04,018
<i>She looks at me every day.</i>

2
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,978
<i>Mary Jane Watson.</i>

3
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:10,191
<i>Oh, boy. If she only knew
how I felt about her.</i>

4
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:12,151
<i>But she can never know.</i>

5
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,780
<i>I made a choice once to live
a life of responsibility.</i>

6
00:03:15,947 --> 00:03:18,241
<i>A life she can never be a part of.</i>

7
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:19,701
<i>Who am I?</i>

8
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:22,454
<i>I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.</i>

9
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,623
<i>And I'm Peter Parker,
and I, too, have a job.</i>

10
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,375
Parker. Parker!

11
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,794
No, no, no, stop! Stop!

12
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:33,882
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.

13
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:36,968
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.

14
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:39,429
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.

15
00:03:39,596 --> 00:03:42,390
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.

16
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:46,853
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.

17
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:50,148
I told you,
I don't understand that language.

18
00:03:50,315 --> 00:03:52,234
- Speak English.
- You can't make pizza.

19
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,277
I can't?
I've been making pizza five years.

20
00:03:54,444 --> 00:03:57,238
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.

21
00:03:57,405 --> 00:04:00,325
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas...

22
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:03,160
...but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.

23
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:06,498
- Why didn't you send Saleem?
- Saleem was deported yesterday.

24
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:08,666
- Look-- Smiley.
- What about my cheese pizza?

25
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,836
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.

26
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,174
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.

27
00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:18,384
This is your last chance.

28
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:23,306
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.

29
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,851
Go!

30
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,541
Hey, what, are you stupid?

31
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:15,733
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!

32
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:26,036
I'm gonna get it!

33
00:05:41,634 --> 00:05:43,970
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.

34
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:45,430
Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.

35
00:05:45,722 --> 00:05:47,390
See you.

36
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:49,726
Way to go, Spidey!

37
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,838
Pizza time.

38
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,178
You're late.

39
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:09,472
I'm not paying for those.

40
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:30,201
Elevator.

41
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,554
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.

42
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:55,226
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.

43
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:57,353
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.

44
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,022
- You're fired. Go.
- Please, I need this job.

45
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,733
- You're fired.
- Look, give me another chance.

46
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,244
<i>You're fired.</i>

47
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:15,580
- Parker, hello. You're fired.
- Why?

48
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:17,248
Dogs catching Frisbees?

49
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:19,750
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?

50
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,127
- Boss.
- Not now.

51
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:24,047
The <i>Bugle</i> could show another side
of New York for a change.

52
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:27,133
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.

53
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,720
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you-- Still not now!

54
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:33,473
I pay you because that psycho
Spider-Man will pose for you.

55
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,391
He won't let me take
any more pictures.

56
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:37,143
You turned the whole city
against him.

57
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,812
A fact I'm very proud of.

58
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:42,773
Get your pretty little portfolio off my
desk before I go into a diabetic coma.

59
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,277
- It's your wife, she lost her checkbook.
- Thanks for the good news.

60
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:49,780
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I need the money.

61
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:52,992
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.

62
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,869
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.

63
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:57,747
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:

64
00:08:57,914 --> 00:08:59,791
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."

65
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,293
- Some food got poisoned?
- I'm a little nauseous.

66
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,295
All right, Mr. Jameson.

67
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:08,174
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.

68
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:09,968
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."

69
00:09:10,134 --> 00:09:11,719
I told you, he's not a menace.

70
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:13,471
- I told you--
- I'll take care of it.

71
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,306
- I'll give you 150.
- Three hundred.

72
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:16,974
That's outrageous.

73
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:19,101
Done. Give this to the girl.

74
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,478
Thank you. Bye-bye.

75
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:22,439
Hi.

76
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:24,107
Hey, Pete.

77
00:09:27,068 --> 00:09:30,905
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.

78
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,199
- Right.
- Sorry.

79
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,659
Hey.

80
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,703
Chin up, okay?

81
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,301
Watch it, jerk!

82
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,939
Dr. Connors. Sorry.

83
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:06,649
Where were you headed, Parker?

84
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:08,108
To your class.

85
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,110
My class is over.

86
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,488
See me standing here?

87
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:16,450
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.

88
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:17,952
Then be here.

89
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,788
Look at you, Peter.

90
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,668
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.

91
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:28,713
You always appear exhausted.

92
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,216
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.

93
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:35,553
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.

94
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,889
Planning is not a major
at this university.

95
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:44,228
Octavius is a friend of mine.

96
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,564
Better do your research, Parker.

97
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:50,067
Get it done, or I'm failing you.

98
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:13,591
Surprise!

99
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:15,677
Well, say something.

100
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:17,094
What's the occasion?

101
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,847
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!

102
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,184
Whether you want
to remember it or not.

103
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:26,854
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?

104
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,940
- Hi, M.J.
- Hi.

105
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,816
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

106
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,234
Long time, no see.

107
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,280
So how's the play?
I read a great review.

108
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:38,115
It's going fine. It's going good.

109
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:39,575
She's brilliant in it.

110
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:41,410
Harry sent me roses.

111
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:44,121
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.

112
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,458
I've been busy.

113
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:51,212
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?

114
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:53,339
The less you see of that man,
the better.

115
00:11:53,506 --> 00:11:56,967
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.

116
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,427
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

117
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:00,721
So how are things going at Oscorp?

118
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:03,766
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.

119
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:06,143
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.

120
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,439
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.

121
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:11,899
Thank you.

122
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:16,070
We're actually funding
one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.

123
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:18,656
- I'm writing a paper on him.
- You want to meet him?

124
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:20,116
You'd introduce me?

125
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:23,494
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map...

126
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:25,663
...in a way my father
never even dreamed of.

127
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,790
M.J., could you give me a hand?

128
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,752
She's waiting for you, pal.

129
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,671
What do you mean?

130
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:36,340
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.

131
00:12:36,841 --> 00:12:38,217
However you want to look at it.

132
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:40,761
I don't have time for girls right now.

133
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:42,263
Why, are you dead?

134
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,014
I've been kind of busy.

135
00:12:44,181 --> 00:12:45,808
Taking pictures of your friend?

136
00:12:47,268 --> 00:12:48,811
Could we get off that subject?

137
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:52,314
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.

138
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:54,149
Then be honest with me.

139
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:57,278
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?

140
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:04,451
Peter, don't you understand
how I feel?

141
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,537
I want this guy dead.

142
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:09,540
The same way you want the guy
who killed your Uncle Ben dead.

143
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:20,509
I'm sorry. I don't mean to
rag on you on your birthday.

144
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:24,722
You're my buddy, you know that.

145
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:28,017
You're family, Pete.

146
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:32,271
My father loved you.
You were like a son to him.

147
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,070
Thank you, Harry.

148
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,398
May.

149
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,107
Oh, what, Ben?

150
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:20,402
Wait.

151
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:22,029
- Aunt May.
- Oh, my.

152
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:27,660
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

153
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,789
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

154
00:14:32,248 --> 00:14:33,916
Did they have a good time?

155
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,667
I'm sure they did.

156
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:41,340
- You okay?
- Of course. But you go home.

157
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:47,137
And be careful. I don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.

158
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:49,098
I'm worried about you.

159
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:54,478
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.

160
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:57,106
Oh, my. You did?

161
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:58,941
Oh, well.

162
00:14:59,108 --> 00:15:00,526
So?

163
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,778
I'm a little behind.

164
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,489
Everybody is.

165
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:09,159
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

166
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:13,038
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.

167
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:17,334
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

168
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,336
You need it more than I do.

169
00:15:19,503 --> 00:15:22,006
- No, I can't take that from you.
- Yes, you can!

170
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,216
You can take this money from me.

171
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:27,136
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

172
00:15:27,303 --> 00:15:29,805
And don't you dare leave it here.

173
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,891
Oh, I'm sorry.

174
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,645
It's just that I miss
your uncle Ben so much.

175
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:43,694
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?

176
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:48,241
I think to myself at times...

177
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:53,704
...were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd...

178
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:56,791
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

179
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:04,924
Now...

180
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:09,553
...you better take
the rest of your cake home.

181
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:25,820
Hey.

182
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:28,071
Hey. You're still here.

183
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,824
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.

184
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:34,369
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

185
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:38,499
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

186
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,084
The photographer liked my face.

187
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,087
I was only supposed to be
in the catalogue.

188
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:46,757
Then I got the part in the play.
Everything at once.

189
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:48,926
Your dream came true.

190
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,261
How about yours?

191
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:56,391
I'm fine.

192
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:00,813
I wish you'd come see the play.

193
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,190
You're the one who
always encouraged me.

194
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,943
I plan to.

195
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:13,284
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.

196
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:17,288
Oh, boy, yeah.

197
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:20,875
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

198
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:27,047
Nothing.

199
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,262
Do you want to say something?

200
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:40,853
I...

201
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,068
...was...

202
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:52,322
...wondering if you're still
in the Village.

203
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:03,500
You're such a mystery.

204
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,553
Peter.

205
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:18,515
What?

206
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,188
Happy birthday.

207
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:36,033
I'm seeing somebody now.

208
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:40,162
- Therapy.
- No.

209
00:18:40,454 --> 00:18:42,122
A person, a man.

210
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,666
You mean, like a boyfriend?

211
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,502
Well, like I like him.

212
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:52,049
What?

213
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,426
Nothing.

214
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:58,555
That's good, you know?
Companionship...

215
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:01,892
May be more than that.

216
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:04,561
More?

217
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,730
I don't know.

218
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,317
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow night.

219
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:16,323
- You're coming?
- I'll be there.

220
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:18,992
Don't disappoint me.

221
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,078
I won't.

222
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,844
Rent.

223
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:44,351
- Hi.
- Hi. What's "hi"?

224
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,061
Can I spend it?

225
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,689
I have a paycheck due this week
and--

226
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:52,192
- You're a month late again. Again.
- I promise as soon as--

227
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:55,862
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.

228
00:19:56,446 --> 00:20:00,951
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All I got
is this 20 for the rest of the week.

229
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,203
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

230
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:08,208
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.

231
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:12,796
- Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
- Hi, Pete.

232
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,226
Hello?

233
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,319
Rent?

234
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:24,785
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.

235
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:28,955
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.

236
00:21:29,122 --> 00:21:30,749
It's not about the prizes, Harry.

237
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,709
But you need money.
You need Oscorp.

238
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:34,127
Who do we have here?

239
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:36,046
This is my good friend
I called you about.

240
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:37,881
He got me through
high-school science.

241
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:41,093
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for--

242
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,719
I know what you're doing here...

243
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:45,055
...but I don't have time
to talk to students now.

244
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,891
But Oscorp pays the bills, so...

245
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,394
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.

246
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,897
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.

247
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:58,694
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!

248
00:22:01,405 --> 00:22:02,906
Interesting fellow, your friend.

249
00:22:03,532 --> 00:22:05,242
I won't take much of your time.

250
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:09,747
Now I remember you. You're Connors'
student. He tells me you're brilliant.

251
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,624
He also tells me you're lazy.

252
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,876
I'm trying to do better.

253
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:18,630
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.

254
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:22,134
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.

255
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,302
And you use it
for the good of mankind.

256
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:27,013
Otto, your lunch is ready.

257
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,932
- This is my wife, Rosie.
- Hello.

258
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:32,603
This is Peter Parker. Connors' student.
The one who falls asleep in class.

259
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:35,856
I always fell asleep in physics class.

260
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,858
- Nice to meet you, Peter.
- Good to meet you.

261
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,944
Excuse me.

262
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:44,323
Is that it?

263
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:48,368
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.

264
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:51,621
I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.

265
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,123
Sympathetic frequencies.

266
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,334
Harmonic reinforcement?

267
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,419
Go on.

268
00:22:57,961 --> 00:23:01,506
An exponential increase
in energy output.

269
00:23:01,673 --> 00:23:03,341
A huge amount of energy.

270
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:07,679
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

271
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:11,016
It's all so amazing. If it works,
it could change the way we live.

272
00:23:11,183 --> 00:23:13,226
It is amazing, and it will work.

273
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:16,938
Are you sure you could stabilise
the fusion reaction?

274
00:23:17,105 --> 00:23:20,775
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?

275
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:22,819
This is my life's work.

276
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:26,156
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

277
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:28,575
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to question you.

278
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:32,162
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

279
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:34,122
You can sleep soundly tonight.

280
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:35,999
Otto's done his homework.

281
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:39,294
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.

282
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:41,964
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.

283
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,341
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?

284
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,885
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

285
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,387
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the <i>5th?</i>

286
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:53,016
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

287
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,519
Rosie, I love this boy.

288
00:23:55,685 --> 00:23:59,481
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?

289
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:02,109
Well...

290
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:04,611
I don't really know.

291
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:07,864
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?

292
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:11,076
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

293
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,286
Love should never be a secret.

294
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:16,706
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...

295
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:18,959
...gonna make you sick.

296
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,545
I finally got lucky in love.

297
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,046
We both did.

298
00:24:23,213 --> 00:24:26,883
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.

299
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,762
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.

300
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:34,224
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.

301
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:37,561
That's right. I was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.

302
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:40,063
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.

303
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:44,026
<i>Time present and time past</i>

304
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:46,236
<i>- Are both perhaps present
- Perhaps present</i>

305
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:48,697
<i>- In time future
- In time future</i>

306
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:50,782
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.

307
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:52,200
- Yes, you do.
- I'm serious.

308
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:55,912
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.

309
00:24:56,454 --> 00:25:00,417
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.

310
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:02,418
Poetry.

311
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:05,547
Never fails.

312
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:12,971
<i>A tall and slender maiden
All alone upon a prairie</i>

313
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:15,515
<i>Brightest green were all her garments</i>

314
00:25:15,682 --> 00:25:18,059
<i>And her hair was like the sunshine</i>

315
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:21,104
<i>Day by day he gazed upon her</i>

316
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:19,996
Rent!

317
00:26:21,873 --> 00:26:23,583
Where is my money?!

318
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:51,528
You seem jittery tonight.

319
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,363
You never know who's coming.

320
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:11,798
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.

321
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:30,317
How'd you do that?

322
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,696
Work out, plenty of rest.

323
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:37,657
You know, eat your green vegetables.

324
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:42,078
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.

325
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:46,249
Come on. Go.

326
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:50,587
Keep it steady.

327
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:14,611
It's a web.

328
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:17,447
Go, Spidey, go!

329
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:26,790
We got trouble!

330
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,351
Get me down!

331
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:53,483
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.

332
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,945
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

333
00:28:57,111 --> 00:28:59,239
Then you think we should
forgive them?

334
00:29:02,116 --> 00:29:03,784
Yes.

335
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:05,787
I mean, no.

336
00:29:10,083 --> 00:29:14,337
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.

337
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:16,339
Whatever.

338
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,552
Shoelace.

339
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:26,683
You might want to...

340
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:36,234
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I've come to see the show.

341
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:40,280
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.

342
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:43,700
It helps maintain the illusion.

343
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:47,454
I understand.

344
00:29:48,413 --> 00:29:51,875
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.

345
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,543
But not to come late.

346
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:59,424
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the--

347
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:10,727
Listen, can't you--?

348
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:28,245
<i>A Spider-Man
A Spider-Man</i>

349
00:30:28,411 --> 00:30:31,414
<i>A-does whatever a spider can</i>

350
00:30:31,581 --> 00:30:34,584
<i>A-spins a web, any size</i>

351
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,128
<i>Catches thieves a-just like flies</i>

352
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:40,548
<i>Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man</i>

353
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,941
You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?

354
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,484
Yeah, I'm sure.

355
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,570
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.

356
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:04,447
- You were great tonight.
- Thanks.

357
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,535
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?

358
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:12,163
What are you doing here?

359
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:28,554
You hungry?

360
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:29,972
Starved.

361
00:32:20,523 --> 00:32:22,525
What was that?

362
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:28,740
Okay.

363
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:06,068
How you doing?

364
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:08,154
Good.

365
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:14,243
I just wanna say,
I really like what you do.

366
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:17,246
- Think it's great.
- Thanks.

367
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:21,584
I'm with Weisenhower,
Anderson, Nichols & Knudsen...

368
00:33:21,751 --> 00:33:23,419
...PR firm in the building...

369
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:26,422
...and I just wanna say I think
the image you have is fantastic.

370
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:29,425
It's really put together.
The costume. The... this thing.

371
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:32,762
I mean, it's really put together.
It's great.

372
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:37,141
I think you could do more
than print though.

373
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:40,061
I think you might wanna try some TV,
you know?

374
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:42,396
Can I riff for you?
Come up with a couple ideas?

375
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:45,316
Just what my company would do?
Let's see, what do I got?

376
00:33:45,483 --> 00:33:48,236
How about a children's book?
You could--

377
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:51,238
Like <i>Charlotte's Web,</i>
but without the pig. That kind of thing.

378
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:53,783
How about a line of hammocks?

379
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,285
Because it's kind of a web thing.

380
00:33:56,452 --> 00:34:00,873
You could do a men's cologne
called Thwip.

381
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,667
Let me give you a card.

382
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:06,629
I don't have any pockets.

383
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:08,256
Yeah.

384
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:13,135
Well, we're right in the building.

385
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,190
That doesn't help.
I do that all the time.

386
00:34:27,024 --> 00:34:29,068
- Slow elevator.
- Yeah.

387
00:34:51,674 --> 00:34:54,135
Thus, the second-order term...

388
00:34:54,302 --> 00:34:57,013
...in the expansion of
the exact order...

389
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:00,516
...is identical to the second order...

390
00:35:00,683 --> 00:35:04,187
...calculated from first-order
perturbation energy.

391
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:07,439
Since we are free to choose
an arbitrary origin for our energy...

392
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,549
<i>Hi. It's me.
Sing your song at the beep.</i>

393
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:35,676
Hi, M.J.

394
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:37,136
This is Peter.

395
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:40,723
<i>I was on my way to your show and...</i>

396
00:35:42,058 --> 00:35:45,478
<i>Well, I was on my bike...</i>

397
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:50,024
<i>Are you there?</i>

398
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:55,529
I really was planning on it all day.

399
00:35:56,781 --> 00:35:58,366
And...

400
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:02,078
...I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.

401
00:36:02,411 --> 00:36:04,079
Bingo.

402
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:06,749
<i>It's amazing, isn't it?</i>

403
00:36:07,667 --> 00:36:10,545
<i>How complicated a simple thing...</i>

404
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:15,841
<i>...like being someplace at 8:00
can become.</i>

405
00:36:19,637 --> 00:36:23,599
<i>Actually, there was
this obnoxious usher.</i>

406
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:27,394
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.

407
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,104
<i>Your time has expired.</i>

408
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:33,525
<i>Please deposit 50 cents
for the next five minutes.</i>

409
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:45,287
I wanna tell you the truth.

410
00:36:47,456 --> 00:36:48,874
Here it is.

411
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:51,544
I'm Spider-Man.

412
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:54,088
Weird, huh?

413
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:58,259
Now you know
why I can't be with you.

414
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:04,056
If my enemies found out about you...

415
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:10,146
...if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.

416
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:18,988
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.

417
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:31,792
Ladies and gentlemen...

418
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:35,796
...my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.

419
00:37:35,963 --> 00:37:37,631
But first, before we start...

420
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:42,177
...has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?

421
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:44,096
Because we found the rubber band.

422
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:50,186
It's a terrible joke.

423
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,104
But thank you for coming.

424
00:37:52,438 --> 00:37:53,689
Today...

425
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:58,361
...you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.

426
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:03,866
Safe, renewable energy
and cheap electricity for everyone.

427
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:08,496
And now let me introduce
my assistants.

428
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,173
These four actuators were
developed and programmed...

429
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,802
...for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.

430
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:25,513
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.

431
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:14,937
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

432
00:39:15,563 --> 00:39:18,357
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum...

433
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:22,611
...allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction...

434
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:25,614
...in an environment
no human hand could enter.

435
00:39:25,781 --> 00:39:28,242
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms...

436
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:30,202
...is as advanced as you suggest...

437
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,413
...couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?

438
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,831
How right you are.

439
00:39:33,998 --> 00:39:36,083
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip...

440
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,627
...to protect
my higher brain function.

441
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:43,132
It means I maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.

442
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,885
And now on to the main event.

443
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:47,970
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

444
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:11,410
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

445
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:14,705
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

446
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:19,627
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp Industries for providing it.

447
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,503
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

448
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:36,852
Ladies and gentlemen...

449
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,357
...fasten your seat belts.

450
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:02,711
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

451
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:10,844
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

452
00:41:11,011 --> 00:41:12,221
Thank you.

453
00:41:12,388 --> 00:41:14,348
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

454
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:23,857
The power of the sun...

455
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,610
...in the palm of my hand.

456
00:41:48,257 --> 00:41:50,801
Keep calm! It's only a spike!

457
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:52,803
It'll soon stabilise!

458
00:41:58,475 --> 00:42:01,395
Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear the room.

459
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:08,402
We have a containment breach!

460
00:42:11,155 --> 00:42:13,240
Otto, please get back!

461
00:42:14,283 --> 00:42:17,077
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

462
00:42:17,453 --> 00:42:20,080
It will stabilise! It's under control!

463
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:22,124
I'm in charge here!

464
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:25,127
It's my money! I'm in con--

465
00:42:28,756 --> 00:42:30,799
This doesn't change anything.

466
00:42:34,094 --> 00:42:36,472
- What are you doing?
- Pulling the plug.

467
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:38,140
No!

468
00:42:57,076 --> 00:42:58,661
Rosie!

469
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:30,525
Watch it.

470
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:31,902
That was too close.

471
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:36,156
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.

472
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:42,955
I'm ruined.

473
00:43:44,623 --> 00:43:47,126
I have nothing left,
except Spider-Man.

474
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:48,960
He saved your life, sir.

475
00:43:49,378 --> 00:43:51,797
He humiliated me by touching me.

476
00:43:51,964 --> 00:43:54,550
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.

477
00:43:54,716 --> 00:43:56,635
What was he doing here anyway?

478
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:15,487
Molten metal penetrated
the spinal cavity...

479
00:44:15,654 --> 00:44:17,781
...and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points...

480
00:44:17,948 --> 00:44:20,534
...including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

481
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:22,870
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.

482
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:25,997
I suggest we cut off these mechanical
arms, slice up the harness...

483
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:28,542
...and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy...

484
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:31,962
...with posterior spinal fusion
from C7-T1 to T12.

485
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:33,547
We're ready, doctor.

486
00:44:36,842 --> 00:44:38,677
Anybody here take shop class?

487
00:45:17,591 --> 00:45:19,259
No! No! No!

488
00:45:22,304 --> 00:45:24,640
Help me! Help me!

489
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:41,300
No!

490
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:35,729
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumours.

491
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:38,065
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.

492
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:41,026
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.

493
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:44,196
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.

494
00:47:44,654 --> 00:47:49,325
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?

495
00:47:49,493 --> 00:47:50,744
Hoffman!

496
00:47:52,788 --> 00:47:54,247
What are we gonna call this guy?

497
00:47:54,414 --> 00:47:56,625
- "Dr. Octopus."
- That's crap.

498
00:47:56,792 --> 00:47:58,377
- "Science Squid"?
- Crap!

499
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,628
- "Dr. Strange."
- That's pretty good.

500
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:05,634
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus."

501
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:08,136
- I like it.
- Of course you do.

502
00:48:08,303 --> 00:48:12,098
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
"Doc Ock."

503
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:14,184
- Genius.
- What, are you looking for a raise?

504
00:48:14,351 --> 00:48:16,019
Get out.

505
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:17,979
Chief, I found Parker.

506
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:20,357
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill.

507
00:48:20,524 --> 00:48:22,859
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!

508
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:24,319
I heard Spider-Man was there.

509
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:28,115
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.

510
00:48:28,281 --> 00:48:29,616
Chief, the planetarium party.

511
00:48:29,783 --> 00:48:31,451
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.

512
00:48:31,618 --> 00:48:33,161
What do you know
about high society?

513
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:35,664
- Oh. Well, I--
- Don't answer that.

514
00:48:35,831 --> 00:48:39,251
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.

515
00:48:39,418 --> 00:48:42,379
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.

516
00:48:42,546 --> 00:48:44,339
Could you pay me in advance?

517
00:48:53,348 --> 00:48:55,851
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?

518
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:58,645
The planetarium, tomorrow night,
8:00. There's the door.

519
00:49:13,702 --> 00:49:15,454
My Rosie's dead.

520
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,374
My dream is dead.

521
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:24,379
And these...

522
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:29,885
...monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...

523
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:34,097
...along with me.

524
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:44,691
Something...

525
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:47,653
...in my head.

526
00:49:51,323 --> 00:49:52,908
Something talking.

527
00:49:56,912 --> 00:49:58,414
The inhibitor chip!

528
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:03,376
Gone.

529
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:09,424
Rebuild.

530
00:50:12,844 --> 00:50:14,512
No.

531
00:50:15,722 --> 00:50:17,140
Peter was right.

532
00:50:19,476 --> 00:50:21,103
I miscalculated.

533
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:29,736
I couldn't have miscalculated.

534
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,781
It was working, wasn't it?

535
00:50:37,661 --> 00:50:39,079
Yes.

536
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:43,124
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.

537
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:45,585
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.

538
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:48,296
But we need money.

539
00:50:50,048 --> 00:50:51,383
Steal it?

540
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:53,301
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.

541
00:50:55,971 --> 00:50:57,306
That's right.

542
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:02,477
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.

543
00:51:06,106 --> 00:51:07,733
We'll do it here.

544
00:51:08,483 --> 00:51:11,778
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

545
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,573
Nothing will stand in our way.

546
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,074
Nothing!

547
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:24,165
- That's the social security.
- Yes, I see.

548
00:51:24,332 --> 00:51:26,084
My uncle Ben's life insurance.

549
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:28,503
Yes, but I'm afraid...

550
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:31,756
...it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.

551
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:35,552
Oh, but I'm giving
piano lessons again.

552
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,095
You are?

553
00:51:42,183 --> 00:51:45,395
We appreciate
that you've just opened up...

554
00:51:45,562 --> 00:51:48,190
...a new supersaver account
with us today.

555
00:51:48,356 --> 00:51:49,607
But the fact is...

556
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:54,112
...you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.

557
00:51:54,738 --> 00:51:56,323
Well...

558
00:51:58,074 --> 00:51:59,909
At least we get the toaster.

559
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:04,122
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of 300 or more.

560
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:08,293
Oh, yes, I see.

561
00:52:09,753 --> 00:52:11,380
Okay.

562
00:52:14,466 --> 00:52:16,551
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

563
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:35,237
Peter?

564
00:52:37,072 --> 00:52:39,032
Don't leave me.

565
00:52:39,824 --> 00:52:42,243
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.

566
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:43,995
Hold it!

567
00:52:44,746 --> 00:52:47,415
Put your arms up! All of them!

568
00:53:10,772 --> 00:53:12,107
Here's your change!

569
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:23,534
Oh, no. Come on!

570
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:39,134
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I have a knack for that.

571
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,927
Not anymore.

572
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:12,459
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Freeze!

573
00:54:16,379 --> 00:54:18,214
- Hold your fire!
- Don't follow me.

574
00:54:22,135 --> 00:54:23,887
Wait a second.

575
00:54:41,654 --> 00:54:43,865
- Hand her over.
- Of course.

576
00:54:44,657 --> 00:54:45,908
Easy, now.

577
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:49,329
Butterfingers.

578
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:02,884
Look out!

579
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:07,013
Help me!

580
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:11,726
- Help me!
- I'm coming!

581
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,859
Hang on!

582
00:55:50,598 --> 00:55:52,016
Help!

583
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:18,793
Thank you.

584
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:23,381
Aunt May.

585
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:26,551
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.

586
00:56:26,718 --> 00:56:29,762
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.

587
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:36,937
Come on.

588
00:56:40,899 --> 00:56:43,026
Shame on you.

589
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:16,977
There you go.

590
00:57:17,936 --> 00:57:21,272
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.

591
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:22,690
We sure showed him.

592
00:57:22,857 --> 00:57:24,692
What do you mean, "we"?

593
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:31,199
- Take me with you, Spider-Man.
- Take me.

594
00:57:58,726 --> 00:58:01,396
- May I?
- Sure. Go ahead.

595
00:58:02,397 --> 00:58:04,274
Penny! Over here!

596
00:58:09,654 --> 00:58:11,197
Leave it.

597
00:58:15,243 --> 00:58:17,745
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.

598
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:19,247
Why? It's a party.

599
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:22,334
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot...

600
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,837
...who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?

601
00:58:26,254 --> 00:58:27,880
Not to mention your friend the bug.

602
00:58:28,464 --> 00:58:29,674
Not tonight, Harry.

603
00:58:29,841 --> 00:58:33,386
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24/7.

604
00:58:33,845 --> 00:58:35,263
Parker!

605
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:37,181
Parker!

606
00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:40,768
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.

607
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:42,937
Think I'm paying you
to sip champagne?

608
00:58:43,104 --> 00:58:45,064
Get a shot of my wife
with the minister.

609
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:46,774
Beautiful tie.

610
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:49,193
Get a shot of us with the DA.

611
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:51,112
Beautiful dress.

612
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:54,282
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.

613
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:57,201
Wife.

614
00:58:59,162 --> 00:59:01,456
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

615
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:04,708
The committee for
the Science Library of New York...

616
00:59:04,876 --> 00:59:07,087
...is pleased to present
our guest of honour.

617
00:59:07,253 --> 00:59:11,007
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.

618
00:59:12,133 --> 00:59:15,303
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious...

619
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:17,305
...Captain John Jameson.

620
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:03,518
Hi.

621
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:09,190
- You.
- Listen, I'm sorry.

622
01:00:09,357 --> 01:00:11,609
But there was a disturbance.

623
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:13,069
I don't know you.

624
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:18,950
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.

625
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:21,536
I've been reading poetry lately.

626
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:23,037
Whatever that means.

627
01:00:23,538 --> 01:00:27,042
<i>Day by day he gazed upon her</i>

628
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:30,336
<i>Day by day he sighed with passion
Day by day--</i>

629
01:00:30,503 --> 01:00:32,380
Don't start.

630
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,633
Can I get you a drink?

631
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,552
I'm with John. He'll get me my drink.

632
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:39,846
John.

633
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:43,891
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.

634
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:47,061
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.

635
01:00:47,228 --> 01:00:49,730
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.

636
01:00:49,897 --> 01:00:51,107
Even my father.

637
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:55,069
He came backstage to borrow cash.

638
01:00:56,696 --> 01:01:01,075
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me...

639
01:01:01,242 --> 01:01:03,411
...can't make an 8:00 curtain.

640
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:06,664
After all these years...

641
01:01:07,957 --> 01:01:10,585
...he's nothing to me
but an empty seat.

642
01:01:36,068 --> 01:01:39,446
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider-Man and not to your best friend.

643
01:01:39,614 --> 01:01:42,867
I find him with my father's body,
and you defend him.

644
01:01:43,034 --> 01:01:45,119
- Take it easy.
- Don't push me.

645
01:01:45,286 --> 01:01:47,079
Don't act like you're my friend.

646
01:01:47,830 --> 01:01:49,790
You stole M.J. from me.

647
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:52,126
You stole my father's love.

648
01:01:52,793 --> 01:01:57,798
Then you let him die because you
didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right?

649
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:01,260
Huh? Isn't that right?

650
01:02:01,427 --> 01:02:03,220
Huh, brother?

651
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:16,943
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...

652
01:02:17,652 --> 01:02:22,115
...that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to many me.

653
01:02:32,625 --> 01:02:34,085
What a surprise.

654
01:02:34,252 --> 01:02:37,171
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!

655
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,576
Oh, no. No!

656
01:03:17,586 --> 01:03:19,755
Why is this happening to me?

657
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:45,633
You told him yes? Just that fast?

658
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:47,260
It felt right.

659
01:04:48,177 --> 01:04:50,137
Well, you might congratulate me.

660
01:04:50,304 --> 01:04:52,223
Congratulations.

661
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:54,475
Good luck in the world.

662
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:57,645
John loves me.

663
01:04:57,812 --> 01:05:01,524
My father always said,
"You'll never be worth anything.

664
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:03,317
No man will ever want you."

665
01:05:03,484 --> 01:05:05,820
So, what, you're gonna spend
the rest of your life...

666
01:05:05,986 --> 01:05:09,198
...trying to prove something
to your father?

667
01:05:09,365 --> 01:05:11,409
Do you really love this guy?

668
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:14,703
- Very much.
- "Very much"?

669
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:16,372
That just doesn't fly.

670
01:05:16,539 --> 01:05:19,000
I mean, if you really love the guy,
then the answer is:

671
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:21,043
"Do I love him? I adore him.

672
01:05:21,877 --> 01:05:23,712
He's my comfortable afghan.

673
01:05:23,879 --> 01:05:26,090
He's all I can think about.

674
01:05:26,257 --> 01:05:30,344
Everything he is, everything he says,
everything he does...

675
01:05:30,511 --> 01:05:35,599
...to me, for me, with me,
is sweet kisses.

676
01:05:37,059 --> 01:05:39,853
He makes up for all the grief
and pain I've ever had...

677
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:43,023
...and in the dark of the night,
he is there."

678
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:45,943
That's the answer I need.

679
01:05:46,110 --> 01:05:48,946
Not just "I love him very much."

680
01:05:50,865 --> 01:05:53,451
You read too many love stories.

681
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:55,911
What about that perfect kiss
you said you had once?

682
01:05:56,078 --> 01:05:58,581
- The guy you believed in?
- That was a fantasy.

683
01:05:58,747 --> 01:06:00,123
That's all he is.

684
01:06:00,291 --> 01:06:02,793
But what's wrong with believing
in love stories?

685
01:06:13,345 --> 01:06:15,305
You seem very okay to me.

686
01:06:16,015 --> 01:06:17,391
My diagnosis?

687
01:06:17,892 --> 01:06:19,352
It's up here.

688
01:06:22,062 --> 01:06:26,066
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?

689
01:06:27,234 --> 01:06:29,987
There is one dream where...

690
01:06:30,404 --> 01:06:31,906
...in my dream...

691
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:34,408
...I'm Spider-Man.

692
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:39,413
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.

693
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:44,585
So you're Spider-Man.

694
01:06:44,752 --> 01:06:45,962
In my dream.

695
01:06:46,128 --> 01:06:50,549
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.

696
01:06:50,716 --> 01:06:52,843
So it's somebody else's dream.

697
01:06:54,929 --> 01:06:57,932
- What's your major? Theatre Arts?
- Science.

698
01:06:58,098 --> 01:06:59,349
Connors?

699
01:06:59,517 --> 01:07:01,102
He flunking you?

700
01:07:01,268 --> 01:07:02,770
He says he might.

701
01:07:03,229 --> 01:07:04,856
There you go.

702
01:07:13,531 --> 01:07:15,450
What about this friend?

703
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:19,453
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

704
01:07:19,954 --> 01:07:23,916
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.

705
01:07:24,542 --> 01:07:28,295
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.

706
01:07:28,462 --> 01:07:30,256
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.

707
01:07:31,006 --> 01:07:34,093
I've been there. Who was I?

708
01:07:36,804 --> 01:07:39,390
Identity. Big one.

709
01:07:40,516 --> 01:07:42,852
Me, I go to my shrink.

710
01:07:44,478 --> 01:07:45,479
What does he tell you?

711
01:07:45,646 --> 01:07:50,317
She tells me I need some
strong focus on what I want.

712
01:07:50,651 --> 01:07:55,072
And I have to find out
who won't let me have it, why...

713
01:07:55,990 --> 01:08:00,995
...and then I have to tackle that guy,
let him hear me...

714
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:04,999
And one more thing. I have to
make sure I'm right about what I want.

715
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:08,669
Listen...

716
01:08:08,836 --> 01:08:13,090
...maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.

717
01:08:13,507 --> 01:08:15,217
That's why you keep falling.

718
01:08:17,678 --> 01:08:19,638
You always have a choice, Peter.

719
01:08:21,849 --> 01:08:23,559
I have a choice.

720
01:08:32,693 --> 01:08:35,696
<i>All the things you've
been thinking about, Peter...</i>

721
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:38,198
<i>...make me sad.</i>

722
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:41,660
Can't you understand?

723
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:44,538
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

724
01:08:44,705 --> 01:08:47,708
You know I understand.

725
01:08:48,626 --> 01:08:52,463
But I thought you'd learned
the meaning of responsibility.

726
01:08:54,173 --> 01:08:56,884
Oh, you don't know how it feels.

727
01:08:58,927 --> 01:09:02,055
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty...

728
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:06,226
...fairness, justice...

729
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:11,273
Out of those times,
I counted on you to have the courage...

730
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:15,402
...to take those dreams
out into the world.

731
01:09:16,487 --> 01:09:19,073
I can't live your dreams anymore.

732
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,075
I want a life of my own.

733
01:09:22,242 --> 01:09:24,369
You've been given a gift, Peter.

734
01:09:24,662 --> 01:09:28,916
With great power
comes great responsibility.

735
01:09:33,504 --> 01:09:35,172
Take my hand, son.

736
01:09:48,352 --> 01:09:50,104
No, Uncle Ben.

737
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:54,441
I'm just Peter Parker.

738
01:09:56,193 --> 01:09:57,945
I'm Spider-Man...

739
01:09:58,779 --> 01:10:00,406
...no more.

740
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:02,908
No more.

741
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:12,627
No more.

742
01:11:41,965 --> 01:11:43,884
- You punk!
- Sorry.

743
01:11:44,468 --> 01:11:46,345
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

744
01:11:53,769 --> 01:11:55,020
Hurry up!

745
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:08,492
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are...?

746
01:12:08,659 --> 01:12:10,536
Someone, please?

747
01:12:12,621 --> 01:12:14,873
.23 electron volts.

748
01:12:20,128 --> 01:12:23,006
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.

749
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,520
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

750
01:12:36,687 --> 01:12:39,523
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...

751
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:41,650
...in a very inexcusable manner.

752
01:12:41,817 --> 01:12:43,986
I hope you have not been
leading a double life...

753
01:12:44,152 --> 01:12:47,364
...pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.

754
01:12:47,531 --> 01:12:49,283
That would be hypocrisy.

755
01:12:50,325 --> 01:12:52,744
Of course, I have been
rather reckless.

756
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:00,044
"I am glad."

757
01:13:00,877 --> 01:13:02,796
"I am glad."

758
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:04,923
"I am glad."

759
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,969
Are you glad to hear it?

760
01:13:11,138 --> 01:13:13,474
I am glad...

761
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,100
...to hear it.

762
01:13:15,267 --> 01:13:16,977
In fact, now you mention
the subject...

763
01:13:17,144 --> 01:13:20,814
...I have been very bad
in my own small way.

764
01:13:22,733 --> 01:13:25,694
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

765
01:13:25,861 --> 01:13:27,904
You could've told me
you were coming.

766
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:30,407
I was afraid you'd say,
"Don't come."

767
01:13:34,161 --> 01:13:35,829
You look different.

768
01:13:36,538 --> 01:13:41,501
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants,
did my homework.

769
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:43,503
I do my homework now.

770
01:13:45,672 --> 01:13:47,507
You wanna get some chow mein?

771
01:13:47,674 --> 01:13:49,050
Peter...

772
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:51,094
...I'm getting married.

773
01:13:56,016 --> 01:13:58,852
I always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.

774
01:13:59,186 --> 01:14:00,854
And who's the groom?

775
01:14:01,188 --> 01:14:02,898
You hadn't decided yet.

776
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:07,444
You think just because
you saw my play...

777
01:14:07,611 --> 01:14:10,030
...you can talk me out
of getting married?

778
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:13,492
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.

779
01:14:13,659 --> 01:14:17,163
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.

780
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:19,206
You're too late.

781
01:14:20,290 --> 01:14:21,666
Will you think about it?

782
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,168
Think about what?

783
01:14:23,335 --> 01:14:25,337
Picking up where we left off.

784
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:26,838
Where was that?

785
01:14:27,005 --> 01:14:29,508
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.

786
01:14:29,675 --> 01:14:31,051
I don't think it's that simple.

787
01:14:31,218 --> 01:14:33,512
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.

788
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:35,306
You don't understand.

789
01:14:35,806 --> 01:14:38,225
I'm not an empty seat anymore.

790
01:14:38,809 --> 01:14:40,227
I'm different.

791
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:42,813
Punch me, I bleed.

792
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:51,572
I have to go.

793
01:14:58,662 --> 01:15:00,914
I'm getting married in a church.

794
01:15:08,588 --> 01:15:10,215
You are different.

795
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:28,275
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding,
not go into bankruptcy.

796
01:15:28,942 --> 01:15:31,570
Caviar?
What, are we inviting the czar?

797
01:15:31,737 --> 01:15:34,782
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail weenies.

798
01:15:34,948 --> 01:15:38,118
I got a garbage man here says he's
got something you might want to see.

799
01:15:38,285 --> 01:15:41,955
If you have an extraterrestrial's head in
there, you're the third guy this week.

800
01:15:44,499 --> 01:15:46,334
Where the hell did you get that?

801
01:15:46,501 --> 01:15:48,044
In the garbage.

802
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:49,629
In the garbage?

803
01:15:51,631 --> 01:15:53,299
He must've given up.

804
01:15:53,717 --> 01:15:58,472
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.

805
01:15:59,306 --> 01:16:02,434
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.

806
01:16:02,601 --> 01:16:07,397
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.

807
01:16:07,564 --> 01:16:10,650
- Give you 50 bucks.
- I could get more than that on eBay.

808
01:16:10,817 --> 01:16:13,903
All right, 100. Give this man his
money and throw in a bar of soap.

809
01:16:14,696 --> 01:16:16,656
Your wife is still on that line.

810
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:19,826
Flowers? How much?

811
01:16:20,494 --> 01:16:23,663
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.

812
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:25,081
Get plastic.

813
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:27,835
Gotta go, big story.

814
01:16:38,929 --> 01:16:42,182
<i>Spider-Man
Spider-Man</i>

815
01:16:42,349 --> 01:16:45,352
<i>Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?</i>

816
01:16:45,519 --> 01:16:48,939
<i>Where have you gone to
Spider-Man?</i>

817
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,056
Come on, man. Get the money.

818
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:26,559
Come on, come on.

819
01:17:28,937 --> 01:17:30,439
Help!

820
01:17:34,401 --> 01:17:35,611
Come on!

821
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,411
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.

822
01:17:44,578 --> 01:17:46,747
He was a peaceful man.

823
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:51,042
And it was all my doing.

824
01:18:23,867 --> 01:18:27,287
Aunt May.
You don't have to punish yourself.

825
01:18:27,454 --> 01:18:29,498
Oh, I know I shouldn't.

826
01:18:29,873 --> 01:18:33,085
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway...

827
01:18:33,251 --> 01:18:35,420
...and he wanted to drive you.

828
01:18:35,754 --> 01:18:38,298
If only I had stopped him.

829
01:18:38,757 --> 01:18:41,927
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.

830
01:18:57,651 --> 01:18:59,194
I'm responsible.

831
01:19:02,989 --> 01:19:04,365
For what?

832
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:07,578
For what happened to Uncle Ben.

833
01:19:07,744 --> 01:19:09,996
But you were at the library.

834
01:19:10,163 --> 01:19:12,165
You were doing your homework.

835
01:19:12,332 --> 01:19:15,460
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.

836
01:19:16,294 --> 01:19:17,921
What do you mean?

837
01:19:18,672 --> 01:19:20,340
I went someplace else.

838
01:19:20,507 --> 01:19:23,510
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money...

839
01:19:24,678 --> 01:19:27,431
...to buy a car, because I wanted...

840
01:19:28,473 --> 01:19:30,600
...to impress Mary Jane.

841
01:19:32,727 --> 01:19:34,771
It happened so fast.

842
01:19:35,897 --> 01:19:39,776
I won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.

843
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:42,695
The thief...

844
01:19:43,697 --> 01:19:45,699
...was running towards me.

845
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:50,077
I could've stopped him,
but I wanted...

846
01:19:50,829 --> 01:19:52,372
...revenge.

847
01:19:54,374 --> 01:19:55,876
I let him go.

848
01:19:57,794 --> 01:20:00,714
I let him get away.

849
01:20:06,553 --> 01:20:08,388
He wanted a car.

850
01:20:08,555 --> 01:20:10,807
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.

851
01:20:12,058 --> 01:20:15,311
Uncle Ben said no...

852
01:20:16,813 --> 01:20:18,982
...and then he shot him.

853
01:20:22,569 --> 01:20:26,239
Uncle Ben was killed that night...

854
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:30,952
...for being the only one
who did the right thing.

855
01:20:34,164 --> 01:20:35,415
And I...

856
01:20:38,877 --> 01:20:40,921
I held his hand...

857
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:43,089
...when he died.

858
01:20:50,597 --> 01:20:53,641
I've tried to tell you so many times.

859
01:21:50,240 --> 01:21:52,325
Just one more little chore.

860
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:01,334
Where are you?

861
01:22:03,545 --> 01:22:07,382
- I'm leaving for the night, sir.
- Fine.

862
01:22:07,549 --> 01:22:10,301
Your father only obsessed
over his work.

863
01:22:10,468 --> 01:22:12,053
Good night, Bernard.

864
01:23:05,440 --> 01:23:06,691
Hello, Harry.

865
01:23:06,858 --> 01:23:09,069
Otto. What do you want?

866
01:23:09,694 --> 01:23:11,237
That precious tritium.

867
01:23:12,155 --> 01:23:13,823
But I need more of it this time.

868
01:23:15,575 --> 01:23:19,579
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!

869
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:25,502
Hey! Hey!

870
01:23:25,668 --> 01:23:28,671
Stop! Stop! All right!

871
01:23:29,088 --> 01:23:32,842
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.

872
01:23:42,769 --> 01:23:45,939
Kill Spider-Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.

873
01:23:46,856 --> 01:23:50,693
On second thought,
bring him to me alive.

874
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:52,111
How do I find him?

875
01:23:53,446 --> 01:23:55,114
- Peter Parker.
- Parker?

876
01:23:55,281 --> 01:23:57,533
He takes pictures of Spider-Man
for the <i>Bugle.</i>

877
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,202
Make him tell you where he is.

878
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:06,292
Have it ready.

879
01:24:10,129 --> 01:24:11,714
Don't hurt Peter!

880
01:24:24,936 --> 01:24:27,355
Somebody, help!

881
01:24:28,314 --> 01:24:29,899
Fire!

882
01:24:38,074 --> 01:24:41,077
Alisa, the Chens can't find their
daughter. Have you seen her?

883
01:24:42,495 --> 01:24:45,081
Somebody call the fire department!
Help!

884
01:24:45,832 --> 01:24:48,168
- Help!
- Is anybody in that building?

885
01:24:48,334 --> 01:24:50,920
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.

886
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:52,838
Hey, where you going?!

887
01:25:14,027 --> 01:25:15,403
I'm coming!

888
01:25:40,011 --> 01:25:42,805
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

889
01:25:42,972 --> 01:25:45,391
Come on. Come on.

890
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:47,620
Mama.

891
01:26:59,632 --> 01:27:01,217
You got some guts, kid.

892
01:27:01,384 --> 01:27:05,972
Some poor soul got trapped
on the fourth floor. Never made it out.

893
01:27:06,264 --> 01:27:07,724
Oh, man.

894
01:27:10,643 --> 01:27:14,105
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.

895
01:27:14,272 --> 01:27:18,151
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this
equipment, let's go! Let's move it!

896
01:27:23,823 --> 01:27:26,826
Am I not supposed to have
what I want?

897
01:27:27,827 --> 01:27:29,329
What I need?

898
01:27:31,664 --> 01:27:34,083
What am I supposed to do?

899
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:42,424
I shouldn't have without...

900
01:27:42,925 --> 01:27:44,176
...knocking.

901
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:50,349
Come in.

902
01:27:53,436 --> 01:27:55,938
- Hi.
- Hi.

903
01:27:59,609 --> 01:28:02,195
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?

904
01:28:04,197 --> 01:28:05,657
Okay.

905
01:28:07,074 --> 01:28:09,159
And a glass of milk?

906
01:28:11,871 --> 01:28:13,498
That would be nice.

907
01:28:15,583 --> 01:28:17,710
Okay.

908
01:28:37,897 --> 01:28:39,732
Thank you.

909
01:28:44,529 --> 01:28:46,072
You got a message.

910
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,742
It's your aunt.

911
01:28:48,908 --> 01:28:50,660
Thanks.

912
01:29:06,592 --> 01:29:07,927
What's going on?

913
01:29:08,094 --> 01:29:11,931
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

914
01:29:12,098 --> 01:29:15,768
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.

915
01:29:15,977 --> 01:29:17,395
Why didn't you tell me?

916
01:29:17,562 --> 01:29:20,856
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.

917
01:29:21,023 --> 01:29:24,443
And Henry Jackson across
the street is giving me a hand...

918
01:29:24,610 --> 01:29:26,112
...and I'm giving him $5.

919
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:27,864
That's Henry Jackson?

920
01:29:28,531 --> 01:29:30,616
Yes. It's funny what happens
in two years.

921
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:34,370
Nine years old, has great ambitions.

922
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:39,291
Listen, about my last visit...

923
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:41,835
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.

924
01:29:42,003 --> 01:29:46,591
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.

925
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:53,848
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

926
01:29:54,098 --> 01:29:55,975
And I'm proud of you.

927
01:29:57,018 --> 01:29:59,437
And I thank you, and I...

928
01:30:00,688 --> 01:30:03,024
I love you, Peter.

929
01:30:04,275 --> 01:30:06,819
So very, very much.

930
01:30:26,255 --> 01:30:29,258
Hey. Where are all my comic books?

931
01:30:29,425 --> 01:30:32,303
Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.

932
01:30:35,348 --> 01:30:38,643
- I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you, Henry.

933
01:30:38,809 --> 01:30:40,352
- Hi, Peter.
- Hey, Henry.

934
01:30:40,519 --> 01:30:41,854
You're getting tall.

935
01:30:42,021 --> 01:30:46,150
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer.

936
01:30:46,317 --> 01:30:49,362
Okay. You take
Spider-Man's pictures, right?

937
01:30:50,321 --> 01:30:51,614
I used to.

938
01:30:51,781 --> 01:30:53,032
Where is he?

939
01:30:53,199 --> 01:30:57,453
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.

940
01:30:59,413 --> 01:31:00,956
He...

941
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,503
- ...quit.
- Why?

942
01:31:06,379 --> 01:31:08,255
Wanted to try other things.

943
01:31:08,422 --> 01:31:10,049
He'll be back, right?

944
01:31:11,342 --> 01:31:12,593
I don't know.

945
01:31:14,053 --> 01:31:17,056
You'll never guess
who he wants to be.

946
01:31:17,431 --> 01:31:19,224
Spider-Man.

947
01:31:19,392 --> 01:31:23,270
- Why?
- He knows a hero when he sees one.

948
01:31:23,437 --> 01:31:27,191
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that...

949
01:31:27,358 --> 01:31:29,402
...saving old girls like me.

950
01:31:29,568 --> 01:31:33,363
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.

951
01:31:33,531 --> 01:31:36,409
Courageous, self-sacrificing people...

952
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:38,911
...setting examples for all of us.

953
01:31:39,370 --> 01:31:41,747
Everybody loves a hero.

954
01:31:42,081 --> 01:31:45,501
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.

955
01:31:45,668 --> 01:31:49,839
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours...

956
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:51,715
...just to get a glimpse of the one...

957
01:31:51,882 --> 01:31:55,344
...who taught them to hold on
a second longer.

958
01:31:56,679 --> 01:31:59,932
I believe there's a hero in all of us...

959
01:32:00,683 --> 01:32:02,518
...that keeps us honest...

960
01:32:03,185 --> 01:32:04,853
...gives us strength...

961
01:32:05,187 --> 01:32:07,064
...makes us noble...

962
01:32:08,149 --> 01:32:11,694
...and finally allows us to die
with pride.

963
01:32:12,862 --> 01:32:16,991
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady...

964
01:32:17,158 --> 01:32:19,952
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

965
01:32:21,704 --> 01:32:23,623
Even our dreams.

966
01:32:25,499 --> 01:32:28,252
Spider-Man did that for Henry...

967
01:32:28,419 --> 01:32:30,838
...and he wonders where he's gone.

968
01:32:32,006 --> 01:32:33,925
He needs him.

969
01:32:38,304 --> 01:32:43,017
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?

970
01:32:43,476 --> 01:32:45,644
But don't strain yourself.

971
01:32:45,811 --> 01:32:47,479
Okay.

972
01:33:06,165 --> 01:33:08,417
Strong focus on what I want.

973
01:33:38,447 --> 01:33:40,032
I'm back!

974
01:33:40,199 --> 01:33:41,534
I'm back!

975
01:33:59,176 --> 01:34:00,552
My back.

976
01:34:01,512 --> 01:34:02,888
My back.

977
01:34:27,037 --> 01:34:31,375
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?

978
01:34:31,917 --> 01:34:33,168
Peter Parker?

979
01:34:35,337 --> 01:34:36,588
Positive.

980
01:34:36,881 --> 01:34:38,049
Thought he was your pal.

981
01:34:38,382 --> 01:34:40,718
- Peter Parker?
- Yeah.

982
01:34:41,594 --> 01:34:44,221
He's just a great big jerk.

983
01:34:44,555 --> 01:34:46,348
The world's full of great big jerks.

984
01:34:47,850 --> 01:34:49,602
You're adorable.

985
01:34:50,019 --> 01:34:51,604
It's just the uniform.

986
01:34:54,940 --> 01:34:57,026
Lean your head back for me.

987
01:34:57,318 --> 01:34:59,778
- Put my head back?
- Yeah, just do it.

988
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,448
Just put my head back?

989
01:35:04,199 --> 01:35:05,784
Okay.

990
01:35:24,887 --> 01:35:26,389
Wow.

991
01:35:27,139 --> 01:35:28,932
I'm back on the moon.

992
01:35:33,562 --> 01:35:35,064
You up there with me?

993
01:35:55,834 --> 01:35:58,003
- Hiya.
- Surprised?

994
01:35:58,170 --> 01:35:59,672
Very.

995
01:35:59,838 --> 01:36:01,423
Thanks for coming.

996
01:36:01,757 --> 01:36:03,676
Everything okay?

997
01:36:04,677 --> 01:36:06,429
You might say so.

998
01:36:07,763 --> 01:36:11,517
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.

999
01:36:13,978 --> 01:36:16,647
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.

1000
01:36:17,022 --> 01:36:20,943
- Tell me about it.
- Well, mine did a real number on me.

1001
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:26,198
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night...

1002
01:36:26,365 --> 01:36:29,994
...that you were different.
But I didn't want to listen.

1003
01:36:30,828 --> 01:36:32,830
I was afraid to trust you.

1004
01:36:34,498 --> 01:36:37,543
But I've been thinking about it--

1005
01:36:37,710 --> 01:36:41,380
Listen, there's more for me to say.

1006
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:49,221
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought--

1007
01:36:49,388 --> 01:36:52,057
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

1008
01:36:52,725 --> 01:36:54,560
I'm saying...

1009
01:37:00,733 --> 01:37:03,736
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary Jane...

1010
01:37:04,236 --> 01:37:05,738
...but I can't.

1011
01:37:09,158 --> 01:37:12,411
My mind was playing tricks too.

1012
01:37:17,082 --> 01:37:19,710
Do you love me, or not?

1013
01:37:26,759 --> 01:37:28,386
I...

1014
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:32,931
...don't.

1015
01:37:37,770 --> 01:37:39,689
You don't.

1016
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:50,449
Kiss me.

1017
01:37:52,659 --> 01:37:54,161
Kiss you?

1018
01:37:54,328 --> 01:37:56,247
I need to know something.

1019
01:37:58,791 --> 01:38:00,376
Just one kiss.

1020
01:38:47,714 --> 01:38:49,674
What's happening?

1021
01:38:59,893 --> 01:39:01,520
Peter Parker...

1022
01:39:02,396 --> 01:39:04,189
...and the girlfriend.

1023
01:39:04,523 --> 01:39:06,358
What do you want?

1024
01:39:09,194 --> 01:39:11,363
I want you to find your friend
Spider-Man.

1025
01:39:11,530 --> 01:39:14,199
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.

1026
01:39:14,366 --> 01:39:16,535
I don't know where he is.

1027
01:39:18,036 --> 01:39:19,621
Find him.

1028
01:39:21,874 --> 01:39:24,710
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.

1029
01:39:24,877 --> 01:39:26,879
If you lay one finger on her...

1030
01:39:27,045 --> 01:39:28,380
You'll do what?

1031
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:45,874
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiancée.

1032
01:40:46,041 --> 01:40:47,626
Sorry, Jonah.

1033
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:50,212
It's all my fault.

1034
01:40:51,964 --> 01:40:54,300
I drove Spider-Man away.

1035
01:40:54,591 --> 01:40:57,761
He was the only one who could've
stopped Octavius.

1036
01:40:59,263 --> 01:41:00,473
Yes.

1037
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:05,477
Spider-Man was a hero.

1038
01:41:06,645 --> 01:41:08,647
I just couldn't see it.

1039
01:41:10,232 --> 01:41:11,650
He was a--

1040
01:41:11,817 --> 01:41:14,570
A thief! A criminal!

1041
01:41:16,071 --> 01:41:18,365
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!

1042
01:41:18,532 --> 01:41:21,577
I want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!

1043
01:41:21,743 --> 01:41:23,912
I want him strung up by his web!

1044
01:41:25,330 --> 01:41:27,999
I want Spider-Man!

1045
01:41:56,486 --> 01:41:57,862
Where is she?

1046
01:41:58,030 --> 01:42:00,615
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.

1047
01:42:51,875 --> 01:42:53,085
What the hell?

1048
01:45:45,173 --> 01:45:47,259
You have a train to catch.

1049
01:45:49,803 --> 01:45:51,638
Help!

1050
01:45:51,805 --> 01:45:56,184
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!

1051
01:46:14,953 --> 01:46:17,497
- It's Spider-Man.
- Oh, my God, this is it!

1052
01:46:17,664 --> 01:46:19,082
Tell everyone to hang on!

1053
01:46:19,249 --> 01:46:21,126
Brace yourselves!

1054
01:46:42,314 --> 01:46:44,650
Any more bright ideas?

1055
01:46:44,941 --> 01:46:47,318
I got a few, yeah!

1056
01:47:08,673 --> 01:47:10,508
Whoa, watch out!

1057
01:47:41,122 --> 01:47:42,373
We're slowing down.

1058
01:48:46,396 --> 01:48:48,356
Nice and easy, we'll go down.

1059
01:48:49,357 --> 01:48:50,859
Slower. Gently.

1060
01:48:56,114 --> 01:48:57,449
Is he alive?

1061
01:49:01,119 --> 01:49:02,454
He's...

1062
01:49:02,620 --> 01:49:04,205
...just a kid.

1063
01:49:05,373 --> 01:49:07,208
No older than my son.

1064
01:49:26,561 --> 01:49:28,354
It's all right.

1065
01:49:32,775 --> 01:49:34,610
We found something.

1066
01:49:43,870 --> 01:49:46,039
We won't tell nobody.

1067
01:49:59,511 --> 01:50:02,222
It's good to have you back,
Spider-Man.

1068
01:50:22,033 --> 01:50:23,868
He's mine!

1069
01:50:24,702 --> 01:50:27,413
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.

1070
01:50:27,747 --> 01:50:29,082
And me.

1071
01:50:29,707 --> 01:50:31,042
Me too.

1072
01:50:36,005 --> 01:50:37,548
Very well.

1073
01:51:06,577 --> 01:51:08,537
Where do you want him?

1074
01:51:16,337 --> 01:51:17,839
And the tritium?

1075
01:51:32,353 --> 01:51:33,813
Yes.

1076
01:52:03,843 --> 01:52:06,971
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.

1077
01:52:09,640 --> 01:52:12,143
First we'll see who's behind the mask.

1078
01:52:12,310 --> 01:52:14,812
I can look into your eyes as you die.

1079
01:52:17,565 --> 01:52:19,108
Pete.

1080
01:52:19,484 --> 01:52:21,152
No.

1081
01:52:21,778 --> 01:52:23,154
It can't be.

1082
01:52:29,744 --> 01:52:31,037
Harry.

1083
01:52:32,580 --> 01:52:36,000
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?

1084
01:52:37,335 --> 01:52:41,339
- He's got M.J.
- No. All he wanted was the tritium.

1085
01:52:42,090 --> 01:52:43,341
Tritium?

1086
01:52:45,343 --> 01:52:47,345
He's making the machine again.

1087
01:52:48,179 --> 01:52:52,433
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.

1088
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:55,353
- Now, where is he?
- Peter...

1089
01:52:56,521 --> 01:52:58,356
...you killed my father.

1090
01:53:03,528 --> 01:53:07,657
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.

1091
01:53:08,366 --> 01:53:11,160
Harry, please, I've got to stop him.

1092
01:53:21,754 --> 01:53:23,464
Hey!

1093
01:53:24,549 --> 01:53:26,217
Hey!

1094
01:53:27,593 --> 01:53:29,386
I'm talking to you!

1095
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:33,224
You got what you needed for your little
science project, now let me go.

1096
01:53:33,391 --> 01:53:35,226
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.

1097
01:53:35,393 --> 01:53:37,979
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider-Man's dead.

1098
01:53:38,938 --> 01:53:40,398
He's not dead.

1099
01:53:40,648 --> 01:53:43,276
- I don't believe you.
- Believe it.

1100
01:54:01,043 --> 01:54:02,378
Surprise.

1101
01:54:06,799 --> 01:54:08,426
As soon as you get free--

1102
01:54:10,595 --> 01:54:14,599
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!

1103
01:54:14,765 --> 01:54:17,851
Shut it down, Ock. You're going
to hurt a lot more people this time.

1104
01:54:18,019 --> 01:54:20,354
Well, that's a risk
we're willing to take.

1105
01:54:21,481 --> 01:54:23,358
Well, I'm not.

1106
01:54:55,890 --> 01:54:57,141
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1107
01:55:13,074 --> 01:55:14,325
Run!

1108
01:55:38,849 --> 01:55:41,185
Let's see you scurry out of this.

1109
01:56:05,042 --> 01:56:07,294
Now what?

1110
01:56:37,408 --> 01:56:39,535
Dr. Octavius.

1111
01:56:42,705 --> 01:56:43,915
We have to shut it down.

1112
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:46,375
Please tell me how.

1113
01:56:46,542 --> 01:56:47,960
Peter Parker?

1114
01:56:51,547 --> 01:56:53,591
"Brilliant but lazy."

1115
01:56:53,924 --> 01:56:55,300
Look at what's happening.

1116
01:56:56,302 --> 01:56:58,262
We must destroy it.

1117
01:57:03,809 --> 01:57:05,436
I can't destroy it.

1118
01:57:10,691 --> 01:57:12,026
I won't.

1119
01:57:17,615 --> 01:57:19,742
You once spoke to me
about intelligence.

1120
01:57:21,661 --> 01:57:25,373
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.

1121
01:57:27,083 --> 01:57:28,459
A privilege.

1122
01:57:29,126 --> 01:57:32,213
These things have turned you
into something you're not.

1123
01:57:33,255 --> 01:57:35,132
Don't listen to them.

1124
01:57:40,971 --> 01:57:42,556
It was my dream.

1125
01:57:42,723 --> 01:57:47,228
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady...

1126
01:57:47,395 --> 01:57:49,897
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

1127
01:57:50,731 --> 01:57:52,399
Even our dreams.

1128
01:57:58,406 --> 01:58:00,033
You're right.

1129
01:58:07,456 --> 01:58:09,333
He's right.

1130
01:58:11,043 --> 01:58:12,670
Listen.

1131
01:58:14,839 --> 01:58:17,133
Listen to me now.

1132
01:58:20,010 --> 01:58:22,346
Listen to me now.

1133
01:58:26,058 --> 01:58:29,019
Now, tell me how to stop it.

1134
01:58:30,146 --> 01:58:31,814
It can't be stopped.

1135
01:58:33,190 --> 01:58:35,317
It's self-sustaining now.

1136
01:58:35,484 --> 01:58:37,528
- Think!
- Unless...

1137
01:58:39,113 --> 01:58:40,865
The river.

1138
01:58:42,199 --> 01:58:43,826
Drown it.

1139
01:58:45,786 --> 01:58:47,121
I'll do it.

1140
01:59:32,416 --> 01:59:35,169
No!

1141
01:59:47,181 --> 01:59:48,766
Hi.

1142
01:59:49,433 --> 01:59:51,101
Hi.

1143
01:59:51,894 --> 01:59:53,270
This is really heavy.

1144
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:19,880
M.J.

1145
02:00:20,756 --> 02:00:22,549
In case we die...

1146
02:00:22,716 --> 02:00:24,301
You do love me.

1147
02:00:24,844 --> 02:00:26,095
I do.

1148
02:00:27,054 --> 02:00:29,139
Even though you said you didn't.

1149
02:00:32,059 --> 02:00:34,520
I will not die a monster.

1150
02:01:39,835 --> 02:01:41,879
I think I always knew...

1151
02:01:42,963 --> 02:01:44,590
...all this time...

1152
02:01:45,758 --> 02:01:47,551
...who you really were.

1153
02:01:48,177 --> 02:01:50,721
Then you know
why we can't be together.

1154
02:01:51,931 --> 02:01:54,892
Spider-Man will always have enemies.

1155
02:01:56,727 --> 02:01:59,438
I can't let you take that risk.

1156
02:02:04,151 --> 02:02:05,527
I will...

1157
02:02:07,196 --> 02:02:09,448
...always be Spider-Man.

1158
02:02:12,242 --> 02:02:14,703
You and I can never be.

1159
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:04,962
Mary Jane!

1160
02:04:08,067 --> 02:04:09,735
Hello?

1161
02:04:25,751 --> 02:04:27,086
Who's that?

1162
02:04:27,252 --> 02:04:29,212
Son.

1163
02:04:30,297 --> 02:04:31,840
I'm here.

1164
02:04:32,966 --> 02:04:34,593
Dad?

1165
02:04:35,677 --> 02:04:37,888
- I thought you were--
- No.

1166
02:04:38,388 --> 02:04:40,473
I'm alive in you, Harry.

1167
02:04:40,641 --> 02:04:42,017
Now it's your turn.

1168
02:04:43,560 --> 02:04:46,229
You swore to make Spider-Man pay.

1169
02:04:46,605 --> 02:04:48,273
Now make him pay.

1170
02:04:48,565 --> 02:04:50,233
But Pete's my best friend.

1171
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:52,027
And I'm your father.

1172
02:04:52,986 --> 02:04:54,404
You're weak.

1173
02:04:55,405 --> 02:04:59,743
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.

1174
02:05:00,828 --> 02:05:03,664
Now you know the truth about Peter.

1175
02:05:04,581 --> 02:05:06,083
Be strong, Harry.

1176
02:05:07,126 --> 02:05:08,544
Avenge me.

1177
02:05:11,338 --> 02:05:13,382
- Avenge me!
- No!

1178
02:07:38,068 --> 02:07:39,444
Call Deborah.

1179
02:07:39,611 --> 02:07:41,446
The caterer?

1180
02:07:42,447 --> 02:07:44,574
Tell her not to open the caviar.

1181
02:08:25,949 --> 02:08:28,118
Had to do what I had to do.

1182
02:08:29,786 --> 02:08:31,121
Mary Jane.

1183
02:08:32,289 --> 02:08:33,540
Peter.

1184
02:08:34,791 --> 02:08:37,210
I can't survive without you.

1185
02:08:47,220 --> 02:08:49,055
You shouldn't be here.

1186
02:08:50,140 --> 02:08:53,226
I know you think we can't be together.

1187
02:08:54,311 --> 02:08:57,981
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?

1188
02:08:59,274 --> 02:09:00,984
I know there'll be risks.

1189
02:09:01,943 --> 02:09:04,488
But I want to face them with you.

1190
02:09:05,655 --> 02:09:09,033
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive...

1191
02:09:09,201 --> 02:09:10,994
...half of ourselves.

1192
02:09:13,455 --> 02:09:15,040
I love you.

1193
02:09:17,334 --> 02:09:20,295
So here I am,
standing in your doorway.

1194
02:09:22,005 --> 02:09:25,133
I've always been
standing in your doorway.

1195
02:09:32,182 --> 02:09:35,685
Isn't it about time somebody
saved your life?

1196
02:09:41,650 --> 02:09:43,485
Well, say something.

1197
02:09:45,987 --> 02:09:48,490
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.

1198
02:10:04,673 --> 02:10:06,425
Go get them, tiger.

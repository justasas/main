1
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:33,415
<i>With the Japanese birth rate
falling below 1.3 per woman in 2003...</i>

2
00:00:33,589 --> 00:00:35,887
<i>...thls is 'the era of few children. '</i>

3
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:40,994
<i>Government measures
to counter this have been in vain...</i>

4
00:00:41,163 --> 00:00:44,621
<i>...and nothing seems to stop the trend.</i>

5
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:48,364
<i>Why have women stopped
having children?</i>

6
00:00:48,737 --> 00:00:51,331
<i>Some cite women's advance
into the workforce.</i>

7
00:00:52,908 --> 00:00:55,433
<i>Others blame uncertainty...</i>

8
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:59,572
<i>...over the country, society,
and their economic future.</i>

9
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:04,682
<i>Stlll others fume that today's women
believe they will lose their freedom..</i>

10
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:07,117
<i>...by having children.</i>

11
00:01:10,693 --> 00:01:14,026
<i>Here now is one of these women.</i>

12
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:17,959
<i>Yoko Sasaki.</i>

13
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:24,799
<i>An English graduate from a top school,
she Is a magazlne editor.</i>

14
00:01:29,845 --> 00:01:34,475
<i>Having a baby
is the furthest thing from her mind.</i>

15
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:53,467
Did you read my flea-market article?

16
00:01:53,602 --> 00:01:54,694
Rewrite.

17
00:01:54,837 --> 00:01:56,429
Why?

18
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:59,870
It's repetitive, out-of-date,
and the English is wrong.

19
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:02,670
'Flea' isn't spelled 'F R E E'.

20
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:04,369
<i>It's not?</i>

21
00:02:04,513 --> 00:02:06,538
That's a pretty basic mistake.

22
00:02:06,782 --> 00:02:08,010
How do you spell it?

23
00:02:08,183 --> 00:02:09,980
Look it up.

24
00:02:12,221 --> 00:02:13,449
Yes, ma'am.

25
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:16,324
Mr Takahara...

26
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:20,192
I haven't seen that facing-page proof.

27
00:02:20,362 --> 00:02:22,762
I sent that to the printer.

28
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:25,365
What? I haven't checked it.

29
00:02:26,902 --> 00:02:28,767
It's my project.

30
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:34,435
As Assistant Editor,
you need to have some faith.

31
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:39,971
Last time I had faith,
you got that potter's name wrong.

32
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:44,080
Tell the printer to hold the page.

33
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:47,714
Oh, all right.

34
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,222
Good morning.

35
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:56,593
Good morning. Have I got
the conference room at 10?

36
00:02:56,732 --> 00:02:58,324
I'll make sure.

37
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,468
Oh, and the Chief Editor
would like to see you.

38
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:05,106
About what?

39
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:10,635
Oan't it wait?
I'm busy this morning.

40
00:03:11,847 --> 00:03:13,872
He says it's important.

41
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:24,923
Yes?

42
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:29,025
Good morning, Sasaki.

43
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:31,659
You're looking lovely.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,492
Your whole look... I love it!

45
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:38,299
Diet? Exercise? How do you do it?

46
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:41,169
I'm getting a little metabolic..

47
00:03:41,343 --> 00:03:45,507
I'm sorry, but I have a meeting.
Can we cut to the chase?

48
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:48,005
Oh... sure.

49
00:03:49,218 --> 00:03:51,846
I was talking to the president.

50
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,953
He wants to start a new magaz ne.

51
00:03:56,525 --> 00:03:59,824
For young women
white-collar workers.

52
00:04:00,295 --> 00:04:03,389
'Fashionable', 'intelligent'..

53
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:05,294
...'contemporary'.

54
00:04:06,535 --> 00:04:11,905
He asked me to run it,
but I've got enough work as it is.

55
00:04:12,241 --> 00:04:13,833
I suggested you.

56
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:19,346
You're still a bit young,
but this is a job for a woman.

57
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:19,970
Well?

58
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:22,007
Um...

59
00:04:22,384 --> 00:04:23,476
Uh, well...

60
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:24,808
OK?

61
00:04:26,855 --> 00:04:28,220
Of course!

62
00:04:28,891 --> 00:04:30,984
Oheers!

63
00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:40,796
So your dream's come true, Yoko.

64
00:04:40,969 --> 00:04:42,197
I guess so.

65
00:04:43,238 --> 00:04:47,698
After decades of mak ng copies
and bringing tea...

66
00:04:47,876 --> 00:04:52,245
It's not 'decades'!
How old do you think I am?

67
00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:56,681
Fending off eager males
and sexual harassment...

68
00:04:57,052 --> 00:05:01,580
More 'jealous' than 'eager'.
That's been hard.

69
00:05:02,424 --> 00:05:06,224
They all hate competent women.

70
00:05:06,495 --> 00:05:07,587
As...

71
00:05:07,796 --> 00:05:09,127
...we both know.

72
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:13,391
So how's everything?

73
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:15,698
Still the same.

74
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:19,967
Did they transfer that
horrible sweaty old guy?

75
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:23,703
They promoted him.
Oan you believe it!

76
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:25,437
What?! Why?

77
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,777
Hey, it's a man's world.

78
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,149
They all hang out together.

79
00:05:33,288 --> 00:05:34,448
That's right!

80
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:37,751
I'll tell you all about it.

81
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,891
Shall we get drunk, then?

82
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:44,827
Waiter, could we see
the wine list?

83
00:05:55,744 --> 00:05:56,768
Ma'am?

84
00:05:58,013 --> 00:05:59,810
Ma'am, we're here.

85
00:06:16,698 --> 00:06:19,895
<i>I had way too much to drink.</i>

86
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:12,245
Good morning.

87
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:29,729
For cramps...
how about this?

88
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:32,605
That'll be fine.

89
00:07:32,941 --> 00:07:33,999
Will that be all?

90
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:38,975
Something for
an upset stomach...

91
00:07:41,283 --> 00:07:42,580
...and a test kit.

92
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:46,118
A test kit for what?

93
00:07:47,722 --> 00:07:49,451
Uh, you know...

94
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:52,422
To see if you're...

95
00:07:53,662 --> 00:07:56,062
<i>Forget it. I'm in a hurry.</i>

96
00:07:56,231 --> 00:07:58,756
<i>Oh, a pregnancy test kit!</i>

97
00:08:02,237 --> 00:08:04,501
<i>Posltive</i>

98
00:08:07,843 --> 00:08:12,143
Ms Sasaki, are you in there?

99
00:08:13,982 --> 00:08:14,607
What?

100
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:18,352
We're waiting for you.

101
00:08:19,654 --> 00:08:22,851
Yes, I know.

102
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:24,783
I'll be right there.

103
00:08:25,093 --> 00:08:26,754
Please.

104
00:08:47,282 --> 00:08:48,874
<i>In the hand-outs...</i>

105
00:08:49,017 --> 00:08:51,577
<i>...are f rst-half sales figures
for Strade.</i>

106
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,280
You can see that sales are down.

107
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:57,516
Soon our competitors
will overtake us.

108
00:08:57,692 --> 00:08:59,557
How are they doing?

109
00:08:59,728 --> 00:09:02,026
They're printing more copies.

110
00:09:02,197 --> 00:09:04,427
What do we do, Sasaki?

111
00:09:06,868 --> 00:09:08,335
Ms Sasaki?

112
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:11,734
I'm sorry?

113
00:09:11,973 --> 00:09:13,440
Is something wrong?

114
00:09:14,442 --> 00:09:15,568
Uh, no.

115
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:19,977
Her head seems full
of her new magazine...

116
00:09:23,552 --> 00:09:25,747
It's true sales are down.

117
00:09:25,887 --> 00:09:30,381
<i>Our competitors have introduced
new titles. It won't last.</i>

118
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:32,753
We have plans to f ght back.

119
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:38,659
Do they include you appearing
in the magazine again?

120
00:09:43,205 --> 00:09:47,107
The model we took to Vietnam
got sick.

121
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:50,142
I had to fill in.

122
00:09:50,612 --> 00:09:53,012
We'll regroup and do it again.

123
00:09:53,949 --> 00:09:56,179
Is it worth redoing?

124
00:09:56,484 --> 00:09:58,349
Do you have any ideas?

125
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,282
Yes.

126
00:09:59,554 --> 00:10:00,987
May I?

127
00:10:01,189 --> 00:10:02,247
Certainly.

128
00:10:03,925 --> 00:10:08,919
<i>I suggest we offer
a Strade original-mix CD.</i>

129
00:10:09,664 --> 00:10:12,792
It will contain music
from around the world...

130
00:10:12,968 --> 00:10:16,267
...chosen by our editorial staff
as they travel the globe.

133
00:11:30,912 --> 00:11:32,539
Hello.

134
00:11:32,981 --> 00:11:35,142
Uh, h.

135
00:11:37,452 --> 00:11:39,113
Come on in.

136
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:42,079
No, I'm fine.

137
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:45,052
Hey! Hey!

138
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:49,720
Oome on, come on!
It'll be OK!

139
00:11:50,098 --> 00:11:51,895
Go on in.

140
00:11:54,602 --> 00:11:56,092
Harue!

141
00:11:56,338 --> 00:12:00,172
Mayumi!
Where have you been?

142
00:12:00,342 --> 00:12:03,277
I went out to my in-laws'.

143
00:12:03,478 --> 00:12:06,311
My husband had a business trip.

144
00:12:06,481 --> 00:12:10,975
Wouldn't it have been easier
to just stay home?

145
00:12:12,387 --> 00:12:13,615
Oh, hey...

146
00:12:13,822 --> 00:12:15,790
Here's the reception.

147
00:12:16,157 --> 00:12:17,818
Uh, yeah...

148
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:18,990
Here.

149
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:20,560
Thank you.

150
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:23,220
So the visit went well?

151
00:12:23,365 --> 00:12:27,597
<i>I couldn't lift a finger.
It's their first grandchild.</i>

152
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:34,575
Um...

153
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:35,936
Yes?

154
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:40,179
I don't have an appointment.
Is that all right?

155
00:12:40,682 --> 00:12:42,149
No?

156
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,784
Oould you fill this out, please?

157
00:12:45,553 --> 00:12:47,487
All right.

158
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:58,663
Hey...

159
00:12:59,334 --> 00:13:00,596
Oandy?

160
00:13:01,503 --> 00:13:04,165
Uh... no, thank you.

161
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:10,071
Is this your first time?

162
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:12,142
Yes.

163
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,807
I hesitated there
my first time, too.

164
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:19,284
This is my fourth.

165
00:13:19,421 --> 00:13:20,285
Fourth?!

166
00:13:20,455 --> 00:13:22,514
So ask away.

167
00:13:22,724 --> 00:13:24,624
What does your husband do?

168
00:13:25,894 --> 00:13:28,522
You're not married? He is?

169
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,663
No, no...

170
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:34,165
I don't even know
if I'm pregnant yet.

171
00:13:34,469 --> 00:13:36,403
Didn't you check?

172
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:38,503
Yes.

173
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:44,643
Then you probably are.
Those test things are pretty good.

174
00:13:46,247 --> 00:13:49,375
They are, are they...

175
00:13:49,784 --> 00:13:52,753
Be sure and bring him next time.

176
00:13:52,954 --> 00:13:57,584
Men have no idea
what having a child involves.

177
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,856
My husband brings me here and back.
For the births he takes time off work.

178
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:10,194
You need to educate them.
Get mad if they complain.

179
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:13,898
Ask them, 'What matters more,
the baby or your job?!'

180
00:14:14,809 --> 00:14:20,247
Ms Sasaki, the doctor
will see you now.

181
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,848
Ooming!

182
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:23,545
Good luck.

183
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:25,183
Right.

184
00:14:25,353 --> 00:14:26,445
Right.

185
00:14:58,453 --> 00:15:00,148
Congratulations.

186
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,849
You're in your th rd month.

187
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:10,024
I am, am I...

188
00:15:10,932 --> 00:15:12,160
Is that bad?

189
00:15:14,702 --> 00:15:19,196
<i>This isn't a good time
for me to be pregnant.</i>

190
00:15:24,112 --> 00:15:26,842
Is it a complicated situation?

191
00:15:28,283 --> 00:15:31,912
Not so much 'complicated'...

192
00:15:33,054 --> 00:15:35,648
Have you told the man?

193
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:37,518
Not yet.

194
00:15:37,892 --> 00:15:40,656
We're not married, anyway.

195
00:15:41,729 --> 00:15:44,527
In any case, he should be told.

196
00:15:45,266 --> 00:15:47,564
Even if that's hard to do.

197
00:15:48,536 --> 00:15:51,733
No, no, it's not like that.

198
00:15:52,173 --> 00:15:54,164
<i>He's not married.</i>

199
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:58,308
<i>He's... in Vietnam.</i>

200
00:16:01,115 --> 00:16:02,173
He's Vietnamese?

201
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:06,476
No, no, he's Japanese.

202
00:16:06,621 --> 00:16:08,646
He's in Vietnam.

203
00:16:09,324 --> 00:16:14,557
We're not engaged,
he's not even a boyfriend.

204
00:16:14,696 --> 00:16:19,099
But you're at least close enough
that you're pregnant now.

205
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,898
That was
a heat-of-the-moment thing.

206
00:16:24,038 --> 00:16:26,302
Or the heat of the alcohol.

207
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:30,536
I have no intention
of having a child by him.

208
00:16:33,615 --> 00:16:35,947
The child is not yours alone.

209
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:38,544
<i>It's his child, too.</i>

210
00:17:04,979 --> 00:17:06,708
Hello? It's me.

211
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,746
I've called and called
and I couldn't get through.

212
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:16,647
What? You're still there?

213
00:17:16,924 --> 00:17:19,392
Yes, I need to talk to you!

214
00:17:19,827 --> 00:17:23,524
About what? Well, uh...

215
00:17:24,198 --> 00:17:26,132
Are you coming back?

216
00:17:26,434 --> 00:17:29,562
Well, come back! It's important!

217
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:31,566
Oan you hear me?

218
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:39,612
Go find a place with signal!

219
00:17:40,014 --> 00:17:45,077
<i>I told you, it's important!
I need to see you!</i>

220
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,245
I can't go there! I'm busy!

221
00:17:48,756 --> 00:17:53,022
Oh, all right! I'll tell you!

222
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:55,122
Are you sitting down?

223
00:17:56,864 --> 00:18:00,027
A baby! I'm pregnant!

224
00:18:00,868 --> 00:18:04,736
Whose?! Yours!
I'm pregnant with your child!

225
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:08,904
Damn it!

226
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,263
Th s way.

227
00:18:36,003 --> 00:18:36,992
Well?

228
00:18:43,778 --> 00:18:45,507
When was your last period?

229
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:48,547
One moment... uh...

230
00:18:48,716 --> 00:18:50,741
I'm asking her.

231
00:18:51,552 --> 00:18:54,077
I wouldn't know.

232
00:18:55,857 --> 00:18:59,156
Is she, you know...

233
00:19:01,262 --> 00:19:03,025
About six weeks.

234
00:19:04,632 --> 00:19:06,361
She is, is she...

235
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,435
But how?

236
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:14,370
You're on the pill.

237
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:17,272
I give it to you every month.

238
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:21,510
He is not the father, I take it?

239
00:19:33,227 --> 00:19:34,455
Get r d of it.

240
00:19:35,797 --> 00:19:37,526
I'm sorry?

241
00:19:37,665 --> 00:19:39,462
That's not enough?

242
00:19:40,168 --> 00:19:43,660
OK, this is
to keep quiet about it, too.

243
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:46,965
Don't tell anyone.

244
00:19:48,342 --> 00:19:50,572
I'm not having an abortion.

245
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:54,577
I'll take him
for everything he's got.

246
00:19:56,317 --> 00:19:59,218
You planned this?

247
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,912
Of course I did.
The whole thing.

248
00:20:05,426 --> 00:20:09,829
<i>I assume you'll write me
a Oertificate of Pregnancy?</i>

249
00:20:17,071 --> 00:20:20,404
All right. Tomorrow, then.

250
00:20:20,575 --> 00:20:21,439
Hello.

251
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:24,840
Where's the stuff on
the Vietnam special?

252
00:20:24,979 --> 00:20:28,142
What? I thought
that was cancelled.

253
00:20:28,783 --> 00:20:30,045
Who said that?

254
00:20:30,184 --> 00:20:31,344
Mr Takahara.

255
00:20:32,386 --> 00:20:34,877
The Ohief Editor agreed.

256
00:20:35,022 --> 00:20:37,320
What are we going to run instead?

257
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,427
Don't worry.
I've got it covered.

258
00:20:40,995 --> 00:20:45,056
If you don't like it,
talk to the chief.

259
00:20:46,601 --> 00:20:50,037
There's a visitor waiting for you.

260
00:20:50,204 --> 00:20:50,932
A visitor?

261
00:20:51,072 --> 00:20:51,538
Yes.

262
00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:53,469
Over there.

263
00:21:12,426 --> 00:21:13,688
Who's he?

264
00:21:13,995 --> 00:21:15,428
I don't know.

265
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:18,557
He said he knows you.

266
00:21:40,855 --> 00:21:41,344
Hi.

267
00:21:46,661 --> 00:21:49,095
I flew back steerage class.

268
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:51,323
What are you doing here?!

269
00:21:51,465 --> 00:21:55,367
What am I doing here?
You told me to come.

270
00:21:55,536 --> 00:21:56,662
Last night.

271
00:21:56,804 --> 00:22:00,968
I couldn't stay there
now you're having my child.

272
00:22:01,142 --> 00:22:05,602
I went straight to the airport
and bought a ticket.

273
00:22:07,248 --> 00:22:08,237
Here.

274
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,209
What?

275
00:22:10,618 --> 00:22:11,414
A souvenir.

276
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:13,084
Child?

277
00:22:14,422 --> 00:22:15,980
Child?

278
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,215
What?!

279
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:21,922
Hey, wait a minute...

280
00:22:22,496 --> 00:22:25,431
Everyone! Your attention, please!

281
00:22:28,936 --> 00:22:32,565
We're pregnant!

282
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:39,168
Right?

283
00:22:42,717 --> 00:22:44,514
Peek-a-boo!

284
00:22:45,653 --> 00:22:47,848
Peek-a-boo!

285
00:22:49,623 --> 00:22:52,285
So your husband came, too...

286
00:22:53,461 --> 00:22:55,895
He's not my husband.

287
00:22:56,297 --> 00:22:57,559
He's married?

288
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:00,667
No, he isn't!

289
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,607
Chocolate?

290
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:10,074
No, thank you.

291
00:23:11,912 --> 00:23:14,176
He has to acknowledge paternity.

292
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:16,976
What for?

293
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:23,688
Otherwise he's not liable for support
and the child has no right to inherit.

294
00:23:24,091 --> 00:23:25,854
Is that true?

295
00:23:25,993 --> 00:23:27,483
Yes.

296
00:23:28,396 --> 00:23:31,888
If he dies, you'll have nothing.

297
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,904
I doubt he has much
a child could nherit.

298
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,905
Maybe not.

299
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:51,418
<i>Anyway, I still haven't decided
to have it.</i>

300
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:52,711
What?!

301
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:56,950
See? I told you!

302
00:23:57,425 --> 00:23:59,359
I got pregnant!

303
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:00,391
Looks that way.

304
00:24:00,895 --> 00:24:03,125
That's ¥8,500.

305
00:24:03,264 --> 00:24:05,960
Yuh! Aren't you happy?

306
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:10,036
Sure, I am.
It just hasn't sunk in.

307
00:24:11,572 --> 00:24:12,937
Let's think of a name!

308
00:24:13,074 --> 00:24:14,063
A name?

309
00:24:14,642 --> 00:24:17,338
There's your receipt.

310
00:24:17,511 --> 00:24:21,777
Not yet. We don't know
if it's a boy or a girl.

311
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:26,876
<i>I'm sure it's a girl.
Let's give her a foreign name.</i>

312
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:27,817
Like what?

313
00:24:27,955 --> 00:24:29,752
Like Christel, that announcer...

314
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,222
Her dad's French!

315
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:37,654
When she gets bigger
I'll dress her just like me.

316
00:24:37,898 --> 00:24:43,097
Then the three of us
can go shopping!

317
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:48,568
Yoko Sasaki...

318
00:24:48,976 --> 00:24:50,341
Yes!

319
00:24:55,483 --> 00:24:57,075
Come on!

320
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:04,223
See you later!

321
00:25:04,592 --> 00:25:06,025
Hurry up!

322
00:25:08,896 --> 00:25:11,456
You sure have a lot of stuff.

323
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:14,659
Hey, it's everything I own!

324
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:17,469
<i>Oonsultation Room</i>

325
00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:20,229
Tetsuya Kudo...

326
00:25:20,374 --> 00:25:21,170
Yes!

327
00:25:24,345 --> 00:25:27,041
So you are the father?

328
00:25:28,716 --> 00:25:29,444
Yes.

329
00:25:31,352 --> 00:25:33,820
I'm glad you're finally here.

330
00:25:34,321 --> 00:25:38,257
So... is it a boy or a girl?

331
00:25:40,294 --> 00:25:42,956
<i>We can't say for sure yet.</i>

332
00:25:45,432 --> 00:25:49,368
More importantly,
have you made up your mind?

333
00:25:53,574 --> 00:25:54,734
Oh, dear...

334
00:25:55,609 --> 00:25:57,099
That's a problem.

335
00:25:57,745 --> 00:26:00,908
<i>Hey! What's this all about?</i>

336
00:26:01,815 --> 00:26:04,841
Honey, you don't mean..

337
00:26:05,953 --> 00:26:08,786
<i>You don't call me 'honey'!</i>

338
00:26:09,523 --> 00:26:13,254
After all, what is there
between you and me?

339
00:26:13,427 --> 00:26:19,024
It was just that Vietnamese liquor
you pushed on me after the shoot.

340
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,994
<i>That damn nep!</i>

341
00:26:22,136 --> 00:26:24,263
You seemed to like it.

342
00:26:24,405 --> 00:26:27,841
Anyway, it was just a one-off.
I was drunk.

343
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:30,308
A 'one-off'?

344
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:33,875
Well, you know...

345
00:26:34,215 --> 00:26:36,445
A two-off, actually.

346
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:41,013
An error of youth.

347
00:26:41,155 --> 00:26:42,645
'Youth'?

348
00:26:42,823 --> 00:26:44,120
Shut up.

349
00:26:44,959 --> 00:26:48,622
This was not in the plan!

350
00:26:48,762 --> 00:26:51,390
Life's like that.

351
00:26:52,933 --> 00:26:56,835
Sometimes one-offs
make you pregnant.

352
00:27:00,107 --> 00:27:03,167
Anyway, I'd like
the two of you to talk.

353
00:27:04,378 --> 00:27:05,140
Yes!

354
00:27:08,515 --> 00:27:13,316
You're not going to do
anything stupid, are you?

355
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:19,091
Have the baby.

356
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:23,387
Do you hear me?

357
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:28,364
It's this way.

358
00:27:29,236 --> 00:27:32,364
Have my child. Please!

359
00:27:33,207 --> 00:27:37,337
What are you doing?!
Stop acting like an idiot!

360
00:27:38,746 --> 00:27:40,805
Hey, wait!

361
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:46,579
<i>Wait! I'm coming, too.</i>

362
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,483
Go away!

363
00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:50,320
Drive.

364
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:53,885
Ow!

365
00:28:03,337 --> 00:28:04,736
Mother?

366
00:28:10,811 --> 00:28:15,908
That Ms Sasaki
was here again today.

367
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:20,749
She's still thinking.
I hope she has the baby.

368
00:28:22,089 --> 00:28:24,148
May I ask your name?

369
00:28:29,897 --> 00:28:33,833
Thank you for your help.

370
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:10,368
Hello?

371
00:29:10,504 --> 00:29:13,200
<i>It's the superintendent...</i>

372
00:29:13,574 --> 00:29:14,370
Yes?

373
00:29:14,508 --> 00:29:17,807
<i>Not homeless.
Oontact Yoko Sasaki.</i>

374
00:29:22,149 --> 00:29:26,085
I found him
when I put out the garbage.

375
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,780
I'd have called the police, but..

376
00:29:31,825 --> 00:29:33,383
Do you know him?

377
00:29:34,762 --> 00:29:37,253
Yes... in a way.

378
00:29:37,631 --> 00:29:39,929
I'll leave him to you, then.

379
00:29:45,806 --> 00:29:47,467
What?! What?!

380
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:49,734
Hi.

381
00:29:56,183 --> 00:30:01,587
I didn't have any money,
so I walked all the way.

382
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:08,894
<i>It was past 2 a. m.,
and I didn't want to wake you.</i>

383
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,932
But there was a beautiful moon.
It felt great.

384
00:30:16,136 --> 00:30:20,038
I could use some coffee, too.

385
00:30:20,207 --> 00:30:20,764
OK?

386
00:30:20,908 --> 00:30:21,374
No.

387
00:30:21,508 --> 00:30:23,135
Thank you!

388
00:30:25,145 --> 00:30:27,340
Why are you here?

389
00:30:28,515 --> 00:30:33,214
The doctor said
the two of us should talk.

390
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,017
I don't want to.

391
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,617
It just means we'll have a kid.

392
00:30:42,129 --> 00:30:45,792
You won't be having it.
I will.

393
00:30:49,837 --> 00:30:52,169
Well, yeah..

394
00:30:53,273 --> 00:30:58,609
But I cooperated
in the production process.

395
00:31:01,548 --> 00:31:03,038
I'm scared.

396
00:31:05,719 --> 00:31:09,883
Having a baby w ll mean
a huge change in my lifestyle.

397
00:31:11,058 --> 00:31:16,018
I won't be able to work
morning till night like I do.

398
00:31:20,133 --> 00:31:22,260
Is your work that important?

399
00:31:28,775 --> 00:31:31,869
Do you realize how hard it's been
to get where I am?

400
00:31:50,631 --> 00:31:51,757
Good morning.

401
00:31:53,233 --> 00:31:54,257
Where's everyone?

402
00:31:54,768 --> 00:31:58,226
Uh... in the conference room.

403
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,736
Why? Is there a meeting?

404
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:07,071
These are the five ideas
for the new magazine's name.

405
00:32:07,281 --> 00:32:11,809
We will decide based upon
what our competitors are doing.

406
00:32:12,019 --> 00:32:13,486
<i>Turning to page 2..</i>

407
00:32:14,488 --> 00:32:16,115
What's going on?

408
00:32:17,891 --> 00:32:18,823
Uh, well...

409
00:32:20,894 --> 00:32:24,022
Chief, what's going on here?

410
00:32:24,164 --> 00:32:26,496
I thought I was runn ng this.

411
00:32:26,633 --> 00:32:29,727
Oongratulations, Sasaki.

412
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:33,237
I'm told you're pregnant.

413
00:32:33,407 --> 00:32:36,274
Uh, yes.

414
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:41,347
What a surprise! I never imagined
you having a child.

415
00:32:41,481 --> 00:32:46,475
That's the greatest happiness
a woman can know, I guess...

416
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,248
...as the president
was just say ng.

417
00:32:50,624 --> 00:32:53,252
Uh, Sir, I...

418
00:32:53,393 --> 00:32:58,296
We had great hopes for you
as our first female Ohief Editor.

419
00:32:59,266 --> 00:33:02,394
But we can't stand in the way.

420
00:33:03,203 --> 00:33:06,502
Make a happy home
for your family.

421
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,999
But I don't intend
to stop working...

422
00:33:11,144 --> 00:33:12,202
Sasaki..

423
00:33:13,847 --> 00:33:16,213
...I understand how you feel...

424
00:33:16,917 --> 00:33:20,683
I'm not hav ng the child!

425
00:33:20,954 --> 00:33:23,422
But you already have it...

426
00:33:23,924 --> 00:33:29,021
I'll go to the hospital right now
and have it taken care of!

427
00:33:42,142 --> 00:33:43,370
Ms Sasaki?

428
00:33:44,945 --> 00:33:48,608
Ms Sasaki, are you all right?

429
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,878
Ms Sasaki?!

430
00:33:54,621 --> 00:33:56,885
Man, I'm starving!

431
00:33:57,024 --> 00:34:00,255

432
00:34:01,328 --> 00:34:03,057
Oh... OK.

433
00:34:03,196 --> 00:34:04,288
Clear out!

434
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:07,161

435
00:34:09,636 --> 00:34:11,866

00:35:04,024 --> 00:35:04,888
Yoko?

449
00:35:10,964 --> 00:35:15,367

455
00:35:35,222 --> 00:35:37,486
Yes, it's fine.

456
00:35:38,558 --> 00:35:40,287
The doctor checked.

457
00:35:41,895 --> 00:35:44,261
<i>It's still there.</i>

458
00:35:55,509 --> 00:35:57,602

462
00:36:27,674 --> 00:36:30,336

Yes.

465
00:36:39,085 --> 00:36:41,952
Everything it needs is formed now.

466
00:36:52,499 --> 00:36:56,458
Fine. Sit down there, please.

467
00:36:58,171 --> 00:37:00,605
Your baby's fine.

settled down?

469
00:37:05,312 --> 00:37:07,610
Not yet.

470
00:37:09,382 --> 00:37:11,976
That affects people differently.

471
00:37:12,752 --> 00:37:17,780
It can be psychological, too,
so don't push yourself.

472
00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:22,725
Eat what you want to
when you want to.

473
00:37:22,863 --> 00:37:24,660
And no dieting.

474
00:37:26,466 --> 00:37:30,527
I've accepted that.
I've bought larger pants.

475
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:34,338

476
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:41,010
I've quit my job.

We can make all sorts
of cute things.

479
00:37:55,395 --> 00:37:59,297
I was thinking of trying this.
I've never done one before.

Yes.

490
00:38:28,028 --> 00:38:32,965
I've never been pregnant before,
so there's a lot I don't know.

491
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:36,125
A veteran like Harue
will be a big help.

492
00:38:36,269 --> 00:38:38,464
We'll ask Dr Hiratsuka...

493
00:38:38,605 --> 00:38:42,439
...to give maternity lectures
and father's classes.

494
00:38:42,943 --> 00:38:45,377
You're going to have to learn!

495
00:38:45,545 --> 00:38:46,842
Yeah... right.

496
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,470
Where's your husband?

497
00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:51,114
He's not my husband!

498
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:54,311
You're going to stay single?

499
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:56,853
Yes, if I can.

500
00:38:57,557 --> 00:39:01,926
Anyway, make sure
you bring him, too.

501
00:39:02,062 --> 00:39:03,757
Oh, just a minute...

502
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:07,099
Instead of a member's card.

503
00:39:07,233 --> 00:39:10,202
A mother's day-book case.
I made it.

504
00:39:10,337 --> 00:39:12,134
Mika's got one, too.

505
00:39:14,107 --> 00:39:19,875

506
00:39:20,013 --> 00:39:21,480
Oh, and...

507
00:39:23,316 --> 00:39:24,806
...a 'pregnant alert'.

508
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:28,854
A 'pregnant alert'?
What's that for?

509
00:39:28,989 --> 00:39:33,119
<i>That way
everyone will know you're pregnant.</i>

510
00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:36,422
They'll be nicer to you.

511
00:39:36,663 --> 00:39:38,221
Great, huh?

512
00:39:38,398 --> 00:39:38,989

an abortion.</i>

I just couldn't.

515
00:39:58,318 --> 00:40:00,809
But quitting your job?

516
00:40:01,788 --> 00:40:05,918
The moment I got pregnant,
they gave my magazine...

517
00:40:06,259 --> 00:40:09,285
...to that illiterate, stuck-up...

518
00:40:09,763 --> 00:40:12,527
...Kenji Takahara.

519
00:40:12,665 --> 00:40:15,793
But there's such a thing as
maternity leave...

520
00:40:16,002 --> 00:40:21,372
Do you think I could stand
com ng back and working for him?

521
00:40:26,446 --> 00:40:30,507
If only babies were born
to the parent with the most time.

522
00:40:31,751 --> 00:40:36,120
The father's
a freelance photographer, isn't he?

523
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:38,624
You met him in Vietnam?

524
00:40:39,526 --> 00:40:44,156
I know it's a bit late to ask,
but what attracted you to him?

525
00:40:46,966 --> 00:40:51,926
Everybody we took on that trip
got sick.

526
00:40:52,172 --> 00:40:54,367
The only ones left standing...

527
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:56,869
...were him and me.

528
00:40:58,778 --> 00:41:02,509
Then the baby should have
a cast-iron stomach.

529
00:41:02,916 --> 00:41:06,511
Anyway, he hardly makes
any money.

530
00:41:06,686 --> 00:41:13,216
So till I can go back to work
I'll be trimming away at my savings.

00:42:36,342 --> 00:42:38,242
I sure did!

549
00:42:38,645 --> 00:42:40,510
Her answers!

550
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,671
That man was with her.

551
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:46,275
So he's her manager?

552
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,485
Why were they here?

553
00:42:48,621 --> 00:42:51,454
You don't think...

554
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:53,320
I was amazed.

555
00:42:53,526 --> 00:42:57,462
She kept those sunglasses on
through the whole examination!

556
00:42:57,597 --> 00:42:58,859
Nurse Ando...

557
00:42:59,966 --> 00:43:03,299
Respect our patients' privacy.

558
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:05,501
Yes, Doctor.

559
00:43:07,273 --> 00:43:11,710
So you've been
to three other places?

560
00:43:12,245 --> 00:43:14,406
That's rough!

561
00:43:14,614 --> 00:43:17,845
I was ready to give up.

562
00:43:18,051 --> 00:43:21,817
<i>But I'm told this doctor's
good with infertility.</i>

563
00:43:21,988 --> 00:43:25,515
You'll be fine. I guarantee it.

564
00:43:25,825 --> 00:43:30,524
She's good with everything,
from older mothers...

565
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:32,721
...right to infertility.

566
00:43:35,401 --> 00:43:39,428
About how much
does the treatment cost?

567
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:42,539
Oh, I wouldn't know.

568
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:48,175
<i>You don't work here?</i>

569
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:55,620
Would you I ke a doughnut?

570
00:43:56,623 --> 00:43:58,921
No, thank you.

571
00:44:02,328 --> 00:44:05,263
So is your husband here?

572
00:44:10,403 --> 00:44:12,928
He has to be here.

573
00:44:13,806 --> 00:44:17,333
They always blame the woman
for not getting pregnant...

574
00:44:17,477 --> 00:44:20,275
...but it could equally be the man.

575
00:44:20,947 --> 00:44:24,849
You won't know for sure
unless he gets checked, too.

576
00:44:24,984 --> 00:44:26,747
I know that!

577
00:44:36,429 --> 00:44:41,799
Why do you keep wasting my time
when I'm busy like th s?!

578
00:44:44,437 --> 00:44:48,373
Look, I don't know
what you've put in her head...

579
00:44:48,741 --> 00:44:53,075
...but she can't have kids.
I've resigned myself to that.

580
00:44:58,718 --> 00:45:01,346
How often do you have sex?

581
00:45:02,922 --> 00:45:05,254
Getting right to it, huh?

582
00:45:05,925 --> 00:45:07,358
In a week..

583
00:45:08,928 --> 00:45:13,558
Uh, well... lately..

584
00:45:14,967 --> 00:45:16,832
<i>It's been a while.</i>

585
00:45:17,437 --> 00:45:21,464
<i>Last December 24th,
at about 9:30 p. m.</i>

586
00:45:22,275 --> 00:45:24,106
That was the last time.

587
00:45:28,481 --> 00:45:31,609
Without sex,
you can't have children.

588
00:45:32,852 --> 00:45:34,342
That's true.

589
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:41,118
I examined your wife last week.

590
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:44,252
She would be 'an older mother'...

591
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:47,490
...but there is nothing
physically wrong.

592
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,495
So today I'd like to run
some tests on you.

593
00:45:52,505 --> 00:45:55,338
You're saying it's my fault?

594
00:45:55,475 --> 00:45:59,036
The husband must cooperate
for treatment to work.

595
00:46:02,148 --> 00:46:06,482
Today I'd like to conduct
a semen analysis.

596
00:46:07,086 --> 00:46:09,782
Oould you give me a specimen, please?

597
00:46:11,391 --> 00:46:12,517
Here?

598
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:14,784
How?

599
00:46:14,994 --> 00:46:16,859
There's a cubicle in back.

600
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:18,595
If you need them...

601
00:46:21,968 --> 00:46:23,765
...use these.

602
00:46:28,574 --> 00:46:31,771
Shall I help?

00:47:03,443 --> 00:47:04,705

00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:14,916
<i>It's true!</i>

607
00:47:15,087 --> 00:47:19,456
It moved!
Like it was turn ng over.

608
00:47:22,795 --> 00:47:24,092
Can't feel it.

609
00:47:25,865 --> 00:47:27,492
<i>Maybe it's asleep.</i>

610
00:47:27,733 --> 00:47:28,961
Hey!

611
00:47:30,403 --> 00:47:32,530
I hadn't felt it move before.

612
00:47:32,672 --> 00:47:38,008
It was so surprising...
and so moving.

613
00:47:38,177 --> 00:47:41,078
<i>It's, like, 'it's alive'!</i>

614
00:47:42,849 --> 00:47:44,544
Oh, sorry...

615
00:47:46,152 --> 00:47:47,710
<i>It's me. What's up?</i>

616
00:47:48,254 --> 00:47:52,452
Oh, that?
I'll call them myself later.

I'm w th someone now.

618
00:47:55,361 --> 00:47:57,090
See you later.

619
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:01,532
You sound busy.

620
00:48:02,535 --> 00:48:06,437
Well, I've been promoted
to Chief Planner.

621
00:48:06,706 --> 00:48:09,641
<i>You have? That's great!</i>

622
00:48:10,142 --> 00:48:13,771
It's more responsibility,
but not much more money.

623
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:17,276
And that guy harassing you?

624
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:21,318
He got caught misusing funds
and they transferred him!

625
00:48:21,888 --> 00:48:23,947
<i>So now I'm my own boss.</i>

626
00:48:24,824 --> 00:48:27,725
That's so great!

627
00:48:28,861 --> 00:48:30,328
Anyway, uh...

628
00:48:31,597 --> 00:48:34,122
Oh yes, the baby moved.

629
00:48:35,134 --> 00:48:36,692
How does that feel?

630
00:48:37,236 --> 00:48:39,363
Uh, well...

631
00:48:40,006 --> 00:48:41,837
How do you describe it?

632
00:48:44,877 --> 00:48:45,969
Sorry.

633
00:48:46,646 --> 00:48:50,343
I'm sorry, I was just about
to call you.

634
00:48:50,516 --> 00:48:53,508
Yes, about that venue.

00:48:53,686 --> 00:48:55,813

You shouldn't be lifting things!

638
00:49:30,222 --> 00:49:32,417
It's OK. I'm stable now.

639
00:49:32,592 --> 00:49:36,392
And the doctor says
I mited exercise is good.

640
00:49:36,562 --> 00:49:37,620
Really?

641
00:49:40,232 --> 00:49:43,759
That's everything.
Could we settle up now?

642
00:49:43,936 --> 00:49:45,836
Sure. How much?

643
00:49:46,005 --> 00:49:48,269
That's ¥68,000.

644
00:49:52,078 --> 00:49:54,911
Huh? That's strange...

645
00:49:56,349 --> 00:49:57,941
I'll pay it.

646
00:50:01,587 --> 00:50:02,815

647
00:50:06,993 --> 00:50:12,158
¥68,000, right?

648
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:14,965
There.

649
00:50:18,037 --> 00:50:20,028

I'll pay you from my next job.

00:50:32,585 --> 00:50:34,610
Uh, not yet.

00:50:35,321 --> 00:50:36,481

I'm due at the hospital,

658
00:50:52,371 --> 00:50:55,738
There's the head...

659
00:50:56,509 --> 00:50:59,967
And then the back...

660
00:51:00,646 --> 00:51:03,479
Oh, did you see that?

661
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,450
Wait...

662
00:51:11,991 --> 00:51:13,424
Right there.

663
00:51:13,592 --> 00:51:15,457
A perfect little thingy.

664
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:21,827
So it's a boy, then?

665
00:51:22,001 --> 00:51:25,528
Yes, now we can be sure.

666
00:51:33,946 --> 00:51:35,436
Is something wrong?

667
00:51:37,316 --> 00:51:38,374
No.

...lead very different lives.

672
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:03,536
But did you not say
you didn't want to spend your life...

673
00:52:04,009 --> 00:52:08,639
...chasing celebrities
for a scandal sheet?

674
00:52:12,918 --> 00:52:13,646
Uh, yes.

675
00:52:14,987 --> 00:52:20,254
Weren't you going to travel the world
taking photographs that might win...

676
00:52:20,392 --> 00:52:21,916
...a Pulitzer Pr ze?

677
00:52:22,094 --> 00:52:25,791
Well, I'm putting off
the Pulitzer...

678
00:52:26,999 --> 00:52:30,366
And now you come crawling back
asking for work?

679
00:52:32,037 --> 00:52:35,302
Well, I'm going to be a father.

680
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:36,905
A child?

681
00:52:37,076 --> 00:52:37,940
Yes.

682
00:52:38,511 --> 00:52:41,537
So there's at least
one thing you can do.

683
00:52:41,714 --> 00:52:46,117

684
00:52:51,557 --> 00:52:55,118

685
00:52:55,261 --> 00:52:56,853
Hello.

686
00:52:57,029 --> 00:53:00,192
We're going to yoga class.
Do you want to come?

687
00:53:00,366 --> 00:53:01,355
Yoga?

688
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:06,630
Maternity yoga.
It's good for your back.

689
00:53:07,139 --> 00:53:10,540
I'm taking the class.
It's helped a lot.

690
00:53:11,076 --> 00:53:12,270
It's fun.

691
00:53:12,511 --> 00:53:14,706
It's close by. Hop in.

692
00:53:14,847 --> 00:53:17,407
This is Jiro, my husband.

693
00:53:17,583 --> 00:53:18,948
How do you do.

694
00:53:20,219 --> 00:53:21,811
Open the door!

695
00:53:21,954 --> 00:53:23,285
Oh, right.

696
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:27,456
Olimb in.

697
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:31,528
I'll hold that.
We don't want you to fall.

698
00:53:31,964 --> 00:53:34,558
There. Take your time.

699
00:53:43,876 --> 00:53:45,275
Is something wrong?

700
00:53:46,245 --> 00:53:48,076
No.

701
00:53:53,619 --> 00:53:54,916
<i>It'll be fine.</i>

702
00:53:55,487 --> 00:54:00,356
You'll have a baby,
just like all the others.

703
00:54:01,627 --> 00:54:05,324
But my husband
isn't cooperating.

704
00:54:05,497 --> 00:54:07,556
That's not true.

705
00:54:08,133 --> 00:54:10,931
Yes, he was a bit reluctant...

706
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:14,706
...but in the end
he gave us a sample.

707
00:54:14,874 --> 00:54:19,106
But he was furious
when he heard the results.

708
00:54:22,982 --> 00:54:29,387
Well, no one is happy to hear
the problem is with them.

709
00:54:30,322 --> 00:54:34,190
Your husband's sperm
are slightly weak in motility.

710
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:39,160
If we can find a way around that,
you can get pregnant.

711
00:54:39,999 --> 00:54:42,024
We'll think of something.

712
00:55:19,038 --> 00:55:20,335
What month?

713
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,732
Almost nine.

714
00:55:22,908 --> 00:55:25,342
It could come any time.

715
00:55:25,511 --> 00:55:27,843
Should you be doing th s?

716
00:55:28,013 --> 00:55:30,641
Oh, sure...

717
00:55:31,884 --> 00:55:34,444
Mayumi! What happened?!

718
00:55:34,653 --> 00:55:39,488
A kick! This is going to be
one tough kid!

719
00:55:40,526 --> 00:55:42,323
So it's a boy?

720
00:55:42,494 --> 00:55:44,655
No, this is a girl.

721
00:55:44,797 --> 00:55:48,198
A lady wrestler, maybe?

722
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,962
Oh, please! I'm going for
a pro golfer.

723
00:55:53,138 --> 00:55:54,605
I like that.

724
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:58,437
I'll make the same wish.
A trillion-yen golfer.

725
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:00,840
So it does affect your bra n...

726
00:56:03,315 --> 00:56:06,011
A figure skater would be nice.

727
00:56:06,185 --> 00:56:09,848
OK, a triple axel!

728
00:56:10,990 --> 00:56:15,051
That probably won't happen.
Neither of us is athletic.

729
00:56:15,227 --> 00:56:17,559
So what's your wish?

730
00:56:17,896 --> 00:56:20,729
I just want it born healthy.

731
00:56:20,899 --> 00:56:24,357
You can't live on good health
these days.

732
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:29,798
<i>A girl's fine if she's pretty.
She can live on that.</i>

733
00:56:30,376 --> 00:56:31,809
Right, Yuh?

734
00:56:40,085 --> 00:56:41,518
What are you doing?

735
00:56:41,687 --> 00:56:45,248
Sorry. I've got to
get to work.

736
00:56:53,565 --> 00:56:56,932
Yuh's cheating on me.
I know it!

737
00:56:58,370 --> 00:57:01,567
I can't have this child!

738
00:57:01,707 --> 00:57:04,505
You don't have any proof of that.

739
00:57:04,676 --> 00:57:07,975
You're pregnant.
You're just over-wrought.

740
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,408
Lately he's always 'working late'!

741
00:57:11,583 --> 00:57:14,143
That's to pay your b lls.

742
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:17,846
<i>He's trying his best.
You shouldn't doubt him.</i>

743
00:57:18,023 --> 00:57:20,184
<i>He's always checking his mail.</i>

744
00:57:20,359 --> 00:57:21,348
A game, maybe?

745
00:57:21,527 --> 00:57:23,495
Or work mail.

746
00:57:23,729 --> 00:57:26,323
It's from a girl!

747
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:29,290
<i>Who'd want him?</i>

748
00:57:31,403 --> 00:57:33,166
Yuh's very popular!

749
00:57:33,939 --> 00:57:35,600
Did you check?

750
00:57:38,744 --> 00:57:41,577
You've got to check his phone.

751
00:57:42,581 --> 00:57:43,843
Mayumi?

752
00:57:44,183 --> 00:57:48,051
I've got a private detective.

753
00:57:48,353 --> 00:57:49,650
A detect ve?!

754
00:57:49,988 --> 00:57:51,853
And a lawyer.

755
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,457
A lawyer?!

756
00:57:53,892 --> 00:57:55,621
You need them?

757
00:57:55,761 --> 00:57:59,754
Your husband's
so serious and hard-working!

758
00:58:00,032 --> 00:58:03,729
When their wives are pregnant...

759
00:58:03,936 --> 00:58:06,803
...lots of men start to cheat.

760
00:58:07,072 --> 00:58:08,300
Jiro!

761
00:58:30,329 --> 00:58:31,853
I'm back!

762
00:58:32,097 --> 00:58:33,997
Yoko, I'm home!

763
00:58:34,133 --> 00:58:35,430
Oh, hi.

764
00:58:35,601 --> 00:58:38,229
I bought champagne.

765
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:39,901
Ohampagne?

766
00:58:40,839 --> 00:58:43,831
You don't have
the money for that.

767
00:58:44,009 --> 00:58:45,670
<i>It's to celebrate.</i>

768
00:58:45,811 --> 00:58:50,180
A guy I knew in school
is doing fashion shoots.

769
00:58:50,549 --> 00:58:53,177
He needs some help.

770
00:58:55,287 --> 00:58:55,981
Oh.

771
00:58:56,121 --> 00:58:58,749
Hey, come on!

772
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:05,155
Our money worries are over.

773
00:59:05,964 --> 00:59:11,197
Now you can concentrate
on having a healthy baby.

774
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:14,336
<i>That is so m ddle-aged!</i>

775
00:59:14,506 --> 00:59:15,871
It is?

776
00:59:16,475 --> 00:59:18,102
Anyway, a drink.

777
00:59:18,277 --> 00:59:19,209
No!

778
00:59:19,878 --> 00:59:23,939
You said you loved champagne!
I bought the best!

779
00:59:24,116 --> 00:59:27,085
It's not good to drink
when you're pregnant.

780
00:59:27,252 --> 00:59:28,981
<i>It's not?</i>

781
00:59:29,154 --> 00:59:34,922
It could give the baby
'fetal alcohol syndrome'.

782
00:59:35,093 --> 00:59:38,551
So he'd be a born alcoholic?

783
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:42,530
You need to learn some things.
Read this.

784
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:46,795
<i>Prenatal Baby Oare</i>

785
00:59:51,376 --> 00:59:52,934
Here goes!

786
00:59:55,147 --> 00:59:56,739
Once more.

787
00:59:57,649 --> 01:00:00,117
That's good. Smile.

788
01:00:00,619 --> 01:00:03,144
OK, that's great!

789
01:00:05,891 --> 01:00:07,825
<i>Now you're into it!</i>

790
01:00:10,329 --> 01:00:11,296
Here goes!

791
01:00:11,763 --> 01:00:12,821
Breeze.

792
01:00:13,999 --> 01:00:15,023
Breeze!

793
01:00:23,008 --> 01:00:24,532
No, no!

794
01:00:25,344 --> 01:00:27,642
More! A wider spread!

795
01:00:27,846 --> 01:00:28,813
Right!

796
01:00:33,285 --> 01:00:34,445
Like this?

797
01:00:38,957 --> 01:00:39,719
Reina!

798
01:00:39,858 --> 01:00:42,019
What the hell are you doing?!

799
01:00:42,728 --> 01:00:43,820
Be careful!

800
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:47,490
<i>What is this?!</i>

801
01:00:48,267 --> 01:00:49,291
Sorry.

802
01:01:08,086 --> 01:01:10,953
What do you mean?!

803
01:01:11,123 --> 01:01:14,115
Did you lay it out for them?

804
01:01:14,459 --> 01:01:18,293
<i>They won't talk to me.</i>

805
01:01:18,597 --> 01:01:20,758
They're denying everything.

806
01:01:20,932 --> 01:01:23,833
What about the DNA test?

807
01:01:24,036 --> 01:01:27,528
<i>Well... it didn't match.</i>

808
01:01:27,973 --> 01:01:30,305
What?! Why not?

809
01:01:31,143 --> 01:01:32,075
I don't know.

810
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:34,405
That's crazy!

811
01:01:35,213 --> 01:01:39,582
Oh, I get it.
He did something.

812
01:01:39,918 --> 01:01:41,818
He could do that.

813
01:01:42,721 --> 01:01:45,554
Are you sure
it's Representative Sakazaki's?

814
01:01:45,724 --> 01:01:48,557
What?! Don't you believe me either?

815
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:51,259
There was another man, too.

816
01:01:51,396 --> 01:01:54,729
That young foreigner, the dancer.

817
01:01:55,067 --> 01:01:57,399
There's no way t's his!

818
01:01:57,869 --> 01:02:03,808
Anyway, he went home
without even saying goodbye!

819
01:02:06,611 --> 01:02:08,875
What are you looking at?!

820
01:02:17,856 --> 01:02:20,586
Thank you for all your help.

821
01:02:21,259 --> 01:02:22,419
Not at all.

822
01:02:30,102 --> 01:02:33,435
Do you have children, dear?

823
01:02:35,607 --> 01:02:36,665
No.

824
01:02:37,809 --> 01:02:39,504
You don't?

825
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:45,079
I have a daughter.

826
01:02:49,554 --> 01:02:52,580
I'd have liked to have children...

827
01:03:12,978 --> 01:03:15,674
Hey... what are you doing?

828
01:03:17,382 --> 01:03:18,713
There!

829
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:23,044
I've taken in this whole book.

830
01:03:28,226 --> 01:03:30,922
Hey! What are you doing?!

831
01:03:32,931 --> 01:03:35,297
It doesn't say you can't have sex.

832
01:03:35,967 --> 01:03:40,370
Don't be silly!
You'll scare the baby.

833
01:03:41,973 --> 01:03:44,965
Hey, are you awake?

834
01:03:45,544 --> 01:03:47,842
I'm just going to borrow her...

835
01:03:50,682 --> 01:03:52,547
He says it's OK.

836
01:03:52,751 --> 01:03:54,241
He does not!

837
01:03:55,086 --> 01:03:58,385
Are you talking back already,
young man?

838
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:00,785
Get out here!

839
01:04:03,028 --> 01:04:06,759
When you do come out,
we can play catch.

840
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:10,100
Don't rush h m.

841
01:04:10,335 --> 01:04:11,825
What do you mean?

842
01:04:12,003 --> 01:04:16,565
Fathers and sons
have to play catch.

843
01:04:16,741 --> 01:04:17,708
Right?

844
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,043
Hey! That tickles!

845
01:04:24,182 --> 01:04:26,116
Just a little!

846
01:04:32,524 --> 01:04:36,722
<i>The Elghth Month</i>

847
01:04:36,981 --> 01:04:39,779
<i>Fathers'Class</i>

848
01:04:40,651 --> 01:04:41,811
What's wrong?!

849
01:04:42,052 --> 01:04:43,883
You're cheating on her!

850
01:04:44,021 --> 01:04:45,579
What?! I am not!

851
01:04:45,789 --> 01:04:48,519
Don't deny it!
We've got proof.

852
01:04:49,426 --> 01:04:52,725
We checked your text mail.

853
01:04:52,863 --> 01:04:53,761
Mail?

854
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:01,196
Mika was afraid to,
so we got a print-out.

855
01:05:04,141 --> 01:05:06,666
Just who is this 'Ayu'?!

856
01:05:06,844 --> 01:05:07,868
That's...

857
01:05:08,545 --> 01:05:10,410
'I had fun today. ' 'Heart'.

858
01:05:10,581 --> 01:05:14,278
'But this is wrong, isn't it. '
'Tears', 'tears'.

859
01:05:15,052 --> 01:05:18,715
'I want your child!
Yuh, take me away!'

860
01:05:18,889 --> 01:05:22,154
'Scream!' 'Blush'.
'Heart', 'heart'.

861
01:05:22,326 --> 01:05:25,056
You have a pregnant wife!

862
01:05:25,229 --> 01:05:27,959
Who is this 'Ayu'?!

863
01:05:28,599 --> 01:05:29,793
Mika!

864
01:05:30,834 --> 01:05:32,324
I'm sorry!

865
01:05:33,404 --> 01:05:35,998
Those are... from me.

866
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:37,364
What?!

867
01:05:37,541 --> 01:05:38,803
Huh?!

868
01:05:40,811 --> 01:05:44,713
We met on a dating site.

869
01:05:44,882 --> 01:05:49,046
<i>She was an Ayumi Hamasaki fan,
so she called herself 'Ayu'.</i>

870
01:05:51,388 --> 01:05:55,017
Look at the dates.
They're two years old!

871
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:57,593
He's been cheat ng two years?

872
01:05:57,761 --> 01:05:59,626
No, I haven't!

873
01:06:00,097 --> 01:06:02,998
Why are you looking at them now?

874
01:06:08,539 --> 01:06:13,806
Mika's all wrapped up in the baby.
She hasn't got time for me.

875
01:06:14,011 --> 01:06:17,811
I kept those, and when I read them
I feel better.

876
01:06:21,552 --> 01:06:22,519
Yuh!

877
01:06:23,687 --> 01:06:24,915
Mika!

878
01:06:25,689 --> 01:06:27,088
Yuh!

879
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:36,822
Today, we'd like to give
you soon-to-be fathers...

880
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,265
...and Mr Ono,
who's a veteran already...

881
01:06:41,672 --> 01:06:46,006
...some idea of what your wives
are going through.

882
01:06:46,210 --> 01:06:50,408
<i>First, put on these
'pregnant-experience jackets'.</i>

883
01:06:53,083 --> 01:06:56,883
I'm really sorry.
I had it all wrong.

884
01:06:57,054 --> 01:06:59,818
<i>It's a happy end,
so that's all right.</i>

885
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:03,892
I'm going to talk to
my husband, too.

886
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:08,657
That's good.
I'm sure it's all in your mind.

887
01:07:08,832 --> 01:07:12,427
Pregnancy is hard on
your nerves.

888
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:16,706
But you and your husband
are so affectionate...

889
01:07:17,574 --> 01:07:20,441
He comes to all these things.

890
01:07:20,577 --> 01:07:23,171
Yes! I'm jealous.

891
01:07:23,747 --> 01:07:25,112
Well, you know...

892
01:07:25,949 --> 01:07:27,507
<i>Sorry I'm late!</i>

893
01:07:28,118 --> 01:07:29,483
Over here!

894
01:07:29,653 --> 01:07:30,551
Hello.

895
01:07:31,021 --> 01:07:32,989
You're late!

896
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:36,153
I skipped out of work.

897
01:07:36,326 --> 01:07:37,554
Yeah, OK.

898
01:07:38,061 --> 01:07:40,996
<i>Now if you'll split
into two groups...</i>

899
01:07:41,165 --> 01:07:44,692
<i>...we'll try washing the baby.</i>

900
01:07:45,302 --> 01:07:50,205
Lower him slowly into the water,
so you don't scare him...

901
01:07:50,407 --> 01:07:52,739
Slowly, slowly... that's good.

902
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:55,707
Carefully, wipe the eyes...

903
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:57,277
That's right.

904
01:07:57,447 --> 01:08:00,416
A real baby's eyes will be closed.

905
01:08:00,784 --> 01:08:04,311
From ins de to out,
that's right.

906
01:08:04,488 --> 01:08:06,683
Roll your sleeves up!

907
01:08:08,358 --> 01:08:13,057
Now with your thumbs,
you rub gently...

908
01:08:13,197 --> 01:08:15,631
Don't let him sink!

909
01:08:16,533 --> 01:08:19,661
Don't forget to hold him
at the back of the neck...

910
01:08:19,803 --> 01:08:24,399
To clean the face,
you wipe down in a figure 3.

911
01:08:25,576 --> 01:08:28,136
That's right. Very good.

912
01:08:29,847 --> 01:08:31,178
Good!

913
01:08:31,648 --> 01:08:34,310
Now let's wash the back.

914
01:08:34,718 --> 01:08:39,815
Place your hand under
the arm away from you..

915
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,890
...and turn him over.

916
01:08:42,059 --> 01:08:45,426
Turn him over...

917
01:08:45,696 --> 01:08:46,424
No!

918
01:08:49,066 --> 01:08:51,660
Think of it as a baby,
not a doll.

919
01:08:56,406 --> 01:09:01,571
Now, very gently,
turn him over..

920
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,643
It's a baby, remember.

921
01:09:04,781 --> 01:09:06,976
<i>Doesn't that feel good?</i>

922
01:09:07,651 --> 01:09:09,710
OK, out we come...

923
01:09:11,521 --> 01:09:12,510
No, no!

924
01:09:13,056 --> 01:09:14,956
Everyone does that..

925
01:09:15,092 --> 01:09:17,617
...but you can't shake him dry.

926
01:09:18,128 --> 01:09:20,119
A baby isn't a plate.

927
01:09:20,264 --> 01:09:21,731
R ght. Sorry.

928
01:09:21,865 --> 01:09:24,197
Do it r ght, will you!

929
01:09:24,635 --> 01:09:26,865
Could I show them...

930
01:09:27,604 --> 01:09:29,299
...how it's done?

931
01:09:29,473 --> 01:09:31,338
Yes, please.

932
01:09:32,242 --> 01:09:33,573
Don't be...

933
01:09:34,344 --> 01:09:36,744
...too nervous yourself.

934
01:09:37,114 --> 01:09:39,947
Have confidence.

935
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:51,156
You're used to this, Mr Ono.

936
01:09:51,962 --> 01:09:54,430
I've done it with three.

937
01:09:55,599 --> 01:09:58,898
Be careful.
He gets carried away.

938
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:03,903
When you wash
babies' heads like this..

939
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:07,669
...they look really, really happy.

940
01:10:07,878 --> 01:10:09,937
You see?

941
01:10:10,514 --> 01:10:12,379
Isn't that nice?

942
01:10:12,516 --> 01:10:16,316
Jiro! Jiro! The camera!

943
01:10:21,825 --> 01:10:23,258
Pick him up!

944
01:10:30,801 --> 01:10:32,496
Oh, Jiro!

945
01:10:33,937 --> 01:10:35,336
I'm sorry!

946
01:10:35,505 --> 01:10:40,272
What are you doing?!

947
01:10:41,044 --> 01:10:45,413
<i>Why do husbands stray

948
01:10:45,816 --> 01:10:46,748
What's that?

949
01:10:46,883 --> 01:10:49,044
Oh, something.

950
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:53,052
'Why do husbands stray

951
01:10:53,223 --> 01:10:54,918
Stop peeking!

952
01:10:55,659 --> 01:10:58,059
I'm not straying.

953
01:10:58,695 --> 01:11:00,458
It's not about you.

954
01:11:03,533 --> 01:11:06,366
What is all this stuff?

955
01:11:07,037 --> 01:11:12,407
I'm going to write some essays
about being pregnant.

956
01:11:12,576 --> 01:11:13,565
Essays?

957
01:11:13,744 --> 01:11:19,512
At first I thought being pregnant
just meant lots of dull conversations.

958
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:24,146
But then I realized
it was a business opportunity.

959
01:11:29,626 --> 01:11:31,150
Oh, yeah...

960
01:11:31,328 --> 01:11:36,766
Speaking of business, I got paid.
You keep this.

961
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,065
Don't leave yourself broke.

962
01:11:39,236 --> 01:11:40,794
I'm not.

963
01:11:41,004 --> 01:11:43,666
I got a fashion job, I told you.

964
01:11:44,274 --> 01:11:45,298

Thank you!

976

Let me set this up.

977
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:42,127
This is your fourth child.
Why so many in this day and age?

978
01:12:42,532 --> 01:12:44,261
Why?

979
01:12:44,968 --> 01:12:47,436
I just keep getting pregnant.

980
01:12:49,172 --> 01:12:52,403
But even one is hard...

981
01:12:52,542 --> 01:12:56,308
My mother had seven.
And a career.

982
01:12:57,347 --> 01:13:00,373
She's a Council member.
Out in the country.

983
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:02,313
Wow!

984
01:13:07,224 --> 01:13:08,054
What's wrong?

985
01:13:08,225 --> 01:13:11,388
Uh-oh... maybe.

<i>'Uh-oh'?</i>

987
01:13:13,463 --> 01:13:16,057

988
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,126
Get a taxi!

989
01:13:18,835 --> 01:13:20,598
Mayumi, hold on!

990
01:13:21,171 --> 01:13:22,536
Stay calm.

991
01:13:23,974 --> 01:13:25,407
You'll be f ne.

992
01:13:25,542 --> 01:13:27,305

993
01:13:28,311 --> 01:13:32,771
<i>You may have heard of
in vltro fertilization.</i>

994
01:13:33,216 --> 01:13:36,276
The egg is extracted
from the wife's ovaries...

995
01:13:36,453 --> 01:13:40,150
...and fertilized outside the body
with the husband's sperm.

996
01:13:40,357 --> 01:13:44,885
The fertilized egg is then put back
into the wife's body.

997
01:13:45,128 --> 01:13:46,789
That's how it works.

998
01:13:48,298 --> 01:13:53,736
After that, it's the same
as a normal pregnancy.

999
01:13:53,904 --> 01:13:57,340
There's morning sickness,
and you swell up.

1000
01:13:57,674 --> 01:13:59,699
<i>So in vitro fertilization...</i>

1001
01:13:59,876 --> 01:14:03,937
...simply gives that first step
a little push.

1002
01:14:07,551 --> 01:14:08,882
So...

1003
01:14:09,252 --> 01:14:14,155
...I go back into that room
with that old porn again...

1004
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:17,755
...and beat off?

1005
01:14:30,106 --> 01:14:32,233

but she wouldn't listen.

1018
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:28,727
...perhaps she'll I ke to exercise,
the same as her mother.

...but now she's here,
I don't care what she becomes.

01:21:49,045 --> 01:21:54,210
You fight all the time,
but then you make up.

1091
01:21:55,485 --> 01:21:57,476
That's what marriage is.

1092
01:22:25,248 --> 01:22:29,651
<i>A photographer thought to be Japanese
shot during a gun battle..</i>

1093
01:22:29,819 --> 01:22:33,619
<i>...on the Paklstan-Afghanlstan
border last night..</i>

1094
01:22:33,756 --> 01:22:37,988
<i>...has died in hospital there.</i>

1095
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:41,653
<i>The Foreign Ministry reports...</i>

1096
01:22:41,831 --> 01:22:44,698
<i>...that a camera bag
left on the scene..</i>

1097
01:22:45,068 --> 01:22:49,061
<i>...bore the name 'Tetsuya Kudo'..</i>

1098
01:22:49,238 --> 01:22:55,734
<i>...and officlals are trying to confirm
if that is in fact the dead man's name.</i>

1099
01:22:57,480 --> 01:23:01,974
<i>Look at the smile on his facel
He looks really happy.</i>

1100
01:23:02,685 --> 01:23:08,646
<i>He only smlles llke that
when Mommy changes his diaper.</i>

1101
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:13,158
Tetsuya?

1102
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:23,832
Yoko? It's me!

1103
01:23:36,586 --> 01:23:39,248
Hi! I'm here to raise morale...

1104
01:23:39,388 --> 01:23:41,413
But are you OK?

1105
01:23:41,591 --> 01:23:44,321
Gotta save Tetsuya..

1106
01:23:44,927 --> 01:23:46,827
What? Yoko!

1107
01:23:46,996 --> 01:23:48,520
What do I do?!

1108
01:23:48,664 --> 01:23:50,256
Are you OK?!

1109
01:24:08,851 --> 01:24:12,014
No harvest again today.

1110
01:24:32,175 --> 01:24:33,403
Uh-oh...

1111
01:24:53,229 --> 01:24:54,662
Damn!

1112
01:25:06,375 --> 01:25:07,933
Watch the steps!

1113
01:25:09,879 --> 01:25:11,005
Hang on!

1114
01:25:16,519 --> 01:25:18,248
Now step up..

1115
01:25:18,421 --> 01:25:20,480
Grab on here. One, two...

1116
01:25:21,557 --> 01:25:22,387
Can I come, too?

1117
01:25:22,558 --> 01:25:23,684
Certainly.

1118
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:25,384
Sit there.

1119
01:25:25,561 --> 01:25:27,688
Lie down here.

1120
01:26:12,275 --> 01:26:13,674
Hang on, Reina!

1121
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:15,377
Is something wrong?

1122
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:19,277
How many months?!

1123
01:26:19,415 --> 01:26:21,542
Well, uh...

1124
01:26:21,684 --> 01:26:23,652
...I don't really know.

1125
01:26:23,786 --> 01:26:25,048
Who's her doctor?

1126
01:26:25,421 --> 01:26:28,151
She hasn't been to one.

1127
01:26:28,324 --> 01:26:30,053
What?! Why not?

1128
01:26:30,693 --> 01:26:33,992
There'd be trouble
if it was made public.

1129
01:26:34,931 --> 01:26:36,831
This isn't the time for that!

1130
01:26:37,967 --> 01:26:38,763
Get in!

1131
01:26:45,541 --> 01:26:48,510
Push down hard
on her birth canal!

1132
01:27:21,277 --> 01:27:23,802
Keep quiet, will you!

1133
01:27:24,747 --> 01:27:26,146
Mrs Ono!

1134
01:27:26,882 --> 01:27:29,612
The pa ns have started.

1135
01:27:29,952 --> 01:27:32,887
It might be early,
but I thought I'd come.

1136
01:27:33,022 --> 01:27:36,981
The kids said they didn't want to
wa t around at home.

1137
01:27:37,226 --> 01:27:37,954
I see.

1138
01:27:38,094 --> 01:27:40,927
One moment.
I'll call the doctor.

1139
01:27:48,671 --> 01:27:53,165
It's a lovely moon tonight,
isn't it.

1140
01:28:05,154 --> 01:28:06,052
Yes?

1141
01:28:07,723 --> 01:28:11,124
Oh? She's a bit early.

1142
01:28:11,293 --> 01:28:13,488
I'll be right there.

1143
01:28:16,065 --> 01:28:18,158
Mother, I have to work.

1144
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:22,931
Are you f nished?

1145
01:28:30,913 --> 01:28:32,813
Good evening, Doctor.

1146
01:28:33,716 --> 01:28:34,910
Good evening!

1147
01:28:35,084 --> 01:28:37,279
Hi, Dr Hiratsuka!

1148
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:39,945
You've all gotten so big!

1149
01:28:40,089 --> 01:28:42,284
We're here for the fourth.

1150
01:28:42,458 --> 01:28:45,950
I see you came ready,
as usual.

1151
01:28:46,128 --> 01:28:47,186
Of course.

1152
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,932
Have the pains started?

1153
01:28:54,103 --> 01:28:58,130
They're not very strong yet.
I guess I came too soon.

1154
01:28:58,474 --> 01:29:00,442
So you're still all right...

1155
01:29:00,576 --> 01:29:02,544
Yes. I'll just wait here a while.

1156
01:29:02,711 --> 01:29:03,643
Doctor?

1157
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:08,412
Yoko Sasaki's water has broken.
She's coming in by ambulance.

1158
01:29:08,584 --> 01:29:09,710
Oh, dear...

1159
01:29:14,290 --> 01:29:15,348
Nurse Ando...

1160
01:29:15,891 --> 01:29:17,552
...get ready.

1161
01:29:41,317 --> 01:29:43,046
Hey, an ambulance!

1162
01:29:51,861 --> 01:29:54,762
<i>Doctor! I think Yoko's here.</i>

1163
01:29:56,799 --> 01:29:57,891
All right.

1164
01:30:21,157 --> 01:30:22,055
Huh?

1165
01:30:22,858 --> 01:30:24,826
Mika started hurting.

1166
01:30:25,928 --> 01:30:27,953
Yuh! Help me!

1167
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:30,325
Didn't you say Ms Sasaki?

1168
01:30:30,499 --> 01:30:31,966
They said so.

1169
01:30:32,134 --> 01:30:33,226
Get inside.

1170
01:30:35,271 --> 01:30:37,205
Did she hear wrong?

1171
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:39,908
Sign here, please.

1172
01:30:40,109 --> 01:30:41,167
Right.

1173
01:30:42,878 --> 01:30:45,540
Hang in there, Yoko.
We're almost there!

1174
01:30:45,714 --> 01:30:47,807
Tetsuya! Tetsuya!

1175
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:49,918
<i>Where is he!</i>

1176
01:30:50,853 --> 01:30:54,345
Gotta save Tetsuya!

1177
01:30:55,057 --> 01:30:56,957
Can we go any faster?

1178
01:31:04,433 --> 01:31:05,229
Here goes.

1179
01:31:05,401 --> 01:31:07,335
You OK? Careful...

1180
01:31:07,536 --> 01:31:08,935
Mika!

1181
01:31:09,138 --> 01:31:11,265
Bring a wheelchair.

1182
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:14,074
You'll be f ne.

1183
01:31:15,844 --> 01:31:16,776
OK?

1184
01:31:17,446 --> 01:31:18,936
Sit down here.

1185
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:23,916
Doctor, she's not due yet.
Is something wrong?

1186
01:31:24,086 --> 01:31:26,111
<i>It's all right. Don't worry.</i>

1187
01:31:32,695 --> 01:31:34,925
Ms Sasaki's coming, too!

1188
01:31:37,299 --> 01:31:40,097
Get Mika into the delivery room.

1189
01:31:42,504 --> 01:31:43,232
Where's Sakurai?

1190
01:31:43,372 --> 01:31:45,465
She worked last night.

1191
01:31:45,608 --> 01:31:47,132
Oall her in.

1192
01:31:49,211 --> 01:31:51,111
We're going to be busy.

1193
01:31:52,414 --> 01:31:54,245
Oh, Jiro!

1194
01:31:56,085 --> 01:32:00,078
Reina, you'll be fine!
I'm with you! Hang on!

1195
01:32:00,222 --> 01:32:02,053
It hurts!

1196
01:32:02,191 --> 01:32:03,988
Go faster!

1197
01:32:04,226 --> 01:32:05,352
I know!

1198
01:32:05,561 --> 01:32:07,358
Oall the Hiratsuka Olinic!

1199
01:32:07,529 --> 01:32:09,326
Hiratsuka...

1200
01:32:36,592 --> 01:32:38,253
Careful...

1201
01:32:43,465 --> 01:32:44,898
Yoko!

1202
01:32:45,567 --> 01:32:46,363
Harue?

1203
01:32:46,535 --> 01:32:47,968
Where's your husband?

1204
01:32:48,137 --> 01:32:49,001
Oh, yeah...

1205
01:32:49,471 --> 01:32:53,100
<i>Call a TV station.
He's abroad, in a gun battle!</i>

1206
01:32:54,643 --> 01:32:56,804
Everything'll be fine...

1207
01:32:57,479 --> 01:32:58,537
Oall them!

1208
01:32:58,681 --> 01:33:00,546
OK, I will!

1209
01:33:00,683 --> 01:33:02,275
Go for it, Yoko!

1210
01:33:08,924 --> 01:33:10,414
Oall who?

1211
01:33:10,993 --> 01:33:12,790
I don't know.

1212
01:33:17,466 --> 01:33:18,296
Huh?

1213
01:33:18,967 --> 01:33:19,763
What?

1214
01:33:19,935 --> 01:33:21,630
It feels like...

1215
01:33:22,338 --> 01:33:23,464
...it's coming.

1216
01:33:27,142 --> 01:33:28,074
Hey!

1217
01:33:29,278 --> 01:33:30,302
Doctor!

1218
01:33:30,446 --> 01:33:30,935
Hold on!

1219
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:32,945
Hey! Doctor!

1220
01:33:33,082 --> 01:33:34,071
Jiro!

1221
01:33:39,288 --> 01:33:41,722
We haven't used this one n years!

1222
01:33:41,857 --> 01:33:45,088
Good thing we still have t.

1223
01:33:45,761 --> 01:33:47,786
Get that, will you?

1224
01:33:49,732 --> 01:33:51,461
I'll help!

1225
01:33:51,934 --> 01:33:54,095
Thank you.

1226
01:33:54,303 --> 01:33:56,669
Hiratsuka Olinic...

1227
01:34:03,412 --> 01:34:05,812
Put that here, will you?

1228
01:34:10,686 --> 01:34:13,314
Harue! Hang in there!

1229
01:34:13,489 --> 01:34:15,480
Mrs Ono, up you go.

1230
01:34:18,026 --> 01:34:21,291
Do you feel like you're pushing?

1231
01:34:21,563 --> 01:34:22,757
A bit.

1232
01:34:22,931 --> 01:34:25,661
Don't do that yet.
Try to relax.

1233
01:34:26,201 --> 01:34:27,293
Harue?

1234
01:34:29,104 --> 01:34:32,835
I must've caught it
from seeing all of you.

1235
01:34:34,810 --> 01:34:35,708
Doctor...

1236
01:34:36,678 --> 01:34:40,045
There's another one coming in!

1237
01:34:42,484 --> 01:34:44,008
<i>Sorry I'm late!</i>

1238
01:34:44,953 --> 01:34:47,080
Wow! Three of them!

1239
01:34:49,224 --> 01:34:50,384
Jiro!

1240
01:34:51,627 --> 01:34:55,290
Get a drip ready.
And call around for back-up!

1241
01:34:55,764 --> 01:34:56,423
'Back-up'?

1242
01:34:57,299 --> 01:34:58,266
Quick!

1243
01:35:04,973 --> 01:35:07,669
Yes! We just don't have
enough people!

1244
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:11,209
Hello, Wakaba General Hospital?

1245
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:13,780
Do you have a spare obstetrician?

1246
01:35:13,949 --> 01:35:16,509
If you could help us...

1247
01:35:21,924 --> 01:35:23,915
Hey, give us a hand!

1248
01:35:26,028 --> 01:35:27,256
An emergency!

1249
01:35:29,498 --> 01:35:31,489
We can't understand her!

1250
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:40,567
Doctor! Another one!

1251
01:35:40,809 --> 01:35:42,709
We're out of tables!

1252
01:35:48,083 --> 01:35:50,677
You'll be fine. What's your name?

1253
01:36:00,496 --> 01:36:01,292
Nope.

1254
01:36:01,597 --> 01:36:06,500
We're full up in here. Bring a bed
and put her in the nurses' station.

1255
01:36:06,735 --> 01:36:07,963
Right!

1256
01:36:09,037 --> 01:36:10,265
You'll be f ne.

1257
01:36:10,439 --> 01:36:12,839
Did you get any help?

1258
01:36:12,975 --> 01:36:17,002
No! All the obstetrics wards
are busy!

1259
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:21,240
Is tonight a full moon?

1260
01:36:28,524 --> 01:36:29,718
I knew it!

1261
01:36:29,858 --> 01:36:31,325
Knew what?

1262
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:36,295
They say the full moon
makes women want to give birth.

1263
01:36:39,735 --> 01:36:40,827
Ow!

1264
01:36:42,671 --> 01:36:44,400
Yuh!

1265
01:36:44,673 --> 01:36:45,731
Hang in!

1266
01:36:50,212 --> 01:36:51,474
Anyway...

1267
01:36:52,881 --> 01:36:54,712
<i>...let's get through this.</i>

1268
01:36:54,850 --> 01:36:55,874
Right.

1269
01:37:02,925 --> 01:37:04,051
Mr Ono...

1270
01:37:04,593 --> 01:37:06,618
...there's a bed in the back.

1271
01:37:07,229 --> 01:37:08,457
Thank you.

1272
01:37:08,830 --> 01:37:11,298
Come on, kids.

1273
01:37:30,085 --> 01:37:31,245
Hang on!

1274
01:37:33,488 --> 01:37:35,479
Dr Hiratsuka!

1275
01:37:36,391 --> 01:37:38,256
Where's the doctor?

1276
01:37:38,627 --> 01:37:40,117
She's busy now...

1277
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:42,328
Hey...

1278
01:37:42,564 --> 01:37:45,931
Are you Tetsuya Kudo?

1279
01:37:46,401 --> 01:37:47,390
Yes.

1280
01:37:47,803 --> 01:37:49,862
You look better in real life.

1281
01:37:50,072 --> 01:37:50,970
Huh?

1282
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:53,604
Oome with me, quick!

1283
01:37:53,742 --> 01:37:55,073
Where?

1284
01:37:59,982 --> 01:38:01,540
Yoko! Are you OK?

1285
01:38:01,683 --> 01:38:04,311
What are you doing here?

1286
01:38:04,653 --> 01:38:06,678
<i>It's a long story.</i>

1287
01:38:06,822 --> 01:38:09,985
You're alive! I'm so glad!

1288
01:38:10,192 --> 01:38:11,853
<i>It's not that bad..</i>

1289
01:38:12,427 --> 01:38:14,452
Why did you just leave?

1290
01:38:14,796 --> 01:38:17,390
Why? Well...

1291
01:38:18,567 --> 01:38:23,266
I have a confession to make.

1292
01:38:23,939 --> 01:38:25,304
Not now.

1293
01:38:26,541 --> 01:38:28,509
In Vietnam...

1294
01:38:29,678 --> 01:38:35,378
...it was me who wanted you
as the photographer.

1295
01:38:38,520 --> 01:38:39,885
The fact is...

1296
01:38:41,356 --> 01:38:43,688
...I've always loved...

1297
01:38:45,827 --> 01:38:49,490
...your pictures.

1298
01:38:51,266 --> 01:38:52,494
Yoko!

1299
01:38:52,801 --> 01:38:54,234
Tetsuya!

1300
01:39:01,009 --> 01:39:03,204
OK OK OK.

1301
01:39:03,412 --> 01:39:05,642
This is no time for long chats.

1302
01:39:05,847 --> 01:39:08,407
It's crowded in here.
Step outs de, please.

1303
01:39:08,617 --> 01:39:09,447
But...

1304
01:39:09,618 --> 01:39:11,142
No buts.

1305
01:39:11,353 --> 01:39:14,618
Out! Outs de, please.

1306
01:39:14,790 --> 01:39:15,722
Yoko!

1307
01:39:15,857 --> 01:39:17,085
Yoko!

1308
01:39:21,363 --> 01:39:23,957
We were just getting to
the good part!

1309
01:39:42,117 --> 01:39:44,415
Somebody! Oome quick!

1310
01:39:44,886 --> 01:39:46,376
It's coming!

1311
01:39:46,955 --> 01:39:49,150
Out front!

1312
01:39:52,594 --> 01:39:54,061
It's coming!

1313
01:39:59,367 --> 01:40:00,595
Oh, uh..

1314
01:40:02,104 --> 01:40:03,901
In the car out front...

1315
01:40:05,073 --> 01:40:07,200
Oh, yeah! Dr Hiratsuka!

1316
01:40:08,176 --> 01:40:09,734
Get out, I said!

1317
01:40:10,879 --> 01:40:14,337
There's another one out front!

1318
01:40:20,655 --> 01:40:22,384
You!

1319
01:40:22,791 --> 01:40:25,817
Doctor! Help us!

1320
01:40:26,361 --> 01:40:29,125
So you didn't abort the baby...

1321
01:40:29,297 --> 01:40:31,458
I've seen her on TV! Uh...

1322
01:40:31,633 --> 01:40:32,531
<i>'Reina'!</i>

1323
01:40:32,667 --> 01:40:33,599
Yeah!

1324
01:40:33,735 --> 01:40:37,136
Does the father know
about the baby?

1325
01:40:37,272 --> 01:40:39,706
They say it's that politician, uh...

1326
01:40:39,841 --> 01:40:41,365
'Sakazaki'!

1327
01:40:42,043 --> 01:40:43,806
So it's true, huh?!

1328
01:40:43,945 --> 01:40:45,776
Will you two shut up!

1329
01:40:51,052 --> 01:40:52,519
The father...

1330
01:40:54,456 --> 01:40:55,616
...is me!

1331
01:40:56,458 --> 01:40:57,823
Huh?!

1332
01:40:58,293 --> 01:40:59,225
What?!

1333
01:41:00,929 --> 01:41:03,693
No!

1334
01:41:04,900 --> 01:41:06,959
That's not what I mean.

1335
01:41:07,602 --> 01:41:11,060
I'm the replacement father.

1336
01:41:11,239 --> 01:41:14,606
Please bring this ch Id
into the world!

1337
01:41:14,776 --> 01:41:16,107
Yeah, right!

1338
01:41:16,311 --> 01:41:20,441
You're the last one who'd be
the father of my child!

1339
01:41:21,116 --> 01:41:24,517
No, it was just
a figure of speech...

1340
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:26,754
Ow!

1341
01:41:26,988 --> 01:41:28,615
Are you all right?!

1342
01:41:29,391 --> 01:41:30,380
Move.

1343
01:41:33,395 --> 01:41:35,226
All of you, turn around!

1344
01:41:36,031 --> 01:41:37,464
Excuse me...

1345
01:41:41,603 --> 01:41:43,537
She's coming fastest.

1346
01:41:44,773 --> 01:41:46,798
Ando! Out here!

1347
01:41:47,943 --> 01:41:49,308
Watch your feet!

1348
01:41:49,878 --> 01:41:52,039
Doctor, we'll go back inside.

1349
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:54,307
Let me know what happens.

1350
01:41:54,683 --> 01:41:59,211
OK, boys, step back.
Back! Back! Back!

1351
01:42:09,497 --> 01:42:14,434
What's going on?!
You expect me to have it here?

1352
01:42:15,403 --> 01:42:17,803
Get me a private room!

1353
01:42:17,973 --> 01:42:21,306
The delivery room's full tonight.
I'm sorry.

1354
01:42:22,911 --> 01:42:24,708
No!

1355
01:42:25,013 --> 01:42:28,505
I want a suite!

1356
01:42:28,717 --> 01:42:31,982
Now! Bear down!
That's t! That's it!

1357
01:42:32,387 --> 01:42:34,617
I can see the head!

1358
01:42:35,490 --> 01:42:36,422
Bear down!

1359
01:42:37,726 --> 01:42:39,421
Almost there!

1360
01:42:39,661 --> 01:42:41,322
OK, now.

1361
01:42:41,596 --> 01:42:43,427
As hard as you can!

1362
01:42:43,598 --> 01:42:45,589
One, two, push!

1363
01:42:46,868 --> 01:42:48,563
Here it comes!

1364
01:42:50,872 --> 01:42:53,170
Congratulations!

1365
01:42:58,713 --> 01:43:00,908
It's a boy!

1366
01:43:09,291 --> 01:43:11,384
Congratulations.

1367
01:43:13,328 --> 01:43:14,090
Thank you!

1368
01:43:14,229 --> 01:43:15,491
Thank you!

1369
01:43:21,236 --> 01:43:23,295
Someone had a baby.

1370
01:43:23,805 --> 01:43:25,705
Besides us?

1371
01:43:26,041 --> 01:43:27,838
It's a full house.

1372
01:43:28,143 --> 01:43:31,237
<i>It's like Ladies' Day
at the movies.</i>

1373
01:43:33,448 --> 01:43:35,211
Go to Mommy...

1374
01:43:35,383 --> 01:43:37,044
Hold him.

1375
01:43:45,026 --> 01:43:46,493
Congratulations.

1376
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:23,062
Nurse Sakurai...

1377
01:44:23,264 --> 01:44:26,199
...that lady's in pain.

1378
01:44:26,334 --> 01:44:31,533
She keeps saying 'dao qua'
or something...

1379
01:44:31,673 --> 01:44:32,833
'Dao qua'?

1380
01:44:33,008 --> 01:44:35,772
<i>It hurtsl It hurtsl</i>

1381
01:44:37,979 --> 01:44:39,742
<i>Are you Vietnamese?</i>

1382
01:44:40,215 --> 01:44:41,842
<i>Are you Vietnamese?</i>

1383
01:44:42,384 --> 01:44:43,749
<i>Yesl Yesl</i>

1384
01:44:43,885 --> 01:44:45,284
<i>I aml</i>

1385
01:44:49,357 --> 01:44:50,654
Nurse!

1386
01:44:52,460 --> 01:44:54,155
Get Tetsuya in here.

1387
01:44:54,295 --> 01:44:56,126
Tetsuya? All right.

1388
01:45:00,835 --> 01:45:02,166
What's wrong?

1389
01:45:02,303 --> 01:45:03,702
Come here.

1390
01:45:03,938 --> 01:45:06,839
That woman's from Vietnam.

1391
01:45:06,975 --> 01:45:09,102
Interpret for her.

1392
01:45:09,277 --> 01:45:10,301
Right!

1393
01:45:15,216 --> 01:45:16,843
<i>I'm a week earlyl</i>

1394
01:45:17,919 --> 01:45:19,580
<i>You'll be fine.</i>

1395
01:45:19,721 --> 01:45:21,154
<i>The doctor's coming.</i>

1396
01:45:21,723 --> 01:45:23,554
<i>Oh, good. Thank you.</i>

1397
01:45:25,560 --> 01:45:27,528
You understand her?

1398
01:45:27,662 --> 01:45:28,594
Yes.

1399
01:45:29,197 --> 01:45:32,428
Then tell her to relax.
Her baby is fine.

1400
01:45:32,567 --> 01:45:35,502
But it's going to take
a little while yet.

1401
01:45:35,637 --> 01:45:37,161
All right.

1402
01:45:42,377 --> 01:45:44,208
<i>OK. Thank you.</i>

1403
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:46,642
Hang in there.

1404
01:45:51,319 --> 01:45:52,251
Mika?

1405
01:45:52,787 --> 01:45:54,880
Doctor!

1406
01:45:56,491 --> 01:45:57,458
Right.

1407
01:45:59,661 --> 01:46:01,060
She's next?

1408
01:46:01,396 --> 01:46:02,522
Mika!

1409
01:46:03,198 --> 01:46:04,825
Yuh, come here.

1410
01:46:07,068 --> 01:46:11,300
Take this, and push it hard
up her rear end.

1411
01:46:11,439 --> 01:46:13,031
This?

1412
01:46:13,174 --> 01:46:14,106
Yes.

1413
01:46:14,242 --> 01:46:16,608
Mika, roll onto your s de.

1414
01:46:16,744 --> 01:46:17,904
Like that.

1415
01:46:18,046 --> 01:46:20,571
Now, hold it like this...

1416
01:46:21,149 --> 01:46:22,514
...and do that!

1417
01:46:22,717 --> 01:46:24,844
Yuh! What are you doing?!

1418
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:26,587
Pervert!

1419
01:46:26,721 --> 01:46:27,915
What?!

1420
01:46:28,656 --> 01:46:30,988
Shut up and push!

1421
01:46:32,026 --> 01:46:33,118
It's OK.

1422
01:46:33,361 --> 01:46:35,488
Settle down and don't worry.

1423
01:46:35,630 --> 01:46:37,393
Breathe slow...

1424
01:46:37,832 --> 01:46:41,063
He's not a pervert.

1425
01:46:42,070 --> 01:46:43,628
<i>One, two..</i>

1426
01:46:55,016 --> 01:46:56,813
Hold that, Yuh.

1427
01:46:59,954 --> 01:47:01,216
Did we get help?

1428
01:47:01,356 --> 01:47:02,448
I'm not sure.

1429
01:47:02,590 --> 01:47:04,057
Go check.

1430
01:47:04,926 --> 01:47:06,450
All right?

1431
01:47:10,632 --> 01:47:11,758
Doctor!

1432
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:13,197
Step aside.

1433
01:47:14,469 --> 01:47:17,927
Well, well, well!
A full house...

1434
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:20,707
Mother! What are you doing here?

1435
01:47:20,842 --> 01:47:23,470
Take her back to her room.

1436
01:47:24,145 --> 01:47:26,238
It's all right.

1437
01:47:27,515 --> 01:47:30,973
I see a bum.
We've got a breech birth here.

1438
01:47:31,586 --> 01:47:33,577
But she was fine!

1439
01:47:34,889 --> 01:47:36,720
Will it be OK?

1440
01:47:36,858 --> 01:47:39,952
You'll be f ne.
I'm used to breech births.

1441
01:47:41,129 --> 01:47:42,460
Doctor!

1442
01:47:42,597 --> 01:47:46,624
I'll look after her.
You see to the lady over there.

1443
01:47:46,801 --> 01:47:47,768
But...

1444
01:47:48,436 --> 01:47:50,996
You'll be f ne.

1445
01:47:51,139 --> 01:47:52,538
Doctor!

1446
01:47:53,508 --> 01:47:54,907
Enough tennis.

1447
01:47:55,043 --> 01:47:57,671
Mika, it's time to bear down.

1448
01:47:57,812 --> 01:47:59,336
Raise her feet.

1449
01:48:01,149 --> 01:48:06,109
Mika, keep look ng down
at your stomach.

1450
01:48:06,254 --> 01:48:07,414
Here goes.

1451
01:48:07,822 --> 01:48:09,084
<i>One, two..</i>

1452
01:48:09,257 --> 01:48:10,986
Yuh!

1453
01:48:11,125 --> 01:48:12,956
Come on, Mika! Try!

1454
01:48:14,028 --> 01:48:16,189
I'm trying!

1455
01:48:21,369 --> 01:48:23,564
Oome on, Harue!

1456
01:48:24,572 --> 01:48:25,664
Jiro!

1457
01:48:25,807 --> 01:48:27,434
Jiro!

1458
01:48:28,543 --> 01:48:30,704
Oould I come in?

1459
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:32,668
No.

1460
01:48:32,814 --> 01:48:35,305
Please! I've taken all three.

1461
01:48:35,450 --> 01:48:37,782
If I miss this one...

1462
01:48:37,919 --> 01:48:40,183
...it'll be jealous...

1463
01:48:40,588 --> 01:48:43,056
The last one was out of focus!

1464
01:48:43,891 --> 01:48:47,691
No problem!
This camera's hi-vision.

1465
01:48:48,329 --> 01:48:51,958
OK, there's the back...

1466
01:48:52,133 --> 01:48:53,760
<i>A little more..</i>

1467
01:48:54,135 --> 01:48:55,864
Here it comes...

1468
01:48:56,237 --> 01:48:57,704
Jiro!

1469
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:01,675
Harue! Just a bit more!

1470
01:49:03,444 --> 01:49:05,878
There we are!

1471
01:49:15,556 --> 01:49:18,024
A pretty little girl.

1472
01:49:23,798 --> 01:49:24,787
Hey!

1473
01:49:25,667 --> 01:49:28,568
Zoom in! Zoom in!

1474
01:49:41,082 --> 01:49:42,140
Now you...

1475
01:49:42,283 --> 01:49:44,274
OK, the last push.

1476
01:49:44,419 --> 01:49:48,219
Look down here and push
with everything you've got.

1477
01:49:48,389 --> 01:49:51,324
Breathe in...

1478
01:49:51,459 --> 01:49:52,448
Now stop...

1479
01:49:52,627 --> 01:49:54,026
And bear down!

1480
01:49:54,162 --> 01:49:56,528
Push! Push! All the way!

1481
01:49:56,664 --> 01:49:58,529
Yes, just like that!

1482
01:49:59,967 --> 01:50:01,559
The head's out!

1483
01:50:04,939 --> 01:50:08,170
Yes! Yes! Almost there!

1484
01:50:09,711 --> 01:50:13,010
There!

1485
01:50:24,158 --> 01:50:25,352
Oh, dear...

1486
01:50:47,749 --> 01:50:50,240
Take a deep breath...

1487
01:50:53,321 --> 01:50:55,619
I see the head! Push!

1488
01:50:58,526 --> 01:50:59,993
Just a bit more..

1489
01:51:00,128 --> 01:51:01,493
You're fine.

1490
01:51:14,142 --> 01:51:15,973
Congratulations!

1491
01:51:19,280 --> 01:51:22,477
Well done. Oongratulations!

1492
01:51:23,618 --> 01:51:25,142
<i>Congratulations.</i>

1493
01:51:25,620 --> 01:51:27,144
<i>Thank you.</i>

1494
01:51:32,894 --> 01:51:36,625
Doctor, sit down here
for a while.

1495
01:51:37,064 --> 01:51:39,294
We can handle the rest.

1496
01:51:39,434 --> 01:51:41,527
Call me if you need me.

1497
01:51:44,372 --> 01:51:47,967
I'm worn out
just from watching it...

1498
01:51:49,477 --> 01:51:51,672
<i>It's a job no man can do.</i>

1499
01:51:52,079 --> 01:51:53,171
Yep.

1500
01:52:01,989 --> 01:52:04,253
It hurts! Do something!

1501
01:52:05,393 --> 01:52:07,327
Ride the wave.

1502
01:52:08,129 --> 01:52:10,996
Now! One, two, push!

1503
01:52:11,833 --> 01:52:13,425
<i>It's taking so long...</i>

1504
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:15,399
It's fine. I see the head.

1505
01:52:15,536 --> 01:52:17,003
Push harder!

1506
01:52:18,172 --> 01:52:19,434
And rest...

1507
01:52:20,241 --> 01:52:24,268
I can't take it.
Do a caesarian.

1508
01:52:24,412 --> 01:52:26,209
What?! You're almost there.

1509
01:52:26,347 --> 01:52:27,871
Stop this pain!

1510
01:52:28,015 --> 01:52:29,482
Yoko! You can do it!

1511
01:52:29,617 --> 01:52:31,209
That's easy for you to say!

1512
01:52:31,352 --> 01:52:32,580
I'm right here!

1513
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:34,984
What the hell good does that do?!

1514
01:52:35,122 --> 01:52:36,146
Squeeze my hand.

1515
01:52:36,290 --> 01:52:38,451
No, thank you!

1516
01:52:39,327 --> 01:52:41,090
Stop fighting!

1517
01:52:41,229 --> 01:52:42,218
Breathe in!

1518
01:52:42,363 --> 01:52:43,853
One, two..

1519
01:52:44,999 --> 01:52:46,091
Yoko!

1520
01:52:46,968 --> 01:52:49,459
Doctor, this isn't fair!

1521
01:52:49,604 --> 01:52:51,299
Don't stop! Bear down!

1522
01:52:51,439 --> 01:52:54,101
Why is it just me who hurts?!

1523
01:52:54,242 --> 01:52:57,905
If a baby takes two,
why is it the woman who suffers?!

1524
01:52:58,045 --> 01:52:59,205
And rest...

1525
01:53:00,448 --> 01:53:02,177
I lost my job...

1526
01:53:03,851 --> 01:53:06,513
...I hurt like hell...

1527
01:53:06,687 --> 01:53:09,349
...and he stands and watches!

1528
01:53:09,624 --> 01:53:12,889
That's the way it is.

1529
01:53:13,794 --> 01:53:14,783
One last time!

1530
01:53:14,929 --> 01:53:17,830
I should never have done this!

1531
01:53:17,965 --> 01:53:20,490
One, two!

1532
01:53:22,236 --> 01:53:23,328
It's coming!

1533
01:53:24,672 --> 01:53:26,071
It's out!

1534
01:53:48,996 --> 01:53:50,020
Ando...

1535
01:53:53,434 --> 01:53:54,560
What's wrong?

1536
01:53:54,869 --> 01:53:55,893
Doctor?

1537
01:53:59,273 --> 01:53:59,864
Doctor!

1538
01:54:00,007 --> 01:54:00,769
Tube.

1539
01:54:01,108 --> 01:54:02,268
Is he OK?

1540
01:54:04,045 --> 01:54:06,843
Why isn't he crying?

1541
01:54:07,048 --> 01:54:08,606
Be quiet.

1542
01:54:11,385 --> 01:54:12,716
What's wrong?

1543
01:54:14,488 --> 01:54:15,978
Is he OK?

1544
01:54:46,420 --> 01:54:47,717
Thank you!

1545
01:54:48,456 --> 01:54:49,821
Good boy.

1546
01:55:11,245 --> 01:55:13,679
It's born!

1547
01:55:41,275 --> 01:55:42,503
Congratulations.

1548
01:55:52,453 --> 01:55:53,613
Tetsuya...

1549
01:55:57,058 --> 01:56:00,755

Gather round
for the picture, everyone.

1555
01:57:03,891 --> 01:57:04,516
Mrs Hibino!

1556
01:57:05,860 --> 01:57:09,421
I talked to my husband.
He's agreed to try again.

1557
01:57:10,564 --> 01:57:12,429
We're in your hands.

1558
01:57:13,334 --> 01:57:14,699
Really?

1559
01:57:15,803 --> 01:57:17,031
Good.

1560
01:57:23,711 --> 01:57:27,545
Is there a festival
or something today?

1561
01:57:28,983 --> 01:57:31,747
Everyone looks so happy.

1562
01:57:35,589 --> 01:57:37,489
They do, don't they.

1563
01:57:39,493 --> 01:57:44,226
Everyone stand
where you can see the camera.

1564

OK, b g smiles!

What is it about big hair
that turns men on?

31

you are?

47

Your father being who he is,
and the enormous expectations...

106

all adds up to
rather a lot, doesn't it?

107

- Yes, sir.
- Hmm. But, none of that excuses...

00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,470
That's about as much
as I know about my father.

between Amy Masterson and Soneji?

00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:36,190
Amy? No way.
Why do you ask?

342

He strangled her.

343
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,570
It's an act of passion.

344
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,580
It's a demonstration
of will.

345
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,140

- Alex.

third eye, sixth sense...

I don't have it.

350

Sure you do, you just
don't look at it right.

351

Every face has two aspects.

352
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,600
Now try looking at it down
the middle, one side at a time.

353
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,050
Would you say this man
was confident?

354
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,950
- Yeah.
- Narcissistic?

355
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:18,350
- I-I wouldn't know.
- Ever see any flashes of hatred?

356
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,790
- No. No. No!
- Anger? Hostility?

357
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:26,300
Look, everything about him
was right.

358
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:30,530
He was always patient, he was
pleasant. He had a sense of humor.

359
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,940

the perfect teacher.

366
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,020
I see that you're about
to start an argument.

367
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,950

368

369
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,160
- You don't. I can understand that.
- That's right.

370
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:16,360
- No, you can't.
- Can I tell you why I don't care?

371
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,240
Shoot.

372
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:29,750
Look, when I was
assigned to Cathedral,

373
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,810
it was a job
I didn't want.

374
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:35,520
It's a far cry from working
rope lines or flying Air Force One,

375
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:39,120
but I have been there
for three years.

376
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,000
I have been responsible
for Megan for three years.

377
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,230
And that little girl means
more to me than even a partner.

378
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,970
Can you understand that?

379
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,750
I suppose so.

380
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,150
Even if I say no, you'll probably
follow me around wherever I go.

381
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,330
So, if it's a choice between
having you as a partner...

382
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:12,070
or as a stalker, I guess I'll
take my chances with a partner.

- Mm-hmm.

on the Internet is connected.

[Laughing]
Yeah.

851
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:02,480
I wondered what happened to it
during the ransom drop.

852
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:07,820
The ransom drop.

853
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:10,620
That was
a well-earned 12 million.

854
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:14,460
Twelve million.

855
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:19,160
Senator Rose says
he can pull strings.

856
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:23,180
He says he can fix it so you
keep the 12 million and walk.

857
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:27,870
All you have to do is return
the child. Where is Megan?

Where's Megan?
Where is Megan?

Where's Megan? Where is Megan?
Where is Megan?

860
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:41,370
She's trapped on my boat, Alex,
isn't that right?

861
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:46,080
Or maybe she's stuck in a warehouse
somewhere or floating in a river.

862
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:49,090

of a rope, buried alive.

864

I envy her.

865
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:03,010
What would life had been like
with parents like that?

866
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:06,640
Come on, Gary, blaming your parents
for what you are?

867
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:09,350
I'm not blaming them, Alex.

868
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:13,120
They've been punished
already.

869
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:21,840
I burned down the house
while they slept.

870
01:16:26,410 --> 01:16:29,380
I was 15 years old.

871
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:32,180
Was it what you expected?

872
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:36,920
Not really.
It was a new experience.

873
01:16:36,990 --> 01:16:38,930
What, killing?

874
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,870
No, being
in the newspapers.

875
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:49,870
So, in your opinion, Doctor,

876
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:54,610
were my actions
triggered by nature...

877
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,740
or nurture?

878
01:16:57,860 --> 01:17:00,320
If you want me
to be brutally honest...

879
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:06,420
I think you just have
a morbid desire to burn in hell.

01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:18,710

[Sirens Wailing In Distance]

[Woman] Residents of this normally
quiet suburb are still in shock...

895
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:15,990
as news of the shooting of Gary
Soneji, America's most-wanted man,

896
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:17,990
filtered through
their community.

897
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,400
Apparently, Soneji had attempted
to confront, or even harm...

898
01:18:20,470 --> 01:18:22,990
members of the kidnapping
task force hunting him.

899
01:18:23,070 --> 01:18:27,340
So, he came after Jezzie
as payback for Dimitri.

900
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:31,300
Ostensibly, yeah.

01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:33,310

on record?

Dr. Cross, tell me you have at least
an idea where my little girl is.

I'm sorry, sir, I can't.

and you're telling me
you haven't a clue, not one clue?

done the same thing, sir.

supposed to find my little girl,

long before we ever heard of him.

Look at this.
What do you see?

01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:21,180
Agent Devine hauling ass
out to the front gate.

Mac, he could have shut this

why he didn't?

[Quietly] Good God.
Devine was in on it with him.

942

Then, when Soneji hit the embassy,
he pulled a double cross.

943

He ran his own ransom.

No, Soneji was a loner.

been beneath him.

You really believe that
he shot Soneji to save my life?

984

Cross pulled the trigger because

[Screams]

1019
01:31:23,730 --> 01:31:25,660
Stop it!

1020
01:31:29,970 --> 01:31:31,900
[Breathing Heavily]

1021
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,680
[Whimpering]

1022
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,490
That was very clever,
Megan.

1023
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:48,330
[Straining,
Whimpering]

1024
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:22,910
- [Muffled Screams]
- Shh, shh, shh.

1025
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:08,710
Jezzie?

1026
01:34:12,190 --> 01:34:14,650
It's over.

1027
01:34:14,720 --> 01:34:16,660
Drop the gun.

1028
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:22,500
Alex...

1029
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:26,640
how-how did you, um...

1030
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:29,040
Aces and eights, Jezzie.

1031
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:32,670
Plus, your timing
was a little off.

1032
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:34,680
I watched the tapes.

1033
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:39,550
You and Devine could have
stopped Soneji at the school.

1034
01:34:39,620 --> 01:34:42,560
Just like you could have stopped
him at the Russian Embassy.

1035
01:34:42,630 --> 01:34:45,060
But you had
a different agenda.

1036
01:34:45,130 --> 01:34:48,260
You know something, Alex?

1037
01:34:48,330 --> 01:34:50,430
When you said,
"You do what you are,"

1038
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:53,030
you were right.

1039
01:34:53,110 --> 01:34:56,230
I'm living proof.

1040
01:34:57,510 --> 01:35:00,000
Put the gun down, Jezzie.

1041
01:35:05,790 --> 01:35:09,090
Would you kill
another partner?

1042
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:11,890
You're not my partner.

1043
01:35:19,210 --> 01:35:21,540
[Whimpering]

1044
01:36:27,030 --> 01:36:29,190
Are you all right?

1045
01:36:31,770 --> 01:36:33,970
You're a very brave girl,
Megan.

1046
01:36:34,040 --> 01:36:37,140
Who are you?

1047
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:40,150
I'm a policeman.

1048
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:46,070
My name is Alex Cross.

1049
01:36:46,140 --> 01:36:48,700
I'm a friend
of your parents.

1050
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,550
Can you take me to them?

1051
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:58,750
Nothing would give me
greater pleasure.

1052
01:37:02,460 --> 01:37:06,270
Could you...
Ah, thanks.

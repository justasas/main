266
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,095
Not a good idea.

267
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,805
Miss Flannigan is not welcome.

268
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,141
But she's a material witness.

269
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,703
She failed the Roses and
she failed the Service.

270
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:49,038

271
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,437
No, he's missing the point.

292

<font color="#804040">MCARTHUR</font>: I disagree.

294
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:20,088

It's going to be about money.

295
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,736
Which is good.

296
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,403
But you're saying it
isn't about money?

297
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,245
I think he wants to draw this out.

298
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,753
From what he's said,
whatever his motives,

299
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,837
it's very unusual.

300
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,013
What did he mean about the book?

301
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,009
That it will never close?

302
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,954
I honestly don't know.

303
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:55,683
Well, I think I do.

304
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:02,072
Let me tell you what this
Gary Soneji is up to.

305
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,739
The last thing he wants is
good crisis management.

306
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,677
What he wants is to confuse.

307
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:12,454
Rancour, mixed signals,
disorientation, those are his tools.

308
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:15,418
So he calls a local cop.

309
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:18,585
A damaged cop shouldering
some heavy baggage.

310
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,754
He's using Dr Cross
as his messenger.

311
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:24,924
Excuse me, the man that kidnapped
our daughter didn't call you,

312
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:28,323
so your agenda is what, to
insult the man he did call?

313
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:32,270
- Mrs. Rose, I never intended...
- No, you wait a second.

314

A mad man has our daughter

315
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:37,108
and for some reason he
contacted this man.

316
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,144

00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,781

He was pleasant.

- You don't.
- That's right.

When I was assigned to Cathedral,
it was a job I didn't want.

411
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:36,023
It's a far cry from working
rope-lines or flying Air Force One

412
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:39,193
but I have been there
for three years.

413

I have been responsible for
Megan for three years.

414

And that little girl means more
to me than even a partner.

415
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:49,267
Can you understand that?

416
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,146
I suppose so.

417
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,378
But even if I say no anyway,

418
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:00,949
you'll probably just follow
me around wherever I go.

419
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:07,555
So, if it's a choice between having
you as a partner or as a stalker,

420
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:10,660
I guess I'll take my
chances with a partner.

428
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,536
Which door did he go out?

00:30:49,598 --> 00:30:53,794
Uh, that one there. It's a straight
shot to his parking space.

- His classroom.
- Mmm-hmm.

432
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:14,644
He was teaching the kids how everything

He planted a monitoring virus
on the girl's hard drive.

453

Every keystroke Megan hit,

I'm sorry, I don't follow.

568
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:43,602
1932. The infant son
of Charles Lindbergh,

569
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:46,897
America's greatest
hero, was kidnapped.

570
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,066
When Bruno Hauptmann was arrested,

571
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:52,569
what followed became known as
"The Crime of the Century."

572
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,239
I believe that Soneji wants
to do the same thing.

with a copycat?

that he's properly appreciated.

580
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,667
And in order for him
to achieve this,

581
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,938
he has to kill Megan?

582
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:31,691
No, no. Not necessarily.

583
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:34,653
The death of the Lindbergh
baby was accidental.

584

Nevertheless, it's critical
that we pull his strings.

The more we make him

Megan is precious cargo.

656
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,563
Soneji is not going to let some
twist of fate bring her harm.

657

665
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,625
- He's...
- Nobody.

666
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,148
Most people don't
even know who he is.

667
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:31,069
Never heard of him. Couldn't
pick him out of a line-up.

668
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:34,155

where will it be in two months?

Oblivion. Know why?

671
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:44,275
Because Senator Hank Rose
is no Charles Lindbergh.

672
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,946
- Well, okay, then, who is?
- Ah...

Two years, five days

680

we appreciate your concern,
but Dimitri is fine,

681
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:19,427

most capable of protecting

682
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:22,031
the son of the Russian president.

683
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,933
Can we at least talk to him?

684
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:28,978
Nothing would please us
more than to be of help.

685
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:33,316

688
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,602
Well, McArthur is drag

689
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,105
And, I mean, he's not
really missing us,

690
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:15,525

could just stick around and,

694

Yeah, you know, stale

Look at this. What do you see?

1000

Agent Devine hauling ass
out to the front gate.

1001
01:22:21,103 --> 01:22:24,981
Mac, he could have shut this whole

1004
01:22:33,490 --> 01:22:35,366
Devine was in on it with him.

1005
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:38,119
Then when Soneji hit the embassy,
he pulled a double-cross.

1006
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,787
He ran his own ransom.

No.

1008
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,708
Soneji was a loner.

1009

An accomplice would
have been beneath him.

I'll tell you what happened.

1011
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:51,738
Soneji was hoodwinked,

1012

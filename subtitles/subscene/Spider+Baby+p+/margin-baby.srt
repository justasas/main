1
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:26,731
Every baby in the world is born
with the secret of the universe.

2
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,240
What sounds like baby talk
to the average adult

3
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:31,435
is in fact a secret baby language.

4
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:36,077
Here, underneath the Bobbins
Day Care Center in Washington,

5
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:39,379
is the top-secret headquarters
of the Baby Squad.

6
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:44,321
Their mission-- use their brilliant
minds and high-tech tools

7
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:48,315
to discover clues and solve mysteries
all over the world.

8
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,940
But they had no idea
what they were in store for

9
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:10,004
with their first mission.

10
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,890
Oh, no.

11
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,430
The jewels!
The jewels have been stolen!

12
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,235
For the queen!

13
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,299
You two, with me.

14
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,005
- Search everywhere. Find them.

15
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,497
"Once upon a time there was a girl
named Snow White.

16
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:41,870
And she lived in a big castle
in this wondrous forest

17
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:45,638
with horses, beautiful trees,
and flowers around it."

18
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,203
Hi there. May I help you?

19
00:02:48,234 --> 00:02:50,271
Did you get put in time-out?

20
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,374
Oh, no.
I'm the new music teacher

21
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:53,713
here for the kids.

22
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,515
Hey, kids.

23
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:58,022
I'd like you to meet
your new music teacher.

24
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,115
Hello, everyone.

25
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,291
-- "And then she met her prince."

26
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,526
And lived happily ever after.

27
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,228
It's time for breakfast.
Gracias, Kylie.

28
00:03:10,256 --> 00:03:11,997
We do have a schedule to keep.
Vémonos.

29
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,165
Vémonos a la mesa.
Kylie, tu sabes.

30
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,208
Hello, General Haiger.

31
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,648
Bob, we've got
an unusual mission for you.

32
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,743
Let's cut to the chase, Bob.

33
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,345
The president wants you to go active,
effective immediately.

34
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:34,153
You and your brothers have done some
great work in baby communication.

35
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,629
Now, I've been involved in everything
from aliens to black ops, white ops,

36
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,892
ops that don't even have
a color yet,

37
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,766
but a team led by babies who can
solve crimes around the world--

38
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:47,567
pretty crazy stuff.

39
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:51,041
You see, General Haiger, babies possess
the knowledge of the universe.

40
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,567
If we can use that power
to help people

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,739
who truly need it,
you see, in theory-

42
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,213
Enough with the theories, Bob.

43
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,616
-- Bob, there's a young man outside.

44
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,052
Did you hire a new
music teacher?

45
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,111
I did.

46
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:07,386
That's Holden Hammer-smith,
one of our top new agency recruits.

47
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,222
Music teacher
is just his cover.

48
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,819
He'll be my liaison.

49
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,490
So-- so you're sending someone
to spy on us?

50
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,521
We're a spy agency, Bob.

51
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,125
It's what we do.

52
00:04:17,156 --> 00:04:19,898
Bottom line--
we need results in 30 days

53
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,907
or your organization doesn't exist,
officially or unofficially,

54
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,602
and that's official.

55
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,953
Hammer-smith,
security code 643.

56
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,286
I've been here
for over two hours.

57
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:43,454
There are no geniuses.
Just a bunch of drooling babies.

58
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,053
Yeah. No, I got it.

59
00:04:45,084 --> 00:04:47,496
- Mm-hmm.

60
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:51,199
No, somebody hit me
in the head with a ball.

61
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,726
Uh-huh.
There's poop everywhere.

62
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,399
Don't get me wrong, General.
They're all very cute

63
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,271
and probably smart for babies.

64
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,742
Maybe even one knows...

65
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,767
how to tie a shoelace,
but that's about it.

66
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,543
They're not gabbing.
They're definitely babies.

67
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,140
- I just sent them all to sleep.

68
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:08,083
Yeah, I ever got the car
and everything.

69
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,519
I don't know what
you want me to do.

70
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,716
Yeah, poop, droop-- everything.

71
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:19,226
No, I understand that, sir.

72
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:22,131
I-- I--
oh, holy mackerel.

73
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,657
I'll get back to you.

74
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:37,376
Yeah!

75
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,881
Whoo-hoo!

76
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,003
Good morning, team.

77
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:10,004
Gather around.
We've got work to do.

78
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,141
Argh! Argh!

79
00:06:12,171 --> 00:06:14,344
Next time, try the elevator.

80
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:22,049
Bob Bobbins.

81
00:06:22,081 --> 00:06:24,118
- Kylie Bobbins-- my niece.
- Nice to meet you.

82
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,620
Meet Holden Hammer-smith, sent by
the agency to observe and report.

83
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,447
Oh, brother.

84
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,549
He's a spy?

85
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,116
He's sure not a musician.

86
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:04,559
Shirley Jones here, sir.

87
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,433
The crown jewels
have been stolen.

88
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,469
The crown jewels, people.

89
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,133
Copy that. We're on it.

90
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,941
The crown jewels of London
are the symbols of the English royalty.

91
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,913
The collection
is worth millions.

92
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,180
the knight's golden scepter,

93
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,710
the princess's diamond necklace,

94
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,418
and even the imperial state crown
worn by the queen herself.

95
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,620
Gorgeous.
Does it come in my size?

96
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,357
You go, girl.
My little fashionista.

97
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,989
We love our royalty.

98
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,160
The whole country has got
its knickers in a knot.

99
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:41,002
Don't worry, we're sending a field team
to London immediately.

100
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,974
- Seriously?
- We are? Oh, my God.

101
00:07:43,996 --> 00:07:45,566
Are you sure you're ready,
Uncle Bob?

102
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,272
We've run the simulations
a thousand times.

103
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,253
People, this is not a drill.

104
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,152
Finally, some real action.

105
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:01,158
Yes! Come on, give it up.

106
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,750
Our first mission.

107
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,386
They can't really be talking
to each other.

108
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,260
Yes, really.
But when it comes to an adult,

109
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:08,026
only a Bobbins can understand
baby talk.

110
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:10,500
I guess the Bobbins
have never really grown up.

111
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,796
- What's this?
- The Z-35 Vortex.

112
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,536
It transports people across the planet
through wormholes.

113
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,443
You know, quantum physics.
Pretty basic baby stuff.

114
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,378
Yeah, I majored
in quantum physics.

115
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:25,848
I'm pretty sure that I'm smarter
than these babies.

116
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,546
I guess we'll see, spy boy.

117
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:33,285
Kylie, you're leading up the field team
along with Skip and Alfred.

118
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,950
What's happening?

119
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,825
- Bob, are you sure they can do this?
- Okay, time to buckle up.

120
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,854
I have full faith in them, Betty.
They're geniuses.

121
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,501
But they're still babies.

122
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,232
We can do it, Mom.

123
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,940
Okay, Kylie is in charge.

124
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,672
You remember to do
everything she says, okay?

125
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,580
These are goody bags
for your first mission.

126
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:00,242
It's pancakes au broccoli.

127
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,378
Skip's dad loved it.

128
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:04,183
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yuck.

129
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,191
Kylie, this is
a Z-35 transponder.

130
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,056
You need to keep this
with you at all times

131
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:12,153
so we can triangulate your position
and get you back home safely.

132
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,890
Activating Z-35 Vortex.

133
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,130
Energy fields up.

134
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:22,435
Synchronizing phase fluctuations
with wormhole.

135
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,007
Programming Wormhole
to change your clothing

136
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:28,410
to the latest London fashions.

137
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,675
Be careful. Come back.
I'll miss you.

138
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,842
If we've adjusted
the telemetry properly,

139
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,944
you'll materialize in a corridor
right next to the Tower of London

140
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,886
where nobody should see you.

141
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,591
- It worked.
- Argh!

142
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,464
It actually worked.
It worked.

143
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:51,723
Yippee!

144
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,931
Yippee!

145
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,406
Whoo!

146
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,780
Hello. Excuse me.

147
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:11,981
Oh, hello.

148
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,252
Oh, look at that--

149
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,691
little babies, eh?

150
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,661
Hey, dude,
who are you calling little?

151
00:10:17,683 --> 00:10:20,596
Here I was, trying to take
a little snooze here,

152
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,363
and little babies
sneak into my cab, eh?

153
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,664
Where are you from,
little babies?

154
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,136
Is this guy for real?

155
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,638
They don't understand me.

156
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:31,039
Or do they? Eh?

157
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,543
- Creepy.
- Where to, missy?

158
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,445
Actually, we're kind of lost.
Can you take us to the Tower of London?

159
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,007
Oh, the Tower of London?
That's where they keep the crown jewels.

160
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:43,179
They were recently stolen.
There's a lot of commotion over there.

161
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:46,452
I understand, but it's really important
that we get to the Tower.

162
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,949
Well, the customer's
always right, little babies.

163
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,326
So the Tower of London it is.

164
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,523
Buckle up now.

165
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,657
We're on the opposite side
of the road.

166
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,794
Looks like a big, giant donut.

167
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,395
There's Big Ben over there.

168
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,964
That clock-- 150 years old.

169
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,737
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

170
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,711
The third tallest
clock tower in the world.

171
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,236
And there on your left side,
that's Buckingham Palace.

172
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:14,308
If you wave, maybe William and Kate
is in the window there.

173
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,786
- Do you know who lives there?
- The queen.

174
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:19,221
Well, that was some wedding, eh?
That was crackers, that wedding.

175
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,384
This guy's strange.

176
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:23,792
- He also needs a dentist.
- Yeesh.

177
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,286
- Ooh.
- Cheese.

178
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,737
- I love you.
- I love you.

179
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:38,173
I rule.

180
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,201
- I can't believe I'm here.
- Smile.

181
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,716
Well, here we
are at the Tower of London.

182
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:52,188
Look out for those royal guards.
No matter what you do,

183
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,384
it's impossible to make them laugh.
Did you ever hear that?

184
00:11:54,413 --> 00:11:56,393
We'll see about that.

185
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,762
Looks like
he's in a doghouse.

186
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:03,357
Looks like a giant poodle.

187
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,300
Look, I'm dancing like
the Black Eyed Peas.

188
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,534
Come on, stop acting
like babies.

189
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,909
We got some work to do.
Let's go.

190
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:18,040
- He's not real.
- I think he's a toy soldier.

191
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,981
We've only just begun,
little babies.

192
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,679
You have no idea
where this will all end up.

193
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,289
I'm going to need a US Government
identification card

194
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:35,322
- to get into the crime scene.
- Copy that. We're on it.

195
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,234
Oh, my gosh, use this one.

196
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,499
Love Kylie's hair in this picture.

197
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,235
Yeah, but look at the outfit
in this one.

198
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,641
That girl can accessorize.

199
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,303
I don't know what you're saying,

200
00:12:48,334 --> 00:12:50,109
but you don't seem
to be doing much work.

201
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,946
Men-- no sense of style.

202
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,509
Obviously.
Look at his shoes.

203
00:12:55,541 --> 00:13:00,012
Men don't realize
it's all about the shoes.

204
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:03,857
I have more shoes
than pacifiers in my closet.

205
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:09,321
Got it, Jordan.
Thanks. I'm out.

206
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:21,043
Whoa, check out
the merchandise.

207
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:25,014
Alfred, don't touch that.
You break it-- you buy it.

208
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,748
I'm Chief Inspector Jones
of Scotland Yard.

209
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,188
- Can I help you, miss?
- Hi. Kylie Bobbins,

210
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:36,159
special assistant to the head
of the US State Department Secretary

211
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,628
here in London.
We would like to offer our assistance.

212
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,961
This guy looks
pretty smart.

213
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,830
You think you'll buy
the fake ID?

214
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,502
Brilliant, Miss Kylie.
And the children?

215
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:50,564
Uh, the secretary had to
leave town suddenly.

216
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:52,542
I assure you
they will be no trouble.

217
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,873
Babysitting today, eh?

218
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:57,346
As it so happens, I'm looking after
my own little princess today.

219
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:01,408
Children, this is my daughter
Shirley Jones.

220
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,889
Miss Bobbins, allow me to show you
what we've learned so far.

221
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:13,553
- Hello, mates.
- Hey, Shirley. What have we got?

222
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,533
Not a clue.
An almost perfect crime.

223
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,627
- They're searching high.
- We're searching low.

224
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,005
Follow me.

225
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:27,206
Being a spy is cool.

226
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,605
This is fun.

227
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,282
Getting a bit of
a reading here, mates.

228
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,449
Love the British accent.

229
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:44,758
Sweet, a clue.

230
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:51,627
Oops, my bad.

231
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:57,934
- Anything, young chap?
- Here, found a clue.

232
00:14:57,963 --> 00:15:00,739
A bit of evidence-
a hamburger.

233
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:02,006
Um, that's okay.

234
00:15:02,034 --> 00:15:04,446
Just scan it and then
use some sanitizer.

235
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,880
- Command center.
- Feeding the last of the clues in now.

236
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,321
Any results yet on your end?

237
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,461
A small footprint,
a baseball cap,

238
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,361
and half-eaten hamburger.

239
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,798
Somebody is a thief
and a slob.

240
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:24,300
Got that right, girl.

241
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,770
Using the graphical interface
projector sequence.

242
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:30,740
- Yeah.
- I love this job.

243
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,471
One of the thieves
snuck through the air vent.

244
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,639
Way too small
for an average-sized adult.

245
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:40,344
Once inside,
Mr. Messy Pants was distracted

246
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:42,579
when he had to
let his partner in.

247
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:50,522
DNA evidence suggests
an adult baseball cap

248
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:54,895
occasionally worn by a baby
with a very big head.

249
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,366
And a poor sense of style.

250
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:00,461
Must have used particle lasers
to cut the glass.

251
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:06,140
Something set off the alarm,
but they still managed to escape.

252
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,667
Analysis on the hamburger?

253
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,180
Get ready to get grossed out.

254
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,648
Small bite marks,
meat by-products,

255
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:15,652
almost 95% fat content.

256
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:19,178
There's only one place in London
that sells a burger that's that greasy.

257
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,859
- Yum.
- Lunchtime.

258
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:35,599
Here we are.

259
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:37,470
Excuse me,
are you the manager?

260
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,773
Yes, miss.
Master Nathan Guffman at your service.

261
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,575
You will love our special
fish and chips burger.

262
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:46,344
We're actually looking for the person
who was eating this burger.

263
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,182
Do you remember a customer
that was a bit suspicious-looking?

264
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,916
He looks suspicious.

265
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:56,418
Our clientele leans towards
working-class families,

266
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,395
not your suspicious types.

267
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:02,797
The big boss-- he's been
working hard to make this

268
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,199
the best burger place in the world.

269
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:08,433
- Beauregard Burger?
- Yes, miss. He's the big boss.

270
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,498
And that's his son,
Beauregard Baby Jr.

271
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,168
We also call him Big Baby.

272
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,270
You know, like his initials, BB.

273
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,872
BB? That's Big Baby.

274
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,043
A criminal baby?
That's not cool.

275
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,576
Do you know where I could find
Mr. Beauregard Burger?

276
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,418
Oh, yes, miss.
He'll be down in his office.

277
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,583
Here you go.
Here's his business card.

278
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:29,559
Thank you.
You've been very helpful.

279
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,254
Thank you.

280
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:32,489
All right, let's go.

281
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,555
Hey, we didn't eat
our food.

282
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,793
We should have
done takeout.

283
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:39,962
Oh, Master Beauregard Jr.

284
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:43,064
- Uppie!
- That is so cute.

285
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:46,599
Oh, such a growing boy.

286
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,040
You will do everything I say.

287
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,883
I will do everything you say.

288
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,616
What's going on?

289
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,646
UPPie!

290
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,089
Excuse me?

291
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,096
Mr. Burger?

292
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,791
A"!/body here?

293
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,992
Welcome.

294
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,023
Hi. I'm here to interview Mr.--

295
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,036
Mr. Beauregard Burger.

296
00:18:13,058 --> 00:18:14,799
Who are these guys?
The Blues Brothers?

297
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,170
Well, well, well,

298
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,266
welcome to Big Daddy Burgers
corporate headquarters.

299
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,799
I'm Beauregard Burger.

300
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,108
Kylie Bobbins.
We spoke on the phone.

301
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,977
Yes, these must be
your nephews.

302
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:25,777
Please come into my office.

303
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,977
I'm doing an article
on how wonderful

304
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,954
your deep-fried fatty food
is for kids.

305
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:35,390
Finally, a journalist who's
not afraid to print the truth.

306
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:40,357
- Huh?
- Oh, Miss Kylie,

307
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:43,298
this here is my son,
Beauregard Burger Jr.

308
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:46,735
Perhaps your nephews would like to
go and play with BB while we talk.

309
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:49,534
Come here, boys.

310
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,570
So you're Big Baby.

311
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,409
And you're here with your aunt,
the reporter.

312
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,312
Interesting.

313
00:18:58,337 --> 00:18:59,372
Cool outfit.

314
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:02,010
Does it come with
a baseball cap maybe?

315
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,351
Since you're new in town,
I'll give you some advice.

316
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:08,586
Stay out of
the Burger business or else.

317
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,026
Oh!

318
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,267
What's up, girl?

319
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,602
So we talked to the Burgers
and we didn't come up with anything.

320
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:24,539
But we did.

321
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:28,306
Infrared GPS scan of the footprints
leaving the Tower of London

322
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,405
leads straight to Big Daddy Burgers
restaurant.

323
00:19:32,638 --> 00:19:34,811
Okay, so the crown jewels
must be here.

324
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,551
We got a bogey on the Garcia cam.

325
00:19:40,946 --> 00:19:44,223
Prepping level-six distraction.

326
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,627
What are these babies
really up to?

327
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:47,960
Time for a diaper bomb.

328
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:53,036
Oh. av-vi-vi

329
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:54,128
Yeah!

330
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,273
I just changed you.

331
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,180
Shh.

332
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,052
- Shh.
- Shh.

333
00:20:12,077 --> 00:20:13,715
Come on.

334
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,762
We have to sneak the jewels
out of here.

335
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:25,360
Have to sneak jewels.

336
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,837
You don't have to repeat
everything I say.

337
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,397
We don't have to repeat-

338
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,137
BB?

339
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,304
What's going on here?

340
00:20:35,334 --> 00:20:38,315
I guess I'll have to
hypnotize you again.

341
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,476
UPPie! Uppie!

342
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,521
So that's how he did it--
hypnosis.

343
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,030
There must be a safe
in here.

344
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,000
Oh, I got it.

345
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,831
Sweet.

346
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:21,550
Holy hamburgers!
We did it!

347
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:24,517
Yeah!

348
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,861
Kylie, get out of there now.
They're heading towards you.

349
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,796
Come on, guys, let's go.

350
00:21:34,993 --> 00:21:37,166
He's got the jewels.
After him!

351
00:21:43,902 --> 00:21:45,506
Inspector Jones.

352
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,711
We received a mysterious call
that you might need help.

353
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,584
We were able to wrestle this
away from him.

354
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,557
Only the necklace?
What about the scepter and the crown?

355
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,820
He handed a bag to a large man
in the alley.

356
00:21:56,848 --> 00:21:59,795
Probably one of his
less intelligent henchmen.

357
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,230
But we've captured
the real mastermind.

358
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:05,133
Mastermind?
But the real mastermind is right here.

359
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,898
Don't be ridiculous.

360
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:09,565
Mr. Burger helped us
crack this case.

361
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:13,633
This horrible man stole the crown
jewels and we called the police.

362
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,645
You're a true hero, sir.

363
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,774
It seems you were
outsmarted, Crybaby Squad.

364
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,445
Let's take this rubbish
downtown.

365
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:23,475
Right-0.

366
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,749
Hey, where did Big Baby
and his dad go?

367
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,224
Cheerio, Baby Squad.

368
00:22:43,428 --> 00:22:46,272
We didn't recover the scepter
and the crown,

369
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,278
but we recovered
the diamond necklace.

370
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,177
A job well done, Bob.

371
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,706
But I hate to burst
your bubble, Bob.

372
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:57,050
The queen's Diamond Jubilee
is days away.

373
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:00,454
And I want the scepter and the crown
back before then

374
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:02,789
or else.

375
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,054
Haiger out.

376
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,229
Guys, you heard the man.

377
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:10,164
We've got work to do.

378
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:12,668
- One down, two to go.

379
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:32,878
Hold it steady.

380
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,254
Easy.

381
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,316
Ugh, Dad, let me do it.

382
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,700
Non, ce n'est pas possible!

383
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,835
Le tableau! Le tableau!

384
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:54,844
Thief!
The painting has been stolen!

385
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,641
- A droite! A gauche!

386
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:57,942
A droite! A gauche!

387
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:20,227
It's like Picasso.

388
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:21,498
Ah!

389
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:28,676
This is impossible.

390
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:31,305
Ah!

391
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:36,844
Babies painting masterpieces?

392
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,399
0-0 Senora, these are
no ordinary babies.

393
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,496
I agree with you.

394
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,603
Operations switcheroo.

395
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,012
I mean, would an ordinary baby
create a masterpiece like this?

396
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,913
I agree.
They are all masterpieces.

397
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,614
No, no, no, no, no, no, senora.

398
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,179
- Well, they're wonderful.
- No, no, no.

399
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,851
- Look at all those colors.
- Yeah, I know. This is like children.

400
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,452
- They didn't do children's work before.

401
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:21,726
- It was like Picasso or something.
- Your positive reinforcement

402
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,960
- is terrific.
- Oh.

403
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:28,333
It's so much fun to trick
Mrs. Garcia, isn't it?

404
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,864
I agree. I just wish
she had more fashion sense.

405
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,378
Oh, get back to business.

406
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,725
We have Charlie le Clueless
on the line.

407
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,757
He's the son of France's
greatest detective.

408
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,303
Bonjour, mes amis.

409
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:02,805
Bonjour.

410
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:05,068
Hello, Charlie.
Tell us what happened.

411
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:07,303
A terrible theft at the Louvre.

412
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,371
It's a museum in Paris

413
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:13,679
that houses the largest
art collection in the world.

414
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:14,706
Any Suspects?

415
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,652
Beauregard Burger
and Big Baby

416
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:20,054
have both been spotted in Paris.

417
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:24,026
We feel they are involved in some way,
but we don't know how.

418
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:27,121
Could this be connected
to the missing crown jewels?

419
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:29,257
Does plaid clash with stripes?

420
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:32,200
In other words, duh!

421
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,567
Don't worry, Charlie.
We're on it.

422
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:39,338
What are they saying?

423
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:42,607
Mr. Bobbins,
I hate to complain...

424
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,238
Since when?

425
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,715
This whole baby talk thing-
I can't be effective

426
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,445
if I can't understand anybody.

427
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:55,692
I've got just the thing.
Try this.

428
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:56,988
What is it?

429
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:58,824
I built a baby translator
for you.

430
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:02,128
- Give it a whirl.

431
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:06,397
I've got the Z-35 Vortex
set for the correct azimuth.

432
00:27:06,424 --> 00:27:08,904
But what about the ionospheric
phase shifting?

433
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,304
I can hear them!

434
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:13,400
I still have no idea what they're
talking about, but I can hear them.

435
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,638
- Duh.
- Welcome to our world.

436
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:16,975
Cool.

437
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,812
Gabi and Jordan, you're gonna be
on the away team.

438
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:23,615
- And Holden is going with you.
- Oh, yes! My first mission!

439
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,145
Holden Hammer-smith
in the field.

440
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:27,349
Hello.

441
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:29,825
Pick me up.

442
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:31,259
Let's go.

443
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,455
- It's going straight to his head.
- Nice.

444
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:36,125
Got a surprise for you
when you get to Paris, Gabi.

445
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,395
Ready?

446
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,334
This is the Z-35 Vortex.

447
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,736
You're going to take this
so we can triangulate your position

448
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:44,763
and get you back home safely.

449
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,942
Vortex power surge beginning.

450
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:53,245
35%. And vortex forming.

451
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:56,741
Transporting you to a storage room
right inside the Louvre.

452
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:58,277
Ohh-hh!
- Pretty colors.

453
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:00,118
- Hang on, guys!
- Good luck.

454
00:28:08,086 --> 00:28:10,930
Hang on!
We're almost there, guys! Hold on!

455
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:15,035
Whoa. That was fun.

456
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,767
- Can we do it again?
- Take off your glasses.

457
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,934
Doesn't look like the Louvre.

458
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,000
Someone should call
a vortex repairman.

459
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,205
Whoa, the Eiffel Tower.

460
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,908
It's over 1,000 feet tall.

461
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:28,611
Actually, it's 1,063 feet.

462
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,314
Ha! I knew something you didn't.

463
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,822
Don't get a big head, rookie.

464
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,381
- Uh, sir?
- Oh.

465
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,654
Excusez-moi, monsieur.

466
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,628
- Hello.
- Whoa!

467
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,188
His nose looks like
the Eiffel Tower.

468
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,429
I was engrossed in my paper

469
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:50,270
and I did not see
two beautiful babies in my cab.

470
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:52,104
He called me beautiful.

471
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,132
He said two beautiful babies.

472
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:55,337
Whatever.

473
00:28:55,366 --> 00:29:00,008
In France we adore
beautiful babies and dogs...

474
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:02,609
- Did he say "dogs"?
- ...because we are warm, loving people

475
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,642
overflowing with compassion.

476
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:08,556
Bonjour. Would you like
to buy a French beret?

477
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,288
Hey, get lost.
Casse-toi! Va-t'en! Va-t'en!

478
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:12,659
Oh, take it easy.

479
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,392
I am sorry.
I lost control.

480
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,094
But I have already been-
how you say?

481
00:29:18,123 --> 00:29:22,037
--Ripped off by this bum
and his fake, phony berets.

482
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:26,805
They're not even French.
They are made in Vietnam.

483
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:29,607
This guy is loony.

484
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:32,114
So where would you like to go?

485
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:34,515
Actually, we need to go
straight to the Louvre.

486
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,076
That is the champion
of art museums.

487
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,917
My favorite painting
is in the Louvre.

488
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,251
Oh, yeah?
What's your favorite painting?

489
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,690
"Starry, Starry Night"
by Vincent.

490
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,251
- Van Gogh, right?
- Vincent van Gogh.

491
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:48,287
You are very smart
like a porcupine, eh?

492
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,558
All right, buckle up.

493
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,569
Oh, Paris. I'm in love.

494
00:29:53,591 --> 00:29:55,832
Holden,
check out my picture.

495
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,171
So you said your favorite
painting was "The Starry Night"?

496
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:01,677
- Why is that?
- Well, because of the stars.

497
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:05,010
On a clear night, you can see
millions and millions of stars

498
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:08,245
and around each one planets.

499
00:30:08,273 --> 00:30:10,412
- I like this guy.
- Planets that may have life.

500
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,751
- Bet he'd really dig my Cosmonauter.
- Imagine them.

501
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,757
- I think you're both crazy.
- Little baby ones, eh?

502
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,492
Now let's rock 'n' roll
Paris style.

503
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:27,369
Say, "Ooh-la-cheese."

504
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,603
Looking good, girl.

505
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,868
Call me Mademoiselle Jordan.

506
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:42,239
Yeah!

507
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,652
We finally made it
to the Louvre Museum.

508
00:30:46,077 --> 00:30:48,853
Kids, this is
a billion dollars of artwork.

509
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,553
Please, no accidents.

510
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,057
Bonjour. I am Jean Le Clueless
of the French police.

511
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,898
- And I'm--
- Uh...

512
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:03,428
Jean Le Clueless is the greatest
detective in all of France.

513
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,270
I need but to observe.

514
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,237
Bien.

515
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,371
You are Holden Hammer-smith

516
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:13,245
assistant art expert
from the US embassy

517
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,911
here in Paris, sent to assist
in our investigation. Oui?

518
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,386
And these are
your two lovely nieces

519
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,912
whom you must play caretaker
to for the day.

520
00:31:20,945 --> 00:31:23,289
I think we're caretakers
for Holden.

521
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:26,261
And you love to eat peanuts.

522
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:29,891
Hello.
It's in the fax he got from Alfred.

523
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:30,922
Duh.

524
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:32,935
Actually, that's pretty good.

525
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:36,029
Although isn't all that information
in the fax you received from our office?

526
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,666
Fax, fax.
What is this fax?

527
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,242
But I am correct
on the peanuts, oui?

528
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,611
No. Actually, I hate peanuts.

529
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,617
No, you don't.
You are mistaken.

530
00:31:47,639 --> 00:31:50,347
But enough chitchat.
I have a crime to solve.

531
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,117
The culprit broke in,

532
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:54,851
evaded security.

533
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:58,053
And stole our most prized
possession-

534
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,618
the "Mona Larry."

535
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,461
Monsieur, don't you mean
the "Mona Lisa"?

536
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,160
Oh, no.

537
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:05,792
No, no, no.

538
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:09,794
The "Mona Lisa" is still here.

539
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:13,601
The "Mona Larry"
is almost as valuable,

540
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:16,237
but it is
a 500-year-old painting

541
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,213
of a father

542
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:21,046
with his very large child.

543
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,882
Now you will excuse me.

544
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:25,751
As I said,
I have a crime to solve...

545
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,687
peanut breath.

546
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:31,785
Ooh-la-la, he's cuckoo.

547
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,818
He'd better watch out.

548
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,961
You break it,
you buy it.

549
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,471
This place is a mess.

550
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:44,302
Have someone
clean this, yeah?

551
00:32:45,396 --> 00:32:46,841
Sorry about my father.

552
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:51,836
Sometimes he can be kind of
a little clueless.

553
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:55,009
Speaking of clues, the first thing
they taught us in the academy-

554
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,780
look for clues.

555
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,879
Hey, fearless leader,
down here.

556
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,357
To catch a big baby,
think like a big baby.

557
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,553
Grown-ups search high
and we search low.

558
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,099
Voilé, a clue.

559
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,034
- We're hot on the trail.

560
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:15,560
Keep detecting.

561
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,170
Yes!

562
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:25,341
Oh, cool.

563
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,372
Certainement. A clue.

564
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,380
A paintbrush with wet ink.

565
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:39,224
Oh, sorry about that.

566
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,923
Let me just-

567
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:42,363
This is not ink.

568
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:46,830
Hmm, barbecue sauce.

569
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,030
Peanut breath.

570
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,604
-- I've scanned and downloaded

571
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:54,872
the clues we found so far, Kylie.
Any results yet?

572
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,379
There's nothing on the paintbrush
or the beret, but the croissant-

573
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:00,076
it's filled with preservatives,
lard, and a ton of grease.

574
00:34:00,104 --> 00:34:02,015
There's only one restaurant
in all of Paris

575
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,077
that would serve
such an unhealthy croissant.

576
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,514
Follow the smell
to Big Daddy Burgers.

577
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,891
My burger has a lot of grease.

578
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,160
Of course it does.

579
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:20,135
It's our secret sauce, Dad.

580
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,638
What is phase two
of your plan?

581
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:26,335
Oh, brother.
You forget everything under hypnosis.

582
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:31,574
Now that we have the painting,
we have to take the crown to the--

583
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:32,979
the Baby Squad!

584
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:35,678
How do they always manage
to track me down?

585
00:34:35,706 --> 00:34:38,778
You need to stop being so sloppy
when we rob places.

586
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,153
I'm a baby. okay?

587
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:43,523
I'm used to having someone
pick up after me.

588
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,289
Let's go.

589
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:48,796
Hello.

590
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,290
Something tells me they don't serve
Caesar salad here.

591
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,627
Excuse me.

592
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,937
How rude.

593
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,808
Hello. Hey.

594
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:04,780
Anyone? Right here.

595
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:07,043
Hi.

596
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:11,417
Why do all clues always lead us
to a greasy hamburger joint?

597
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,319
Qu'est-ce que c'est?
Look what it is.

598
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,881
We've got customers to serve.
What are you doing?

599
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,860
Now go. Go away
and wash the dishes, you fool.

600
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,329
Bonjour.
How may I help you?

601
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,662
Do you recognize this?

602
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:28,663
Oh, mon Dieu.
Oh, that is vile.

603
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,969
That is--
it's practically inedible.

604
00:35:30,995 --> 00:35:32,235
It came from this
restaurant.

605
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:35,836
Oh, then that makes sense,
doesn't it?

606
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:37,175
Maybe you'd like one?

607
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,203
This guy is loony.

608
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,513
Yeah, his head is full of grease.

609
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:44,748
Did anyone suspicious purchase
a croissant like this recently?

610
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,948
Suspicious?

611
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,313
No.

612
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:52,157
Nobody suspicious at all.

613
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:53,719
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

614
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:55,924
Maybe you would like
a croissant.

615
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:57,660
I'm good, thanks.

616
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,167
Can we go shopping now?

617
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,192
Good day, monsieur.
Au revoir.

618
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:03,796
Who's next? Bye-bye.

619
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,364
Customers to serve.

620
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,535
Au revoir.
Have a nice day.

621
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:11,035
Now that's how
you behave under hypnosis.

622
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:18,112
Kylie here.
Anything to report?

623
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:20,019
It was a dead end
at the burger place.

624
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:21,887
What's the analysis
on the clues we sent you?

625
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,291
The paintbrush
is inconclusive-

626
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,124
gross, but inconclusive.

627
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,595
She's not kidding.

628
00:36:27,618 --> 00:36:29,222
You might want to check out
the crime scene again.

629
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:31,392
- Maybe there's something you missed.
- Copy that.

630
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,931
Nothing. We're toast.

631
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,944
Better call Mr. Bobbins.

632
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:45,971
Man, my first mission out in the field
and I got nothing.

633
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,483
Okay, in the academy

634
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,645
they told us to start
from the beginning.

635
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:51,745
So what have we got?

636
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,620
- The croissant.
- The croissant. Good.

637
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:57,592
- Is there an echo in here?
- Yeah, and his name is Holden.

638
00:36:57,615 --> 00:36:58,616
Oh, that's harsh.

639
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:01,960
The croissant only had
two bites taken out.

640
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,159
It appeared to be half-eaten.

641
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:07,226
It broke up on impact, yes.

642
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,501
After breaking into the museum,
Big Baby used mirrors

643
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,031
to bypass
the motion detectors.

644
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:17,274
And used GPS spectral analysis
to stay clear of the guards,

645
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,781
which allowed Beauregard
to come right through the door.

646
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,012
Of course.
He was wearing a beret

647
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,281
in an attempt to blend in
with the locals.

648
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,186
So Big Baby had to act fast.

649
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:30,420
He used his laser cutter
to cut the picture out of the frame.

650
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,483
Yeah!

651
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:35,964
So it all comes down
to the painting.

652
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,261
Yes!

653
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:38,926
He's got the what,
when, and where.

654
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,994
But why does he want it?
Mm! Why does he want it?

655
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:44,233
Why does he want it?

656
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,466
- Sir.
- Oui?

657
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:50,342
Did you happen to sketch
the painting that was stolen?

658
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:52,746
You mean the "Mona Larry"?

659
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,216
Actually, that one
was a commission.

660
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:56,775
Ah, from who?

661
00:37:56,807 --> 00:38:00,380
A very strange man
with a very large baby.

662
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,413
- A large baby?
- He wanted me

663
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,290
to make the copy,
but to change the faces.

664
00:38:05,316 --> 00:38:06,488
Wait.

665
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,532
I'll show you.

666
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:13,831
Ah, here it is.

667
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:16,338
Yeah. Can you remember
anything else?

668
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,705
He said to make
the picture work,

669
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,971
they needed berets.

670
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:23,171
Bingo.

671
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,146
Ha! Thank you.

672
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,046
What's up, dude?
Find something?

673
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:30,143
Maybe. Pull up the specs
on that beret we scanned.

674
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,020
The labels were all removed,

675
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:38,493
but chemical analysis suggests
the fibers originated in Vietnam.

676
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:41,053
So we need to find that vendor
who was selling those berets.

677
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:43,725
Good. I want to nail him
for crimes of fashion.

678
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:46,360
I'm already tracking
his movements.

679
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:49,269
He's taking a break
at Big Daddy Burgers.

680
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:53,037
Beret, monsieur? Non?
Bonjour.

681
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,600
A French beret?

682
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:58,739
Sir, did you sell this beret?

683
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,544
- Oui, I did.
- Do you remember who bought it?

684
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,073
Oh, how could I forget?

685
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:05,383
A crazy big man and a big baby
who smelled like hamburgers.

686
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,184
Good. Do you remember
which direction they came from?

687
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:09,953
Oui. From right under
the Tour d'Eiffel itself.

688
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,153
Good.
Gabi, contact Charlie.

689
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,753
Have him grab his dad
and the police

690
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:15,889
and get them over to Eiffel Tower
right away.

691
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,297
Let's go, team.

692
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,164
Good. Come on.

693
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:24,799
Hamburgers!
Get your hamburger right here!

694
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,900
Throwing the hamburgers on
right now.

695
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,501
The painting.

696
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:32,207
Big Baby,
the painting we stole

697
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:36,116
is ready for the artist
to put our faces on.

698
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:38,780
My portrait.

699
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:42,780
Taking over the world
just wouldn't be the same without it.

700
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:46,090
In a few minutes, we'll rendezvous
with the helicopter

701
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,994
at the top of the Eiffel Tower.

702
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:51,727
And then to our private jet
to fly to our next destination.

703
00:39:51,756 --> 00:39:53,599
And what's my name?

704
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:56,468
O Magnificent One.

705
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:57,802
Very good.

706
00:39:57,828 --> 00:39:59,967
Today I'm just a baby,

707
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:04,605
but tomorrow
everyone will look up to me.

708
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,948
Oh, no.
That Baby Squad is coming.

709
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,118
Stop them.

710
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,958
Big Baby
is making a big break for it.

711
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,123
Stop them.

712
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,291
Stop them.

713
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:39,877
Monsieur Holden, you will not believe
what I have just discovered.

714
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:42,316
- I have cracked the case.
- Oh, that's great.

715
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:44,876
But right now can you help us out
with the bionic busboy over here?

716
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:47,549
Not yet. This is fun.

717
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,524
Arrest him.

718
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:52,494
- Where is Big Baby?
- Escaping behind you.

719
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:57,459
Au revoir, Baby Squad.

720
00:40:57,488 --> 00:40:59,900
Oh, man.
The Burgers got away again.

721
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,803
It doesn't matter.
We have the culprit.

722
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:07,634
He tried to stop you.
His fingerprints are on the tableau.

723
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:10,373
This case, she has been
shut and open.

724
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,278
You mean open and shut.

725
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,977
You are mistaken,
peanut breath.

726
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:17,508
Oil suis-je?
How did I get here?

727
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,283
The question is,
where are you going?

728
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,884
The answer-- prison.

729
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,589
Hey, rookie, not bad
for your first mission.

730
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:30,098
Yeah, you guys
weren't so bad yourselves.

731
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:34,000
All right. Good job.

732
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:37,471
- Now can we finally go shopping?
- Two down, one to go.

733
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,808
Well, we solved the crime
at the Louvre

734
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,039
and recovered
the stolen painting.

735
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:46,674
Unfortunately, the Burger boys
got away again.

736
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,945
With the scepter and the crown.

737
00:41:48,973 --> 00:41:51,010
We only got two days left
to get that crown back

738
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,317
or it's going to be a disaster
for the queen of England.

739
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:57,680
I have a feeling Big Baby is up to
something much bigger than all this.

740
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,022


741
00:42:04,588 --> 00:42:07,194
Shh.
Pay attention to the mission

742
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,261
and not your stomach.

743
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:14,472
Shh.

744
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,712
Grab an end and be careful.

745
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,717
Steady. Steady.

746
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:24,476
Ohh.

747
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:26,510
No, don't touch that.

748
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,457
You're so hungry under hypnosis.

749
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:49,771
Mamma mia!

750
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,247
The pizza di tutte pizze,
she's gone.

751
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,518
Trying to use
the NSA satellites

752
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,184
to find where Big Baby
hid the jewels.

753
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:09,654
NASA found some strange activities
in the vicinity of Centauri Alpha.

754
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,497
I'm using the satellite
to track hamburger grease

755
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,332
in the world's sewer systems.

756
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:18,238
I found deposits in Pisa, Italy.

757
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:22,507
Something's strange
about the rings around Saturn.

758
00:43:22,533 --> 00:43:24,103
Those aren't rings.

759
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,842
That's where you spit up
on the blocks last week.

760
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,372
Oops. My bad.

761
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:32,979
Oh, listen, why don't you show them
the artwork, okay? Gracias.

762
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:36,647
Hmm.

763
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,321
What are my little darlings
doing now, hmm?

764
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,992
I'm sure it's something unusual,

765
00:43:44,021 --> 00:43:46,023
especially for babies.

766
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:47,626
Mm-hmm.

767
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:51,499
You know, the Cosmonauter
can also be used

768
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:54,236
to search and contact
alien life.

769
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:57,871
Uh-oh, here comes trouble.

770
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:02,339
- Ugh, Mrs. Garcia.
- Time to foil Mrs. Garcia.

771
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,049
- ' Oh!

772
00:44:07,077 --> 00:44:08,647
The blocks
got knocked down.

773
00:44:08,679 --> 00:44:11,159
Oh, no, no, no.

774
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:14,424
Mrs. Garcia didn't mean
to knock over your blocks.

775
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,727
- Did you?
- No, no, no.

776
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:19,132
Listen, I came over here
and I saw something amazing.

777
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,965
- I'm sure you did.

778
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,800
No, I didn't do nothing.
I was looking-

779
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:26,535
- Oh, isn't it snack time?

780
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,770
It is snack time.

781
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,972
- Crazy, I know.
- No wonder they're crying.

782
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,038
No snacks, right?
Whew.

783
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,913
Let's move.

784
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:41,620
- Good morning, Uncle Bob.
- Morning, team.

785
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:44,251
We've got Pisa, Italy,
on the monitor.

786
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:47,295
Italy needs your help.

787
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:49,923
- What's wrong?
- The pizza di tutte pizze.

788
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:53,730
- The pizza of all pizzas?
- That's one sweet pizza.

789
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,828
My father Antonio Angelotti,

790
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,068
the greatest pizza chef
in all of Italy, created it.

791
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:01,736
It was his life's work.
And now it has been stolen.

792
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:04,974
It was created for the prime minister's
birthday celebration tomorrow.

793
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:09,041
Yes. You must find it before then
or my father's reputation is ruined.

794
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:12,418
Don't worry, Tony.
We're on the case.

795
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:15,947
Okay, team, get ready.
We're on mission to Italy.

796
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:19,222
A new Big Daddy Burger restaurant
opened in Pisa, too.

797
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,422
Smells like a Big Baby connection.

798
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:25,491
This is the case
of the Leaning Tower of Pizza.

799
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:27,798
Get it?

800
00:45:27,825 --> 00:45:29,998
- Pisa, pizza.
- Not funny, dude.

801
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,530
- Is this on?
- Oh, grow up.

802
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,635
Kylie, you'll be taking Alfred
and Gabi on the away team.

803
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:38,647
Skip, Jordan, Holden, you'll be
manning the command center.

804
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:47,846
Energy fluctuation stabilized.

805
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:51,621
Vortex transmission positive.

806
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:53,855
Stand by
to be transported directly

807
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:56,490
into the lobby
of the Tower of Pisa.

808
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,269
Italy, here we come.

809
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:17,151
A taxicab? Again?

810
00:46:17,174 --> 00:46:18,915
This is getting ridiculous.

811
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,616
Shh.
Here comes the drive-

812
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,689
Well, hello there.

813
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:27,787
I stopped for five minutes
for a cappuccino,

814
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:31,231
and suddenly
my car is full of babies, eh?

815
00:46:33,423 --> 00:46:35,334
He looks familiar. Yes?

816
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,238
Yeah.
Isn't he the same--?

817
00:46:38,262 --> 00:46:40,139
Nah.

818
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:44,169
Do you know a restaurant owned by
Antonio Angelotti-- Pisa Pizza?

819
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,408
Oh, sure I know Pisa Pizza.

820
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,541
I know Antonio Angelotti.

821
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:52,850
But to tell you the truth,
his pizza is not so good.

822
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:55,379
His pepperoni is not fresh.

823
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:59,861
He's been slicing
from the same pepperoni for 20 years.

824
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:01,760
Ooh, that is old.

825
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:04,823
All in all, we still need
to get to the Pisa Pizza.

826
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:06,732
Well, we could go to Rome, though,
you know.

827
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:09,829
You see, the Colosseum,
it bring you to tears.

828
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:13,774
It's so beautiful.
It's four hours away by cab, that's all.

829
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:15,708
Four hours in a cab?

830
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:17,541
He's trying to keep us
from getting there.

831
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:21,675
Thank you for the suggestion, sir,
but to Pisa Pizza, please.

832
00:47:21,705 --> 00:47:23,275
Okay, sure. I go.

833
00:47:23,307 --> 00:47:27,449
You are little smarty-pants babies.
That's where we're gonna go.

834
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:30,648
Ciao, bella.

835
00:47:31,648 --> 00:47:34,891
-- I'm Sophia Loren.

836
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:36,795
- Pisa!
- Buongiorno!

837
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:39,695
Yay!

838
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:47,869
I love you.

839
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:50,811
It's quite the smooth drive,

840
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:54,941
considering that I'm the driver.

841
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:58,385
Okay, there it is-- Pisa Pizza.

842
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:02,879
But very upset, he,
because of the stolen giant pizza.

843
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:05,484
There's thieves among us, eh?

844
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:07,692


845
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:10,456
Finally we're here.

846
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,626
Now let's go investigate
the stolen pizza.

847
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,099
Sounds like a baby crying.

848
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,606
Signore Angelotti?

849
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:32,951
Hi. I'm Kylie Bobbins from the CCC--
Culinary Crisis Center.

850
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:36,150
In all of Italy,
I was the chef they chose

851
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:38,921
to make the prime minister's
birthday pizza,

852
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,951
and now

853
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,123
I'm a disgrace!

854
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:45,565
I spit on myself.

855
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:48,331
No, no, no, no. Don't do that.
We're gonna get it back for you.

856
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:49,632
You will?

857
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:52,140
- Yes. That's what we're here for.
- Ah.

858
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:03,548
My Papa.
he's very emotional.

859
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:05,075
No need for apologies.

860
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:08,715
May I say
you are working that hat?

861
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:10,691
Tell us about the stolen pizza.

862
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:14,423
Not a pizza-- a master pizza.
It was priceless.

863
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:17,330
Yeah, a lot of dough, right?
Get it?

864
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:20,528
It loses something
in translation.

865
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,729
Okay, kids, let's get to work.

866
00:49:25,228 --> 00:49:27,538
The clues are the key.

867
00:49:28,532 --> 00:49:30,705
Find ones
the grown-ups don't see.

868
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,476
Check out my new wheels.

869
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,149
I got something.

870
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:46,058
Looks like pepperoni.

871
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:52,167
Yes, it's a pepperoni.

872
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:53,964
Seriously, folks,
we're in a pizza shop

873
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,629
and this is the best clue
we can find?

874
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,900
Come on, what does that say
about us as detectives?

875
00:49:57,928 --> 00:49:59,100
That we're hungry?

876
00:50:04,468 --> 00:50:05,469
Believe it or not,

877
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,972
there was actually clues
on the clues you sent us.

878
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,747
Put it on the screen, Skip.

879
00:50:10,774 --> 00:50:12,583
Who took a nap
and made you president?

880
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:15,419
The spectrum analysis indicates

881
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:19,257
large traces of mucosa rhinitis
on the pepperoni slices.

882
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:20,556
Mucosa what?

883
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:22,222
- Snot.
- Eww.

884
00:50:22,252 --> 00:50:25,062
It was just enough to render
a positive DNA match.

885
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,591
Okay, here's how I see it.

886
00:50:27,624 --> 00:50:29,968
Using an old-world
pizza cutter,

887
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:33,873
they broke in,
snuck by Antonio Angelotti...

888
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:35,433
-- Shh.

889
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:37,911
...and snagged
the prime minister's pizza.

890
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:42,349
The pepper in the pepperoni
caused an allergic reaction.

891
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:46,686
Ah-choo!

892
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:49,748
Without waking
Mr. Angelotti,

893
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,488
who was guarding the pizza,
they made their getaway.

894
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:53,961
Hold it.

895
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:55,759
You are wrong, wrong, wrong.

896
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:58,289
It did so not happen like that.

897
00:50:58,321 --> 00:51:01,359
- Says who?
- This is what really happened.

898
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,837
Using a high-tech
laser pizza cutter-

899
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,864
a Swiss-made Urich 3000,
by the way--

900
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,604
they breached
the perimeter,

901
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:11,203
then bypassed the high-tech
security system-

902
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:13,441
the Angelotti 350--

903
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,108
and grabbed the pizza.

904
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:18,142
Pepper and pepperoni-
allergic reaction.

905
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:21,679
It was really Beauregard
that sneezed, not Big Baby.

906
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:23,713
Hold it. Totally wrong.

907
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,522
It was the Big Baby
who sneezed.

908
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:28,325
What are you drinking in that bottle?
It was Beauregard.

909
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:30,797
- Big Baby.
- You're a big baby.

910
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:34,394
Hold on, guys. Who cares
whose snot is on the pizza?

911
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,404
We've only got two hours
to find it

912
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:39,305
or the reputation
of Angelotti is finished.

913
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:48,041
It's raining pepperoni.

914
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:50,278
If we keep following
the trail of pepperonis,

915
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,344
it will lead us
to the stolen pizza.

916
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:55,284
There's cheese on it.

917
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:56,985
Gross.

918
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:59,186
There's another...

919
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:00,957
and another and--

920
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:02,930
oh, wait.
That's from a pigeon.

921
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:06,397
Great.
The pepperoni ends here.

922
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:07,993
- We hit a dead end.
- Hey, guys.

923
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:11,096
- I found it. I found it.
- Another clue?

924
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,938
No, the perfect outfit,
two shops down.

925
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:16,740
-- Maybe this guy knows something.

926
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:18,939
- Excuse me, sir.
- Oh, please,

927
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:21,575
this is a power station,
not a tourist attraction.

928
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:23,710
You must take the bambinos
away pronto.

929
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,648
Oh, no,
I just want to know

930
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,451
if you've noticed
anything unusual lately.

931
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,253
Oh, we've got big problems.

932
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,124
The electricity-- she's not going
where she's supposed to.

933
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,595
What do you mean?

934
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,962
Everybody in town--
they're having blackouts.

935
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,263
- Somebody's stealing our power...

936
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:41,132
...to run something big.

937
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,104
-- Oh, we got so many problems.

938
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:44,935
Luigi, I tell you,
you put that down!

939
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:50,573
So why is Big Baby
stealing electricity, and how?

940
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:54,181
I don't know why,
but I think I know how.

941
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,947
Oh, yes.

942
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:58,953
They're following my plan.

943
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:01,649
Somebody is using
this power cord.

944
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:11,091
Dad, you're being childish.

945
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:12,828
Wheel

946
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:16,635
Oh, sparkles.

947
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,470
This is so unbelievably shiny.

948
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:20,839
All right, Dad.

949
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:24,243
The scepter is not a toy.

950
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:26,508
We need it to focus the ray.

951
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,743
But I like it.

952
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,513
Grown-ups.

953
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,645
We follow the cord.

954
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:34,747
And we find
the evil pizza thieves.

955
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:37,554
It leads
all the way to the tower.

956
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:40,687
This cord is longer
than a million plates of spaghetti.

957
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,995
Can't we take the escalator?

958
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,398
They didn't have escalators
when the tower was built.

959
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:49,336
We have to climb up
all 296 steps.

960
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,999
296? Man, that's crazy.

961
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:53,837
I'm glad I didn't wear heels.

962
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:56,776
Are we there yet?
Are we there yet?

963
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,441
Alfred, you're driving
us both crazy.

964
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:03,280
No wonder your mom
hates long drives.

965
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:04,785
So are they there yet?

966
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:06,845
Holden, stop asking me that.

967
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:13,188
When I give the signal,
power up.

968
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:15,321
Yes, when you give me
the signal.

969
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:18,026
At last, we found you!

970
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,658
Well, well, well,

971
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:23,102
if it isn't the Baby Squad
and the babysitter.

972
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,163
Too late, as usual.

973
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:26,697
Now!

974
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,911
Why did you disintegrate
the prime minister's pizza?

975
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,787
Disintegrate?
Look again, closer.

976
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:50,320
-- You shrunk it?

977
00:54:50,353 --> 00:54:51,798
Tell them, Father.

978
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:53,630
The genius that is Big Baby

979
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:56,297
condensed the molecules
of the pizza,

980
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:59,830
thereby miniaturizing
its atomic structure.

981
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:02,207
Right, so you shrunk
the pizza.

982
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:03,734
Okay, fine.

983
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:05,371
I shrank the pizza.

984
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:08,110
- But why?
- Because if I can make it smaller,

985
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,175
I can also make it bigger.

986
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:16,251
Get back!

987
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,257
- Now that's a pizza.

988
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:23,389
My prototype is a success.

989
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,663
Ready to move
to my master plan.

990
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:29,728
You're actually moving on to jail.
And here comes your ride.

991
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,739
Perhaps not.

992
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:34,105
- Transport.
- There they are.

993
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:36,041
They stole my pizza!

994
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:37,909
Sorry, we've got to fly.

995
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:40,107
Dad?

996
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:41,809
- Ciao, Baby Squad.
- Oh.

997
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,875
They're getting away again?

998
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:50,090
But look what they left behind.

999
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:57,390
You found my pizza.
But it's a bigger pizza.

1000
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:00,299
It's enough for the prime minister
and the whole city.

1001
00:56:00,323 --> 00:56:03,896
Well, at least we got
the scepter and the pizza.

1002
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:06,168
- Now we can shop.
- Yeah.

1003
00:56:08,098 --> 00:56:10,100
Ah, pizza.

1004
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,135
Grazie.

1005
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:15,172
Ancora? Grazie.

1006
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,014
Ah, grazie.

1007
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:24,380
Now that's
a pizza di tutte le pizze!

1008
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,954
Good work, Baby Squad.

1009
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:31,465
We've recovered
two of the crown jewels.

1010
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:34,594
We just need to find the queen's crown
to make her Jubilee in time.

1011
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:50,847
The Glockenspiel!
Polizei! Polizei!

1012
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:53,514
The Glockenspiel has been stolen!
Come, come!

1013
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:58,826
- Argh! They defaced the Glockenspiel!
- Polizei!

1014
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:15,168
Those babies,
always up to something.

1015
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:16,506
Here we go.

1016
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:18,945
Time to test the upgrades
to my Cosmonauter.

1017
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:23,878
What's it do?

1018
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:26,285
Using two screens,
I can search

1019
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:28,687
for the queen's jewels
and alien life forms.

1020
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:30,156
Does it work?

1021
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,659
Let's find out.

1022
00:57:34,217 --> 00:57:36,823
Imagine I want to send aliens
a friendly message

1023
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:38,799
and find the jewels.

1024
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:41,268
I got a bad feeling about this.

1025
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,861
And behold!

1026
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,707
Where did my cup go?

1027
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:55,072
Don't worry.
Mrs. Garcia is my problem.

1028
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:03,415
The Glockenspiel is kaput!

1029
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:05,858
This is a crime that has struck

1030
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:08,419
at the very heart of Germans
everywhere.

1031
00:58:08,451 --> 00:58:11,261
Hans, we understand completely
and we're on it.

1032
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:13,198
Bobbins out.

1033
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:14,998
- Okay, listen up.

1034
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:18,597
I've got tofu waffles
and soy milk.

1035
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:20,505
Everybody eat up.

1036
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,066
Okay, team.

1037
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:24,704
- Man, good stuff.
- Really?

1038
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:28,204
That was Hans Bezelug,
the son of Germany's top police chief.

1039
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:30,047
It looks like we're going
to Munich, Germany,

1040
00:58:30,073 --> 00:58:33,282
where one of the country's most
precious symbols-- the Glockenspiel--

1041
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:35,448
has been defaced and brought
to a complete standstill.

1042
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:38,118
That's awful.
The Glockenspiel

1043
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,684
is one of the most beautiful
and intricate clocks ever made.

1044
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:42,754
Fortunately, we do have
a suspect this time.

1045
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:50,097
That is just so wrong.

1046
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:52,265
Somebody needs a time-out.

1047
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:54,366
Skip and Jordan,
you're on the away team.

1048
00:58:54,397 --> 00:58:57,241
Alfred, Gabi, and Kylie
will be backing you up from here.

1049
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:58,871
And, Holden-

1050
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:01,946
Where is Holden?

1051
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,342
How do I look?

1052
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:08,584
Like Hansel in search of Gretel.

1053
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:18,330
Haven't you guys ever heard
the term "undercover"?

1054
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:20,891
You should be
under the covers.

1055
00:59:20,924 --> 00:59:22,267
Guess what.

1056
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:25,501
A new Big Daddy Burgers
has opened in Munich.

1057
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:27,007
I smell a Big Baby.

1058
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,168
Yeah.

1059
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:30,302
Activating vortex.

1060
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:33,880
Good luck, team.
And remember...

1061
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:37,350
mein hiinden
ist nicht stubenrein.

1062
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:39,819
Your dog is not housebroken?

1063
00:59:42,712 --> 00:59:45,192
Uh, maybe that didn't
come out right.

1064
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:48,792
Oh, and you
watch over him, okay?

1065
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:51,389
Don't worry, I'll take good care
of the babies.

1066
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,868
I think she's saying the babies
should be looking after you.

1067
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:58,304
Energy field at full power.

1068
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:03,367
Normal activation 97, 93,

1069
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:05,675
99%.

1070
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:12,277
Wheel

1071
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:21,990
- Whoa.
- I can't see. I can't see.

1072
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:23,998
Let me get this.
There we go.

1073
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,593
Whew, looks like there's still
a few kinks in the Z-35 Vortex.

1074
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:34,135
Uh, sir?

1075
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,543
You should not sneak up
on anybody like that.

1076
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:41,412
Did you sneak
into the car anyways?

1077
01:00:42,405 --> 01:00:45,750
Finally, a tourist
with a sense of style.

1078
01:00:45,775 --> 01:00:47,516
You are a cool dude, man.

1079
01:00:47,543 --> 01:00:49,853
See? I told you I was cool.

1080
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:51,790
Dream on, dude.

1081
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,623
Such smart-looking babies, eh?

1082
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:56,722
You know, I had a lot of
smart people in the cab.

1083
01:00:56,753 --> 01:00:59,495
Albert Einstein
drove in this cab.

1084
01:00:59,522 --> 01:01:01,729
This is when he was nothing.
He was just Albert.

1085
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:03,829
And I couldn't roll up
the windows.

1086
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:07,171
The wind, when we were driving,
made his hair all crazy.

1087
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:08,766
That's-- that's great.

1088
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:12,109
Can you take us to
the Big Daddy Burgers restaurant?

1089
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:15,844
Oh, sure, I could take you
to Big Daddy Burgers.

1090
01:01:15,872 --> 01:01:20,685
If you like burgers that taste like
old socks, that's the place.

1091
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:24,057
Look at that guy.

1092
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,027
- Haven't we seen him before?
- Who, me?

1093
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:28,859
Don't we know you
from somewhere?

1094
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:32,765
Let's not talk about me.
I'll take you on a tour of Munich, ja?

1095
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,370
Hans Bezelug,
chief of police.

1096
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,039
Holden Hammer-smith,
with the World Clock Institute.

1097
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,810
These are members from our
Junior Timekeepers League.

1098
01:02:21,838 --> 01:02:23,647
Interesting.

1099
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:26,779
Makes about as much sense
as your outfit.

1100
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:29,786
What do you have for us so far?

1101
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:32,759
Only that we've been unable
to reset the Glockenspiel.

1102
01:02:32,782 --> 01:02:35,353
And that by leaving
this statue behind,

1103
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:38,388
the thief is daring us
to catch him!

1104
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,401
This guy's got anger issues.

1105
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,993
He taunts us!

1106
01:02:42,024 --> 01:02:44,129
He needs to chill out.

1107
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:49,641
Any other clues
from the crime scene?

1108
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:53,135
Just this stone debris
from where the perpetrator

1109
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:55,775
- entered the clock tower.
- Look at this stuff, guys.

1110
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:59,143
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

1111
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:03,551
What do we have here?
Okay, team, listen up.

1112
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:05,650
Run a digital
spectrum analysis.

1113
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:07,718
Skip, see what else
you can find.

1114
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:09,491
I'm on it.

1115
01:03:21,597 --> 01:03:23,099
Got something.

1116
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,907
Oh, a ticket.

1117
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:26,845
Oh, darn, it's in German.

1118
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:28,712
Well, we are in Germany.

1119
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:31,082
Guys, I found something.

1120
01:03:31,107 --> 01:03:32,313
Let me get it.

1121
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:34,184
- Ugh!

1122
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:36,554
- Oh.
- Let me help you.

1123
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:38,616
- Here.
- I could have gotten it.

1124
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,855
- Good work.

1125
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:45,128
Find anything unusual,
besides your hat?

1126
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:47,600
Did it take you all day
to think of that one?

1127
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:49,125
Yeah. Pretty much.

1128
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:51,229
I'm uploading the clues now.

1129
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:56,201
Well, it's definitely a tool,

1130
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:59,679
but not the kind that any modern
nut or bolt would fit.

1131
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:02,546
Great. We now know what they used,
but the question is why.

1132
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:04,882
Why would Big Baby
sabotage the Glockenspiel?

1133
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:08,480
I don't know why, but now we know
where he's been.

1134
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:11,981
Snickety-snack. A ticket stub.
Maybe they went to a movie.

1135
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,927
This is a ticket for the tour
of Castle Neuschwanstein.

1136
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:17,192
Pack your bags.
We're heading to Bavaria.

1137
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:31,242
Walt Disney was so impressed
with the architecture,

1138
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:34,714
he modeled the Sleeping Beauty
castle on it.

1139
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:39,550
Help yourselves to a Red Delicious
poisoned apple...

1140
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,818
...if you dare.

1141
01:04:51,087 --> 01:04:54,432
All right, guys,
we know Big Baby's here.

1142
01:04:54,457 --> 01:04:56,164
We just have to find out why.

1143
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:58,934
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

1144
01:04:58,961 --> 01:05:00,838
Holden, watch out.

1145
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,979
Checking heat signature levels.

1146
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:17,514
Collecting rocks
and mortar samples.

1147
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:25,555
Ultraviolet scan.

1148
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:29,665
Holden here.

1149
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,899
Transmitting clues
from Castle Neus--

1150
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,841
Neuschwenber-- Neus--
the castle.

1151
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:36,673
Any data
from the crime scene?

1152
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,337
Okay, this is how the computer
breaks it down.

1153
01:05:38,367 --> 01:05:40,973
Someone breached internal security
through the ventilation shaft.

1154
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:43,643
He used the wrench that you found
at Big Daddy Burgers

1155
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:45,778
to remove the clock's
pinion cog.

1156
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:47,913
What's a pinion cog do?

1157
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:51,357
It runs the timing system. So in other
words, it makes the clock smart.

1158
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:54,156
Alfred, maybe your brain needs
a pinion cog.

1159
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:56,026
Oh, that hurt.

1160
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:58,760
We have to get Big Baby fast.
We only have an hour left

1161
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,768
before we have to get the stolen
crown back to the queen.

1162
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,031
What about the clues we just
collected from the castle?

1163
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:06,165
Checking that now.
Gabi, give me a spectrum comparison.

1164
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,067
Bingo.

1165
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:10,702
The stone samples
from the crime scene

1166
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:13,009
match the same ones
Jordan just found at the castle.

1167
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:16,505
That means whatever we're looking
for is right under our feet.

1168
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,596
- That's a no-no.
- Ouch.

1169
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,139
All right, the clock
is ticking, people.

1170
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:43,268
Somewhere in this place
there's a secret passage.

1171
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:44,869
We're gonna have to
find it quick

1172
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,972
or there's gonna be
one very unhappy queen.

1173
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,915
I'm picking up something.

1174
01:06:52,141 --> 01:06:54,246
This section is hollow.

1175
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:56,552
Okay, they taught this
at the academy.

1176
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:59,753
All secret hatches
must be activated

1177
01:06:59,782 --> 01:07:01,557
by a force-to-pressure ratio

1178
01:07:01,584 --> 01:07:06,294
mounted exactly
two feet from the base.

1179
01:07:06,322 --> 01:07:08,131
It's right here.

1180
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:12,196
Oh.

1181
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:13,866
Perfect.

1182
01:07:13,896 --> 01:07:16,035
Don't give up hope, Holden.

1183
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:19,012
Something will
pop up soon.

1184
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,879
Now we're never gonna get the crown
back to the queen.

1185
01:07:21,904 --> 01:07:22,905
Man!

1186
01:07:24,673 --> 01:07:27,677
- What's happening?
- Whatever it is, it's major.

1187
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:35,826
Whoa, you guys
got to see this.

1188
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:49,242
You're a little late to stop me.

1189
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:50,903
What is that thing?

1190
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:54,278
Say hello to my little friend.

1191
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:56,510
While you've been playing
with blocks,

1192
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:58,519
I've been building this.

1193
01:08:00,109 --> 01:08:02,453
Meet the Expander Ray.

1194
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:05,481
Dad, sit down!

1195
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:15,064
- After I finish entering the code...

1196
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:18,368
...l'll step in front,
activate the beam,

1197
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:20,067
and in seconds

1198
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:23,543
grow to over 100 times my size!

1199
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,170
That's one big baby.

1200
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:26,874
That's one big diaper.

1201
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:29,542
Whoa, what did you do
to your dad?

1202
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:31,677
A little too much hypnosis.

1203
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,851
Not to worry.
Soon I won't need hypnosis,

1204
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:42,658
'cause he too will answer
to the new and improved

1205
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:43,891
Bigger Baby!

1206
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:46,229
He is one bad little boy.

1207
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:48,098
All right, we can't let him
get away with this.

1208
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:51,662
That's it. I'll wake up Beauregard
from his trance.

1209
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:52,968
And I'll distract Big Baby.

1210
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:55,271
And I'll shut down
the Expander Ray.

1211
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,299
All right, Baby Squad on three.

1212
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,040
One, two, three.

1213
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:02,072
- Baby Squad!
- All right, let's go, guys.

1214
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:08,748
Hey, Beauregard.

1215
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:09,881
Wake up.

1216
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:18,560
Nein!

1217
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,938
Okay, burger man,
repeat after me.

1218
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:30,175
Let go of my joust.

1219
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,976
- Are you sure?
- Ja!

1220
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:38,210
Yes!

1221
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,186
I am in control.

1222
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:41,552
I am not in control.

1223
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:43,955
This isn't going to be easy.

1224
01:09:43,979 --> 01:09:47,426
So, Big Baby,
why the queen's crown?

1225
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:51,761
It's a unique combination of rare
gold, silver, and diamonds.

1226
01:09:51,787 --> 01:09:55,291
It makes it
the perfect power source.

1227
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:58,263
Why do you want to be so big?

1228
01:09:58,294 --> 01:09:59,773
You're a grown-up.

1229
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:02,241
You don't know what it's like
to be a baby.

1230
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:05,245
"Take a nap! Go to bed!
Eat your vegetables!"

1231
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:07,679
Have you ever tried
mashed broccoli?

1232
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,148
I know what he means.

1233
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:12,516
Now I'm going to be
the size of 100 adults.

1234
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:17,852
You're too late, Baby Squad.

1235
01:10:19,982 --> 01:10:22,929
Look out, world.
Here comes Bigger Baby!

1236
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:25,728
Junior, what do you think
you're doing?

1237
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:28,758
This is not the type of young man
I wanted you to be.

1238
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:31,169
Want to be a good boy
or a naughty boy?

1239
01:10:31,193 --> 01:10:33,332
A naughty boy

1240
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:40,243
- I did it!
- Touchdown!

1241
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,277
Kids, come here, quick.
Cover your eyes. Hurry.

1242
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:49,186
- Cover them.

1243
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:55,691
Hey! Hey!

1244
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:59,791
Hey!
Hey!

1245
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:02,462
Big Baby's pocket-sized.

1246
01:11:02,491 --> 01:11:05,836
BB, you're tiny.

1247
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:08,205
Aww,
he's kind of cute now.

1248
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:11,566
I don't want to be cute.

1249
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:13,740
Officers, here's your man.

1250
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:16,613
I mean, your Big Baby.

1251
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:20,086
I mean, the Big Baby
who is now a small baby.

1252
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:23,352
I don't think we have
a prison cell this size.

1253
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:25,188
Perhaps a shoebox?

1254
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:27,922
Mark my words, Baby Squad.

1255
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:29,725
I'll be back!

1256
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:32,926
And when I am, you'll regret it.

1257
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:35,902
Hey, I'm kind of hungry.
Can we stop for a burger?

1258
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:39,701
Auf wiedersehen, Baby Squad.

1259
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:49,141
Come on, team.
Put your glasses on.

1260
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:54,148
-- We need emergency Z-35 activation.

1261
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:56,850
Take us to Buckingham Palace.
Get it right this time.

1262
01:11:56,879 --> 01:11:58,688
I've got your position
triangulated.

1263
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:00,751
We'll meet you there.
Stand by.

1264
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:02,091
The crown.

1265
01:12:04,019 --> 01:12:06,021
Grab hands.
Here we go.

1266
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:16,876
Ahh!

1267
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:29,549
I think this is for you,
Your Highness.

1268
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:30,750
Indeed.

1269
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:37,095
It's fit for a queen.

1270
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:51,272
- Bye. Bye.
- Ta-ta.

1271
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,439
- Bye.
- We did it!

1272
01:12:53,469 --> 01:12:55,210
Good-bye,
Your Royal Highness.

1273
01:13:05,647 --> 01:13:09,254
We received a tip that somebody smarter
and more devious than Big Baby

1274
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:11,389
might be after
the Expander Ray techno-

1275
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:16,063
Where is it?
Where is it?

1276
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:19,835
The Expander Ray,
it's gone!

1277
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:22,274
We must alert Interpol.

1278
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:32,852
I agree with you, Inspector.

1279
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:35,879
I am as smart as Big Baby

1280
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:38,755
and more devious
than Big Baby.

1281
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:41,620
They think I'm a cabdriver.

1282
01:13:41,650 --> 01:13:44,563
By the time they find out
I'm the great Moriarty,

1283
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:46,896
I will have played them
like a piano.

1284
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:49,562
They don't know
who they're dealing with.

1285
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,593
I know..

1286
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:53,629
Me.

1287
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:03,174
Job well done, Bob.

1288
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:06,118
You're now unofficially official.
Haiger out.

1289
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:16,693
I love you, Mom.
I love you, Dad.

1290
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:18,129
Aww.

1291
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:20,463
And we love our little
spy baby

1292
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:22,935
and the rest
of the Baby Squad, too.

1293
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:26,902
we're official.

1294
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:29,842
- Yay!

1295
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:32,539
- That's what I'm talking about.
- We are the Baby Squad.

1296
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:54,961
? Feeling good right now ?

1297
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,867
? Take a look right now ?

1298
01:14:56,892 --> 01:14:59,338
? Feeling good right now ?

1299
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:01,238
? Take a look right now ?

1300
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:03,300
? Once I was a little shy ?

1301
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,209
? But now I'm gonna
catch your eye ?

1302
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,771
? Oh, yeah, yeah ?

1303
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:11,975
? Don't you know
I've got to show ?

1304
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:14,749
? Just what I've been
keeping inside? ?

1305
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:16,881
? Feeling good now, baby ?

1306
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:18,858
? Take a look now, baby ?

1307
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:20,690
? I know it takes a little while ?

1308
01:15:20,716 --> 01:15:22,457
? But now I see your smile ?

1309
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:24,930
- .' I'm gonna let it shine .'
- .' Feeling good right now .'

1310
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:26,830
- .' I've really got to shine .'
- .' Take a look right now .'

1311
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,096
- .' I'm gonna let it shine .'
- .' Feeling good right now .'

1312
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:31,161
- .' I'm really gonna shine .'
- .' Take a look right now .'

1313
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:33,264
- .' I'm gonna let it shine, shine .'
- .' Feeling good right now .'

1314
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:36,037
- .' Shine, shine, yeah .'
- .' Take a look right now .'

1315
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:38,408
? Feeling good right now... ?

1316
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:43,636
- We got a bogey in the air.

1317
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:45,303
Switching to the Garcia cam.

1318
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:47,746
Recon robot is active.

1319
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:51,512
Activating beam
inside robot dog.

1320
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,952
Bogey has eyes
on our robot alarm.

1321
01:16:53,976 --> 01:16:57,219
Switching to mobile
surveillance code for recon.

1322
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:06,194
Setting velocity beam.

1323
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:09,225
Stand by
for level-four distraction.

1324
01:17:10,225 --> 01:17:12,171
-- Argh!

1325
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,667
Take it up to level nine.

1326
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:18,575
Ahh!

1327
01:17:21,003 --> 01:17:24,416
Distraction contained. Yes!

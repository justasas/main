1
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:51,860
Five hundred dollars
for the death of Chen Kuo-Wei

2
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,680
Friend

3
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,190
Please stop, you're wasting your energy

4
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,190
Are you Chen Kuo-Wei with
Quadruple Door Heavy Fists style?

5
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,700
Yes, who are you?

6
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,900
I'm Yen Tieh-hsin

7
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,640
So you're the Hades Kick

8
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,210
The kick which has never been beaten?

9
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,950
You're right

10
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,890
Someone paid me to kill you

11
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,690
You and I haven't met before
Who wants kill me?

12
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,960
I can pay you double to kill him

13
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,070
You can, but killing is my profession

14
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,940
I have to honor my word

15
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,380
So I must kill you first

16
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,010
You're too arrogant

17
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,140
I've never lost before

18
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,980
You may not win

19
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,950
I don't care what kind of fists you have

20
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,750
I'll break your hands first!

21
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:24,550

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:46,040
Gai Hsien

24
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,140
What's the matter, master?

25
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,720
I'm going out, keep an eye on them.

26
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,740
Yes, sir.

27
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,260
Stop!

28
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,790
We won't practise this today

29
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,610
Let's practise the Fist of Five Styles
which I taught you a few days ago.

30
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,860
Messing up again!

31
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,700
Cheeky!

32
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,630
Pointless!

33
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,530
Start now.

34
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,670
Appearance of Dragon & Tiger

35
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,010
Two Tigers inside,
White Snake signaling.

36
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,290
Panther watching Fire,
White Crane flashing wings.

37
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,680
Hold it!

38
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,850
Your wrists are not firm at all!

39
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:40,620
You can't learn it well, can you?

40
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,530
You mud head!
How dare you fool me?

41
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,710
- Fooling me...
- Not me!

42
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,140
Who's he?

43
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,800
Say it

44
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,640
Fan Dou Hong
(Naughty Panther)

45
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,880
Naughty Panther

46
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,090
Though Mentor Wong is your father

47
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,350
you should never cause trouble here.

48
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,510
All because your kung-fu instruction
makes no sense!

49
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,230
You mean that my instruction is wrong!?

50
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,030
Not all wrong, just a little!

51
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:58,500
Huh? How wrong is it?

52
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,860
Your Panther Watching Fire...

53
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,060
Excuse me!?

54
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,900
You've exposed your body
easy to be attacked

55
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:11,250
Your foot-work is too loose.
Just a sweeping kick

56
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,410
can knock you down!

57
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,540
Just wait!

58
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,210
Shut up! Shut up you turkeys!

59
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,100
Oh! you'd like to test
your teacher's kung fu, would you?

60
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,370
A nice person can fly, can't he?

61
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:48,380
Aha! I can stand almost anything, you bum!
But I've taken enough of this bullshit!

62
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,250
Right! Come on!...

63
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,800
You're wide open.
Do you know that, teacher?

64
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,630
What?

65
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,780
Come to...
Over...

66
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,440
See how good his Horse Stance is?

67
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,420
Pork belly, shut up!

68
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,730
Hah! Look! Hah! Look!
Right foot!

69
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,510
Bastard!

70
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,700
Chick... Chicken Stance!

71
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,360
Naughty Panther
you've taught Hsien a lesson.

72
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,290
We all feel very happy about it

73
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,770
He's too arrogant, I can't stand it

74
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,710
You've vented our anger

75
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,350
That's great...

76
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,390
If so, eat more then...

77
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,070
No, I'm talking about that girl

78
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,700
What a charming face
very pretty indeed.

79
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,030
- How much?
- 30 cents.

80
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,160
Not bad!

81
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:29,160
I'm willing to trade 10 years
for one night with her!

82
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,460
That's easy

83
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,700
I'll make her hug and kiss me

84
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,500
Liar I won't believe you

85
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's take a dinner to bet then.

86
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:39,670
Deal.

87
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:44,050
Be careful!
You'll be sent to jail if she sues you.

88
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:47,160
Just watch out. Don't worry.

89
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,620
Just watch.

90
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,990
He's dead man.

91
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:03,900
This flower is beautiful.
Trust me, try it on.

92
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,300
I'm sorry, sir.

93
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,470
My eyes hurt.

94
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,700
What can I do?

95
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,000
Something got into my eyes

96
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,950
Help me get rid of it, miss. Please, hurry

97
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,950
Not yet.

98
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,880
Yes good.

99
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,220
Thanks.

100
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,670
Snake.

101
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,050
Snake?

102
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,990
Don't be afraid...
I'll kill it. Don't be afraid.

103
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,670
It's great
I'll do the same thing on your sister.

104
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,930
My sister?

105
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,110
How dare you flirt my daughter!

106
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:49,920
I didn't, she hugged me first.

107
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:50,860
Mother

108
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,920
Save it, I saw everything over there.

109
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,460
Who'll flirt an ugly duck like her!

110
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,740
Time to teach you a lesson.

111
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,430
Good, not bad

112
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,300
You're good fighter

113
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,370
Watch out

114
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,050
What a fierce woman

115
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,030
Come on, you guys! Hey!

116
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,430
You're all ruthless bastards!

117
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:59,180
Man won't argue with bitch, excuse me!

118
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,580
What's your game, huh? Stumbling
about like some drunken stooge.

119
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,200
Don't answer back, there!

120
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,100
Hey! Jerry!

121
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:28,720
Come to buy. Ah, see, mister.
Jade antique.

122
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,060
Is it real?

123
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,410
But of course, sir. It's an heirloom, mister.
It's worth the money, sir.

124
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,230
- How much is it?
- Ten bucks, sir.

125
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,710
That's very expensive!

126
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,950
Here.

127
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,890
Just ten cents!
Hey!

128
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,020
Hey! Hear me, sir!

129
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,120
You can't give me this, it wouldn't
buy an old plate, you know that.

130
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,170
I couldn't sell such a
valuable piece for only 10 cents!

131
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,530
If you don't want to sell,
give me my money back.

132
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,520
Hey, give me back my jade.

133
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,940
Mister, you broke my jade!
Pay me back!

134
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,760
Pay? No way!

135
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,200
Father...

136
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,260
- You must pay me.
- No!

137
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,440
What happened?

138
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:22,100
He's broken my jade
but refused to pay, yet beat me.

139
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,560
Beast, get lost!

140
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,970
Who're you calling beast?

141
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,220
I'm calling you!

142
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,170
Pay him immediately.

143
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,960
Pay? I don't know how to pay.

144
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,710
Good, I'm just looking for some way
to vent my anger.

145
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,580
Let me teach you how to pay!

146
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,350
Get up

147
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,080
Wanna kill me?

148
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,950
Oh, wow! You almost kill me!

149
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,680
Wow, my knuckles are barely missed!

150
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,820
This is for you, now get going!

151
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,700
I'm doomed, I'm dead!

152
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,080
Don't be afraid, it's just the dull edge!

153
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,990
Me uncle don't want to kill
you boy, so don't move.

154
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,030
Don't...!
Please spare me...

155
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,360
Not hit yet...

156
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,420
Got you now

157
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,240
Drop dead!

158
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:59,210
Fists have no eyes, knives have no heart!
Sometimes I can hit by mistake!

159
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,310
Watch this!

160
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,810
I chop... chop meat.

161
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,640
I slice... slice a cucumber.

162
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,530
I beat... beat garlic into paste.

163
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:14,120
Nice to see you! I wouldn't know
how good I am if we didn't fight today.

164
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,220
Oh gosh! So do I!

165
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,390
It's been ages, brother.
You still look great.

166
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,970
Your bro is old now.
What a beautiful niece I've got!

167
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,180
Not really. She's still a kid.

168
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,450
Where's Hung?

169
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,010
This naughty boy always goes to play

170
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,910
He's grown up now.

171
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,180
I think you may not recognize him.

172
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,180
This time you visit, stay longer.

173
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,910
Fei Hung, don't go away.

174
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:53,700
Come to greet your auntie and cousin.

175
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,250
Come here, now.

176
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,570
I'm coming...

177
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,200
Shit!

178
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,470
Come to greet your auntie.

179
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,800
Auntie, cousin.

180
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:15,920
Cousin.

181
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,170
Fei Hung

182
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,510
What happened to your neck?

183
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,420
I... I slept without a pillow.

184
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,040
Without a pillow? Let me help you.

185
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,520
No thanks, auntie.

186
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,250
Come on, relax.

187
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,620
Auntie

188
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,690
Mother!

189
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,650
Feel better now?

190
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,900
Yes.

191
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:45,130
Brother, Fei Hung really looks smart.

192
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,890
He's tactful and learn fast.

193
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,290
Brother, you really know how to raise a son.

194
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:57,350
Yes, I'm very strict to him.

195
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,390
No wonder I heard people praising him
as soon as I came here

196
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,790
Really? What did they say?

197
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:08,960
The son of Wong Kei Ying is very smart

198
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,760
He's also a man of justice

199
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,430
I'm very proud of him.

200
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,590
Come here my son, come here.

201
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,000
Sit down

202
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,760
But there're many sex maniacs
in this village.

203
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,780
A bad guy harassed your niece

204
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,010
on the street just now.

205
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,040
He beat me too.

206
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,310
Who dares do this to my relatives?

207
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,690
Can you recognize him
if you see him again?

208
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,300
Sure I can.

209
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,620
Good, let's find him now.

210
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,860
I'll teach him a real good lesson
Hung, come with me.

211
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,220
Uncle

212
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,680
You don't have to go out.

213
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,510
Why?

214
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,220
That guy is here.

215
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,890
Who?

216
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,990
He's your son Wong Fei Hung.

217
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,080
You...

218
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,380
You...

219
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,290
Son-of-bitch...

220
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,580
Kneel down.

221
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:21,960
Father

222
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,040
You bastard, I'm so angry.

223
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,540
Wong Kei Ying

224
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,050
I'm doomed.

225
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,650
Wong Kei Ying

226
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,880
Mentor Li, is someone looking for cure?

227
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,720
I'm looking for your son.

228
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,600
Why?

229
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,370
Your son beat my son irrationally

230
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:06,080
You see the bandages? He hurts so badly.

231
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,170
It's just a waste to heal him

232
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,390
Wong Kei Ying, we want your son?

233
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,820
You beast, I must kill you

234
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,490
No, Dad... no...

235
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,040
Brother, you'll kill him

236
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,730
Yes, because I'm too angry

237
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,710
But they'll think that
you won't have your son tortured

238
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,780
Mentor Li doesn't come to witness
how you punish your son

239
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,350
but to punish him with his own hands

240
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,420
Don't move...

241
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,620
It's all me
I'll let your son beat me back

242
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,720
Take this.

243
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,960
I've given you a chance
It's you who let it go.

244
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,660
You dare say this at this time

245
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,900
Wong Kei Ying, you indulge your son

246
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,330
I'll just abandon him

247
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,360
Just do anything you want

248
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,590
Mentor Li, how about let Hung

249
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,780
stand this mentor's 10 strikes
without any resistance?

250
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,280
He deserves it if he dies

251
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,590
If not, just put it into an end

252
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:30,730
I don't need 10 strikes to kill him

253
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,280
Young Master
I'll take the revenge for you

254
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,950
Mentor Chao
beat him to be as badly as I'm

254
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,500
Top<font color=#FFFF00>Teo</font>.com

255
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:34,910
The Divine Eight, that palm-style
of yours is really something.

256
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,130
Ha! I'm only starting.

257
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,970
How many strikes already?

258
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,950
You want to make me childless?

259
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,700
Stop it

260
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,020
It's already 10 strikes

261
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,050
You said you'll kill me within 3 strikes

262
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,760
Crane Chasing Snake On River technique.

263
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,460
Secret Strike on vital point

264
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,250
I'll fight back if you don't stop

265
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,550
I told you I got style.

266
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,770
Hold it!

267
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,010
My clothes get dirty, take it

268
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,090
You comes for the revenge?

269
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,220
It's me

270
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,630
You hit your master

271
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,530
Young Master, are you alright?

272
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,730
Young master, are you ok?

273
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,030
My baby, are you alright?

274
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,200
Young Master Go to hell

275
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,970
Young Master
I hurt as badly as you now

276
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,640
Wong Kei Ying, you're somebody

277
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,840
but I ain't ordinary person
just wait and see

278
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,690
Let's go!

279
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,020
You watch out!

280
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,620
Take Young Master home, hurry

281
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,890
Do come back

282
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,990
Be careful

283
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,780
Now two of them are badly hurt

284
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:59,150
Are you very proud of yourself?
I'll kill you now

285
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,120
Brother

286
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,780
It's useless
to beat this naughty panther

287
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,820
Let's punish him by practising kung-fu

288
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,320
You really piss me off

289
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,740
From now on, you can't go out

290
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,520
and do 6-hour foot-work!

291
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,580
Don't move

292
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,720
Be careful, this water is hot

293
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:20,300
So, feeling good now?

294
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:29,640
You're trembling, I feel very happy now

295
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,800
So happy...

296
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:43,020
You feel itchy? Let me help you

297
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,730
Stop, don't go too far!

298
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:57,380
I don't, your father asked me
to keep an eye on you

299
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,230
You'll have to stand 2 more hours
if you break one single bowl

300
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:02,840
You deserve it

301
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,600
Master, you come back

302
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,460
Your foot-work is fine

303
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,220
Did he slack off?

304
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:08,070
No, I've always kept my eyes on him.

305
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,710
- Really?
- Yes

306
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,070
Show progress finally

307
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,830
Yes, I'm very tired

308
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,370
Are you really tired?

309
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,650
- But you got a chair
- Yes

310
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,360
What? A chair, let me see

311
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,190
Damn it, a chair

312
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:31,590
You dare cheat me
when I'm punishing you

313
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,800
I really can't do anything about you

314
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,850
I'll ask your uncle to come tomorrow
and fix you

315
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,800
Who's he?

316
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,000
Beggar So

317
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,670
It hurts!

318
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,450
Hurry up pinhead,
it's choking me!

319
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:10,980
Won't be a second.

320
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,180
Oh, hurry!

321
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,580
Wow! Practicing your kung fu upside down, huh!

322
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,250
- I'm dying!
- Here, I get you something to eat.

323
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,130
Wait till I get some water.

324
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,900
Just take this thing off my ass.

325
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,790
- OK.
- It's killing me!

326
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,070
Hurry!

327
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:00,960
Get up!

328
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,730
Eat

329
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,790
Master's asked Beggar So to fix you

330
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,890
Yes

331
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,670
You're miserable then!

332
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,030
Why?

333
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,970
Do you know anything about Beggar So?

334
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,760
He's very cunning

335
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:22,750
All his students have
if not broken arms then broken legs!

336
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:23,920
Really?

337
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,980
If not believing, then you can try.

338
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:31,650
A guy named Bull was his student
and you know what happened to him?

339
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,860
What?

340
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,280
He lost all his teeth and hair!

341
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,520
His nose is twisted
even his father can't recognize him

342
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,110
That monster really likes torturing people!

343
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,800
What should I do then?

344
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,040
You think about it yourself

345
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,870
Shit! You got to help me.

346
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,650
Among the 36 tactics,

347
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,400
running away is the best!

348
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,780
What are you doing?
You're clumsy!

349
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,120
Hurry up! Run!

350
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,630
- I leave now.
- Just go!

351
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,140
Yue He Restaurant

352
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,800
Have some pork buns...

353
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,780
Come in please.

354
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:43,060
Excuse me, sir.
Can I sit here?

355
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,160
Yes... You from Chaochow?

356
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,530
Are you Chaochowese? Me too!

357
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,700
- I'm also from Chaochow...
- Please, sit...

358
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,170
The food is very good

359
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,170
They all look good and taste good

360
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,670
Really good

361
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,010
Good

362
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,020
Sir...

363
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,310
Why you're alone? Where's Old Shang?

364
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,250
You eat first, eat

365
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,520
What would you like to eat?

366
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,850
A bowl of shark's fin as appetizer

367
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,690
Sorry, we got no shark's fin

368
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:17,700
It's too bad

369
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,200
Then I want a roasted left goose leg

370
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,170
Left leg...

371
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,900
A chicken and a steamed grouper

372
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,770
Sorry, we got no grouper

373
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,330
Then any fish will do

374
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,170
Also a stewed abalone
and big shrimp noodle

375
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:31,170
Yes

376
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:33,310
Half litter of Shaoshing wine, hurry.

377
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,710
Half litter of Shaoshing wine

378
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,840
You have a big stomach

379
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:41,590
Of course, or I won't be so fat

380
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,810
Here's the left goose leg, chicken...

381
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,010
Half litter of Shaoshing wine.

382
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,910
Yes... no thanks

383
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:13,750
Cheer... just feel free

384
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:23,730
Eat... very delicious...

385
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:29,330
We're friend... feel free to eat...

386
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,340
Drink...

387
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:41,080
Go ahead

388
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,810
I eat...

389
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,620
Drink...

390
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,330
He must be starving

391
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,730
Very nice

392
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,900
I mean the food is really good

393
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,470
Really good

394
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,060
I'll pay the bill, don't refuse me
I'll pay it now

395
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:15,070
Buy me lunch tomorrow. I'm leaving
I'll pay there

396
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:18,040
Let me pay, just enjoy it

397
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,110
I've to go, see you tomorrow

398
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,240
Take it easy, goodbye

399
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,380
Excuse me, goodbye... Enjoy

400
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,410
Sir, 1.99 dollars please

401
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,880
Someone will pay the bill

402
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:34,260
Who?

403
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:39,320
The old man who's eating with me

404
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,830
You know him?

405
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,970
He's my father

406
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,330
Your father?

407
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,170
How many fathers do you have?

408
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:55,340
He's the boss of this inn
and I'm his son

409
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,940
So you're his illegitimate son?

410
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:03,780
So you just want to eat and run?
Look there.

411
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,450
Severe punishment for not paying
(嚴懲白食)

412
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,200
Eat and run? No
I've just forgotten to bring the money.

413
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,830
I'll come tomorrow and I'll pay you then.

414
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:37,150
Kingkong, beat him!

415
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,440
Tiger's Claw

416
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,510
Stop it, let's talk

417
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,180
Stop it

418
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:45,050
Don't fight, we're friend, don't fight

419
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,940
It's okay to beat friends.

420
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:51,060
I'll get back what you've eaten
Beat him!

421
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,200
Roasted goose's leg

422
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,230
One on the left

423
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,310
Soyed pork

424
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,540
Damn it

425
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,480
Also half a litter of Shaoshing wine.

426
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:18,690
No... I'm dying.

427
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:33,500
Stop it! That's enough!
Do you really want to kill people?

428
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,520
Enough?
He's to do the toilet cleaning for us.

429
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:43,110
I can't stand it anymore.

430
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,530
Thanks.

431
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,880
Old bum! How you dare
interfere with our affairs!

432
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:59,510
Just watch, I can jump.

433
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,970
Take it

434
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:09,410
Now he's jumping all right!

435
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,110
Here is how to wash your face.

436
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,820
You've eaten enough, you thief!

437
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:26,850
- Stop, Let's be friends!
- Who's your friend?

438
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,810
You're looks well built, but stupid!

439
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,040
Hey, bad boy, let's go!

440
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,180
This way...

440
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,500
Top<font color=#FFFF00>Teo</font>.com

441
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:17,660
Sir, it's amazing at your age,
you're really tough!

442
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:23,890
Oh well, without it how can I
survive in this world?

443
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:28,680
Unlike you, looking tough while
letting people thrash you around!

444
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,850
It's just an accident

445
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,980
If I hadn't fallen into the trap

446
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,790
I'd have beaten them

447
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,390
It's just an excuse

448
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:48,660
How come you're so miserable?

449
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,660
Couldn't pay the bill?

450
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,900
That's a long story

451
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,670
May I know your name?

452
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:57,870
I'm So

453
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:03,910
I feel very angry
when I hear the name So

454
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,010
It's all his fault

455
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,510
Who're you talking about?

456
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,420
It's that Beggar So

457
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,790
My father asked him to come
and fix me up

458
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,250
So you're afraid of him

459
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:17,460
Afraid? Of course not

460
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:23,450
It's heard that
he's vicious and cunning

461
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,900
That old bastard...

462
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,790
I'll teach him a lesson someday

463
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,670
You'll have the chance

464
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,040
Well, where do you work?

465
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:41,780
Me? I have no work

466
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:42,780
So you're a beggar?

467
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:46,260
Yes, I'm Beggar So.

468
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,720
I see...

469
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:51,990
Beggar So?

470
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,460
Exactly

471
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,390
Better go now

472
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:24,490
You can't go now

473
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,560
I've received your father's money
I've to do my job

474
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,570
You can't go away

475
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,320
How long do I need to learn from you?

476
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,310
A day?

477
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:47,630
A year

478
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,780
I'm doomed then

479
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:00,760
I quit and you've got the money
Profits are all yours

480
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,560
You wanna quit? I wanna teach you

481
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,730
You old bastard

482
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,350
Do you dare release me?

483
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:39,930
You old bastard
don't ever underestimate me

484
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,950
Let me show you Tiger-conquering Fist

485
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,610
This is Tiger-conquering Fist?

486
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,220
Tiger-like Fist

487
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,360
It's great, isn't it?

488
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,890
Tiger-conquering Fist?
I think it's Conquered-Tiger Fist!

489
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:40,280
Crane Fist

490
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:43,990
Cool Crane's Beak

491
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,460
Well-Fed Crane's Soul

492
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:47,000
Crane Hunting for Shrimps...

493
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,470
Shrimps... Flying Crane

494
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,730
Your fingers are stronger
than my teeth?

495
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:14,020
Ahh! It's broken!

496
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:16,850
I'm coming!

497
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,390
You scared me!

498
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,820
You're scared to climb up a tree

499
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:27,290
What? I'm just using the Monkey's Fist

500
00:46:57,170 --> 00:46:58,280
Wanna follow me?

501
00:46:58,370 --> 00:47:00,830
Answer me. Answer me!

502
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:02,130
Please stop

503
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,660
Answer me, now!

504
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:09,200
Okay...
Nobody should find a student by force!

505
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:36,890
Let me down!
I don't want to die yet!

506
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,550
I suppose you're supposed to be a teacher,
you'd break a gorilla in half.

507
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:59,520
All students with style
must learn how to fall, right?

508
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:02,110
That was only your first lesson.

509
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,290
Wanna escape?

510
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:59,220
I just wanna piss.

511
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,140
Do it there.

512
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:18,170
From right to left

513
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,750
Then back to right

514
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:33,520
Back to the front

515
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:43,100
Left to the right

516
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:46,400
Right to the front

517
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:57,480
Left to right, right to left

518
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,640
I can never finish it

519
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,760
Just go on

520
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:09,420
So harsh to me? Fine!

521
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:39,380
Fei Hung...

522
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:54,970
Old guy, wash yourself

523
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:29,200
Go away, kid

524
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:34,650
Do you hear me? Go away

525
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:39,020
Can't you see I'm busy

526
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:43,510
What a stubborn bastard

527
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,490
Is this your place?

528
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:47,920
How about if I don't leave?

529
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,290
You're so cheeky

530
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:55,320
and so naive about the world

531
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,030
Comfortable?

532
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,380
No, you're a wicked person

533
00:52:09,450 --> 00:52:11,250
I'm good at fixing wicked people

534
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:22,620
Come on...

535
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:44,770
You shouldn't be too arrogant
with such bad kung-fu

536
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:46,580
Who's your master?

537
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:48,450
My father teaches me

538
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:08,060
Then
your father mustn't be a good fighter

539
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:11,340
Maybe I'll let him be my follower

540
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:19,540
I think you'd better call me daddy!

541
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:21,100
Go to hell!

542
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,550
Sit down.

543
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,530
Get up

544
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,560
Sit down again

545
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,240
It's good you obey daddy.

546
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,660
Go suck mommy!

547
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,450
Take my shoes

548
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,020
Oh...

549
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,710
I won't even need
my hands for you, stupid!

550
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:10,110
Ah, you dare use them!
I'm not scared!

551
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:24,150
Well, shithead, had enough?

552
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,880
I won't stop until you sink in hell fire.

553
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:41,560
Don't come here!

554
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:45,930
Ah shit! You've become
a cowardly turtle!

555
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,740
I surely beat you now.

556
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,890
No matter how hard you train, you never
could beat me with this suck kung-fu!

557
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,600
Killing a nobody like you...

558
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,230
would only defame my reputation.

559
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:29,520
Crawl between my legs

560
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:31,440
then go back to your shit hole!

561
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:35,370
Crawl!

562
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:09,370
Wait, is this your trousers?

563
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:01,790
With your kung-fu that bad,

564
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,800
Then
your father mustn't be a good fighter

565
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,230
Take my shoes.

566
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:16,770
I surely beat you now.

567
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:21,920
No matter how hard you train, you never
could beat me with this suck kung-fu!

568
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:40,220
Killing a nobody like you...

569
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:43,210
would only defame my reputation

570
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:45,230
Crawl between my legs

571
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:47,250
then go back to your shit hole!

572
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,110
Crawl!

573
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:08,740
You idiot, this wine is very expensive

574
00:59:09,130 --> 00:59:11,220
It smells good!

575
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:17,830
Master, enjoy your wine,
I'll dry your clothes.

576
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,690
Why are you so sexy?

577
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,920
Oops! The clothes caught fire...

578
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,580
On fire...

579
00:59:57,310 --> 01:00:01,060
Oh god! You've burned
the only decent clothe I have!

580
01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:37,760
My back!

581
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:03,650
My wrist!

582
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:05,220
You're not strong enough.

583
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:19,040
The food has no meat,
and the tea's too cold!

584
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:20,390
Cold...

585
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:24,830
My head hurts, master.

586
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:26,180
Have your meal.

587
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:37,570
Are you too tired
that you can't even use your chopsticks?

587
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,500
Top<font color=#FFFF00>Teo</font>.com

588
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:06,100
Master, all the stuff is done

589
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,680
So quick?

590
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:12,150
Take it back from upstairs

591
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:15,480
Hurry.

592
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:20,030
I shouldn't have made it so full!

593
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,780
Oh my god!

594
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:36,540
- Hey, Hung,
- Yes?

595
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:39,980
help me to break walnuts.

596
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,190
You break it like this

597
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:50,760
Yeah, like that.

598
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:54,880
Master, it's too hard even for a monkey!

599
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:57,600
Let's go for a walk outside.

600
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:00,110
All right...

601
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:02,610
Open now...

602
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:15,050
- Master, you're good!
- Of course.

603
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:23,570
Observe well... Make your bets!

604
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:25,790
Old guy, you should leave now.

605
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:31,120
Leave?
How can I buy good wine with so little money?

606
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:37,020
I got to bet when luck's with me.
I bet on this.

607
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:42,760
Come on, bet...
Trust me, bet there!

608
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:50,910
Open it... What?

609
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,170
Don't dare

610
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:54,570
Open it...

611
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:56,740
Scared? Shut up!

612
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:01,520
Open it.

613
01:06:04,470 --> 01:06:08,670
You're amazing, master Sure!

614
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:11,760
That's great

615
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:14,830
Put down your bets...

616
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,800
We're getting rich. It's easy!

617
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:17,800
Lucky you!

618
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:20,170
I'll play with you

619
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:21,970
in one go!

620
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:25,510
Alright, we'll make a good fortune today.

621
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:27,670
Come on.

622
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:52,760
Bet!

623
01:06:52,970 --> 01:06:53,800
Good.

624
01:07:00,450 --> 01:07:01,290
Open.

625
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,050
I'm sorry!

626
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:16,660
What's it?

627
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:20,100
You're nimble
but I got good eye-sight too.

628
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:28,100
So you're a swindler.

629
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:33,740
Police is here, run!

630
01:07:43,550 --> 01:07:47,600
You filthy thief, give me back the money.

631
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:50,250
You can never get back your money
from a swindler!

632
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,870
Do you know who I am?

633
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,350
I think you're a rat!

634
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:56,770
You're quite clever
for knowing I'm an old rat!

635
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:58,610
People call me Iron-head Rat!

636
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,580
Really like clay-head indeed!

637
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,380
Very hard indeed!

638
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:06,690
Scared?

639
01:08:08,030 --> 01:08:09,150
Don't go!

640
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:13,250
If you don't return my money,
no matter you're a rat

641
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,120
or a tiger, I'll beat you.

642
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:20,090
Around here no one dare say this to me

643
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:22,130
You don't mind to get hurt, do you?

644
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,720
I'll let you try my iron head.

645
01:08:31,300 --> 01:08:32,300
Your heart.

646
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:43,080
Your lung.

647
01:08:44,280 --> 01:08:46,610
Master, his head is too strong!

648
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:48,450
Don't give up

649
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,560
Now you know how good I am.

650
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:00,370
It's fun.

651
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,940
Good, very good.

652
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:46,610
You've knocked into my trousers.

653
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:54,440
Watch out...

654
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:21,280
A hammer for an iron head, all right?

655
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:45,190
How can you bear?

656
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,470
It's unbearable!

657
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:10,090
Master, I can't bear...

658
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,770
- Want to be lazy?
- No...

659
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:39,230
My hands are gonna be broken!

660
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:47,100
Let's stop now, buy me some wine.

661
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:50,130
Yes, buy wine...

662
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:52,100
Ru Yi's Restaurant.

663
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,290
Waiter.

664
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:03,810
What do you want, mister?

665
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:07,550
- Give me three...
- Three litters of wine?

666
01:12:07,900 --> 01:12:11,430
No, 3 cups of Shaoshing wine, hurry!

667
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:12,590
3 cups?

668
01:12:13,650 --> 01:12:15,520
Hurry up, don't just stand here!

669
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:22,220
Right.

670
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:50,300
What takes that kid so long
to buy some wine?

671
01:12:59,610 --> 01:13:00,950
Idiot!

672
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:08,850
That's him!

673
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:18,060
Old guy, who are you?

674
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:20,560
Who are you then?

675
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:27,190
I'm King of Stick Hsu Ching-tien
Have you heard about me?

676
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:33,610
Yes, I have
You ever heard of Beggar So then?

677
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:35,300
Beggar So?

678
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:37,770
It's me.

679
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:40,660
Go.

680
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:44,190
Don't go, he doesn't look like Beggar So.

681
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:44,790
What?

682
01:13:44,950 --> 01:13:45,640
Look.

683
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:53,260
He's trembling
he isn't the real Beggar So.

684
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:02,460
Well, how dare you cheat me
impersonating beggar So!

685
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,810
What's for?
I'm really Beggar So.

686
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:07,330
Still so stubborn?

687
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,530
Master.

688
01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:03,730
Give me the wine.

689
01:15:13,530 --> 01:15:14,590
It's water!

690
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,310
Idiot, you harm yourself.

691
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:57,200
Master!

692
01:16:31,410 --> 01:16:34,550
They're lucky!
I'll get them next time!

693
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:36,530
I sure will break their bones, let's go!

694
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:04,500
What happens?
Are you too badly beaten to eat?

695
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:09,350
Master, it's all my fault
that you were beaten.

696
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:12,010
It's all because of you.

697
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:17,290
Me beggar So throughout
10 years traveling everywhere

698
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,590
I've never had such humiliation like that!

699
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,670
It's not because you couldn't beat him,

700
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,210
just you didn't drink enough.

701
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,360
Now you know.

702
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:30,170
But I'm so useless

703
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:33,640
or I'll surely
kick the King of Stick out.

704
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,680
Then you're blaming me
for not teaching you?!

705
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:43,290
You've taught me minor things only

706
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,790
and how to stand beating.

707
01:17:51,370 --> 01:17:55,600
Your father Wong Kei Ying is an expert

708
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:58,730
of all kinds of kung-fu.

709
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:01,920
How can I teach his son?

710
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:04,370
He wants you to torture me.

711
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,010
Your father's given you to me

712
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:12,140
because he knows
I have good kung-fu skills

713
01:18:12,890 --> 01:18:14,050
What skills?

714
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,270
The 8 Drunken Gods.

715
01:18:17,410 --> 01:18:22,120
What special? I've learned Drunken Fist
when I was first introduced to kung-fu!

716
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:24,250
You won't understand how great it is

717
01:18:24,290 --> 01:18:28,000
Many people asked me
to teach them in the last decade

718
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:29,990
but I turned them all down.

719
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:08,410
Don't take my drunken-like footwork lightly.
It hides the killing strike.

720
01:19:08,540 --> 01:19:13,670
Camouflage the moves. Appear weak to
beat the strong. Use defeat to snatch victory!

721
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,660
How?

722
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:38,490
Why don't you teach me then?

723
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:42,010
Didn't your father tell you that...

724
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:45,700
it's bad to just practice the moves
without building up a solid foundation?

725
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:47,770
I do this because I want you to have

726
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:51,650
a strong foundation.

727
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:55,150
It's really the right time now.

728
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:56,480
Really?

729
01:19:56,590 --> 01:20:00,500
You should be a bit drunk
to learn the Drunken Fist!

730
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:05,350
Have a drink first.

731
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,170
One more.

732
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:23,110
Fei Hung, have you ever gone to school?

733
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,540
I've spent a few years
in a private school.

741
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,100
Enough!

Lady Ho, using drunk footwork
while attacking at the waist.

Be more serious when training!

769
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:55,080
This style is so sissy!

770
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:59,110
Miss Ho is a woman. Watch.

771
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:05,450
Follow me.

772
01:26:19,570 --> 01:26:21,060
Do it yourself

773
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,180
Okay, I will.

774
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:24,570
Practise hard!

775
01:26:29,950 --> 01:26:32,040
Only women practise this, not me!

Wong Kei Ying

777
01:26:39,090 --> 01:26:41,520
Why do you persuade
the Bull Head Hill villagers

778
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:44,460
not to sell me their land?

779
01:26:44,890 --> 01:26:46,300
What are you thinking?

780
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:51,030
Was it because of
that business with your son?

781
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:52,560
That's a personal issue

782
01:26:53,080 --> 01:26:54,910
that will be settled in good time.

783
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:58,060
I'm not responsible.
What is your game?

784
01:26:58,100 --> 01:26:59,770
What is yours?

785
01:27:00,020 --> 01:27:03,990
Mr. Li, I'm most interested to know
why you want to buy Bull Head Hill.

786
01:27:03,990 --> 01:27:05,950
As you wish to know, I'll tell you.

787
01:27:06,330 --> 01:27:10,380
Metal graveyard up there
has been haunting us for centuries,

788
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:12,430
disturbing family spirits!

789
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:17,710
They'll get more than $30 per lot,
it's good money for that land.

790
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:20,100
then you butcher nose in
where it isn't wanted!

791
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:22,270
You mean you want to buy the graveyard?

792
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:26,790
Huh? Don't you believe me?
There's a curse on the name of Li!

793
01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:31,010
And it must be exorcised.
I've got three mistresses without children!

794
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:34,420
I'll be content with a chicken egg.
 But they can't produce that!

795
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:37,920
Oh, my chilled nut be...
becoming a little seed ah?

796
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:45,930
You can't hide anything
from me, Mr Li.

797
01:27:46,830 --> 01:27:48,830
And what's that supposed to mean?

798
01:27:49,190 --> 01:27:52,660
Li Wan-hao, I think you just want
the thing hidden on the hill

799
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:55,140
Huh? What are you bullshitting?

800
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,180
- The coal.
- The coal?

801
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,400
Bull Head Hill contains a rich coal deposit.
You secretly deal with the Coal Company

802
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:04,690
to depress the price
and make huge profits.

803
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:08,350
You can fool the villagers,
but you can't fool me!

804
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:17,470
Since you know it,
OK, I won't deny.

805
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,390
If you don't interfere,

806
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:22,250
I'll give you 20% of the profit.

807
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:25,840
20%? You spend so much on me?

808
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:30,300
Listen, Li Wan-hao, the hill belongs to the villagers.

809
01:28:30,650 --> 01:28:33,430
No one can take it away,
get out of here!

810
01:28:34,420 --> 01:28:37,070
Wong Kei Ying,
you're trying to go against me,

811
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:40,720
No matter how good your kung fu is,
I'll find someone to handle you.

812
01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:04,750
A 1000-dollar warrant
to kill Wong Kei Ying of Fushan

813
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:07,810
Wong Kei Ying?

814
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:10,810
Teacher's Birthday Feast.

815
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:22,150
Master

816
01:29:22,150 --> 01:29:24,500
- Is everything ready for tonight?
- Yes.

817
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:31,780
Hurry up
there'll be many guests tonight.

818
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,530
Hey, Master Hsu.

819
01:29:43,260 --> 01:29:44,480
Funeral?

820
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:49,020
You ugly boy,

821
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:52,150
Haven't you had enough last time?
Itching for more again?

822
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:59,890
My body is not,
but my hands are.

823
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:02,000
Alright
I'll make you an extra dish tonight

824
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:03,530
Master, what would it be?

825
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:06,970
- Bamboo shoot and pork, give me a rod
- Yes.

826
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:08,490
Pork?

827
01:30:10,370 --> 01:30:11,660
I'll have a piece first.

828
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:15,840
Right, it tastes good!

829
01:30:16,190 --> 01:30:17,090
Master

830
01:30:20,220 --> 01:30:21,160
One bowl.

831
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,230
Wow! Your teeth are so strong
to break a bowl!

831
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,500
Top<font color=#FFFF00>Teo</font>.com

832
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:22,950
Well?

833
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:37,570
Watch out for the teeth!

834
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:51,140
You look quite miserable now!

835
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:07,600
Sit still!

836
01:32:11,550 --> 01:32:12,650
Push off!

837
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,850
Ass against the King of Sticks.

838
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:29,580
This is 'Hungry Dogs Eat Shit!'

839
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,500
Not quite.

840
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:38,690
Got it?

841
01:34:01,710 --> 01:34:02,960
Are you drunk now?

842
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:43,160
Master, there's wine to drink now.

843
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:53,600
Master, the King of Sticks gave us wine
free of charge.

844
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:59,000
Master

845
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:01,190
Master

846
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:05,730
Master

847
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:07,540
Master

848
01:35:17,490 --> 01:35:22,150
<i>Fei Hong, we've been together for a year,
it's time to say good bye.</i>

849
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:26,630
<i>Master can only show the techniques,
learning depends on the pupil.</i>

850
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:32,160
<i>You've to work it out,
practice makes perfect.</i>

851
01:35:32,470 --> 01:35:35,600
<i>Make the Drunken Fist
becomes part of your self</i>

852
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:40,470
<i>The world is my home,
don't miss me, go home.</i>

853
01:35:40,530 --> 01:35:45,260
<i>I'll come when you need me.</i>
-- Beggar So.

854
01:35:53,430 --> 01:35:59,630
Master

855
01:36:16,110 --> 01:36:17,270
Higher

856
01:36:23,390 --> 01:36:24,380
Come on

857
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:25,420
Master Wong!

858
01:36:27,260 --> 01:36:29,370
- Master Wong...
- What's it?

859
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:33,430
Master Wong, Li and his men
are digging up on Bull Head Hill.

860
01:36:33,550 --> 01:36:34,690
Really?

861
01:36:35,390 --> 01:36:38,130
Tell people I'm going up there.
Be quick!

862
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:43,740
It's right ahead, quick.

863
01:37:17,610 --> 01:37:22,910
Wong Kei Ying, you really deserve the fame
being Grand Master of the Great Fist school.

864
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:27,240
Who are you? I don't know you.

865
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:28,920
Why did you ambush me?

866
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:34,080
I'm Yen Tieh-hsin.
I kill for money.

867
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:39,790
Meeting a renown opponent like
Mr. Wong, I won't try to be polite!

868
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:46,360
So you're the cold blood killer
Yan Tieh-hsin.

869
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:48,550
Correct.

870
01:37:49,690 --> 01:37:53,210
But against me,
you won't find that easy!

871
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:56,750
Then you must show me your best today.

872
01:38:17,410 --> 01:38:20,420
The hands are the doors,
the legs are for attack.

873
01:38:29,780 --> 01:38:32,480
30% from the hands,
the rest are from the legs.

874
01:39:14,970 --> 01:39:18,590
Wong Kei Ying,
I must kill you today.

875
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:32,300
Master

876
01:39:32,410 --> 01:39:34,070
Father, how are you?
Are you alright?

877
01:39:34,250 --> 01:39:36,320
Idiot, you're back?

878
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:39,330
It's alright. I'm here.

879
01:39:39,730 --> 01:39:42,740
You dare attack my father?
I'll teach you a good lesson.

880
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:47,230
You again?

881
01:39:49,230 --> 01:39:53,220
So you come to bury your father.

882
01:39:53,330 --> 01:39:54,900
You...

883
01:39:56,030 --> 01:39:59,960
Master Wong, it's too bad
you have such a disgraceful son.

884
01:40:02,210 --> 01:40:04,170
Careful, you will give birth to
a deformed child!

885
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,370
Good kid,
go back and clean the pig-stys

886
01:40:09,550 --> 01:40:11,130
or I'll kill you too.

887
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,250
Don't mind about the hogwash,
I'll break your bones now.

888
01:40:14,450 --> 01:40:19,560
Okay, I give a discount today,
killing two for the price of one!

889
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:30,370
Wait... wait for me.

890
01:40:30,380 --> 01:40:32,360
Master, why you're here?

891
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:37,330
How can I miss a great fighting?

892
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:41,470
Beggar So, it's none of your business.
Go away!

893
01:40:42,290 --> 01:40:47,810
No, you're wrong! I love to
stick my nose in people's business!

894
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:52,720
But don't worry. I myself don't need
to touch people like you!

895
01:40:52,890 --> 01:40:55,160
He's good enough.

896
01:40:57,580 --> 01:41:00,120
Come. Drink first.

897
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:43,800
Master, this wine is strong.
What kind of wine is it?

898
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:45,630
Three-Immortals Wine.

899
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:47,240
Good wine!

900
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:45,740
The immortal Lu, the drunkard
strong like a thousand men.

901
01:42:57,120 --> 01:42:58,780
The immortal Li...

902
01:43:26,780 --> 01:43:29,870
the cripple with a powerful leg.

903
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:32,570
Lan...

904
01:43:49,830 --> 01:43:52,270
a sudden attack at the waist

905
01:43:52,640 --> 01:43:54,260
Han...

906
01:43:55,810 --> 01:43:58,280
holding a pot in his arms

907
01:44:14,190 --> 01:44:16,890
That's great... the 8 Drunken Gods...

908
01:44:17,730 --> 01:44:21,290
Thanks... there's more

909
01:44:22,330 --> 01:44:23,700
Han Hsiang-chi...

910
01:44:27,570 --> 01:44:31,210
blowing his flute while
holding one's wrist and kicking at his chest.

911
01:44:58,340 --> 01:44:59,740
It's amazing!

912
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:03,040
Even the flute would twist

913
01:45:03,980 --> 01:45:07,910
Tso, drinking wine lock...

914
01:45:07,950 --> 01:45:09,880
Throat Lock

915
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:12,610
I lock...

916
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:16,340
Lock...

917
01:45:16,920 --> 01:45:20,720
Lock...

918
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:27,130
Bow...

919
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:33,200
I'll make you bow.

920
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:49,450
Shadowless Hand!

921
01:45:50,630 --> 01:45:52,150
Yes, you're very smart.

922
01:45:54,850 --> 01:45:56,050
Chang

923
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:03,850
I must kill you!

924
01:46:21,290 --> 01:46:23,280
And Miss Ho? Show it now.

925
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:32,040
Miss Ho... Ho...

926
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:34,960
Wait!

927
01:46:35,290 --> 01:46:36,730
Master, I can't stand it anymore.

928
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:38,020
Why?

929
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:39,350
I haven't learned it yet!

930
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:42,950
Can you teach me now?

931
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:44,770
Of course not!

932
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:11,860
Fei Hung

933
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:16,310
It seems invisible but it's visible.

934
01:47:18,910 --> 01:47:23,470
Combine the other 7 styles, and relax.

935
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:27,650
Well, I'll create another Miss Ho.

936
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,970
This is Sexy Girl's Fist

937
01:47:50,010 --> 01:47:52,630
Twisting the ass...

938
01:48:00,100 --> 01:48:01,470
You don't sit right!

939
01:48:09,100 --> 01:48:10,660
Putting on cheek blush

940
01:48:14,130 --> 01:48:16,190
and facing the mirror.

941
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:19,030
Is it the 8 Drunken Gods?

942
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:24,820
Everyone has different styles

943
01:48:24,890 --> 01:48:27,630
even they learn from the same master.

944
01:49:57,610 --> 01:49:59,680
The goddess wants a drink,
Come on.

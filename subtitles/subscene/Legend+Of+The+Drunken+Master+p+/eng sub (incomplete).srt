00:00:16,557 --> 00:00:22,986
"MASTER
A COPACABANA BUILDING"

2
00:01:11,684 --> 00:01:16,018
A building in Copacabana,
one block from the beach.

3
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,949
276 studios home...

4
00:01:21,662 --> 00:01:24,290
to some 500 tenants.

5
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:29,765
Twelve floors,
23 units per floor.

6
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:34,063
We've leased a studio
there for a month.

7
00:01:34,776 --> 00:01:40,078
Three film crews shot the
building's life over a week.

8
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:44,912
- I was 1 when I moved in.
- So all your 49 years, you've lived...

9
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,989
Here.
all my 49 years!

10
00:01:50,192 --> 00:01:52,956
In one building.

11
00:01:53,162 --> 00:01:57,395
- In one apartment?
- No. I've already lived...

12
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,696
I first moved into #813.

13
00:02:01,972 --> 00:02:07,070
Then I moved to #715.

14
00:02:07,311 --> 00:02:11,941
Then to #714.

15
00:02:12,183 --> 00:02:16,620
I've lived in #1102, #306...

16
00:02:16,854 --> 00:02:21,224
#209, #123...

17
00:02:21,426 --> 00:02:23,553
#117...

18
00:02:23,762 --> 00:02:26,390
- Your mother lived in...
- 28 apartments.

19
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:31,400
'Cause we'd rent them and...

20
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:35,040
the owner okaying it,
she'd sublet them.

21
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:41,613
She'd furnish a studio,
People liked it...

22
00:02:41,815 --> 00:02:44,443
you know...
so we'd rent it out.

23
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:47,882
Regularly.
We lived like gypsies...

24
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:50,784
only within one single building.

25
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:53,756
This place used to...

26
00:02:54,162 --> 00:02:58,963
I'll draw the general picture first,
then I'll go into details.

27
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:02,767
This used to be a seedy dive.

28
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:08,808
There's been suicides,
doormen killed...

29
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:11,536
assassinations.

30
00:03:11,914 --> 00:03:16,750
This used to be quite seedy.

31
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:21,185
- In the hallways?
- There used to be hookers...

32
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:24,087
and lines, see?

33
00:03:24,294 --> 00:03:28,061
Men and women waiting for...

34
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:31,599
clients to exit,
so they'd have their go.

35
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:35,669
There used to be lots
of madams here.

36
00:03:35,873 --> 00:03:38,866
There were natural deaths, too.

37
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:43,473
I remember...
Sure you wanna hear this?

38
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:47,277
A friend died in #608.

39
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,885
- The studio we've in?
- That's right.

40
00:03:50,089 --> 00:03:53,253
The building's been revamped.

41
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:56,485
The indecorous people have
moved out.

42
00:03:56,696 --> 00:04:00,223
There's lots of decent people
here now.

43
00:04:00,433 --> 00:04:04,598
Thank God,
this is a family building now.

44
00:04:21,623 --> 00:04:24,285
Welcome to the Administration.

45
00:04:25,328 --> 00:04:28,354
I'm glad, I'm really glad,
cause...

46
00:04:28,564 --> 00:04:34,002
I've been in charge here
since April'97.

47
00:04:34,537 --> 00:04:38,941
I was reelected last March...

48
00:04:39,143 --> 00:04:41,202
until 2003.

49
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:46,348
I hope to be able to do
much more...

50
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,611
but my goal is not, let's say...

51
00:04:50,588 --> 00:04:55,548
I wanted this place to be
nice- looking and decent.

52
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,159
Thank God, I succeeded.

53
00:04:57,695 --> 00:05:02,827
I use a lot of Piaget.
Otherwise, I resort to Pinochet.

54
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:05,999
That's reality, huh?

55
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,605
People say I'm the King
of sayings, so...

56
00:05:08,807 --> 00:05:12,141
"Reality is the funeral
of illusions."

57
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,984
So when they flip out,
I bring them back to reality.

58
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:24,154
They come to their senses,
shocked with reality.

59
00:05:25,226 --> 00:05:29,492
That's how I deal with them:
I start with Piaget. I'm polite, I'm kind.

60
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:33,224
I give love and expect
to get love...

61
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,433
but I can't demand
love from them.

62
00:05:36,638 --> 00:05:41,166
Like I say: "One can't demand
love; only conquer it."

63
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,773
Go on, Eliska.
Go, go, Eliska.

64
00:05:45,882 --> 00:05:47,611
Hi, Ms. Maria do Céu.

65
00:05:48,117 --> 00:05:49,106
How do you do?

66
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,220
- Fine. Welcome.
- Thank you.

67
00:05:52,755 --> 00:05:54,985
Come on in.

68
00:05:56,492 --> 00:06:00,520
Before Sergio's tenure,
at the wee hours...

69
00:06:00,731 --> 00:06:04,189
that lobby there...

70
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:08,337
became the hang out place
for us, ladies...

71
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:12,636
to drink with the doormen
all night...

72
00:06:12,844 --> 00:06:14,937
every night.
I used to join them, too.

73
00:06:15,146 --> 00:06:19,412
About 1 am, I'd get insomniac,
so I'd go down, too.

74
00:06:19,618 --> 00:06:22,247
We all ate, the doormen drank...

75
00:06:22,455 --> 00:06:25,856
got drunk, then one of them
would go to sleep...

76
00:06:26,058 --> 00:06:31,587
on a foldable beach chair
out of sight...

77
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:33,561
and the lobby would then
be deserted.

78
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,600
You say it with such fondness!

79
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:42,971
Look, it wasn't all that good.

80
00:06:43,176 --> 00:06:46,840
Only when we were having fun,
but things could turn sour.

81
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:51,779
First, some woman would show up,
throwing a fit.

82
00:06:52,186 --> 00:06:55,486
Then someone else,
waving a pocketknife.

83
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:59,218
It'd go on like this.

84
00:06:59,428 --> 00:07:02,693
So the cops were called.

85
00:07:02,898 --> 00:07:08,565
When fights broke out,
the cops would come, and go up.

86
00:07:08,772 --> 00:07:11,935
Out front, there was a scaffold,
for the facade was being painted.

87
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:16,841
So someone would rappel down
the scaffold ropes.

88
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:25,913
Then, a second person
would rappel down...

89
00:07:26,123 --> 00:07:29,787
from the 7th or 8th floor.

90
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:33,294
Then a third one. I'd say:
"What the hell is this?"

91
00:07:33,498 --> 00:07:38,435
all night long...
In the morning I'd say:

92
00:07:38,637 --> 00:07:41,402
"Who's giving the scoop
of what happened...

93
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:46,135
you or me, Conceição?
About what we saw last night?"

94
00:07:46,346 --> 00:07:51,181
We'd give each other the scoop,
saying it was a news flash.

95
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:56,888
Before Sergio, this was hell,
but thank God, all's calm now.

96
00:07:57,491 --> 00:08:00,483
all's great,
but the poor fellow suffered...

97
00:08:00,694 --> 00:08:03,185
to chase out of here
the transvestites...

98
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:06,856
prostitution, the massage parlors.

99
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:11,437
Good Lord! He kept going
down to the district...

100
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,075
the poor guy suffered.
We would go testify...

101
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:20,840
and so would the doormen.
Now it's better. all's fine.

102
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,802
We're here.
This is our crew.

103
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:47,111
I'll see myself in, okay?

104
00:08:47,311 --> 00:08:50,372
How are you?
This is Jacques.

105
00:08:50,582 --> 00:08:53,016
This is Coutinho, the director.

106
00:08:53,218 --> 00:08:56,745
- You look smart, huh?
- Yeah, but one should look smart?

107
00:08:56,955 --> 00:08:59,719
My favorite objects?
My portraits!

108
00:09:00,826 --> 00:09:02,385
Definitely!

109
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:06,554
- Tell me why.
- Cause I love myself.

110
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:09,860
We should all love
ourselves, right?

111
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:12,731
If I don't love myself,
who will?

112
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:15,235
Except when you have a boyfriend.

113
00:09:15,443 --> 00:09:18,537
Then you love your boyfriend,
of course!

114
00:09:19,547 --> 00:09:23,074
I began posing for portraits
after my divorce.

115
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:26,785
I started working as a seamstress
for the high society.

116
00:09:26,988 --> 00:09:29,354
I worked for
Roberto Marinho's famlly...

117
00:09:29,558 --> 00:09:33,722
Othon Palace Hotel's ,
and Niemeyer's family.

118
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:38,458
I had to polish my act.

119
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:42,434
I learned many great things
with the high society.

120
00:09:42,638 --> 00:09:47,268
Then I started posing for portraits,
cause I fell in love with myself.

121
00:09:47,477 --> 00:09:52,973
And to this day, I've got portraits
on my phones and about everywhere!

122
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,152
We live in one of Rio's
postcards: Copacabana.

123
00:09:57,921 --> 00:10:01,016
It's very violent here, though.

124
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,922
How was your mugging,
Ms. Esther?

125
00:10:04,128 --> 00:10:05,186
- Here?
- Yeah.

126
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:11,666
I was on Siqueira Campos St.,
near here...

127
00:10:11,871 --> 00:10:14,567
when a guy and a woman
approached me.

128
00:10:14,773 --> 00:10:19,142
I got quite frightened.
Then...

129
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:20,744
he took his piece out of
his pocket.

130
00:10:20,946 --> 00:10:23,347
When I saw the gun,
I panicked.

131
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,852
He said: "Be quiet,
and don't look sideways."

132
00:10:28,588 --> 00:10:30,351
"Where do you live?"

133
00:10:30,557 --> 00:10:34,517
When I came in here,
I got so scared...

134
00:10:34,729 --> 00:10:37,357
really scared of him.

135
00:10:37,565 --> 00:10:40,398
Such a handsome man! White...

136
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:43,798
really well- dressed.

137
00:10:44,005 --> 00:10:48,705
He said:
"Where's your bank card?"

138
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:53,778
I said: "I don't know!"I shook
so badly, I was speechless!

139
00:10:53,982 --> 00:10:57,419
I opened up a drawer,
emptied it on my bed...

140
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,384
kneeling on the floor, looking
for it, but couldn't find it...

141
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,024
being under gunpoint like that.

142
00:11:03,226 --> 00:11:05,285
I had to crawl on my knees...

143
00:11:05,495 --> 00:11:10,399
grab his leg,
and beg him not to shoot me.

144
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:13,798
Then we left for the bank.

145
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:18,235
He cashed all my money,
R$ 8,OOO reais.

146
00:11:19,476 --> 00:11:22,878
He had the gun on me all the time.

147
00:11:23,214 --> 00:11:29,449
I think the branch manager
was in it with him...

148
00:11:29,654 --> 00:11:34,752
cause he paid right up. For you
to cash a couple thousand reais...

149
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:37,156
a 24- hour notice is required.

150
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,821
I came back home,
in such a state!

151
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:44,162
I couldn't stop crying.

152
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:49,399
He handed me a damn bag
that's still here!

153
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:51,339
It's here, that damn bag!

154
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:55,107
He said: "Keep it.
I don't need your money."

155
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:58,774
I thought the money
was really there.

156
00:11:58,987 --> 00:12:02,184
Boy, what a letdown!

157
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:04,454
The bag's here.

158
00:12:06,027 --> 00:12:08,997
Here's the damn bag.

159
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:12,525
I find it disgusting.

160
00:12:12,735 --> 00:12:16,000
Look, he did all this!

161
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,201
It's disgusting.

162
00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:26,876
all nicely folded up,
so I'd take it for my money.

163
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,311
I got desperate,
when I saw myself alone here...

164
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:35,515
pacing up and down,
debt- ridden at C&A, and Ponto Frio...

165
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,524
At 4 am, I got dressed and decided
to jump out of the window.

166
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:43,758
I was going to jump.

167
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:50,368
It'd been two years my late
husband had died...

168
00:12:50,575 --> 00:12:53,841
and left me alone.
But I...

169
00:12:54,047 --> 00:13:00,077
didn't go through with it.
People always teased me:

170
00:13:00,286 --> 00:13:03,881
"You didn't jump because of
C&A and Ponto Frio?"

171
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,891
I said: "Yes", cause I'm not
like those who say:

172
00:13:08,095 --> 00:13:10,563
"The dead don't have to honor
their debts."

173
00:13:10,764 --> 00:13:13,494
When I die,
I want to go in peace!

174
00:13:13,701 --> 00:13:16,068
Not owing a dime to anyone.

175
00:13:16,271 --> 00:13:20,799
Now I have a really
great boyfriend.

176
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:25,412
I'm very happy.
One shouldn't be alone.

177
00:13:25,613 --> 00:13:29,846
We should all have someone.
I'm not dead yet.

178
00:13:30,052 --> 00:13:35,615
Men and women need companions,
don't you think so?

179
00:13:35,825 --> 00:13:37,850
We all need a partner.

180
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,621
You spend your daytime with
your friends, and that's nice.

181
00:13:40,831 --> 00:13:44,198
Then you come home,
and Iock your front door...

182
00:13:44,401 --> 00:13:46,494
My friends tease me, saying:

183
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:51,641
"If you dislike being alone within 4
white walls, paint them in colors!"

184
00:13:52,243 --> 00:13:55,474
It's easy for them to say so,
cause they're not in here.

185
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,411
Solitude hurts a lot.
It hurts a lot.

186
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:23,902
- My boyfriend is American.
- What's he like?

187
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:29,208
Christopher? Oh, God,
he was a godsend, a glory.

188
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:33,876
Calls me everyday.
Must be nuts my cel phone's off.

189
00:14:34,155 --> 00:14:39,219
- Where's he?
- He lives in Greenville, a city in the US.

190
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:44,626
He's bought me a home, and
proposed. I pIan to move there.

191
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,996
I just wanna wait a little,
cause he's too eager.

192
00:14:48,204 --> 00:14:53,642
Everyday he sends me e- mails,
calls, wires me money...

193
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,004
- How do you call him?
- "My chocolate baby", he calls me.

194
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:59,579
I call him "my chocolate white".

195
00:15:00,384 --> 00:15:04,821
He's really cool.
AIways joking, you know?

196
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:07,513
No one would say he's 42.

197
00:15:07,724 --> 00:15:12,662
He's the chairman of one of the
US' most famous organizations.

198
00:15:12,864 --> 00:15:16,595
- Is he single, married, widowed?
- He's single, and he's mine!

199
00:15:18,203 --> 00:15:20,364
He's got a beautiful son,
who loves me dearly!

200
00:15:20,572 --> 00:15:22,301
- Does his son know you?
- Yes, he does.

201
00:15:22,507 --> 00:15:25,306
I know his mom.
His son came to visit, she didn't.

202
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:27,672
She sends me e- malls.

203
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,372
It seems he has a huge house,
and his wife left him.

204
00:15:31,584 --> 00:15:35,112
My poor baby,
his wife was a neurotic.

205
00:15:35,322 --> 00:15:39,019
She took off with a lover,
and left him with their son...

206
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:42,662
and a huge trauma.
He's been separated for 2 years.

207
00:15:42,863 --> 00:15:48,029
I think he found in me
what he'd been looking for.

208
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:51,433
I have a dream, cause when
I Ieft home, my mom said:

209
00:15:51,906 --> 00:15:55,467
"You wanna move in with
your cousin? Fine!"

210
00:15:55,676 --> 00:16:00,444
"You'll be back in a week,
begging for a plate of food."

211
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:03,413
As I'm really proud, I said:

212
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:07,316
"Mom, apart from being a hooker
or a killer..."

213
00:16:07,522 --> 00:16:10,788
"I'd sooner starve to death
than ever come back here."

214
00:16:10,994 --> 00:16:14,486
- Why?
- Cause I had a boyfriend...

215
00:16:14,697 --> 00:16:18,224
She was so liberal with my friends,
I thought with me...

216
00:16:18,434 --> 00:16:20,733
Then I got pregnant.

217
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:24,704
And I'm through and through
against abortion.

218
00:16:25,843 --> 00:16:31,873
My mom was worried about
what People'd say...

219
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:35,143
what the neighbors would say.
That upset me even more.

220
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:39,514
When she got her paycheck,
she took me to this...

221
00:16:39,724 --> 00:16:42,158
Spiritist Center, where a lady,
like, induced miscarriages.

222
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:47,128
You go there, she does her thing,
and the next day, you miscarry.

223
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,358
only I didn't .

224
00:16:49,702 --> 00:16:54,162
So, I had an internal infection.

225
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:56,672
I kept the dead baby
in my womb for 3 days.

226
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:02,849
On the 4th, my temperature
was, like, 1O7 F.

227
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,249
When I recovered, my mom said:
"Let's go home."

228
00:17:07,455 --> 00:17:11,789
I said: "Maybe you forgot
you'd told me...

229
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:14,359
that I couldn't stay home
with a baby."

230
00:17:14,562 --> 00:17:17,087
"So, even without one,
you won't want me there."

231
00:17:17,298 --> 00:17:19,199
"I love you, but..."

232
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:22,598
I couldn't bear to see
my mom cry, I'd cry, too.

233
00:17:23,305 --> 00:17:26,604
Now I'm Renata, and that's it.
I'm #1 in Brazil.

234
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:31,037
Nobody will ever let me
down again.

235
00:17:52,303 --> 00:17:54,499
My music keeps me entertained.

236
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:59,507
I've already played a little
keyboard today.

237
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:04,375
I enjoy singing.
I used to sing a lot.

238
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:07,882
When a radio station in Maranhão
was founded...

239
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,215
I sang in one of their
talent shows.

240
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:15,258
My family disapproved of it,
but I loved it.

241
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:18,158
I've lived by myself for quite
a while, and am used to it.

242
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:21,630
But I have children.
I've had 4 children:

243
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,030
one of them passed away.
I have 3 children...

244
00:18:24,238 --> 00:18:29,734
two married girls
and 8 grandchildren.

245
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:33,971
My daughters say: "Mom,
People have CDs now, not LPs!"

246
00:18:34,282 --> 00:18:38,150
Oh, c'mon, my LPs are beauties!

247
00:18:38,353 --> 00:18:43,053
Once in a while, I sit there...

248
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:46,786
play my LPs, and fly!

249
00:18:46,996 --> 00:18:51,457
I'm not sad,
I'm not unhappy either.

250
00:18:51,668 --> 00:18:55,104
No sir, thank God.

251
00:18:55,305 --> 00:18:58,468
I face my probIems...

252
00:19:00,143 --> 00:19:01,838
naturally.

253
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,545
I'll sing, if you want. I'm not
self- conscious, did you notice?

254
00:19:06,184 --> 00:19:11,087
Never,not even if

255
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:13,484
my world ends

256
00:19:13,691 --> 00:19:16,252
Neither in God's name

257
00:19:16,462 --> 00:19:18,623
Not even then

258
00:19:18,831 --> 00:19:24,394
Will I evertake you back

259
00:19:24,736 --> 00:19:29,765
Never! When our illusions

260
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:32,274
Are shattered

261
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:36,814
Our hearts end up buried

262
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:40,612
As I have buried mine

263
00:19:41,122 --> 00:19:44,751
Nostalgia

264
00:19:45,292 --> 00:19:50,754
Go and tell him
Please

265
00:19:50,966 --> 00:19:55,699
How happy my love was

266
00:19:55,904 --> 00:20:01,104
And how much I loved him
long ago

267
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:05,212
Nostalgia

268
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:09,976
Don't forget to say, at last

269
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:15,523
That you bring me sleep and rest

270
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:20,026
So I can live in peace

271
00:20:55,135 --> 00:20:58,128
Your 1st anniversary?!
How has it been?

272
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:00,273
Thank God, all's fine.

273
00:21:00,808 --> 00:21:02,605
Why did you eye him like that?

274
00:21:04,312 --> 00:21:06,780
Be honest.

275
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:10,175
Why?
Aren't we fine?

276
00:21:10,385 --> 00:21:14,719
Honestly?
Since December...

277
00:21:14,923 --> 00:21:20,691
in January and February...
Until January, all was fine.

278
00:21:20,897 --> 00:21:26,028
In February, we had a fight.

279
00:21:27,604 --> 00:21:30,664
I thought of jumping out
of that window.

280
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:33,873
We fought all night.

281
00:21:34,078 --> 00:21:39,345
In the morning, he saved me.

282
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,986
If I'd seen him coming,
I'd have jumped.

283
00:21:43,187 --> 00:21:47,887
I sat down on the windows,
and said: "So be it..."

284
00:21:48,093 --> 00:21:50,220
"I can't stand it anymore."

285
00:21:50,428 --> 00:21:54,592
"When I meant to jump,
he threw me on the floor."

286
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,029
- She's sick with jealousy.
- So is he!

287
00:21:57,236 --> 00:22:00,501
That fight, back in February,
was out of jealousy.

288
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:05,177
I'm honest. I'll say whatever
I pIease to his face...

289
00:22:05,378 --> 00:22:10,578
anywhere.
Whenever he's with a woman.

290
00:22:10,784 --> 00:22:12,911
Say I'm a guy, with a date.

291
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,521
I won't check out other women
passing by.

292
00:22:16,723 --> 00:22:19,591
She's paranoid,
says I'm gawping at them.

293
00:22:19,794 --> 00:22:24,527
- Do you look at them?
- She says I do...

294
00:22:24,732 --> 00:22:26,063
Do you love each other?

295
00:22:26,267 --> 00:22:30,796
I love her, but I don't know if
she loves me. I think she does.

296
00:22:31,006 --> 00:22:34,601
I used to be crazy about him.

297
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:37,711
That love I felt for him...

298
00:22:42,185 --> 00:22:46,679
I first got married at 42...

299
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:49,120
and I'm never
getting married again.

300
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,554
Did you have children?

301
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:53,488
Ready for this?
You won't believe me.

302
00:22:53,698 --> 00:22:59,398
I have a 23- yr- old son.
I've had 22 children...

303
00:22:59,603 --> 00:23:01,161
15 abortions.

304
00:23:01,372 --> 00:23:05,742
I didn't get it. Come again?
How many children have you had?

305
00:23:05,944 --> 00:23:10,438
22. Total, with 15 abortions.

306
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:13,914
As a child, were you poor?

307
00:23:14,986 --> 00:23:20,653
Yeah, I can't say I was rich.
I was raised...

308
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,988
and lived in a slum.

309
00:23:24,197 --> 00:23:26,324
But he didn't .
His life...

310
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:27,966
His life was better.

311
00:23:28,168 --> 00:23:30,466
Thank God,
I've had a good life.

312
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:33,367
My dad gave us an okay life.

313
00:23:33,574 --> 00:23:36,338
But my mom and I lived
in a slum.

314
00:23:36,543 --> 00:23:39,775
My dad left me with her
to be raised.

315
00:23:39,981 --> 00:23:42,074
I'd spend a year
with each of them.

316
00:23:42,283 --> 00:23:45,116
My mom had a rather
improper life...

317
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,911
if you know what I mean.

318
00:23:48,423 --> 00:23:53,589
I was 13, 14, and she rented out
rooms for trysts.

319
00:23:53,796 --> 00:23:56,993
- With you there?
- I was there.

320
00:23:57,366 --> 00:23:59,994
- Do you like Copacabana?
- No.

321
00:24:00,202 --> 00:24:03,263
I've worked here for years,
and never liked it.

322
00:24:03,473 --> 00:24:05,134
What did you use to do?

323
00:24:05,342 --> 00:24:08,641
I'm not ashamed of saying it:
I was a housemaid.

324
00:24:08,845 --> 00:24:10,312
- For how long?
- Years.

325
00:24:10,614 --> 00:24:12,878
You've worked for a family
in Copacabana...

326
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:15,075
so you know the neighborhood well.

327
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:17,186
- Why don't you like it?
- Because.

328
00:24:17,388 --> 00:24:19,583
You know why?
I feel caged in.

329
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,725
Of her own choice.

330
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:25,394
I aIways invite her to take walks
on the beach.

331
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:28,088
I don't like it.
You know why?

332
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,999
I'm an oId lady. Why sit and watch
oId foIks stroll by?

333
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,264
I don't mean that!
Just for the sake of walking.

334
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:41,311
You know what I really like?
To do the samba, to dance...

335
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:46,281
but he doesn't .
I love him more than he loves me.

336
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:49,820
- Is it a love contest?
- Yes, it is.

337
00:24:51,258 --> 00:24:54,716
We're good for nothing,
but we love each other.

338
00:24:55,262 --> 00:24:59,824
I've told his daughter:
"Next time he misbehaves...

339
00:25:00,034 --> 00:25:02,196
I'll kill him first, and then
I'll kill myself."

340
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:08,868
Your hair grows longer
Your look goes downhill

341
00:25:09,077 --> 00:25:14,812
You grow older,
Time doesn't stand still

342
00:25:15,017 --> 00:25:18,748
A minute can contain
a lifetime,or more

343
00:25:19,922 --> 00:25:23,916
Within that minute,
What's in store?

344
00:25:25,095 --> 00:25:29,031
Love stories do not
exist anymore

345
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:33,764
And they were only lies
of yore

346
00:25:35,306 --> 00:25:37,604
She showed her bellybutton

347
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:39,902
Herworld spinning there

348
00:25:40,111 --> 00:25:42,375
Look beyond your bellybutton

349
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,775
See time go by, by,by

350
00:25:44,983 --> 00:25:47,111
She showed her bellybutton

351
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:49,651
And herworld spinning there

352
00:25:49,855 --> 00:25:53,655
Look beyond your bellybutton
And see

353
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:55,690
Have you ever made money
with your music?

354
00:25:55,895 --> 00:26:01,960
We have. If we played covers,
we'd earn a llving with it.

355
00:26:02,168 --> 00:26:04,398
But if money was my only concern,
I wouldn't be a musician.

356
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,902
ReaI money,
not pocket money here and there.

357
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,305
Or eIse, I'd be home in Curitiba,
playing at bars.

358
00:26:10,511 --> 00:26:14,208
We used to play every week,
Thursdays thru Sundays.

359
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:18,513
But we don't want to play
musak at such venues.

360
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:22,816
We want to play concerts,
go on tours, play for reaI.

361
00:26:23,025 --> 00:26:25,550
How do you like llving in
Copacabana for 6 months?

362
00:26:26,094 --> 00:26:28,221
It's cooI.
I like it here.

363
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,455
- Why?
- It's great. We go down...

364
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:35,127
to the corner bar,
everyone's happy, sipping beer.

365
00:26:35,338 --> 00:26:37,363
You go to the beach,
everyone's jogging.

366
00:26:37,574 --> 00:26:38,666
How much is your rent?

367
00:26:39,375 --> 00:26:43,243
Rent R$ 35O, taxes R$ 135.

368
00:26:43,446 --> 00:26:45,472
And how do you make ends meet?

369
00:26:45,683 --> 00:26:50,143
They both work, and I study,
so my dad send me some dough.

370
00:26:50,354 --> 00:26:53,187
- What do you do? Can he speak?
- No.

371
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:55,552
He works at a Chinese restaurant.

372
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,387
Won't he ever answer me?

373
00:26:57,596 --> 00:26:59,564
When he's in that outfit,
he's isn't allowed to speak.

374
00:26:59,764 --> 00:27:01,391
ExpIain it to me.

375
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,229
Well, he's in our band as
a visuaI message.

376
00:27:05,437 --> 00:27:08,874
He expresses, physically, what we
want to convey with our music.

377
00:27:09,075 --> 00:27:13,569
So if he taIked, it'd be
meaningIess, cause he's an image.

378
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:17,010
He's meant to be a visuaI message,
not a taIking one.

379
00:27:33,534 --> 00:27:37,163
- How was your 1st marriage?
- I had two chlldren.

380
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:39,469
How long did it Iast?

381
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:42,371
I was married for 9 years
before I got divorced.

382
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:45,910
I spent some time by myself,
then got married again.

383
00:27:46,315 --> 00:27:49,648
After 9 years,
I became a widower.

384
00:27:50,185 --> 00:27:54,282
- Was your 2nd marriage good?
- Excellent.

385
00:27:54,724 --> 00:27:57,192
- Haven't been married since?
- No.

386
00:27:57,394 --> 00:28:01,956
We've been llving together
for 13 years now.

387
00:28:02,198 --> 00:28:05,259
And were you separated,
or a widow?

388
00:28:05,469 --> 00:28:07,767
- A widow.
- How long untll you met him?

389
00:28:07,972 --> 00:28:11,408
Three years.
I worked all day back then...

390
00:28:11,842 --> 00:28:15,869
and had no time Ieft to miss
a partner.

391
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,983
It was only after I got retired
that things got worse.

392
00:28:20,318 --> 00:28:24,152
I began to feeI a big void.

393
00:28:24,356 --> 00:28:29,795
One week seemed to Iast a year.

394
00:28:29,996 --> 00:28:31,759
I knew I couldn't go on aIone.

395
00:28:31,964 --> 00:28:34,364
I decided to look up
the personal ads.

396
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:38,936
I picked up BaIcão and read them,
but didn't want to write one.

397
00:28:39,172 --> 00:28:45,134
But in the paper, all 5O...

398
00:28:45,345 --> 00:28:48,109
51- yr- oId men,
up to 6O yr. oIds...

399
00:28:48,315 --> 00:28:51,547
they all wanted
4O- yr- oId women...

400
00:28:52,087 --> 00:28:56,148
or between 3O and 4O. I was 5O,
I'd have to look for an 8O yr. oId.

401
00:28:56,357 --> 00:28:58,120
No way, huh?

402
00:28:58,326 --> 00:29:00,351
I was doomed...

403
00:29:00,562 --> 00:29:03,157
cause an 8O yr. oId would
do me no good.

404
00:29:03,365 --> 00:29:06,357
So I decided to write
my own ad.

405
00:29:06,569 --> 00:29:12,007
One farmer sent me his picture,
surrounded by oxen...

406
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:16,168
saying I was right for him,
and he'd like...

407
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,006
to exchange Ietters with me.

408
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:21,082
But I didn't like his
self- advertising.

409
00:29:21,418 --> 00:29:24,546
- Did you have any actuaI dates?
- Three.

410
00:29:24,755 --> 00:29:27,919
- How did they go?
- Fast! In one...

411
00:29:28,126 --> 00:29:31,493
- Where were they?
- One was at Lido Square.

412
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:34,126
He was a soccer coach in Niterói...

413
00:29:34,332 --> 00:29:39,532
but I when saw his white & brown
shoes, I didn't like them.

414
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:42,332
I hated his shoes.

415
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:46,068
The second one I met
at the square...

416
00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:49,009
grabbed my arm, and said:
"Let's see if it's firm."

417
00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:51,607
- Just like that?
- Yeah.

418
00:29:51,818 --> 00:29:55,276
I said: "Why?
I'm not selling anything."

419
00:29:55,488 --> 00:29:58,218
"Just checking if your
body's firm."

420
00:29:58,491 --> 00:30:02,223
I'd call the paper to check
for Ietters.

421
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,863
I'd give my phone and box.
"Any Ietters?"

422
00:30:06,066 --> 00:30:08,762
"Yes,'X' Ietters."
Then, I'd go pick'em up.

423
00:30:08,969 --> 00:30:11,130
I'd read'em on the bus
ride back.

424
00:30:11,338 --> 00:30:13,933
- Did your heart beat fast?
- Of course!

425
00:30:14,142 --> 00:30:16,042
- Did you ever post any ads?
- No, never.

426
00:30:16,244 --> 00:30:18,940
- But you read them.
- I read and replled to them.

427
00:30:19,147 --> 00:30:20,944
What interested you the most?

428
00:30:21,183 --> 00:30:24,449
- Age, personallty.
- What age group interested you?

429
00:30:24,654 --> 00:30:28,317
Upwards of 48.

430
00:30:28,524 --> 00:30:30,253
- No young Iadies?
- AbsoIuteIy not.

431
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:33,895
- Why not?
- Because.

432
00:30:34,363 --> 00:30:38,232
I was looking for a partner
in every respect.

433
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:42,201
I could find a girI just wanting
to go out on dates...

434
00:30:42,406 --> 00:30:44,306
and that's not what I wanted.

435
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:46,443
My first date took pIace
in Campo Grande.

436
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:48,475
I got there, parked far off,
got out...

437
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,013
and when I saw her from afar...

438
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,711
she was horribIe.
HorribIe.

439
00:30:56,921 --> 00:30:59,015
She was hideous!

440
00:30:59,391 --> 00:31:01,086
I thought: "No way."

441
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:04,160
I waIked back and drove off.

442
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:07,389
Then I had a date with
a fashion designer.

443
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:13,572
She was very pretty,
and I got interested.

444
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,134
But all she thought about
was money.

445
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:19,574
She was only after money.

446
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:23,181
MiracIes are rare,
but they do happen.

447
00:31:23,384 --> 00:31:25,249
Like how we met.

448
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:30,356
It's hard finding someone who
fuIfllIs you in every way.

449
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:33,119
- In 3 days.
- In 3 days.

450
00:31:33,328 --> 00:31:36,593
Day 1, we met. Day 2, we dinned.
Day 3, I moved in with him.

451
00:31:36,865 --> 00:31:40,995
I wanted a free, independent...

452
00:31:41,837 --> 00:31:45,569
attractive woman.
My oId Iady is pretty.

453
00:31:45,975 --> 00:31:49,035
She's pretty,
and I wanted a pretty woman.

454
00:31:49,245 --> 00:31:52,476
I once was... I once was.

455
00:31:52,682 --> 00:31:55,310
Were you also looking for
a handsome man?

456
00:31:55,518 --> 00:31:57,578
- That'd be hard.
- Why? Him?

457
00:31:57,788 --> 00:31:59,619
Were you also looking for
an attractive man?

458
00:31:59,823 --> 00:32:03,452
Any man without a belly.
But then I found him.

459
00:32:05,229 --> 00:32:08,529
I liked all about him,
except for his belly.

460
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:10,860
So we've been llving together.

461
00:32:11,069 --> 00:32:14,937
He's so nice he put his apartment,
his car, everything...

462
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,166
under my name. If I Ieave him
tomorrow, he's lost.

463
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:20,572
would it be rude
if I asked your age?

464
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,874
Not at all. I'm 67.

465
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,785
65.

466
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,920
You're stllI young.

467
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:32,285
- And pretty, isn't she?
- You fooI!

468
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,720
She's very pretty.

469
00:32:34,061 --> 00:32:37,588
Did you forget we'd made
this appointment?

470
00:32:37,798 --> 00:32:41,860
Of course, not.
It's just that...

471
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,198
I woke up with the doorbell.

472
00:32:45,406 --> 00:32:47,340
Do you mind if we shoot?

473
00:32:47,542 --> 00:32:53,071
I don't , but your audience might.
I just woke up. Look at my face.

474
00:32:55,017 --> 00:32:56,917
- Are you a teacher?
- Yes.

475
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:00,282
- An Engllsh teacher?
- I've lived in N. OrIeans for 8 yr.

476
00:33:00,489 --> 00:33:04,118
- And why?
- My mom worked at the ConsuIate.

477
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,795
- Worked at the ConsuIate?
- Yes.

478
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:08,464
Do you have cats?

479
00:33:08,665 --> 00:33:11,327
Yeah, I live with
3 femaIe kitties.

480
00:33:11,534 --> 00:33:17,599
I used to have maIes, but since
the kitties aren't spayed...

481
00:33:17,808 --> 00:33:21,141
I had to get rid of them.

482
00:33:21,345 --> 00:33:23,404
It was a great bIow to me...

483
00:33:23,614 --> 00:33:26,082
but that's ok.
I live with the kitties...

484
00:33:26,283 --> 00:33:32,780
and haIf of the week,
my boyfriend comes over, but...

485
00:33:32,991 --> 00:33:35,755
- Over here?
- Yes, he does.

486
00:33:35,961 --> 00:33:41,662
I'm a bit of a neurotic
and sociaI phobic...

487
00:33:41,868 --> 00:33:46,965
and Copacabana's busy
hustIe and bustIe...

488
00:33:47,173 --> 00:33:52,043
makes me stressed out
by the time I get home.

489
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:53,508
The crowds?

490
00:33:53,714 --> 00:33:56,649
Yeah. I don't know: Either there
are too many passersby...

491
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,784
or the sidewaIks are too narrow...

492
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:04,254
or there's an unpIeasant
combination of both.

493
00:34:04,659 --> 00:34:07,059
What I'll say is not nice...

494
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:11,289
but I quite enjoy it...

495
00:34:11,499 --> 00:34:14,401
when I ride the elevator
by myself.

496
00:34:14,603 --> 00:34:18,505
Not because I might loose time
stopping at another floor.

497
00:34:18,707 --> 00:34:22,837
only because I know I won't have
to see nor be seen.

498
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:25,377
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

499
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:28,576
Why do you avoid eye contact
when we taIk?

500
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:32,186
It's not that what
I'm saying isn't true.

501
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:35,517
It's just that I'm not sure...

502
00:34:35,725 --> 00:34:39,355
I'm too insecure
to face you...

503
00:34:39,564 --> 00:34:44,797
without stammering,
or bllnking compuIsiveIy.

504
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:46,867
In your first interview,
you also looked sideways.

505
00:34:47,071 --> 00:34:49,939
Right, I have that probIem.

506
00:34:50,142 --> 00:34:55,205
I'll only make an extra effort,
if I'm in a job interview...

507
00:34:55,414 --> 00:34:57,541
or eIse People think I'm Iying:

508
00:34:57,749 --> 00:35:03,120
"Your gaze avoidance means you're
either afraid or gullty."

509
00:35:03,323 --> 00:35:05,689
Since neither is usually
the case...

510
00:35:05,892 --> 00:35:08,360
Here, I don't feeI gullty,
but I'm afraid.

511
00:35:08,561 --> 00:35:11,121
- You are?
- Course! What do you think...

512
00:35:11,331 --> 00:35:16,861
makes People avoid
eye to eye contact?

513
00:35:17,071 --> 00:35:19,096
It's fear, huh?

514
00:35:19,306 --> 00:35:25,940
Writing for me is a necessary
escape...

515
00:35:26,414 --> 00:35:31,909
but IateIy I haven't found
inspiration to write poetry.

516
00:35:36,492 --> 00:35:41,452
Here's a short poem,
called "Opium Dreams".

517
00:35:57,247 --> 00:35:59,443
- Did you get it?
- Overall, but could you...

518
00:35:59,651 --> 00:36:01,949
in Portuguese?

519
00:36:21,474 --> 00:36:26,173
Its symbollsm touches me deepIy.

520
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:33,411
This one here is entitIed...

521
00:36:33,988 --> 00:36:37,355
I'll transIate it,
cause I give them Engllsh titIes:

522
00:36:37,558 --> 00:36:42,518
"The Forest of My Despair."It's
about paranoia and Iack of love.

523
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:47,225
The forest is such a dubious pIace.
It ellcits our expIoration.

524
00:36:47,436 --> 00:36:52,430
It is trees, and oxygen,
adventure, and enigma.

525
00:36:52,641 --> 00:36:57,875
It entices our curiosity.
It's quoted...

526
00:36:58,081 --> 00:37:02,950
in many fairy taIes, especially
the ones meant to scare us.

527
00:37:03,152 --> 00:37:07,590
These are the eyes that define
the concrete jungIe...

528
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:11,955
as a pIace of paranoia...

529
00:37:12,162 --> 00:37:15,689
and intrusion.
It somehow seems...

530
00:37:15,899 --> 00:37:18,424
we're constantIy being watched.

531
00:37:18,702 --> 00:37:20,762
It's aesthetically ridicuIous...

532
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:24,100
but I don't care,
'cause I have no ambition.

533
00:37:24,309 --> 00:37:29,246
This was a baIm to me
when I made it.

534
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,211
I've settIed many issues.

535
00:37:58,279 --> 00:37:59,906
- Is this Roberto's home?
- Yes.

536
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:01,479
Is he in?

537
00:38:06,955 --> 00:38:11,221
- Mr. Roberto, I brought a crew.
- WeIcome. Make yourseIves at home.

538
00:38:14,363 --> 00:38:15,921
Where do you work?

539
00:38:16,131 --> 00:38:18,726
I'm a street vendor, paI.

540
00:38:19,169 --> 00:38:23,162
I used to be well off,
I had severaI houses...

541
00:38:23,373 --> 00:38:26,638
and lived in Santa Tereza.

542
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,341
I've had severaI occupations
in life.

543
00:38:31,549 --> 00:38:33,608
I've bust my butt all my life.

544
00:38:33,818 --> 00:38:37,015
Whlle some drank many a beer,
I worked.

545
00:38:37,221 --> 00:38:39,655
I worked, day and night.

546
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:44,454
But, sadIy,
I suffered a brain stroke...

547
00:38:44,663 --> 00:38:47,427
which put me in a hospitaI
for 6 months...

548
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:49,500
paraIyzed.

549
00:38:50,302 --> 00:38:54,637
I'm 65, going into 66...

550
00:38:54,841 --> 00:38:57,571
and sick. Who will empIoy me
in such conditions?

551
00:38:57,777 --> 00:39:00,575
Young men find it hard
to get jobs...

552
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,511
Iet aIone an oId sick fart.

553
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:06,615
So men like me are unempIoyed.

554
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,947
would you give me a job?

555
00:39:09,456 --> 00:39:14,325
I have none... er...
but I know it's tough...

556
00:39:14,529 --> 00:39:18,329
You're very kind, thank you.

557
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,695
I'm right, aren't I?

558
00:39:21,035 --> 00:39:25,096
But that's the tough reality,
right, paI?

559
00:39:25,306 --> 00:39:27,605
- Are you married, separated?
- Married...

560
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:31,769
but we got separated some
3O years ago.

561
00:39:32,882 --> 00:39:37,114
I get along just fine
with my wife, though.

562
00:39:37,386 --> 00:39:39,651
We're separated, but we've never
gotten divorced.

563
00:39:39,856 --> 00:39:44,190
We're friends, and I wish
her well. Really well.

564
00:39:44,394 --> 00:39:47,557
I wish the best for her,
she's wonderfuI.

565
00:39:47,764 --> 00:39:49,528
It just didn't work out for us.

566
00:39:50,701 --> 00:39:52,362
Look...

567
00:39:53,704 --> 00:39:56,070
quite frankly...

568
00:39:56,374 --> 00:39:58,501
you'll laugh at me.

569
00:39:59,477 --> 00:40:02,208
I get all emotional.

570
00:40:02,514 --> 00:40:04,948
I cry for no reason,
I'm sensitive.

571
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:08,449
I'm from Itallan descent,
that's why.

572
00:40:09,955 --> 00:40:12,186
But the issue here is not
sensibllity.

573
00:40:12,392 --> 00:40:15,361
So, in answer to your question...

574
00:40:15,562 --> 00:40:21,023
I've really, really missed my
mother since she died.

575
00:40:21,234 --> 00:40:24,500
She was very oId, but I would like
she were by my side.

576
00:40:24,705 --> 00:40:27,037
I really miss my Iate father, too.

577
00:40:27,408 --> 00:40:30,775
Life goes on, of course.
We move on, right?

578
00:40:33,481 --> 00:40:36,178
You. Didn't you have parents, too?

579
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:40,478
Didn't you grow up,
get married, have chlldren?

580
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:44,352
Didn't you Ieave your parent's house
to raise your own famlly?

581
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:46,858
Doesn't life go on?

582
00:40:47,063 --> 00:40:49,031
We don't own our chlldren.

583
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,659
- Where are you from?
- BeIo Horizonte.

584
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:54,894
How was your chlldhood?

585
00:40:55,638 --> 00:40:57,629
I didn't have one.

586
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,776
I had no chlldhood.

587
00:41:01,612 --> 00:41:04,012
No chlldhood whatsoever.

588
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:05,442
What do you mean?

589
00:41:05,649 --> 00:41:10,144
Because I wasn't free
to be, like...

590
00:41:10,355 --> 00:41:14,951
a normaI kid, to play.
I had no freedom.

591
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:17,525
My father wouldn't let me.

592
00:41:18,029 --> 00:41:21,488
At 14, I gave birth,
and my chlldhood was over.

593
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,668
How did you get pregnant?

594
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:26,167
- Was it your 1st experience?
- Yeah.

595
00:41:26,372 --> 00:41:29,535
He was my first lover,
'cause I wasn't allowed to date.

596
00:41:29,742 --> 00:41:33,440
After schooI, my dad made
me go straight home.

597
00:41:33,647 --> 00:41:36,480
He'd have picked me up
at schooI...

598
00:41:36,683 --> 00:41:41,814
so I wouldn't meet men,
to protect me from the worId.

599
00:41:42,355 --> 00:41:43,947
And so it happened.

600
00:41:44,157 --> 00:41:49,095
On my first date,
I met my daughter's father...

601
00:41:49,297 --> 00:41:51,788
I had no idea what infatuation was.

602
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:54,934
I was 14, and thought
I was in love.

603
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:59,564
So I gave myself and got pregnant.
Damn!

604
00:41:59,775 --> 00:42:01,242
Did you get an abortion?

605
00:42:01,443 --> 00:42:06,540
No, my mom wouldn't let me.
I've never lled to her.

606
00:42:06,748 --> 00:42:10,515
I told her: "Something weird is
going on with my body."

607
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,622
"I think I'm pregnant."
Cause my hips grew wider...

608
00:42:14,824 --> 00:42:18,157
my body had changed.
So I told her...

609
00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:22,458
and she got desperate. My dad
didn't taIk to me for a whoIe year.

610
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:28,127
Afterwards, he reallzed
he was to bIame...

611
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:30,239
for my fate, so...

612
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:31,909
- So you gave birth?
- I did.

613
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,407
- To a boy or a girI?
- A girI.

614
00:42:33,612 --> 00:42:35,944
- What's her name?
- AIexia Carollne.

615
00:42:36,147 --> 00:42:38,411
Well, my first call girI date
was cooI.

616
00:42:38,617 --> 00:42:40,949
- Excuse me?
- My 1st call girI date.

617
00:42:41,152 --> 00:42:45,556
When I got paid all that money,
I freaked out.

618
00:42:45,758 --> 00:42:51,219
I'd never touched so much money.
Some R$ 15O reais! A fortune! Jeez!

619
00:42:51,497 --> 00:42:56,561
More than my monthIy pay.
I earned R$ 136 monthIy.

620
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:00,135
So I told my daughter:
"Let's hit the mall."

621
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:04,800
We pigged out on McDonald's
all day... ice cream... great!

622
00:43:05,112 --> 00:43:08,241
Today I wouldn't have the guts
to do that. Back then, it was fun.

623
00:43:08,449 --> 00:43:11,543
- What wouldn't you do?
- Spend R$ 15O at McDonald's .

624
00:43:11,753 --> 00:43:15,416
No, sir!
But that day I was a chlld...

625
00:43:15,623 --> 00:43:19,219
who's been given her favorite toy.
We stuffed our faces!

626
00:43:19,495 --> 00:43:21,520
What's your life like?

627
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,789
What's it like?

628
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:26,400
Well... not good.

629
00:43:26,602 --> 00:43:29,037
It's not "an easy life",
as some call it.

630
00:43:29,239 --> 00:43:34,336
It's disgusting to go out
on a date with a man...

631
00:43:34,544 --> 00:43:39,572
you might even like,
and be attracted to him...

632
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,809
and the next day, he wakes up
and gives you money.

633
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:45,386
That's not nice. And it's not
an easy money at all.

634
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:50,219
It's hard- earned...
under humiliations, and offenses.

635
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:54,864
It's humlliating... a lot.
That's not easy.

636
00:43:55,067 --> 00:43:59,231
Do you have pleasure at it?
Or fake it?

637
00:43:59,438 --> 00:44:03,535
I have to drink to be able to do it.
I can't work straight- faced.

638
00:44:03,743 --> 00:44:06,075
I drink all day,
'cause I have to work all day...

639
00:44:06,279 --> 00:44:10,375
to support my daughter,
my family.

640
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:16,887
So I drink to gather up the courage
I don't have when I'm sober.

641
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:20,593
Apart from work,
do you have a boyfriend?

642
00:44:23,063 --> 00:44:24,155
No.

643
00:44:24,364 --> 00:44:27,163
- Really?
- No. There's this guy...

644
00:44:27,368 --> 00:44:31,065
I'm stllI a teenager.
Hey, I'm only 2O.

645
00:44:31,272 --> 00:44:33,502
Say, do you enjoy life?

646
00:44:33,708 --> 00:44:35,608
I do.

647
00:44:35,944 --> 00:44:37,970
But I expect to die any moment.

648
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,047
I've already told my mom
she shouldn't cry...

649
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,514
'cause I'll better off than
most People here.

650
00:44:44,053 --> 00:44:46,715
- How come?
- When you die you're better off...

651
00:44:46,922 --> 00:44:51,883
than llving here, in this ugIy
worId with mean People.

652
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:54,859
So I say:
"I'll be happy when I die."

653
00:44:55,065 --> 00:44:57,966
But I don't want to die.
I love my life...

654
00:44:58,168 --> 00:45:01,764
but I know it will be the end
of my suffering.

655
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,898
I'll stop suffering and hustllng
for work. That's good!

656
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,203
Waking up at 7 am is horribIe.

657
00:45:08,546 --> 00:45:11,481
I mean it.
I don't like to work.

658
00:45:11,682 --> 00:45:16,643
I do it to support my daughter,
but if I could I'd be llving the good life.

659
00:45:16,855 --> 00:45:18,516
What do you mean?

660
00:45:18,724 --> 00:45:22,091
I'd get up at noon,
have Iunch cooked for me.

661
00:45:22,294 --> 00:45:24,058
I should marry a mllllonalre.

662
00:45:24,264 --> 00:45:26,164
Lunch on the tabIe...

663
00:45:26,633 --> 00:45:30,467
I would play with
my daughter all day...

664
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:34,731
taIk on the phone all day.
That's what I would like.

665
00:45:34,941 --> 00:45:38,810
How did you work up the courage
to give this testimony?

666
00:45:39,013 --> 00:45:41,140
You agreed to taIk...

667
00:45:41,348 --> 00:45:44,545
and this movie will be showing
at theaters. How come?

668
00:45:46,187 --> 00:45:49,055
It's no act of courage.

669
00:45:49,257 --> 00:45:51,122
It's normaI. I think so.

670
00:45:51,326 --> 00:45:54,454
It's quite normaI to me.

671
00:45:54,696 --> 00:45:57,529
Most People out there today...

672
00:45:57,732 --> 00:46:01,169
have a"b.C."mentallty.

673
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:04,464
That's history.
Now, anything goes.

674
00:46:04,674 --> 00:46:06,972
Babies are born Ieft and right.

675
00:46:07,176 --> 00:46:10,772
There's men with men,
women with women.

676
00:46:11,048 --> 00:46:13,812
There's 5O women for each man.

677
00:46:14,017 --> 00:46:16,042
Those things shouldn't be normaI.

678
00:46:16,253 --> 00:46:19,017
People steallng from People.
Pollticians, too.

679
00:46:19,223 --> 00:46:22,853
Thieves steallng from the poor.

680
00:46:23,061 --> 00:46:24,995
Poor thieves steallng the poor.
Rich thieves steallng the poor.

681
00:46:25,196 --> 00:46:27,027
Everyone's steallng, and...

682
00:46:27,232 --> 00:46:30,827
that's normaI. So why shouldn't
being a call girI?

683
00:46:31,035 --> 00:46:33,163
should People cast stones at me?

684
00:46:33,372 --> 00:46:36,068
I don't think so,
that's why I'm honest.

685
00:46:36,275 --> 00:46:40,473
I'm not ashamed. The whoIe
neighborhood and my family know it.

686
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:43,239
If you like me as I am, great.

687
00:46:43,949 --> 00:46:45,577
I don't see anything
unusuaI in that.

688
00:46:45,785 --> 00:46:47,844
Here's my Iast question.

689
00:46:48,054 --> 00:46:51,353
When your daughter grows up,
she's 6 now...

690
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:54,220
...will you tell her the truth?
- I will.

691
00:46:54,427 --> 00:46:57,056
I'm gonna tell my daughter
everything.

692
00:46:57,265 --> 00:47:00,928
When she turns 14, I'll put her
on the pllI. I've told my mom.

693
00:47:01,135 --> 00:47:03,797
Cause I ain't gonna do to her
as they did me.

694
00:47:04,005 --> 00:47:06,439
I'll tell her:
"Here's all I've done."

695
00:47:06,641 --> 00:47:10,271
I want neither her nor my sister
to do as I did.

696
00:47:10,479 --> 00:47:14,643
I'll earn enough to pay
for their studies for both of them.

697
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:19,515
I'll heIp, I'll pay to keep them
away from this life.

698
00:47:19,956 --> 00:47:23,619
But if that's what she wants,
I can't stop her.

699
00:47:23,826 --> 00:47:26,989
I'll suffer, like my mom did.
Sure, she's my daughter.

700
00:47:27,196 --> 00:47:31,634
But, all I can do is say:
"You're hurting me..."

701
00:47:31,835 --> 00:47:34,235
No. I can't ever say
that, cause...

702
00:47:34,438 --> 00:47:38,966
she'll say: "You hurt my grandma,
and didn't hear all this."

703
00:47:39,176 --> 00:47:40,575
- You said you lle a lot.
- I do!

704
00:47:40,778 --> 00:47:46,115
I lle a lot. When you lle,
you gotta belleve.

705
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:50,209
Really belleve,
so you must lle well.

706
00:47:50,422 --> 00:47:53,016
And I'm quite a llar.

707
00:47:53,525 --> 00:47:56,825
I even cry to convince
my own self of things.

708
00:47:57,029 --> 00:48:01,591
I lle so much, I end up belleving
my lles to be true.

709
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:05,938
So what were the lles you told
me in our chat?

710
00:48:06,139 --> 00:48:08,164
I didn't tell you any lles.

711
00:48:08,375 --> 00:48:10,434
I lled to you guys yesterday...

712
00:48:11,645 --> 00:48:14,910
cause I didn't wanna do
this interview.

713
00:48:15,115 --> 00:48:20,247
So I lled. "I'm going out,
and I'll be in Iate."

714
00:48:20,455 --> 00:48:24,323
The instant they Ieft,
I came back. I was scared.

715
00:48:24,525 --> 00:48:26,959
But today I didn't lle.
I forgot about it.

716
00:48:27,161 --> 00:48:30,825
I'd forgotten I was gonna do
this interview.

717
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:34,659
It'd sllpped my mind,
but yesterday I lled.

718
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:38,101
There you have it.
I'm an honest llar.

719
00:48:38,307 --> 00:48:40,902
I lle, but I also tell the truth.

720
00:50:14,078 --> 00:50:18,640
I'm shy.
And I stammer.

721
00:50:19,584 --> 00:50:21,575
- Excuse me?
- I'm shy...

722
00:50:21,786 --> 00:50:26,121
and I stammer.
This will be terribIe.

723
00:50:26,325 --> 00:50:28,987
- How oId are you?
- I'm 57.

724
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:31,253
- And your wife?
- 25.

725
00:50:31,463 --> 00:50:33,624
- Is it your first marriage?
- No, my second.

726
00:50:33,832 --> 00:50:36,734
- How many chlldren?
- Two.

727
00:50:36,936 --> 00:50:40,428
I've had one son with
my first wife...

728
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,771
and I'm also a singIe father.
I have a 31- yr- oId son.

729
00:50:45,979 --> 00:50:48,676
- What's a"singIe father"?
- Well...

730
00:50:49,116 --> 00:50:54,213
in my 2Os,
I knocked up a girI.

731
00:50:54,955 --> 00:50:58,653
I fathered the baby.
So I was a singIe father.

732
00:50:59,461 --> 00:51:01,088
At what age did you start working?

733
00:51:01,296 --> 00:51:05,562
- When I was 8.
- Doing what?

734
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:09,168
I soId peanuts
and snacks in trains.

735
00:51:09,905 --> 00:51:13,774
I was a shoeshine for 2 weeks,
but I didn't like it.

736
00:51:13,976 --> 00:51:18,003
Then I got a job at a supermarket.

737
00:51:18,748 --> 00:51:22,981
Before that, I'd worked for
the City Morgue...

738
00:51:23,187 --> 00:51:27,385
picking up bodies out of the streets
hit and run victims.

739
00:51:27,591 --> 00:51:31,550
My mom often couldn't put food
on our tabIe.

740
00:51:31,762 --> 00:51:33,822
Any check, ticket...

741
00:51:34,032 --> 00:51:37,866
or coupon I got at schooI...

742
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:41,061
for my bus fares...

743
00:51:41,272 --> 00:51:47,109
cause I didn't pay for schooI
I'd give my mom to buy us food.

744
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:50,339
How come you didn't stammer
once during our conversation?

745
00:51:50,549 --> 00:51:54,815
Beats me.
God spoke through me.

746
00:51:56,756 --> 00:51:58,417
It was wonderfuI.

747
00:51:58,625 --> 00:52:00,354
Was it?
Why is that?

748
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,223
Because I had an
opportunity to...

749
00:52:04,431 --> 00:52:08,266
speak publlcIy about...

750
00:52:09,003 --> 00:52:12,871
my chlldhood.
Though it was tough...

751
00:52:13,074 --> 00:52:18,512
and rather bitter...

752
00:52:20,115 --> 00:52:26,076
I never turned to coke,
nor drinking.

753
00:52:26,288 --> 00:52:28,950
I've aIways kept my dignity
about me.

754
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:33,423
I've got no chip on my shoulders.

755
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:36,258
I'm convinced
I was a good son.

756
00:52:37,433 --> 00:52:40,231
My poor mom died on my Iap,
in Brasílla.

757
00:52:40,436 --> 00:52:45,067
I used to traveI to Brasílla
to visit her.

758
00:52:45,476 --> 00:52:51,039
At times, I'd just come back
from my annuaI vacations...

759
00:52:51,248 --> 00:52:55,447
and I'd ask my manager:
"Let me go see my dying mother."

760
00:52:55,820 --> 00:53:01,588
Once, upon my return,
I thanked him: "Listen, Pedro..."

761
00:53:01,793 --> 00:53:04,353
His name is Pietro,
he's Itallan.

762
00:53:04,562 --> 00:53:08,226
"Pietro, I'll make up for missing
work in the future."

763
00:53:08,434 --> 00:53:11,870
"I had to go.
Thank you for granting me Ieave."

764
00:53:12,071 --> 00:53:15,472
He said:
"You don't have to thank me."

765
00:53:15,841 --> 00:53:19,334
I'll never forget his words.
"You don't have to thank me."

766
00:53:19,546 --> 00:53:23,209
"You traveled not because you had
to, but because you deserved it."

767
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:32,290
I was very happy.

768
00:53:33,728 --> 00:53:39,894
I had no idea he held me,
as an employee...

769
00:53:40,101 --> 00:53:45,335
in such high esteem.

770
00:53:48,043 --> 00:53:52,743
I worked with Pietro
for 15 years.

771
00:53:53,149 --> 00:53:56,175
Are you very emotional?

772
00:53:56,853 --> 00:53:58,878
I'm a softie.

773
00:53:59,089 --> 00:54:00,920
Is that good or bad?

774
00:54:04,462 --> 00:54:06,828
Men don't cry.

775
00:54:08,466 --> 00:54:11,264
Just because he cries...

776
00:54:12,737 --> 00:54:14,762
a man...

777
00:54:15,474 --> 00:54:17,942
I've got nothing to hide.

778
00:54:18,844 --> 00:54:21,210
This is me.

779
00:54:25,016 --> 00:54:27,212
This is me.

780
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,785
No, Beth.
I'll ask them to stop.

781
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,557
There's no doorbell.

782
00:54:39,099 --> 00:54:42,262
Sir, excuse me again.

783
00:54:42,469 --> 00:54:47,839
We're interviewing your
next-door neighbor in #111...

784
00:54:49,376 --> 00:54:54,246
and it's tough.
We got a film crew here. Look.

785
00:54:55,617 --> 00:54:58,450
See?
We're working here.

786
00:54:58,653 --> 00:55:01,646
If you guys could stop
for just a sec?

787
00:55:01,857 --> 00:55:05,452
Can you stop just for a sec?
Thanks.

788
00:55:05,661 --> 00:55:08,095
Ellska, a half hour
is not a sec.

789
00:55:08,297 --> 00:55:11,733
Now keep going, keep going.
Who knows them?

790
00:55:17,808 --> 00:55:21,972
Hi, Lucinha. How are you?
Is Rita here?

791
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:24,978
We'd been waiting for you.
Make yourselves at home.

792
00:55:28,286 --> 00:55:30,345
How long have you lived
at the Master?

793
00:55:30,555 --> 00:55:35,185
4O years, since I was born.

794
00:55:35,426 --> 00:55:38,157
Were you born right here
in this studio?

795
00:55:38,363 --> 00:55:40,888
That's right.

796
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:43,897
At night, I can find my way
in the dark.

797
00:55:44,102 --> 00:55:47,197
I go to the bathroom
with the llghts out...

798
00:55:47,407 --> 00:55:49,671
but she gets lost.

799
00:55:49,876 --> 00:55:52,310
Or my mom will enter
the bathroom...

800
00:55:52,512 --> 00:55:55,208
as I'm Ieaving,
and we scare each other.

801
00:55:56,216 --> 00:55:58,013
We aIways walk around
in the dark.

802
00:55:58,218 --> 00:56:01,211
- Does you mom sleep in there?
- Yes. I sleep here.

803
00:56:01,422 --> 00:56:03,219
Where do you sleep?

804
00:56:03,424 --> 00:56:05,289
That's a sofa- bed.

805
00:56:05,693 --> 00:56:09,220
- A bunker bed?
- No, a pullout bed.

806
00:56:12,534 --> 00:56:15,526
- Where are you headed for?
- The Publlc Security office...

807
00:56:15,737 --> 00:56:16,999
where I used to work.

808
00:56:17,205 --> 00:56:19,435
- The pollce.
- You worked for the pollce?

809
00:56:19,641 --> 00:56:23,408
I'm a retired pollce officer.

810
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,638
You going downtown?
Don't forget your key.

811
00:56:26,015 --> 00:56:27,607
Don't take too long.

812
00:56:28,217 --> 00:56:31,983
- Did you go to schooI?
- Yep, untll high schooI.

813
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:37,456
I've had jobs, but I've quit
to take better care of mom.

814
00:56:38,028 --> 00:56:39,893
I quit working 5 years ago.

815
00:56:40,097 --> 00:56:42,725
Do you get along well,
or what?

816
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:45,199
Say something, help me out!

817
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:50,165
We have the occasional quarrel.

818
00:56:50,375 --> 00:56:55,745
That's life. We're the same sign.

819
00:56:55,947 --> 00:56:59,179
But I'm more...
We're Leo.

820
00:56:59,752 --> 00:57:03,244
She's a bit more...
I avoid conflicts.

821
00:57:03,455 --> 00:57:06,720
Ritinha is a good roommate.
She's easy- going.

822
00:57:08,295 --> 00:57:11,526
- What was that?
- I'm easy-going.

823
00:57:12,532 --> 00:57:15,262
And how about her, Rita?
Level with me.

824
00:57:15,468 --> 00:57:18,494
She's got more of a temper.

825
00:57:18,705 --> 00:57:21,368
I've got a temper, I'm stubborn...

826
00:57:21,576 --> 00:57:25,706
I admit it, I'm difficult,
indeed.

827
00:57:25,913 --> 00:57:27,778
But I'm a nice person.

828
00:57:27,982 --> 00:57:30,883
When People need me,
I'm there for them.

829
00:57:31,085 --> 00:57:36,217
I'm always there for my friends.

830
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:38,058
- Ain't it right?
- Yeah.

831
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,694
Really, Rita? You may disagree.

832
00:57:40,896 --> 00:57:45,493
No, really. She's a friend
for all times.

833
00:57:45,702 --> 00:57:47,795
And would you live
together forever?

834
00:57:48,004 --> 00:57:50,973
I would. We get along great.

835
00:57:51,174 --> 00:57:54,542
She's learning to cook now,
which is hard...

836
00:57:54,745 --> 00:57:57,839
...cause she's not too keen on it.
- What about the house chores?

837
00:57:58,048 --> 00:58:00,744
I do most of them.

838
00:58:00,951 --> 00:58:04,250
But she heIps with the cleaning.

839
00:58:04,455 --> 00:58:06,117
I prefer to cook.

840
00:58:13,365 --> 00:58:15,333
Are you preparing lunch?

841
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:18,059
Just a quick bite.

842
00:58:22,441 --> 00:58:25,171
- Excuse us.
- Make yourseIves at home.

843
00:58:33,286 --> 00:58:35,049
Didn't you say you'd lost
your father?

844
00:58:35,255 --> 00:58:37,485
I haven't lost him. He's missing!

845
00:58:37,691 --> 00:58:40,855
- Tell me.
- 1931, haven't I told you?

846
00:58:41,429 --> 00:58:44,262
Two months after I was born,
he kissed me...

847
00:58:44,465 --> 00:58:47,559
left for Belém, and never
came back.

848
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:51,728
He went to Fortaleza first.
Then boarded a ship to the Amazon...

849
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:55,307
and disappeared eaten by cannibals
in the Amazon, I don't know.

850
00:58:55,611 --> 00:59:00,480
People would ask:
"Where's your old man?"

851
00:59:00,683 --> 00:59:02,548
I'd say: "He's gone."

852
00:59:02,751 --> 00:59:05,915
That would hurt me, and
my mother would tell me:

853
00:59:06,122 --> 00:59:10,821
"Son, you daddy's gone.""He went to
Belém, and has been gone ever since."

854
00:59:11,061 --> 00:59:14,861
- She was father and mother to me.
- How did she support you both?

855
00:59:15,066 --> 00:59:20,834
She had a stall in a street fair,
she soId knickknacks.

856
00:59:21,072 --> 00:59:24,166
She was quite a smart lady.

857
00:59:24,375 --> 00:59:27,072
- What did you use to do?
- Here?

858
00:59:27,279 --> 00:59:30,248
I've had many jobs.
I've soId furniture...

859
00:59:30,515 --> 00:59:33,279
at a shop in Catete St.
I've been a bartender...

860
00:59:33,552 --> 00:59:38,252
then worked at a carpet shop...

861
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:41,656
at a fabric store...

862
00:59:43,563 --> 00:59:46,999
Since I was a kid,
I've written poetry.

863
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,031
I used to be quite inspired.

864
00:59:49,235 --> 00:59:51,295
Here...

865
00:59:52,539 --> 00:59:56,407
I started writing sambas...

866
00:59:56,844 --> 01:00:00,177
and got the inspiration
to write "Favela".

867
01:00:02,584 --> 01:00:04,176
Has "Favela"ever been recorded?

868
01:00:04,385 --> 01:00:09,345
Yes, by Marisa Gata Mansa,
in 196O-61...

869
01:00:09,557 --> 01:00:13,153
back when she was a star.

870
01:00:14,964 --> 01:00:18,923
Only the favela's residents

871
01:00:19,135 --> 01:00:21,467
Are aware of its enchantment

872
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:24,265
Are aware of its enchantment

873
01:00:25,008 --> 01:00:30,742
Gazing out at the moon
We see it's beautiful

874
01:00:30,947 --> 01:00:33,347
And the favela seems
More blissful

875
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:38,113
The only true samba
ls that made in a terreiro

876
01:00:38,322 --> 01:00:40,790
A dirt-covered, sacred ground

877
01:00:40,992 --> 01:00:45,326
The tambourine keeps the beat
The mulattas shake their hips

878
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:47,726
All is settled all around

879
01:00:47,933 --> 01:00:52,393
People are tired of
working all day

880
01:00:52,604 --> 01:00:56,973
Carryingwateron their heads,
And cooking on hot plates

881
01:00:57,176 --> 01:01:01,375
When the circle is complete
People surrenderto the beat

882
01:01:01,581 --> 01:01:06,177
And even the moon comes
to a standstill

883
01:01:06,386 --> 01:01:11,620
l suspect the moon agrees
with me:

884
01:01:11,826 --> 01:01:17,230
They suffer all day,but doing
the samba at night, they are happy

885
01:01:17,431 --> 01:01:20,832
Only the favela's residents

886
01:01:21,035 --> 01:01:23,095
Are aware of its enchantment

887
01:01:25,607 --> 01:01:28,269
I came to the Master 4 years ago.

888
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,967
Funny,
I said "came"to the Master...

889
01:01:31,179 --> 01:01:35,412
cause the first time
I came in here, I got scared.

890
01:01:35,618 --> 01:01:38,644
"God no! Not another one of those
Copacabana buildings!"

891
01:01:38,855 --> 01:01:42,313
I had sort of "inhabited",
or eIse...

892
01:01:42,525 --> 01:01:46,826
been a frequent visitor
to a studio nearby.

893
01:01:47,030 --> 01:01:48,895
I got nervous.

894
01:01:49,099 --> 01:01:52,535
I saw this pIace and said:
"Another one of those buildings".

895
01:01:53,904 --> 01:01:59,866
ObviousIy, I was brought here by
emotional reasons, and stayed.

896
01:02:02,881 --> 01:02:06,112
Its diversity of tenants...

897
01:02:06,317 --> 01:02:08,309
doesn't bother me.

898
01:02:10,756 --> 01:02:15,523
But its high popuIation
density does.

899
01:02:15,728 --> 01:02:18,561
It's an oppressive number
of People... a lot of them!

900
01:02:18,764 --> 01:02:23,202
Their diversity is not a probIem,
it's what's interesting.

901
01:02:23,403 --> 01:02:27,737
In the Iate'7Os,
I used to come here...

902
01:02:27,941 --> 01:02:31,878
to hang out at the oId Sótão...

903
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:34,070
a night cIub in AIaska Gallery.

904
01:02:34,282 --> 01:02:36,182
Back then, there was a mix of...

905
01:02:36,384 --> 01:02:39,353
sIeaziness and gIamour,
both in one pIace.

906
01:02:39,553 --> 01:02:42,647
I couldn't tell them apart in
the short time I spent here...

907
01:02:42,858 --> 01:02:45,759
I didn't know better.
I feIt I was attending...

908
01:02:45,961 --> 01:02:50,864
a CarnivaI Ball.
all was a fantasy.

909
01:02:51,066 --> 01:02:54,331
- You lived eIsewhere?
- Far from here.

910
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:57,062
None of this really affected me.
What bothers me today...

911
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:02,301
is that Copacabana's reality
affects most People.

912
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:06,506
You go out into the streets
and see terribIe things:

913
01:03:06,717 --> 01:03:10,278
kids sniffing gIue,
maIe and femaIe prostitutes...

914
01:03:11,055 --> 01:03:13,683
drug deaIers, etc.,
that's our reality.

915
01:03:13,891 --> 01:03:16,655
It's too much, for God's sake!

916
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:21,764
I don't think sociaI evlls should
be eradicated...

917
01:03:21,967 --> 01:03:26,267
and treated to create an
ascetic society. But this is too much.

918
01:03:26,504 --> 01:03:29,303
Natallna, how do you
like Copacabana?

919
01:03:29,508 --> 01:03:32,500
You work at two homes.

920
01:03:32,712 --> 01:03:34,737
Tell us...

921
01:03:34,981 --> 01:03:38,644
about Copacabana's mayhem.

922
01:03:38,851 --> 01:03:40,341
Look this way, and tell us.

923
01:03:40,554 --> 01:03:42,715
Be yourself.

924
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:45,151
It's chaotic, huh?

925
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:47,384
I prefer quieter pIaces.

926
01:03:48,061 --> 01:03:51,497
I'd rather go straight home
after work.

927
01:03:51,698 --> 01:03:55,362
Or traveI to Minas to visit
my mother.

928
01:03:56,004 --> 01:03:58,871
I'd rather stay home.
On weekends...

929
01:03:59,073 --> 01:04:03,373
or weekdays, I go to church.
I'm a PentecostaI.

930
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:37,000
Happy Birthday to you

931
01:04:37,212 --> 01:04:40,614
Happy Birthday to you

932
01:04:40,816 --> 01:04:44,252
Happy Birthday,Geicy

933
01:04:44,453 --> 01:04:48,219
Happy Birthday to you

934
01:04:50,227 --> 01:04:53,253
- Do you live here by yourself?
- Yes, I do.

935
01:04:53,463 --> 01:04:57,365
- Don't you feeI IoneIy?
- Very much so, very often.

936
01:04:57,567 --> 01:05:01,298
But I've got an aunt
who lives nearby...

937
01:05:01,505 --> 01:05:03,439
and reIatives in BeIo Horizonte.

938
01:05:03,641 --> 01:05:06,166
My kids live in the US,
all of them.

939
01:05:06,377 --> 01:05:11,076
- What are some of your hobbies?
- Going to the beach and waIking.

940
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:14,446
- You're in good shape.
- Not yet, because of...

941
01:05:14,653 --> 01:05:18,817
...my domestic accident.
- What happened exactIy?

942
01:05:19,024 --> 01:05:20,924
It was Aprll 23.

943
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:25,154
I came in and, as you can see,
the pIace is all carpeted...

944
01:05:25,365 --> 01:05:30,803
except for the tlled entrance.
I sllpped and hit my head.

945
01:05:31,004 --> 01:05:34,633
I must've fainted,
I don't remember.

946
01:05:34,841 --> 01:05:40,576
I moaned, and a neighbor passing
outside heard me...

947
01:05:40,781 --> 01:05:43,773
and knew it:
"Something's wrong with Henrique."

948
01:05:43,984 --> 01:05:48,251
What if nobody happened
to be passing by?

949
01:05:48,456 --> 01:05:50,151
I would be dead.

950
01:05:50,825 --> 01:05:54,056
I can't quite describe it to you.

951
01:05:54,262 --> 01:05:56,560
It was a... a...

952
01:05:57,732 --> 01:05:59,530
I don't have words to describe it.

953
01:05:59,735 --> 01:06:02,727
3, 4 hours Iater,
it would've been too Iate.

954
01:06:03,472 --> 01:06:05,770
- Do you have 3 chlldren?
- I do.

955
01:06:05,975 --> 01:06:08,705
- I have 2 sons and one daughter.
- What do they do?

956
01:06:08,911 --> 01:06:15,147
My eIdest is VP of an oll company
in Lafayette, Louisianna.

957
01:06:15,352 --> 01:06:21,188
My other son is
a computer anaIyst.

958
01:06:21,391 --> 01:06:24,555
And my daughter Rebeca drives...

959
01:06:24,762 --> 01:06:31,429
one of those 18- wheeIers big rigs
for FederaI Express.

960
01:06:33,271 --> 01:06:35,331
- Is your wife deceased?
- Yes, she is.

961
01:06:35,541 --> 01:06:39,568
- For how long?
- She passed away 6 years ago.

962
01:06:39,778 --> 01:06:41,177
Was it tough for you?

963
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:46,318
It was, indeed.
We were very cIose.

964
01:06:46,519 --> 01:06:49,317
Whose idea was it to move
to the US?

965
01:06:49,522 --> 01:06:55,688
I'd aIways wanted to
against my family's will.

966
01:06:56,029 --> 01:07:02,697
I was 17, and my uncIe,
who had acquaintances...

967
01:07:02,903 --> 01:07:05,235
in high pIaces,
got me a fake ID.

968
01:07:05,439 --> 01:07:09,308
With only my passport, R$ 2OO reais,
and no contacts, I moved to the US.

969
01:07:09,511 --> 01:07:11,706
I was a dish- washer at first.

970
01:07:11,913 --> 01:07:16,316
One day, I happened to be at
the IdIewlld Airport...

971
01:07:16,518 --> 01:07:20,250
an oId US airport.

972
01:07:20,456 --> 01:07:23,857
A man asked me
if I were Puerto- Rican.

973
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:29,191
"Brazilian", I said, and he told me
of a job for Portuguese speakers.

974
01:07:29,399 --> 01:07:31,128
The next day, I was empIoyed.

975
01:07:31,334 --> 01:07:33,462
- By what company?
- Pan American.

976
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:36,230
You heId an important position
in the US.

977
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:40,206
You must've had big savings
and a pension pIan.

978
01:07:40,411 --> 01:07:44,280
- Why live in such a small pIace?
- I didn't save much.

979
01:07:44,482 --> 01:07:46,279
all I got I gave to my chlldren.

980
01:07:46,484 --> 01:07:49,248
I gave my house and car
to my son.

981
01:07:49,454 --> 01:07:54,654
My retirement pay comes from
the US but it's no big deaI.

982
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:59,320
It's enough to support myself
here, but not what People think:

983
01:07:59,532 --> 01:08:02,262
"Oh, he gets paid in dollars,
he must be rich."

984
01:08:02,468 --> 01:08:05,665
No, absoIuteIy not.

985
01:08:05,871 --> 01:08:09,672
HonestIy, if I lived in the US...

986
01:08:09,876 --> 01:08:13,004
with my retirement pay,
I'd be worse off.

987
01:08:13,213 --> 01:08:17,274
How did you meet Frank Sinatra?

988
01:08:17,484 --> 01:08:20,750
That's interesting.
Through my company...

989
01:08:20,955 --> 01:08:24,186
when the astronauts came back
from the Moon...

990
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:28,852
and a reception was thrown for
them at Houston's Astrodome...

991
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:31,123
I was incIuded in the guest llst.

992
01:08:31,333 --> 01:08:33,460
I sat down in the arena...

993
01:08:33,669 --> 01:08:38,470
and there he was,
sitting 4 or 5 chairs away...

994
01:08:38,674 --> 01:08:41,508
sided by thugs of the...

995
01:08:41,711 --> 01:08:44,475
- Mob?
- Sitting with the mob.

996
01:08:44,681 --> 01:08:47,582
I went up to greet him:

997
01:08:47,784 --> 01:08:49,649
"How are you doing,
'BIue Eyes'? "

998
01:08:49,853 --> 01:08:54,291
He smlled, we shook hands,
and started chatting.

999
01:08:54,492 --> 01:09:00,431
Dione Warwick was there...
many ceIebrities.

1000
01:09:00,631 --> 01:09:03,429
I told him I was crazy about
his song, "My Way".

1001
01:09:03,634 --> 01:09:06,399
He said: "Come up on stage and
sing two llnes with me."

1002
01:09:06,605 --> 01:09:09,904
I went up on stage,
and sang two llnes with him.

1003
01:09:10,108 --> 01:09:13,168
Did he tell the audience
what you were doing there?

1004
01:09:13,378 --> 01:09:17,782
He said: "This is a good friend
I just met. He's Brazilian...

1005
01:09:17,984 --> 01:09:20,885
he works for the SAS,
and he'll sing with me."

1006
01:09:21,087 --> 01:09:23,681
-  Why "My Way"?
- "My Way"is my life story.

1007
01:09:23,890 --> 01:09:28,419
- Why? Tell me.
- The Iyrics describe my life.

1008
01:09:28,629 --> 01:09:33,589
He did all he could've done...

1009
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,963
traveIed West and East...

1010
01:09:37,171 --> 01:09:39,834
went to Europe,
went everywhere...

1011
01:09:40,041 --> 01:09:42,032
but he did it his way.

1012
01:09:42,243 --> 01:09:44,507
Right or wrong,
he did it his way.

1013
01:09:44,712 --> 01:09:48,045
And I, for my turn,
did the same.

1014
01:09:48,249 --> 01:09:51,686
I moved to the US with moxie only
and did it my way.

1015
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:54,720
I made it there,
and I did it my way.

1016
01:09:54,924 --> 01:10:00,123
Two Saturdays a week, I play
that song for the People outside.

1017
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:05,097
They waIk by and say:
"Okay, okay!"

1018
01:10:05,302 --> 01:10:08,760
- "Two Saturdays a week?"
- Sorry, every other Saturday.

1019
01:10:08,972 --> 01:10:13,103
- At what time?
- Around 1O am.

1020
01:10:16,047 --> 01:10:18,811
I'll turn it up!
Ready?

1021
01:13:40,301 --> 01:13:42,600
That's right, gentlemen.

1022
01:13:43,505 --> 01:13:46,633
The voice could be better, but...

1023
01:13:47,843 --> 01:13:50,437
next time it will be.

1024
01:13:51,113 --> 01:13:55,016
That was in the 6Os,
a long time ago.

1025
01:13:58,221 --> 01:14:01,156
I get emotional llstening to it.

1026
01:14:02,025 --> 01:14:07,328
I get... shivers.

1027
01:14:10,367 --> 01:14:13,598
That's it? Is it over?

1028
01:15:07,296 --> 01:15:12,131
If I hear: "Fernando José!",
it's GIobo TV.

1029
01:15:12,334 --> 01:15:13,802
"Fernando!", it's my family.

1030
01:15:14,004 --> 01:15:17,167
"BaIdy!", my Copacabana friends.

1031
01:15:17,374 --> 01:15:20,775
I love it here. I attend to
oId Iadies on the beach...

1032
01:15:20,977 --> 01:15:23,445
on the sidewaIk, where I waIk
every day, rellgiousIy...

1033
01:15:23,647 --> 01:15:26,776
even if I'm hurting here,
and there.

1034
01:15:26,984 --> 01:15:29,384
- How oId are you?
- I'm 73.

1035
01:15:29,587 --> 01:15:31,714
Do you get along with all here?

1036
01:15:31,923 --> 01:15:35,188
I do. I know everyone.
For instance, I care for...

1037
01:15:35,393 --> 01:15:39,490
an eIderIy coupIe who lives
across the hall.

1038
01:15:39,698 --> 01:15:42,599
They have no phones,
no doorbell.

1039
01:15:42,801 --> 01:15:47,067
He's scIerotic,
and she's very llI.

1040
01:15:47,272 --> 01:15:49,332
He's way past 9O...

1041
01:15:49,542 --> 01:15:51,533
so I care for both of them.

1042
01:15:51,744 --> 01:15:56,477
- Have you acted in many soaps?
- Over 3O soap operas.

1043
01:15:56,683 --> 01:16:00,211
- And movies?
- 62 movies.

1044
01:16:00,788 --> 01:16:02,915
Back in the oId era of
sex sIapstick comedies...

1045
01:16:03,123 --> 01:16:06,183
but I've also acted in an
award- winning film.

1046
01:16:06,393 --> 01:16:09,556
I've had great times,
I miss them dearIy.

1047
01:16:09,763 --> 01:16:14,167
If I hadn't gotten deaf on
the set of The CIáudia Affair...

1048
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:16,860
I was to get shot at my nape...

1049
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:19,734
with a squib this big.

1050
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:24,043
The EFX guy sent a stand- in
that day...

1051
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:27,738
who used a bigger charge.

1052
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:31,947
So when I got shot on the set,
I knew it:

1053
01:16:32,154 --> 01:16:35,318
"I'm fucked!",
but I did the whoIe scene.

1054
01:16:35,525 --> 01:16:39,325
I had a fake bIood capsuIe
in my mouth...

1055
01:16:39,529 --> 01:16:44,296
and spat it on the wall.

1056
01:16:44,501 --> 01:16:48,563
The shot came out beautifuI, but I
couldn't hear a thing afterwards.

1057
01:17:07,292 --> 01:17:09,625
WeIcome.

1058
01:17:17,037 --> 01:17:20,838
This is DaIva,
the mistress of the house.

1059
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:25,470
This is our home.
Make yourseIves at home.

1060
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:32,648
This is just a simpIe thing
we prepared to weIcome you.

1061
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:38,888
Just a simpIe thing
to weIcome you.

1062
01:17:39,227 --> 01:17:40,694
Where do you work now?

1063
01:17:40,896 --> 01:17:43,228
I'm an accountant,
working freeIance...

1064
01:17:43,433 --> 01:17:47,460
since I sadIy joined the ranks
of the unempIoyed.

1065
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:50,468
One's got to take meniaI tasks
to survive:

1066
01:17:50,673 --> 01:17:54,074
I'm a dispatcher,
a freeIance accountant...

1067
01:17:54,277 --> 01:17:57,441
I soIve People's red- tape
at the DMV.

1068
01:17:57,648 --> 01:18:01,607
OddIy, what heIped me when
I set up home in Copacabana...

1069
01:18:01,819 --> 01:18:04,083
was having lived
in the North city area.

1070
01:18:04,288 --> 01:18:06,313
I feIt out of pIace here.

1071
01:18:06,524 --> 01:18:08,788
I enjoyed having a beer
with my buddies.

1072
01:18:08,993 --> 01:18:11,154
There are picket- fence
houses there...

1073
01:18:11,362 --> 01:18:14,331
we greet everyone:
"Hi, Maria. Hi, João."

1074
01:18:14,532 --> 01:18:16,329
Here we Iock ourseIves in...

1075
01:18:16,534 --> 01:18:20,995
and only know a neighbor's died
if he's missing for more than...

1076
01:18:21,207 --> 01:18:25,075
Henrique, our neighbor and
good friend, a US Navy Major...

1077
01:18:25,277 --> 01:18:27,507
who had a fall at home...

1078
01:18:27,713 --> 01:18:30,410
disappeared for 2 days,
and he's allve to tell the taIe...

1079
01:18:30,617 --> 01:18:35,645
cause he dragged himself to the
phone to call for heIp, right?

1080
01:18:35,856 --> 01:18:39,019
He was rescued, and thus we heard
he'd had an accident.

1081
01:18:39,226 --> 01:18:41,092
In my oId neighborhood,
we'd say:

1082
01:18:41,295 --> 01:18:43,627
"I haven't seen Maria today.
What's up?"

1083
01:18:43,831 --> 01:18:45,822
Then we'd knock on
the neighbor's door.

1084
01:18:46,033 --> 01:18:47,933
I gotta tell you.

1085
01:18:48,136 --> 01:18:51,037
Just because I've lived here
for the past 7 years...

1086
01:18:51,239 --> 01:18:53,504
my former neighbors
discriminate me.

1087
01:18:53,709 --> 01:18:56,041
- Why?
- They say I'm rich.

1088
01:18:56,245 --> 01:18:58,338
"Oh, he lives in Copacabana."

1089
01:18:58,614 --> 01:19:02,175
My dad is a tough German guy...

1090
01:19:02,384 --> 01:19:06,651
with all the cons attached to it.

1091
01:19:06,856 --> 01:19:11,259
So he wasn't too happy to have
a grandson so soon.

1092
01:19:12,695 --> 01:19:15,859
What do you mean,
"a grandson so soon?"

1093
01:19:16,967 --> 01:19:18,264
Did it just happen?

1094
01:19:18,469 --> 01:19:23,839
Yes. I found out too Iate
and had Lucas.

1095
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:28,001
Because you wanted to,
or you had to?

1096
01:19:28,547 --> 01:19:33,883
Thanks to a series
of coincidences...

1097
01:19:34,085 --> 01:19:37,680
I was Ieft with no other choice.

1098
01:19:37,889 --> 01:19:39,755
Did you live with your kid's
father after his birth?

1099
01:19:39,959 --> 01:19:41,449
For a short whlle.

1100
01:19:41,661 --> 01:19:44,596
- Things didn't work out?
- CertainIy not.

1101
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:50,201
So your father wasn't too happy
with your pregnancy?

1102
01:19:50,404 --> 01:19:54,636
I think he had other pIans for me...

1103
01:19:54,842 --> 01:19:58,835
so he acted...

1104
01:20:00,848 --> 01:20:04,285
I don't know.
I think he acted a bit...

1105
01:20:05,386 --> 01:20:08,014
I don't know... a bit hasty.

1106
01:20:08,223 --> 01:20:10,214
Lucas wasn't even 1 yr. oId,
when he...

1107
01:20:10,425 --> 01:20:16,331
handed me a small sum of
money to buy an apartment.

1108
01:20:16,532 --> 01:20:17,897
- Did he give you the money?
- He did.

1109
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:21,934
- As if saying: "Move out", right?
- Right.

1110
01:20:22,204 --> 01:20:25,333
Did you use to live in a big,
spacious home?

1111
01:20:25,542 --> 01:20:26,600
Big, right.

1112
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:29,904
How did you feeI moving
into this studio?

1113
01:20:30,113 --> 01:20:32,206
CIaustrophobic.

1114
01:20:32,415 --> 01:20:36,546
And really scared.
I was 18 when I moved in...

1115
01:20:36,754 --> 01:20:41,282
not even 19, and brought
only my room's furniture.

1116
01:20:41,492 --> 01:20:47,124
I'd call and ask him if I could go
sleep there but he wouldn't let me.

1117
01:20:47,331 --> 01:20:49,596
I really hated it here.

1118
01:20:49,801 --> 01:20:51,962
- And now?
- Now it's my home.

1119
01:20:52,271 --> 01:20:54,239
What bothers me is the noise.

1120
01:20:54,439 --> 01:20:59,399
Hearing other Peoples' lives
coming in through the vent...

1121
01:20:59,612 --> 01:21:02,103
...through the windows.
- Really?

1122
01:21:02,315 --> 01:21:06,115
- Yeah. Cris' seen it.
- For reaI?

1123
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:10,415
For reaI. I know when the
downstairs neighbors are cooking...

1124
01:21:10,623 --> 01:21:13,525
or arguing, or fighting
with their chlldren.

1125
01:21:13,727 --> 01:21:16,423
You hear it through
the kitchen vent?

1126
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:22,364
- I'd love to insulate that.
- Do you hear much yelling, fighting?

1127
01:21:22,569 --> 01:21:26,404
It's annoying.
I tell Lucas...

1128
01:21:26,608 --> 01:21:28,769
I teach him that's wrong,
you know...

1129
01:21:28,977 --> 01:21:31,673
but it's constant, so...

1130
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:35,908
- How do you like Copacabana?
- It's terrifying.

1131
01:21:36,118 --> 01:21:38,746
Some days...

1132
01:21:38,955 --> 01:21:42,288
this meIting pot is
anthropoIogically interesting...

1133
01:21:42,491 --> 01:21:48,362
but, above all, I think I'd like
to kllI passersby who bump into me...

1134
01:21:48,565 --> 01:21:50,760
its street vendors,
its chaotic traffic.

1135
01:22:01,579 --> 01:22:04,241
I was born in Petrópolls and...

1136
01:22:04,449 --> 01:22:08,853
HEAD DOORMAN
was adopted with 8 months...

1137
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:12,922
by a family who raised me.
My adoptive mother is allve.

1138
01:22:13,125 --> 01:22:16,959
I haven't heard from my
bioIogicaI mother in 2O years.

1139
01:22:17,162 --> 01:22:23,534
I never knew my father,
but I've aIways feIt that...

1140
01:22:23,737 --> 01:22:27,104
one of these days,
a secret will be reveaIed:

1141
01:22:27,307 --> 01:22:31,676
that my Iate adoptive father
was my reaI father.

1142
01:22:31,878 --> 01:22:35,315
Cause we are identical...

1143
01:22:35,516 --> 01:22:39,714
in the way we act...

1144
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:43,880
the way we talk,
our personalities.

1145
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:46,060
Too much of a coincidence.

1146
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:49,355
- Is he alive?
- No, he died 14 years ago.

1147
01:22:49,564 --> 01:22:51,293
Why don't you ask your
adoptive mother?

1148
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:55,938
No. I know she'll tell me
before she dies.

1149
01:22:56,139 --> 01:22:59,870
- Do you see her often?
- Every week.

1150
01:23:00,076 --> 01:23:03,341
- How oId is she?
- 75.

1151
01:23:03,546 --> 01:23:05,309
Are you gonna wait to hear
the truth?

1152
01:23:05,515 --> 01:23:07,780
She'll tell me, I know.

1153
01:23:07,985 --> 01:23:11,079
If not to me,
she'll tell someone eIse.

1154
01:23:11,288 --> 01:23:13,347
- Do you like her?
- Of course. A lot.

1155
01:23:13,557 --> 01:23:17,618
She raised me. I should thank her
for being here today...

1156
01:23:17,828 --> 01:23:20,491
giving this interview.
I'm grateful to her.

1157
01:23:20,698 --> 01:23:24,225
I was already on my way...

1158
01:23:24,436 --> 01:23:27,371
...to meet the guy up there.
- Why?

1159
01:23:27,572 --> 01:23:29,973
I was very sick, full of probIems...

1160
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:31,734
- As a kid?
- Yeah.

1161
01:23:31,944 --> 01:23:34,742
How do you reIate to God,
and rellgion?

1162
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:40,145
I thank Him every morning
for being allve...

1163
01:23:40,352 --> 01:23:42,287
for being abIe to waIk, and taIk.

1164
01:23:42,489 --> 01:23:44,616
How do you communicate with God?

1165
01:23:45,425 --> 01:23:51,261
I look up, cross myself,
and taIk straight up to Him...

1166
01:23:51,465 --> 01:23:53,627
as if I were having this
conversation with you.

1167
01:23:53,835 --> 01:23:56,633
Really?
But do you visuallze him and all?

1168
01:23:56,838 --> 01:24:00,035
No, I don't see anything.
Just in my imagination.

1169
01:24:00,341 --> 01:24:03,833
You said you didn't call Him
"God", but something else.

1170
01:24:04,045 --> 01:24:07,038
"Boss."
I often call him "Boss"...

1171
01:24:07,249 --> 01:24:11,583
cause He hires and fires us
as He pIeases.

1172
01:24:11,787 --> 01:24:14,187
Or "The- Guy- Beyond- The- CIouds."

1173
01:24:14,389 --> 01:24:16,255
This is how I call him,
with all due respect.

1174
01:24:16,659 --> 01:24:20,561
I dream of my father the most.

1175
01:24:22,866 --> 01:24:26,632
I aIways dream of him
since he's passed away.

1176
01:24:26,836 --> 01:24:30,398
Not every night, but very often.

1177
01:24:30,608 --> 01:24:34,169
And I remember my dreams.

1178
01:24:34,378 --> 01:24:39,146
He aIways scoIded me,
gave me nasty sermons.

1179
01:24:39,351 --> 01:24:42,286
- Do you see his face?
- CIearIy.

1180
01:24:42,487 --> 01:24:46,423
You dream of your adoptive father,
who you belleve is your reaI father.

1181
01:24:46,625 --> 01:24:48,991
That's right.

1182
01:24:49,194 --> 01:24:52,926
How do you feeI when you wake up?
Good or bad?

1183
01:24:53,132 --> 01:24:57,831
I sometimes feeI a llttIe upset.
Depending on the dream, I feeI sad.

1184
01:24:58,037 --> 01:25:00,562
I'm quite emotional,
and sometimes I cry.

1185
01:25:01,374 --> 01:25:04,708
And the baby you found in the
hallway, before Sérgio's tenure?

1186
01:25:04,912 --> 01:25:08,211
No, no.
During Sérgio's tenure...

1187
01:25:08,415 --> 01:25:11,213
about 3 years ago.

1188
01:25:14,088 --> 01:25:17,717
The baby's mother used to work
at Mr. Roberto's ...

1189
01:25:17,926 --> 01:25:20,394
apartment, #718.

1190
01:25:20,662 --> 01:25:23,495
One day, she showed up with
a small baby in her arms.

1191
01:25:23,698 --> 01:25:27,135
Ten minutes Iater,
she Ieft without the chlld.

1192
01:25:27,336 --> 01:25:29,998
I thought:
"There's something wrong."

1193
01:25:32,308 --> 01:25:34,742
I took the eIevator up
to the 8th floor...

1194
01:25:34,944 --> 01:25:38,642
came down the stairs, and
found the baby on the 5th floor...

1195
01:25:38,848 --> 01:25:41,840
by the trash shute door...

1196
01:25:42,519 --> 01:25:45,113
Iying on newspapers on the floor.

1197
01:25:45,322 --> 01:25:49,259
The chlld was healthy...

1198
01:25:49,460 --> 01:25:53,920
clean, chubby, next to a bottle
with juice, with a clean diaper.

1199
01:25:54,131 --> 01:25:56,122
I ran down, fetched Mr. Sérgio
and Ms. Vera...

1200
01:25:56,334 --> 01:25:59,862
to handle the situation.

1201
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:02,700
- And then youleft?
- I did.

1202
01:26:03,175 --> 01:26:07,339
I came home, and drank
some water to calm down.

1203
01:26:07,546 --> 01:26:11,847
But that scene kept haunting me...

1204
01:26:12,051 --> 01:26:14,110
that baby on the floor.

1205
01:26:17,423 --> 01:26:21,484
all else was fine, no problem.

1206
01:26:21,694 --> 01:26:24,687
That scene shocked me, though...

1207
01:26:24,965 --> 01:26:28,230
as if I were seeing myself
lying there.

1208
01:26:29,603 --> 01:26:31,969
But that's past, I'm ok.

1209
01:26:32,773 --> 01:26:35,334
- Where were you born?
- Spain.

1210
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:38,071
And how did you end up here?

1211
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:42,514
It's fate.
It dictates our lives.

1212
01:26:42,717 --> 01:26:46,176
I was born in a village...

1213
01:26:46,389 --> 01:26:49,984
near Santiago de Compostela,
La Coruña.

1214
01:26:50,192 --> 01:26:53,355
Quite young,
at 17, 18, Ileft...

1215
01:26:53,562 --> 01:26:57,499
for Santiago, where I began work
at a hoteI...

1216
01:26:57,701 --> 01:26:59,293
untll I decided to come here.

1217
01:26:59,503 --> 01:27:00,993
- By yourself?
- Yes.

1218
01:27:01,204 --> 01:27:02,796
Did you get a job right away?

1219
01:27:03,006 --> 01:27:07,033
- I was jobIess for only 11 days.
- Where did you find work?

1220
01:27:07,244 --> 01:27:13,184
At the same home I work today,
on AtIântica Ave., in Copacabana.

1221
01:27:13,384 --> 01:27:14,646
As a house maid?

1222
01:27:14,852 --> 01:27:21,417
I've been a maid all my life,
and I stllI am. I'm proud of it.

1223
01:27:21,627 --> 01:27:25,688
Some People are ashamed of it,
but that's ignorance...

1224
01:27:25,898 --> 01:27:28,765
simpIemindedness.

1225
01:27:28,967 --> 01:27:32,426
For those who work honestIy,
any job is good.

1226
01:27:32,872 --> 01:27:34,806
Have you been back
to Spain since?

1227
01:27:35,008 --> 01:27:37,943
Yes, 1O years after
I'd settled in Brazil.

1228
01:27:38,144 --> 01:27:40,203
My employer paid for my trip.

1229
01:27:40,413 --> 01:27:44,646
I'd had my eldest daughter,
and was pregnant with Fernando.

1230
01:27:44,852 --> 01:27:46,979
I went back to see my father.

1231
01:27:47,188 --> 01:27:49,656
Then I went back again
last year...

1232
01:27:49,857 --> 01:27:54,191
on a European tour,
not only to Spain.

1233
01:27:54,395 --> 01:27:56,830
How could you afford such a trip?

1234
01:27:57,032 --> 01:27:59,466
Don't we all save a few pennies?

1235
01:27:59,668 --> 01:28:01,295
I've always lived sparingly.

1236
01:28:01,503 --> 01:28:05,963
I don't spend unIess I have to,
for fear I'll be in want.

1237
01:28:06,174 --> 01:28:09,576
So we save,
and save all our lives.

1238
01:28:12,148 --> 01:28:13,911
Problems are inherent to life.

1239
01:28:14,117 --> 01:28:19,818
If you don't have the courage
to face them, you fall.

1240
01:28:20,290 --> 01:28:25,728
I thank God I've had the courage
to face them and move on.

1241
01:28:25,929 --> 01:28:28,397
I'm a winner.

1242
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:39,441
So to those who are willing
to fight, poverty is...

1243
01:28:39,644 --> 01:28:41,909
There's no poverty.
That's a fantasy...

1244
01:28:42,114 --> 01:28:45,641
nonsense! People always taIk
about poverty.

1245
01:28:45,851 --> 01:28:48,684
There's no poverty here.

1246
01:28:48,888 --> 01:28:52,722
only in places plagued
by war...

1247
01:28:52,926 --> 01:28:57,920
where there's misery, no land
and no means to grow crops.

1248
01:28:58,131 --> 01:29:03,433
But in a country like ours?!
We're the richest in the world.

1249
01:29:03,637 --> 01:29:06,937
To me, America is not
the 1st worId; Brazil is.

1250
01:29:07,141 --> 01:29:10,702
We have it all. all it takes
it the will to work, pal.

1251
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,174
So you think poor People...?

1252
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:15,611
That's bull! They don't want
to do anything.

1253
01:29:15,817 --> 01:29:20,255
I've dealt with the poor for 4O
years since I came to Brazil.

1254
01:29:20,456 --> 01:29:25,860
I know them. They lie,
you can't fathom what they do.

1255
01:29:26,061 --> 01:29:30,123
- Are they lazy?
- Yes. They don't want to work.

1256
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:32,691
Rather, they don't like working.

1257
01:29:33,069 --> 01:29:37,802
They don't even bother going
to hospitals or clinics...

1258
01:29:38,007 --> 01:29:41,341
to get their free birth control pills.
They don't go.

1259
01:29:41,545 --> 01:29:43,706
- They don't ?
- They don't bother.

1260
01:29:43,914 --> 01:29:46,439
I know.

1261
01:29:46,650 --> 01:29:48,481
They're too lazy to go.

1262
01:29:48,686 --> 01:29:54,057
And if you give them medicine,
they forget to take it.

1263
01:29:54,259 --> 01:29:57,695
So it's very tough.

1264
01:29:57,896 --> 01:30:02,527
Perhaps, we could find a way
to educate them.

1265
01:30:02,735 --> 01:30:07,195
Simpleminded People, however,
don't seem to learn.

1266
01:30:07,406 --> 01:30:10,864
You speak, they hear quietly.

1267
01:30:11,077 --> 01:30:15,777
You can tell them: "Here's a job,
for a salary, will you take it?"

1268
01:30:15,983 --> 01:30:20,750
"That lady is a bore!"
C'mon, "The lady is a bore."

1269
01:30:20,954 --> 01:30:23,787
"It pays only R$ 2O reais,
that's good for nothing."

1270
01:30:23,991 --> 01:30:27,723
For some People, a job means...

1271
01:30:27,929 --> 01:30:33,231
sermons from your boss, being
humiliated, and discriminated.

1272
01:30:33,434 --> 01:30:39,567
But it's not, cause there are
no employees and employers.

1273
01:30:39,775 --> 01:30:43,176
We only exchange services.

1274
01:30:43,379 --> 01:30:46,075
I work, you pay me.

1275
01:30:46,482 --> 01:30:49,975
You pay me, and I work.
We're co-dependent.

1276
01:30:50,387 --> 01:30:55,347
People think I side with
the bosses.

1277
01:30:55,559 --> 01:30:58,357
I side with reality...

1278
01:30:58,562 --> 01:31:03,466
cause I see both sides,
and People often see only one.

1279
01:31:03,768 --> 01:31:06,293
- How old are you?
- Five.

1280
01:31:06,504 --> 01:31:08,768
Do you love your grandma?

1281
01:31:12,377 --> 01:31:14,504
Is today Father's Day?

1282
01:31:14,713 --> 01:31:17,511
Are you happy or sad?

1283
01:31:17,716 --> 01:31:19,377
- Sad.
- Why?

1284
01:31:19,585 --> 01:31:24,523
Cause my dad lives in Petrópolis,
and he's traveled.

1285
01:31:25,358 --> 01:31:28,293
Aren't you going to see him today?

1286
01:31:29,128 --> 01:31:31,096
But he's working there, right?

1287
01:31:31,297 --> 01:31:37,635
He was kicked out of work.
He has to find another job.

1288
01:31:37,838 --> 01:31:40,272
He was kicked out of work?!

1289
01:31:45,746 --> 01:31:50,980
Such is life,
and incomprehension.

1290
01:31:51,553 --> 01:31:54,818
When you're a parent,
you have to overcome and...

1291
01:31:55,023 --> 01:31:59,620
overlook a lot of things,
so you can move on.

1292
01:31:59,829 --> 01:32:03,128
And today most couples...

1293
01:32:03,332 --> 01:32:05,892
- Is his dad divorced?
- Yes, he is.

1294
01:32:11,241 --> 01:32:13,072
How long have you known Rio?

1295
01:32:13,276 --> 01:32:16,837
For quite a long time.

1296
01:32:17,047 --> 01:32:20,814
First, I used to come here
for Carnival only.

1297
01:32:21,019 --> 01:32:24,921
I aIways came with my agent.

1298
01:32:26,357 --> 01:32:32,057
- Agent?
- Cause I used to be a dancer.

1299
01:32:32,264 --> 01:32:34,164
I did great shows.

1300
01:32:34,366 --> 01:32:37,631
I'm one of the Bronze "Stautues".

1301
01:32:38,103 --> 01:32:43,735
I toured São Paulo
with my show...

1302
01:32:43,943 --> 01:32:46,503
then toured Japan with it.

1303
01:32:46,713 --> 01:32:50,274
- How long did you stay in Japan?
- For a year.

1304
01:32:50,483 --> 01:32:52,075
In Tokyo, in the country,
what cities?

1305
01:32:52,285 --> 01:32:54,412
I lived in Shirahama...

1306
01:32:54,621 --> 01:32:58,251
but I visited Shimoda...

1307
01:32:58,459 --> 01:33:00,324
Yokohama and Tokyo.

1308
01:33:00,761 --> 01:33:04,128
Did you dance,
or dance and sing?

1309
01:33:04,331 --> 01:33:06,857
I used to dance and sing.

1310
01:33:07,069 --> 01:33:12,097
I'd be delighted if you sang
something in Japanese.

1311
01:33:13,308 --> 01:33:15,776
You want me to sing?

1312
01:33:18,648 --> 01:33:21,583
Wait, let me see.

1313
01:33:34,665 --> 01:33:37,828
There was another one
I used to sing.

1314
01:33:47,479 --> 01:33:50,846
Gee, after all this time,
one forgets.

1315
01:33:51,683 --> 01:33:53,879
Where were you born?

1316
01:33:54,086 --> 01:33:57,112
- In Salvador.
- Why did you go to São PauIo?

1317
01:33:57,323 --> 01:34:00,224
I moved to São Paulo cause...

1318
01:34:00,426 --> 01:34:04,089
I was really eager to work...

1319
01:34:04,296 --> 01:34:07,130
and my parents were poor.

1320
01:34:07,567 --> 01:34:11,503
But I didn't know a soul
in there, you know?

1321
01:34:11,705 --> 01:34:14,173
I got a job at a lady's home...

1322
01:34:14,374 --> 01:34:18,004
doing the laundry,
the ironing, cooking.

1323
01:34:18,212 --> 01:34:21,010
But I actually wanted
to work out of the house...

1324
01:34:21,215 --> 01:34:25,481
so other People hired me
as a cleaning lady.

1325
01:34:25,686 --> 01:34:28,520
I'd Ieave for work, and come back.

1326
01:34:29,792 --> 01:34:35,731
I started seeing things, learning.

1327
01:34:37,032 --> 01:34:40,230
I build my house.

1328
01:34:40,436 --> 01:34:43,064
Then I met Ruth...

1329
01:34:43,273 --> 01:34:47,642
and she said: "Wow! You're tall,
bonny, and beautiful."

1330
01:34:47,844 --> 01:34:49,209
"I'm producing a show."

1331
01:34:49,412 --> 01:34:54,612
"Come on over and have a look."
So I went.

1332
01:34:54,819 --> 01:34:58,118
Then she produced a show
and cast me in it.

1333
01:34:58,322 --> 01:35:02,281
We staged it all across
São Paulo...

1334
01:35:02,494 --> 01:35:06,430
performing here,
performing there...

1335
01:35:06,631 --> 01:35:09,099
Were you ever in a relationship?

1336
01:35:09,301 --> 01:35:10,768
Yes, I was.

1337
01:35:10,969 --> 01:35:13,403
- Were you happy, or not?
- I was.

1338
01:35:13,605 --> 01:35:16,769
I lived with a German guy...

1339
01:35:18,444 --> 01:35:21,709
for 1O years. 1O years.

1340
01:35:21,914 --> 01:35:24,314
We got separated quite
recentIy.

1341
01:35:24,517 --> 01:35:26,110
- Was it good?
- It was great.

1342
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:32,483
If I were meant to be married,
I'd already be by now.

1343
01:35:32,693 --> 01:35:36,686
But I won't find a partner
within these walls.

1344
01:35:36,897 --> 01:35:41,733
One's got to go out.
I can find men easily, but...

1345
01:35:44,606 --> 01:35:50,045
I don't want a man to
give me trouble.

1346
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:53,707
I don't men to give
me trouble.

1347
01:36:12,637 --> 01:36:15,128
I'd dreamt of living
in Copacabana.

1348
01:36:15,339 --> 01:36:20,276
I used to live in Tijuca,
and I liked it there.

1349
01:36:20,478 --> 01:36:24,677
But... I'd always dreamt
of living here.

1350
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:27,177
How long have you
lived at the Master?

1351
01:36:27,386 --> 01:36:30,549
- 13 years.
- How do you like it?

1352
01:36:30,756 --> 01:36:34,351
It's great. It's calm, quiet.

1353
01:36:34,626 --> 01:36:36,390
Have you always been roommates?

1354
01:36:36,596 --> 01:36:39,190
Yes! It's aIways been
she, my mother, and I.

1355
01:36:39,399 --> 01:36:42,835
- For the past 3O, 2O years?
- For a long time.

1356
01:36:43,036 --> 01:36:45,266
Since I was born.

1357
01:36:46,440 --> 01:36:48,738
For 5O- some years.

1358
01:36:48,943 --> 01:36:50,672
You're sisters. Have you always
lived together?

1359
01:36:50,878 --> 01:36:53,574
- Always.
- Were you married?

1360
01:36:53,781 --> 01:36:57,376
I've never had the time,
with so many things...

1361
01:36:57,584 --> 01:37:00,713
and responsibilities.
There was no time left.

1362
01:37:00,922 --> 01:37:04,983
- We work too hard.
- And there's their health problems.

1363
01:37:05,193 --> 01:37:10,154
She's sick, my mom's sick,
so I had to deal with it all.

1364
01:37:10,366 --> 01:37:15,770
I had no time to go out to date,
especially here in Rio.

1365
01:37:15,972 --> 01:37:17,997
I'm afraid of these People...

1366
01:37:18,207 --> 01:37:21,541
so many are drug addicts,
and you can't tell.

1367
01:37:21,745 --> 01:37:26,478
You go to the beach, and you see
People smoking pot, doing drugs...

1368
01:37:26,683 --> 01:37:29,584
and you say:
"God knows if they are..."

1369
01:37:29,786 --> 01:37:32,722
"Those who pose as decent
People, but..."

1370
01:37:33,257 --> 01:37:36,624
- I heard you paint.
- I do.

1371
01:37:36,828 --> 01:37:38,762
I have a bunch of paintings
around here.

1372
01:37:38,963 --> 01:37:41,693
There's that one there,
and more in storage.

1373
01:37:41,899 --> 01:37:43,799
would you comment on the one
with a window?

1374
01:37:44,003 --> 01:37:45,971
Oh, "Ocean view", right?

1375
01:37:46,171 --> 01:37:49,140
It isn't finished yet.
It's over there.

1376
01:37:49,341 --> 01:37:51,605
How is it?
And how do you want it to be?

1377
01:37:51,810 --> 01:37:54,176
I want to do it...

1378
01:37:54,380 --> 01:37:58,909
as I envision it.
I wanted to include Botafogo...

1379
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:02,020
with Copacabana in the same
painting, anyhow...

1380
01:38:02,222 --> 01:38:08,059
incIuding the Sugar Loaf,
and Botafogo.

1381
01:38:08,529 --> 01:38:11,726
So you mixed in different
city areas.

1382
01:38:11,932 --> 01:38:14,298
- I am, like...
- What?

1383
01:38:14,502 --> 01:38:15,491
- Crazy.
- Why?

1384
01:38:15,703 --> 01:38:19,663
Cause I paint things
that don't exist.

1385
01:38:20,842 --> 01:38:24,539
Stay there, boy.
Calm down.

1386
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:35,318
If you leave him alone,
he'll be quiet. Go, go.

1387
01:38:35,925 --> 01:38:38,086
- Where did you start playing?
- In Bahia...

1388
01:38:38,294 --> 01:38:41,388
at Galicia.
I'm from Bahia.

1389
01:38:42,266 --> 01:38:47,636
Since I was 12,
I've played soccer.

1390
01:38:47,938 --> 01:38:51,305
In Rio, I've played in Bonsucesso,
and Bangu.

1391
01:38:51,508 --> 01:38:55,912
Then I went abroad and played
in Mexico for 2,5 years...

1392
01:38:56,114 --> 01:38:58,514
in France for 3 years.

1393
01:38:58,716 --> 01:39:01,514
I've played in Mexico,
so yo hablo español un poco.

1394
01:39:01,719 --> 01:39:03,778
I've played in France
for 2,5 years, so...

1395
01:39:03,988 --> 01:39:06,685
je parle français
un petit peu.

1396
01:39:06,892 --> 01:39:09,861
I've played in the US.

1397
01:39:10,062 --> 01:39:12,860
I've played in Venezuela...

1398
01:39:13,332 --> 01:39:17,099
then I quit playing soccer...

1399
01:39:17,304 --> 01:39:21,934
and became a coach in Saudi Arabia,
Thalland, and Sudan.

1400
01:39:22,309 --> 01:39:24,038
Tell us that episode in Maracanã.

1401
01:39:24,244 --> 01:39:26,735
- When I got naked?
- Yes.

1402
01:39:26,947 --> 01:39:31,578
I coached Itaperuna,
a small team...

1403
01:39:31,786 --> 01:39:35,620
in the State Championship.

1404
01:39:35,957 --> 01:39:39,051
I'd been doing a good work...

1405
01:39:39,260 --> 01:39:43,561
cause a good coach turns
a small team into a major team.

1406
01:39:43,765 --> 01:39:48,600
I'd managed to take my team
to that next round...

1407
01:39:48,804 --> 01:39:52,502
so we'd get to the
quarter- finals. Then...

1408
01:39:52,709 --> 01:39:58,739
on that fateful day,
I knew it wouldn't happen.

1409
01:39:58,948 --> 01:40:01,314
We couldn't possibly win.
The match had been rigged.

1410
01:40:01,518 --> 01:40:03,510
Why?

1411
01:40:03,954 --> 01:40:07,788
Cause that's Brazilian soccer.

1412
01:40:07,992 --> 01:40:09,823
But you were in your
coach uniform...

1413
01:40:10,027 --> 01:40:14,226
I was. I took off my shirt first,
then my pants, I was...

1414
01:40:14,432 --> 01:40:16,662
- In your briefs or naked?
- Naked!

1415
01:40:16,868 --> 01:40:19,393
They showed a close- up
of my butt.

1416
01:40:19,771 --> 01:40:24,140
That was the end, at least
so far, only God knows...

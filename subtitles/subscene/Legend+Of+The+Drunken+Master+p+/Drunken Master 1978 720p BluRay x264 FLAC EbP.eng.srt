1
00:00:49,057 --> 00:00:52,959
"Five hundred dollars for the death
of Chen Kuo-Wei."

2
00:01:16,517 --> 00:01:20,248
Hey, friend.
Not bad style.

3
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:23,415
You should take it easy.
You look done in.

4
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,955
Guess you must be
the Four Door Fist champion...

5
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,429
a Chen Kuo-Wei?

6
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:34,868
I'm Chen Kuo-Wei.
Your name, if you have one.

7
00:01:35,903 --> 00:01:37,393
Sure, it's Thunderleg.

8
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:43,237
I've heard of his Devil's Kick.
Of course, yeah.

9
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:47,008
Everyone knows in the kung-fu world it's
a method that's never been defeated yet.

10
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,575
And won't be.

11
00:01:51,886 --> 00:01:54,354
I suppose I should warn you.

12
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:57,414
I've been given good money
to kill you.

13
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,893
What the hell are you talking about?
Someone's paid you to kill me?

14
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:04,295
I'll give you twice as much
to kill him!

15
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:07,766
You could, only my honor comes first.

16
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:11,635
You must realize I'm paid to kill.
The contract's sealed.

17
00:02:11,706 --> 00:02:13,936
- So you must die.
- Don't be so sure of that...

18
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,476
for Chen Kuo-Wei,
champion of the Four Door Fist...

19
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:18,535
has never yet been defeated.

20
00:02:19,414 --> 00:02:22,178
I'll break every bone in your body...

21
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,218
and send you to hell.

22
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,860
Professor?

23
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:53,696
- What is it, Master?
- You'll finish the lesson.

24
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,676
- I have something to attend to.
- Yes, sir. I will, sir.

25
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,585
Stop!

26
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,980
I'm now going to demonstrate.

27
00:04:10,057 --> 00:04:13,390
The first lesson
I will instruct you in...

28
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,554
- is the five animal styles.
- He's gone bonkers.

29
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,359
- Three-legged cat.
- Four-eyed rat.

30
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:20,594
Let's get started.

31
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:22,329
Dragon Sees Tiger.

32
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,565
Tiger Rears.
Snake's Tongue Darts Out.

33
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,903
Panther Sees Fire.
White Crane Spreads Wings.

34
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,975
No, hold it, hold it.

35
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,812
There isn't any power in your wrist.
How do you expect to make progress?

36
00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:43,481
Well?

37
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:02,066
Straighten it up.

38
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,925
I suppose you think that was real funny,
pulling tricks on your teacher.

39
00:05:22,997 --> 00:05:25,727
We'll see.
Take that! And that!

40
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,894
And that!
Who was it? Tell me.

41
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,460
Who was it?

42
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,166
Fei-Hung did it.

43
00:05:38,145 --> 00:05:40,545
So, Wong Fei-Hung.

44
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:43,516
Now, just because your father
is Master Wong...

45
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:46,314
gives you no damn right
to cause any trouble here.

46
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:49,379
Oh, balls. Who told you
kung fu is just a good start?

47
00:05:49,457 --> 00:05:53,154
So that's it. You mean to say
my kung fu is lousy?

48
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,821
It's not as bad as that,
but it isn't the greatest.

49
00:05:56,931 --> 00:05:59,695
Suppose you show me exactly
what's wrong with it.

50
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:03,770
Right. Just take a look
at your Panther Sees Fire.

51
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:06,773
- What's wrong with it?
- Look at that spread between your paws.

52
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:09,002
That's an open invite.

53
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:11,977
And that Horse's Stance
is completely bowlegged.

54
00:06:12,046 --> 00:06:13,638
I bet on one sweep that l...

55
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,015
There, you've been thrown, yeah?

56
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:21,679
just wait.

57
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,089
Shut up!
Shut up, you turkeys!

58
00:06:36,971 --> 00:06:39,667
You like to test
your teacher's kung fu, would you?

59
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,675
And magpies can't fly, can they?

60
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:47,839
I can stand almost anything, you bum!

61
00:06:47,915 --> 00:06:50,475
But I've taken enough
of this bullshit.

62
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:52,178
Right. Come on!

63
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:00,559
You're wide open.
Do you know that, Teacher?

64
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,061
What?

65
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:26,778
See how good his Horse Stance is?

66
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,924
Pot belly! Shut up!

67
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:40,191
Look, right foot.

68
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,701
Cheat, cheat, cheat!

69
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:46,034
Bastard!

70
00:07:46,107 --> 00:07:46,240
Fresh roosters.

71
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,935
Fresh roosters.

72
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,034
Get your fresh roosters here.

73
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:54,373
You know, Fei-Hung?
You're the cat's ass...

74
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:56,643
making old crow face dance like that.

75
00:07:56,717 --> 00:07:58,810
He's always so full of bullshit.

76
00:07:58,886 --> 00:08:02,413
He thinks he's God's gift to kung fu.
just to see him makes me puke.

77
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,651
- You sure made him dance.
- You should have seen his face.

78
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:16,067
- That's not bad.
- So have some more then.

79
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:19,129
Dumb head. I was talking
about that chick there.

80
00:08:20,474 --> 00:08:23,272
That perfect frame she's got.
Yeah, sexy.

81
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:26,070
- How much?
- That one is 76.

82
00:08:26,147 --> 00:08:27,944
You mean that one in the red?

83
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:31,212
Imagine what it'd be like
to be kissed by that chick.

84
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:33,515
Kissing her is for children.

85
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:35,555
I could get that broad to hug me.

86
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:38,751
- Come on!
- She wouldn't.

87
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:41,727
- You wanna bet on it?
- I'll bet you a whole dinner.

88
00:08:41,796 --> 00:08:46,165
She's hot, that kind. She won't
even take a second look at you.

89
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,167
- Come on.
- All right.

90
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:50,169
A whole dinner then.

91
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,274
Watch.

92
00:08:57,344 --> 00:08:59,369
He's in for trouble.

93
00:09:06,454 --> 00:09:08,081
- What is it?
- It's agony!

94
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:10,419
- Something's in my eye.
- What's the matter?

95
00:09:10,491 --> 00:09:13,927
Blow it out, please.
Can't you help me?

96
00:09:13,994 --> 00:09:15,586
Can you?

97
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:18,256
One more, huh?

98
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:21,558
- He did it!
- Did you see that?

99
00:09:21,635 --> 00:09:25,196
Thanks a lot.
Hey, a snake! There!

100
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:30,035
It's all right.
Don't be scared. I'll kill it.

101
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,375
- That's a technique.
- Sure is.

102
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:35,711
I gotta try that on your sister.

103
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,580
On my sister?

104
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:44,424
Thought you could come fresh
with my daughter, did you?

105
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:51,588
Me touch her?
She was asking for it. Dumb bitch.

106
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,400
Don't deny it. You just wanted
to lay your filthy hands...

107
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:59,166
On her? That's a laugh.
She's much too ugly for that.

108
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,974
Think you're real smart, huh?

109
00:10:02,042 --> 00:10:04,067
I'll teach you a lesson, boy.

110
00:10:15,222 --> 00:10:17,520
So you want to play at kung fu.

111
00:10:17,591 --> 00:10:18,956
Try this!

112
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:33,632
- She's not joking.
- The old bitch is tough.

113
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,911
Hey, guys, you gotta help me.

114
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:44,083
Some friends they make.

115
00:10:57,665 --> 00:11:00,998
You're nothing but a skinny old woman,
so I'll let you win.

116
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:14,037
Fresh peas. Fresh...

117
00:11:14,114 --> 00:11:15,706
Son of a...

118
00:11:17,318 --> 00:11:20,583
What's your game? Stumbling about
like some drunken stooge.

119
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,457
Hey, Jerry!

120
00:11:24,525 --> 00:11:26,993
<i>Come, who'll buy</i>

121
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,655
See, mister.
jade antique.

122
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:35,168
- Is it real?
- But of course, sir.

123
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,672
It's an heirloom, mister.
It's worth money, sir.

124
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,299
- How much is it?
- Ten bucks.

125
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:45,141
That's very expensive.
Come.

126
00:11:45,212 --> 00:11:48,704
- Here.
- Just ten cents?

127
00:11:51,118 --> 00:11:53,416
- Mister, you can't give me this.
- Hands off!

128
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:55,250
This wouldn't buy an old plate.

129
00:11:55,322 --> 00:11:58,155
I couldn't sell such a valuable piece
for only ten cents.

130
00:11:58,225 --> 00:12:00,887
You don't want to sell,
you give me my money back.

131
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:02,360
But my jade!

132
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,165
That was all I had in the world, sir.
Pay for it!

133
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:09,702
You expect payment from me?
Take this!

134
00:12:10,738 --> 00:12:12,672
Daddy, are you all right?

135
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,004
Please, at least give me something.

136
00:12:15,075 --> 00:12:16,133
Sure.

137
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:21,347
What's wrong, old man?

138
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:23,849
He smashed my jade, and he won't pay.

139
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,486
Shithead. Piss off.

140
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:34,250
- Think you're talking to your mother?
- I'll see you rot in hell!

141
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:37,722
You'd better hand over
this man's money.

142
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:39,197
Pay?

143
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:41,359
Not before I put you in the ground.

144
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:43,665
It's too bad you feel that way.
Know why?

145
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:48,140
There's nothing been going right today,
so you caught me in a bad mood.

146
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,666
Now, I'm gonna have to
teach you how to pay.

147
00:13:23,544 --> 00:13:25,239
You're mad, huh?

148
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:39,818
You almost killed me!

149
00:13:50,237 --> 00:13:52,171
My knuckles were barely missed.

150
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,880
- This is for you. Now get going!
- Thank you, sir.

151
00:14:15,696 --> 00:14:18,221
That's enough. I'm dying.

152
00:14:18,298 --> 00:14:20,823
Don't worry. You're safe.
It's only the blunt side.

153
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,370
I have no intention of killing you...

154
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:28,840
yet.

155
00:14:34,348 --> 00:14:35,781
Please!

156
00:14:37,651 --> 00:14:40,449
- That one really came close.
- I beg of you!

157
00:14:40,521 --> 00:14:42,455
And watch what you're doing.

158
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,383
Drop dead.

159
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,663
You're fortunate because
it seems I do miss...

160
00:14:58,739 --> 00:15:00,832
although it's quite by accident.

161
00:15:00,908 --> 00:15:02,375
Oh, please!

162
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:06,645
I chop-chop-chop this meat.

163
00:15:06,713 --> 00:15:09,113
So then I slice-slice-slice.

164
00:15:09,183 --> 00:15:12,641
And then I beat-beat-beat.
Mix it all together!

165
00:15:12,719 --> 00:15:15,085
It sure has brightened
the day I met you.

166
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:25,760
You know this?
It must be at least...

167
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,858
ten years, brother,
since we've seen each other.

168
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:30,403
And you hardly look a day older.

169
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,939
I would not have recognized
my niece.

170
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,571
She isn't a bad girl...

171
00:15:35,642 --> 00:15:38,202
just a bit naive.

172
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:41,270
- And where is Fei-Hung?
- That young rascal.

173
00:15:41,348 --> 00:15:44,715
He's a handful. Always out
with his pals getting into trouble.

174
00:15:44,785 --> 00:15:48,118
Very grown up now.
You won't recognize him.

175
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:50,213
By the way,
you'll stay for a few days?

176
00:15:53,093 --> 00:15:56,460
I say, Fei-Hung,
come and meet your aunt.

177
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:02,768
- Come on, lad.
- I'll... Coming.

178
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:14,439
Say hello.

179
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,915
Hello, Auntie, cousin.

180
00:16:16,984 --> 00:16:18,713
- Hello.
- Hello, Fei-Hung.

181
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:20,548
What on earth's the matter?

182
00:16:20,621 --> 00:16:23,613
I seem to have pulled a muscle
in my neck.

183
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,818
I'll soon put that right.
Here, let your aunt fix that.

184
00:16:26,894 --> 00:16:30,159
- I'll be all right.
- Relax just for a second.

185
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:33,391
Oh, dear.

186
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,695
- Well, you feel better?
- Thank you, yes.

187
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:44,267
Be all right now.

188
00:16:44,344 --> 00:16:48,303
Your son's grown into
a real smart-looking fellow.

189
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:51,408
Yes, he's quite clever.
Also, his kung fu's not bad.

190
00:16:51,485 --> 00:16:55,945
Oh? I should like to see
his kung fu sometime.

191
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:58,651
All right.
You would enjoy a match.

192
00:16:59,526 --> 00:17:02,188
I believe that you are strict
with him, from all accounts...

193
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:04,389
and I've heard he's regarded
very highly in the neighborhood.

194
00:17:04,464 --> 00:17:06,432
That's a fact.
Tell me what they say.

195
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,333
They've said that he's courteous
and polite...

196
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:12,463
setting other boys a good example,
well-mannered.

197
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:17,368
That makes me really proud
to be his father. Come here, son.

198
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:28,187
I'm so glad he isn't like
the other boys around here.

199
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,553
They're real sex maniacs.

200
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:32,558
Yes, that's right.
Only today...

201
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:35,720
my own daughter was attacked
by one of them.

202
00:17:35,796 --> 00:17:39,698
Besides that, when I went
to rescue her, he even attacked me.

203
00:17:41,401 --> 00:17:45,770
You mean to tell me both of you
were attacked here in my own town?

204
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:47,807
Would you recognize him?

205
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,268
As if I could forget.
Yes, I'd recognize him.

206
00:17:53,347 --> 00:17:56,475
And when I find him,
I'll flay the skin off his back.

207
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,677
Fei-Hung, come along.

208
00:17:59,486 --> 00:18:02,284
- Uncle, there's really no need.
- But why?

209
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:05,416
Because he's in this very room
standing quite near us.

210
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:07,892
- But where?
- Standing right over there.

211
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,553
Your precious son Fei-Hung.

212
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:14,733
What?

213
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:16,735
It can't...

214
00:18:21,008 --> 00:18:22,737
Down on your knees!

215
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:23,935
Please!

216
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:27,572
You'll pay for this,
you scum, you criminal!

217
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:36,415
Oh, my gosh.

218
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,470
Yes, Mr. Li.
What has happened?

219
00:18:52,639 --> 00:18:56,302
I'll tell you what.
That bastard son of yours beat him up!

220
00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:01,180
Why should he do that?

221
00:19:01,248 --> 00:19:05,082
Because he's nothing but a wild animal.
Viciously attacked my son...

222
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:07,643
breaking his legs, arms
and the poor boy's skull.

223
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:13,319
Oh, my.
He really beat him up.

224
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:17,056
- He looks like a dumpling.
- Well, what are you going to do?

225
00:19:19,499 --> 00:19:20,523
Father!

226
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,068
You vermin from hell!
I'll beat you to death!

227
00:19:23,136 --> 00:19:24,569
Please, Father!

228
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:27,733
Brother, you mustn't kill
your own son.

229
00:19:27,808 --> 00:19:30,777
Yes! I've got to kill this devil.

230
00:19:30,844 --> 00:19:33,472
He's a disgrace to the name of Wong.

231
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,879
Sounds bad for a teacher
of your standing...

232
00:19:35,949 --> 00:19:38,611
to flog his own son to death.

233
00:19:38,685 --> 00:19:41,916
If he's got to be punished,
I suggest that...

234
00:19:41,988 --> 00:19:45,116
Mr. Li here is quite capable.

235
00:19:47,928 --> 00:19:50,488
Stop him!

236
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,795
It was your son I beat,
so let him punish me.

237
00:19:53,867 --> 00:19:55,664
There.

238
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:59,365
Now you hit me.
I promise I won't fight back.

239
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:02,807
So you're funny, huh?

240
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:06,243
All right, Mr. Wong.
What are you gonna do?

241
00:20:06,313 --> 00:20:09,441
As from this moment, I disown him.

242
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:12,007
This slime is no longer mine.

243
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,019
Do what you like with him.

244
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:18,781
So my suggestion...
you pick your man.

245
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:22,351
He'll fight Fei-Hung, who'll be
strictly forbidden to fight back.

246
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,454
Ten strokes should be enough.

247
00:20:24,531 --> 00:20:27,432
Now, Mr. Li,
do you approve of the punishment?

248
00:20:29,503 --> 00:20:32,995
Ten strokes won't be needed.
I'm gonna do it in three.

249
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:37,610
Master.

250
00:20:37,677 --> 00:20:40,043
Hear? I'm gonna fix that squid.

251
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:43,571
And be sure you leave him looking
just like I am now.

252
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:34,090
The Divine Eight.

253
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,567
That palm style of yours,
it's really something.

254
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:39,596
I'm only starting.

255
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,449
I'm not dead yet!

256
00:22:11,004 --> 00:22:12,096
Enough.

257
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:16,839
You've made your ten hits now,
Mr. Chao.

258
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,412
And you said
you'd put me down in three.

259
00:22:26,286 --> 00:22:28,481
Snake and Crane Together.

260
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:33,526
- What?
- Strike the vital points.

261
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:37,756
Let's try and divine it again.

262
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,744
I told you I got style.

263
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:44,895
Hey, my jacket's getting dirty.
Take it.

264
00:23:57,544 --> 00:24:00,570
I bet you regret
you didn't pay for that jade.

265
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,781
You got the wrong guy!

266
00:24:10,523 --> 00:24:12,081
Are you all right, Master?

267
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:14,854
You idiot!

268
00:24:27,807 --> 00:24:32,107
Master, now I look just like you do.

269
00:24:33,246 --> 00:24:35,840
Okay. You win.

270
00:24:35,915 --> 00:24:39,612
Smart of you to play that trick on us.
I'll get you back. Let's go.

271
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,450
You haven't heard the last of us.
Let's get out of here.

272
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,286
Careful with my son.
I'll get you yet!

273
00:24:48,194 --> 00:24:50,389
Careful, careful.

274
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,466
He came in a furor
with one ragged cripple.

275
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,128
He left in a furor
with two on the stretcher.

276
00:24:57,203 --> 00:25:00,070
You fight quite well.
I must give you credit.

277
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,074
- But I'll still kill you!
- Oh, no.

278
00:25:03,476 --> 00:25:05,740
You mustn't kill a child
of your blood.

279
00:25:05,812 --> 00:25:08,372
Break his wicked ways
through practice.

280
00:25:08,448 --> 00:25:11,508
I've tried everything with
that young bastard. Right!

281
00:25:11,584 --> 00:25:14,144
From now on, you won't be allowed
to leave this house.

282
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,155
We'll start with
five hours Horse Stance.

283
00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:07,764
Now, don't move.

284
00:26:09,275 --> 00:26:12,711
Have some more water.

285
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:21,383
Hey, your Horse's Stance
is improving.

286
00:26:25,258 --> 00:26:28,455
Are your legs a bit shaky?
They aching?

287
00:26:28,528 --> 00:26:32,897
You know, I feel real sorry for you.
Chicken, chicken!

288
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:44,709
I bet you this will tickle.

289
00:26:49,883 --> 00:26:52,681
Stop. Don't do that.

290
00:26:52,752 --> 00:26:54,720
just what exactly
are you trying to do?

291
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:58,985
Carrying out my orders.
See, it's your father's idea.

292
00:26:59,058 --> 00:27:01,390
He says for every bowl you break...

293
00:27:01,461 --> 00:27:04,259
you stay another hour, you bastard!

294
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,972
Darned idiot.

295
00:27:54,581 --> 00:27:56,014
Master.

296
00:28:01,788 --> 00:28:04,689
Yes, his stance appears
to be pretty steady.

297
00:28:04,757 --> 00:28:07,248
- You're sure he hasn't had a rest?
- Oh, no.

298
00:28:07,327 --> 00:28:09,261
I've been watching him
just like a hawk.

299
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:11,320
- Absolutely not.
- You're certain?

300
00:28:12,498 --> 00:28:15,092
- Well, you have problems?
- Sure.

301
00:28:15,168 --> 00:28:16,499
I feel very tired.

302
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:20,701
- Tired? You don't seem to be.
- I am, sir.

303
00:28:20,773 --> 00:28:23,708
You mean you're tired,
though you're sitting on a chair?

304
00:28:23,776 --> 00:28:27,007
What? Sitting on a chair?
Let me see.

305
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,072
Oh, my God! So he is!
On a chair!

306
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:31,946
You young criminal.

307
00:28:32,018 --> 00:28:34,486
I've tried to teach you, but no.

308
00:28:34,554 --> 00:28:36,852
Well, it leaves me
no alternative then.

309
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:41,489
I will have to ask your great uncle
to come and discipline you.

310
00:28:41,561 --> 00:28:43,153
Who's that?

311
00:28:49,035 --> 00:28:50,627
You stepped on my foot again!

312
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,755
Hurry up, bean head.

313
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,221
- It's choking me.
- Won't be a second.

314
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,885
Oh, hurry.

315
00:29:21,701 --> 00:29:23,896
Practicing your kung fu
upside down, huh?

316
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,438
- I'm dying.
- I'll get you something to eat.

317
00:29:27,373 --> 00:29:28,806
Here.

318
00:29:31,077 --> 00:29:35,104
- Wait'll I get some water.
- Get this thing off my neck.

319
00:29:35,181 --> 00:29:37,115
- Okay.
- It's killing me.

320
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,351
Hurry!

321
00:29:51,364 --> 00:29:53,457
Come on, get up.

322
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:55,558
Why did you get down so fast?

323
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:08,276
Here, eat this.

324
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,613
Hey, is it true
Su Hua-Chi is gonna train you?

325
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,346
- That's right.
- That's sure bad news for you.

326
00:30:15,755 --> 00:30:18,952
You know what they say
about that bastard?

327
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,186
I know he's a bit rough.

328
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:24,161
He's far worse than that.
You'll be crippled for life.

329
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:27,757
- How's that?
- I'm telling you, honest.

330
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:29,199
I'm not kidding.

331
00:30:29,268 --> 00:30:32,533
I knew one young guy
who was his student.

332
00:30:32,605 --> 00:30:35,199
- Gee, was he a mess.
- What?

333
00:30:35,274 --> 00:30:38,004
He lost all his teeth.
His hair torn out.

334
00:30:38,077 --> 00:30:41,672
Should have seen his busted nose.
His own father didn't know him.

335
00:30:41,748 --> 00:30:43,340
That monster devil...

336
00:30:43,416 --> 00:30:46,817
he's a real sadist, a torturer.

337
00:30:48,654 --> 00:30:51,748
- But what can I do?
- You sure better do something.

338
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,286
Sure. I gotta think fast.

339
00:30:55,361 --> 00:30:57,352
Think, damn you. Think!

340
00:31:06,172 --> 00:31:08,072
Let's see. You might...

341
00:31:08,141 --> 00:31:10,609
We run like hell!

342
00:31:10,676 --> 00:31:12,906
That's not running.
Come on.

343
00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:14,970
- Come on, hurry.
- Yeah, okay!

344
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:16,639
Follow me.

345
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:23,780
Cookies.

346
00:31:23,856 --> 00:31:26,757
Cookies. All right.
Take a seat there.

347
00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:45,437
Excuse me.
Do you mind if I sit here?

348
00:31:45,511 --> 00:31:47,843
No, sit down. Go on.

349
00:31:47,914 --> 00:31:50,144
You're all by yourself.
That's good.

350
00:31:50,216 --> 00:31:52,707
- I don't like eating on my own.
- Go on, sit down.

351
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,717
This restaurant's not bad, huh?

352
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:59,451
just look at the color of their food...
so red and juicy.

353
00:31:59,525 --> 00:32:02,619
Real good smell.
Really fantastic, huh?

354
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:07,628
What can I get you, sir?

355
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,861
This is such a surprise.
Where's your friend?

356
00:32:09,936 --> 00:32:12,234
- What's that?
- No, go ahead, eat.

357
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,670
For you, sir?

358
00:32:13,739 --> 00:32:16,936
We'll start with
a bowl of shark's fin.

359
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:19,671
- Sorry. We got no shark's fin.
- That's too bad.

360
00:32:19,745 --> 00:32:22,714
Soy pork, roast goose
with plenty of fat.

361
00:32:22,782 --> 00:32:26,377
- Steamed grouper.
- Sorry, sir. No grouper.

362
00:32:26,452 --> 00:32:28,477
Never mind.
just bring what you have.

363
00:32:28,554 --> 00:32:31,148
Stewed abalone, shrimp noodles,
and be quick about it.

364
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:33,192
Yes, sir.

365
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:35,693
- A pint of wine. Right away.
- One wine.

366
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:39,097
Can you really eat as much as that?

367
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,395
Yeah, easy.
I'm growing still.

368
00:32:41,467 --> 00:32:43,992
Gotta keep myself strong and fat.

369
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,615
Here, sir.

370
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,284
That's great. Oh, boy!

371
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,419
Now we eat. Give me!

372
00:33:09,495 --> 00:33:11,087
That's okay.

373
00:33:12,431 --> 00:33:14,695
- Have a little wine. Be my guest.
- Really, l...

374
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:17,065
- Drink up. This looks good.
- Most kind of you.

375
00:33:17,136 --> 00:33:19,331
Oh, boy, I'm starving.

376
00:33:19,405 --> 00:33:21,771
Here, just taste that.

377
00:33:21,841 --> 00:33:23,433
Eat up!

378
00:33:25,011 --> 00:33:28,538
Go on, don't be shy.
Help yourself to what you want.

379
00:33:28,614 --> 00:33:31,208
Enjoy yourself.
Don't stand on ceremony. Here.

380
00:33:31,284 --> 00:33:33,252
- To us.
- Cheers.

381
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,725
Go on!

382
00:33:43,796 --> 00:33:45,388
Say, boy...

383
00:34:01,347 --> 00:34:03,281
He sure gets the food down him.

384
00:34:37,316 --> 00:34:38,749
Feels great.

385
00:35:05,378 --> 00:35:08,438
They sure know how to cook here.
That meal was really something.

386
00:35:08,514 --> 00:35:10,675
Delicious.
Now, listen, friend.

387
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,150
I gotta move now,
but I got an idea.

388
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:16,188
Tonight I insist you've gotta
be my guest. Don't worry.

389
00:35:16,255 --> 00:35:19,224
I'll pay as I'm leaving.
We'll meet again tomorrow night.

390
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:21,225
You must finish your dinner, okay?

391
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:23,386
See you tomorrow.
Bye for now.

392
00:35:25,264 --> 00:35:27,425
- Sorry.
- See you tomorrow.

393
00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:30,796
That'll be exactly $1.05.

394
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,739
- I ain't gonna pay.
- You're not?

395
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,400
Well, who is?

396
00:35:38,544 --> 00:35:41,104
The old guy over there.
He's paying.

397
00:35:44,817 --> 00:35:47,786
- He's a good friend of yours?
- I'm his son, you idiot!

398
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:49,912
Is that so, now?

399
00:35:49,989 --> 00:35:52,082
just how many fathers do you have?

400
00:35:53,259 --> 00:35:57,593
For your information, that guy owns this
place, and you're talking to his son.

401
00:35:57,663 --> 00:36:00,097
I guess that leaves you a bastard.

402
00:36:00,166 --> 00:36:03,795
Yeah. Thought that
the meals went free here?

403
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:07,100
We don't give credit,
so get your money out.

404
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:18,210
I ain't pouncing meals from you.
Forgot my money, that's all.

405
00:36:18,284 --> 00:36:21,685
I'll fetch it right now
and I'll pay your check.

406
00:36:37,036 --> 00:36:38,833
Gorilla, you just take him.

407
00:37:38,397 --> 00:37:41,059
No, hold it, hold it.
Hold it. Stop.

408
00:37:48,374 --> 00:37:51,866
Bastard pig you are.
You were so greedy for all that food.

409
00:37:51,944 --> 00:37:55,573
Now, spit the lot out.
Yes, right out.

410
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,411
One roast goose.

411
00:38:06,725 --> 00:38:09,125
One soy pork out.

412
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:12,961
- That's enough.
- And one pint of wine yet.

413
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,768
Now you want to look in my belly.
I feel hungry again.

414
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:35,153
Break it up right now,
or do you wanna kill the boy?

415
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:39,419
He's not finished yet.
He's gonna clean the toilets up.

416
00:38:43,395 --> 00:38:45,420
You wanted something to clean, huh?

417
00:38:51,437 --> 00:38:53,029
Thanks, old man.

418
00:38:55,975 --> 00:38:58,773
You dare to interfere in our business?

419
00:38:58,844 --> 00:39:01,972
I'm the Gorilla.
Watch how I jump!

420
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,150
jump then.

421
00:39:09,488 --> 00:39:11,820
Now he's jumping, all right.

422
00:39:14,526 --> 00:39:16,118
It hurts!

423
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,617
Here's how to wash your face.

424
00:40:20,259 --> 00:40:21,851
You thief!

425
00:40:26,532 --> 00:40:28,727
- Let's be friends. Please.
- Okay, let's be friends.

426
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:46,512
You've got strength in your arms,
but you've brains of straw.

427
00:40:47,252 --> 00:40:49,186
Stop that. Stop that.

428
00:41:00,766 --> 00:41:02,529
This way.

429
00:41:13,045 --> 00:41:14,672
You know what?

430
00:41:14,747 --> 00:41:17,614
I can't help wondering
how old you are, old man.

431
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,947
For your age, you sure are tough.

432
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,816
A necessity.

433
00:41:21,887 --> 00:41:26,290
I've had to be tough
to be able to survive to this age.

434
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:29,794
No, I'm not like young men today.
None of you can fight.

435
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,796
Always getting thrashed.

436
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:37,635
Today wasn't a good day.
just bad luck, really.

437
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:41,104
Usually I'm tremendous. With just
one blow, I'd have done the lot.

438
00:41:41,173 --> 00:41:42,902
You've still gotta see my real style.

439
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,702
That sounds to me like an excuse.

440
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,978
I forgot to ask you what your name is
and why you couldn't pay for your meal.

441
00:41:53,218 --> 00:41:57,780
That's a long story, mister.
And what's your name anyhow?

442
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,382
It's Mr. Su.

443
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,089
There's a fellow with that same name
screwing up my life!

444
00:42:06,665 --> 00:42:10,431
- That's why I'm here on the run.
- Who is he?

445
00:42:10,502 --> 00:42:12,993
He's this creep named Su Hua-Chi.

446
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:16,667
It was my own father
asked for this guy to fix me.

447
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:20,303
- You afraid then?
- What? I'm not afraid at all.

448
00:42:20,379 --> 00:42:23,314
Though I've heard it said
he's real cunning...

449
00:42:23,382 --> 00:42:24,781
violent and mean.

450
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:27,444
But one day I'm gonna fix him!

451
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:29,453
That old fart.

452
00:42:29,521 --> 00:42:32,217
Wait till I see him.
I'll tear him apart!

453
00:42:32,291 --> 00:42:36,421
- You'd fix the old fart?
- Yeah, sure.

454
00:42:36,495 --> 00:42:38,224
Hey, just where do you come from?

455
00:42:38,297 --> 00:42:43,325
I have the sky as a roof,
and I sleep wherever I may.

456
00:42:43,402 --> 00:42:45,131
- You're a bum. That it?
- Sure.

457
00:42:45,204 --> 00:42:48,037
Everyone knows me as Su Hua-Chi.

458
00:42:53,645 --> 00:42:55,579
That's the name, young fella.

459
00:43:16,268 --> 00:43:19,499
Lucky for me, I got fast legs.
That was a new one.

460
00:43:22,207 --> 00:43:24,368
- You run as fast as you like.
- Let go!

461
00:43:24,443 --> 00:43:26,377
You can't get away though.

462
00:43:33,318 --> 00:43:35,616
Now, you listen. Your father
has paid me well to train you...

463
00:43:35,687 --> 00:43:38,053
and I'm gonna do it.

464
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:45,255
It hurts.
How long will this take you?

465
00:43:47,332 --> 00:43:49,698
- A day?
- One year exactly.

466
00:43:49,768 --> 00:43:51,702
I'll never make it.

467
00:43:59,978 --> 00:44:02,606
As you already got your loot,
might as well forget it.

468
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,548
I wouldn't do that.
I think I'll enjoy it.

469
00:44:05,617 --> 00:44:07,551
I'll see you in hell!

470
00:44:23,101 --> 00:44:24,295
Damn you!

471
00:44:26,738 --> 00:44:29,935
Let me go.
You'll break my neck.

472
00:44:35,914 --> 00:44:38,508
Well, you're just a stupid old fool.

473
00:44:38,584 --> 00:44:41,781
You like to pretend that
you're a real tiger, do you?

474
00:44:41,853 --> 00:44:44,447
Well, I'll show you
what a tiger's about.

475
00:44:57,269 --> 00:44:59,203
I see your tiger's got a bad paw, eh?

476
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,452
It's still there.

477
00:45:36,475 --> 00:45:40,343
All that kung fu.
Looks like dancing.

478
00:45:41,313 --> 00:45:42,905
Crane Attacks!

479
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:47,051
Crane Strikes!

480
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,384
Angry Crane Eats Shrimp.

481
00:45:51,456 --> 00:45:54,050
The Crane Flies.

482
00:46:09,541 --> 00:46:11,839
Your finger's stronger than teeth.

483
00:46:14,746 --> 00:46:16,976
Is it broken?

484
00:46:17,049 --> 00:46:18,516
Now let's start!

485
00:46:21,753 --> 00:46:23,516
You scared me then.

486
00:46:23,588 --> 00:46:26,056
Climbing trees to get away now!

487
00:46:26,124 --> 00:46:28,592
Bastard. Monkey Kung Fu.

488
00:46:56,555 --> 00:46:58,716
You're choking me.

489
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:00,417
Ready to learn?

490
00:47:00,492 --> 00:47:02,960
- Help!
- Answer! Answer!

491
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:06,156
- My poor head.
- Well, are you?

492
00:47:06,231 --> 00:47:08,165
I guess I haven't got much choice...

493
00:47:08,233 --> 00:47:10,793
but I don't much care for your methods
of finding your pupils.

494
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:39,924
Let me down!
I don't wanna die yet!

495
00:47:39,998 --> 00:47:41,590
That's enough.

496
00:47:50,776 --> 00:47:53,404
I thought you were supposed
to be a teacher.

497
00:47:53,478 --> 00:47:55,878
You'd break a gorilla in half.

498
00:47:57,516 --> 00:48:01,111
All students with style
must learn how to fall.

499
00:48:01,186 --> 00:48:04,019
Right? That was only
your first lesson.

500
00:48:57,509 --> 00:48:59,534
Where were you going?

501
00:48:59,611 --> 00:49:02,637
- I was going to have a piss.
- Have a piss over there.

502
00:49:02,714 --> 00:49:04,181
All right!

503
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:20,420
Now, fill up the right jars
and the left jars.

504
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,601
Good. Now, back to the right jar.

505
00:49:33,945 --> 00:49:36,038
Back jar to the front jar.

506
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,421
And now to the right jar.

507
00:49:46,691 --> 00:49:48,716
Now to the front jar.

508
00:49:53,632 --> 00:49:55,224
All right.

509
00:49:56,935 --> 00:49:59,802
Stupid old man, playing games.
Back jar to left jar.

510
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:02,669
Breaking my back
is what this will do.

511
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:06,201
Come on, hurry!

512
00:50:08,713 --> 00:50:10,647
My balls are busted.

513
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,809
Come on out of there.

514
00:50:52,257 --> 00:50:54,418
Shit!

515
00:50:54,492 --> 00:50:57,393
Hope you drown in there,
you old crank!

516
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:31,421
Hey, you, get out.

517
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:36,729
Asshole, get out of here.
Can't you hear?

518
00:51:38,103 --> 00:51:41,266
Are you blind?
These pants won't dry on their own!

519
00:51:42,507 --> 00:51:45,601
You're done hanging around here,
you bum. Keep moving your ass.

520
00:51:46,444 --> 00:51:50,210
Who says? This your pad?
And suppose I don't move it?

521
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:54,580
A big mouth on a wet ass.

522
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,814
It should be taught some manners.

523
00:52:06,264 --> 00:52:08,926
How's it feel? All dry?

524
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,630
Right, little fart. I'll give you dry.
I'll shove you in head first!

525
00:52:23,848 --> 00:52:25,782
Come on.
Watch the birdie.

526
00:52:42,233 --> 00:52:44,793
What's that supposed to be?

527
00:52:44,869 --> 00:52:47,929
Kung fu?
Who taught you that load of shit?

528
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,931
No one calls my dad's kung fu shit!

529
00:53:07,092 --> 00:53:09,458
judging by you,
your old man's kung fu stinks.

530
00:53:09,527 --> 00:53:12,963
I wouldn't ask him to wipe the shit
off my damned asshole.

531
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:20,961
Perhaps it's better
you called me Father.

532
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,774
Get bent, okay?

533
00:53:30,782 --> 00:53:33,683
Sit. Stand up.

534
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,879
Sit down.

535
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,724
You see, all my dogs must obey.

536
00:54:06,417 --> 00:54:08,851
I won't even need my hands
for you, stupid.

537
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,911
Ah, you better use them!

538
00:54:10,989 --> 00:54:12,923
I'm not scared!

539
00:54:24,335 --> 00:54:26,303
Well, shithead, had enough?

540
00:54:26,371 --> 00:54:29,101
I won't stop until
you sink in hellfire!

541
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:45,217
- Get back!
- What?

542
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:47,349
Ah, so you're in
your turtle shell now.

543
00:55:03,007 --> 00:55:06,170
Your skull's like butter.
It's not worth it.

544
00:55:06,244 --> 00:55:08,644
You can study kung fu
for 20 years if you want...

545
00:55:08,713 --> 00:55:10,647
but you will never beat me.

546
00:55:23,795 --> 00:55:26,730
Me kill a nobody like you? No.

547
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:30,859
Could ruin that good reputation of mine.
Bend down, you little squirt!

548
00:55:30,935 --> 00:55:34,598
Crawl between my legs!
Go clean crud and pissholes!

549
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:38,074
Crawl!

550
00:56:06,371 --> 00:56:08,202
Hey, hold it.

551
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:13,070
Aren't these your pants?

552
00:57:02,593 --> 00:57:05,118
Well, now, what's that
supposed to be?

553
00:57:05,196 --> 00:57:07,664
Kung fu? Who taught you
that load of shit? Your father?

554
00:57:17,075 --> 00:57:19,407
Your skull's like butter.

555
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:23,379
Even if you were to study for 20 years,
you wouldn't beat me.

556
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:42,194
To kill a nobody like you? No.

557
00:57:42,266 --> 00:57:45,235
It could ruin that
good reputation of mine.

558
00:57:45,303 --> 00:57:49,205
Bend down, you little squirt!
You'd best go clean crud and pissholes!

559
00:57:49,273 --> 00:57:51,537
Crawl between my legs! Crawl!

560
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,948
Careful with that wine.

561
00:59:11,022 --> 00:59:13,149
It's one of the best, huh?

562
00:59:15,726 --> 00:59:17,660
It's good, huh?

563
00:59:17,728 --> 00:59:19,662
Let me dry your clothes.

564
00:59:36,047 --> 00:59:38,379
Bare knees?
What happened to your pants?

565
00:59:53,064 --> 00:59:55,532
- My God! It's burning!
- My coat!

566
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,158
Help!

567
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:03,102
Oh, look at my coat.

568
01:00:37,942 --> 01:00:39,876
My wrists are broken!

569
01:01:02,967 --> 01:01:05,265
My wrists... they hurt.

570
01:01:05,336 --> 01:01:07,827
Your wrists seem to be very weak.

571
01:01:15,246 --> 01:01:18,010
If I were a rabbit,
I'd want to eat greens.

572
01:01:18,082 --> 01:01:21,848
The tea's weak,
and it's cold again.

573
01:01:23,854 --> 01:01:26,322
Oh, Teacher, it gives me
a headache now.

574
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:27,687
You're hungry, eat.

575
01:01:35,633 --> 01:01:37,965
What's wrong? Weak wrists?

576
01:01:38,035 --> 01:01:40,799
Can't pick up your food? Here.

577
01:03:05,523 --> 01:03:07,684
Teacher, I'm finished.

578
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,454
- That was quick.
- Yeah.

579
01:03:11,529 --> 01:03:14,123
Use these smaller cups
to empty again.

580
01:03:16,067 --> 01:03:18,228
You go on.

581
01:03:18,302 --> 01:03:21,794
Oh, I wish I'd known
about this part first.

582
01:03:29,513 --> 01:03:31,777
Oh, this is killing me!

583
01:03:37,388 --> 01:03:39,481
- Hey, Fei-Hung.
- What?

584
01:03:39,557 --> 01:03:41,889
Crack this walnut for me.

585
01:03:41,959 --> 01:03:43,392
Sure.

586
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:49,731
You've gotta do it this way.

587
01:03:51,302 --> 01:03:52,564
There. Now you try it.

588
01:04:52,363 --> 01:04:54,593
Please, Teacher!
Haven't I cracked enough for today?

589
01:04:54,665 --> 01:04:57,190
A monkey would die
under the strain.

590
01:04:57,268 --> 01:04:59,566
Why don't we take a walk, huh?

591
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,872
All right.

592
01:05:05,242 --> 01:05:07,403
I did it! Good.

593
01:05:07,478 --> 01:05:09,412
You won again.

594
01:05:12,716 --> 01:05:14,445
Oh, boy!

595
01:05:14,518 --> 01:05:17,282
- You're quick at it.
- Yeah.

596
01:05:18,722 --> 01:05:22,089
Okay, Teacher,
what are you gonna bet on it?

597
01:05:25,863 --> 01:05:27,797
Hey there. Get going now.

598
01:05:27,865 --> 01:05:29,799
What, go now?

599
01:05:29,867 --> 01:05:32,358
I haven't made
my wine money yet.

600
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:37,335
I still got to win
some more yet.

601
01:05:37,408 --> 01:05:40,639
- There! Who's betting?
- Get your money on the table.

602
01:05:40,711 --> 01:05:42,838
Back your winner now.

603
01:05:46,917 --> 01:05:50,512
- Come on!
- Come on, play!

604
01:05:50,588 --> 01:05:53,819
Play the game!
Play the game!

605
01:05:53,891 --> 01:05:57,383
Hey, what is this? Come on!

606
01:05:57,461 --> 01:06:00,089
Can the noise.

607
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:01,597
Play.

608
01:06:03,467 --> 01:06:06,163
You win!

609
01:06:06,237 --> 01:06:09,798
We've won again! We've got it right on!
This is great!

610
01:06:10,875 --> 01:06:12,775
I told you he would.

611
01:06:14,945 --> 01:06:17,413
We've got enough to buy
a decent meal and good wine.

612
01:06:17,481 --> 01:06:19,449
- Huh? We're rich!
- Hey, you there.

613
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:23,749
Old man. I've got 50 to lose.
I'll play you for it.

614
01:06:24,655 --> 01:06:26,088
Right.

615
01:06:26,156 --> 01:06:28,249
This should be good.

616
01:06:54,318 --> 01:06:56,513
- Go ahead, choose.
- Oh, sure, sir.

617
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:03,955
Let's see.

618
01:07:14,905 --> 01:07:16,839
You see? It's not there.

619
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:18,966
- Hold on.
- Hey, what the...

620
01:07:19,043 --> 01:07:22,570
You think you're quick, huh?
Listen, baldy, my eyes are quicker.

621
01:07:23,747 --> 01:07:25,681
Lay off!

622
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:29,651
You're trying to cheat, huh?

623
01:07:32,756 --> 01:07:35,281
Police! Police!

624
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:37,190
Hey, everybody run!
Let's go!

625
01:07:45,369 --> 01:07:47,496
You're a dishonest cheat
and a dirty thief.

626
01:07:47,571 --> 01:07:49,835
- Give me back that money!
- Nah!

627
01:07:49,907 --> 01:07:52,876
You must be joking.
I ain't got no money, you meathead.

628
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:55,173
- Don't you recognize who I am?
- Who cares who you are!

629
01:07:56,246 --> 01:07:58,874
That's right. And I'll tell you
who you're talking to.

630
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:00,883
Rat, the Iron-Headed Bullet.

631
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:06,654
Oh, wow. That's horrible.

632
01:08:07,891 --> 01:08:09,825
Scared, are you?

633
01:08:09,893 --> 01:08:13,454
Hey, baldy!
You'd better get this straight.

634
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:16,897
You're gonna pay back that money.
I don't care if you're a tiger!

635
01:08:18,102 --> 01:08:19,797
I warn you, shitface.

636
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:22,839
I pick who I'm gonna bury next.

637
01:08:22,906 --> 01:08:26,307
Say your prayers fast, 'cause you're
about to feel my iron head!

638
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:49,959
- Teacher, his head's much too hard.
- Don't give up now.

639
01:08:50,034 --> 01:08:52,502
Let's see how
you stop Iron Bullet!

640
01:09:16,226 --> 01:09:18,421
Good. Very good.

641
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:46,147
You sure can jump.

642
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:48,418
Bet you'd never guess
that that's how you'd end up...

643
01:09:48,492 --> 01:09:51,017
jumping into someone's pants.

644
01:09:51,095 --> 01:09:52,323
Why, you...

645
01:10:19,623 --> 01:10:22,592
Great! It works!
Here, hard nut, try this!

646
01:10:26,029 --> 01:10:29,396
Gong! You still feel
like fighting, huh?

647
01:10:37,307 --> 01:10:39,400
I missed!

648
01:10:46,016 --> 01:10:48,075
Looks like your bullet's
got carbuncles.

649
01:10:50,554 --> 01:10:52,146
That's enough, please!

650
01:10:52,222 --> 01:10:53,814
Sure.

651
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:11,867
Teacher, my wrists are killing me!

652
01:11:27,991 --> 01:11:29,925
Get up!

653
01:11:38,202 --> 01:11:41,501
Oh, my hands!

654
01:11:46,777 --> 01:11:49,302
No more exercises.
Go fetch some wine from the village.

655
01:11:49,379 --> 01:11:51,813
Oh, sure. Okay, Teacher.

656
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:04,752
Waiter!

657
01:12:07,397 --> 01:12:09,922
- Some more wine in there.
- How much wine, sir?

658
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,401
Fill the bottle with three cups.
That should be enough.

659
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:15,563
Red wine or white, sir?

660
01:12:15,639 --> 01:12:17,971
White wine, you idiot!
Be quick!

661
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:24,980
Sir?

662
01:12:34,758 --> 01:12:36,692
Sure. Yeah.

663
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:49,429
Damn it!

664
01:12:49,506 --> 01:12:51,974
Where's that stupid boy
got to with my wine?

665
01:13:02,019 --> 01:13:03,987
Where is he?

666
01:13:09,593 --> 01:13:11,527
That's the fella.

667
01:13:18,568 --> 01:13:22,231
- Old man, where are you from?
- And who may you be?

668
01:13:26,710 --> 01:13:29,178
Old man, have you ever heard
of the name King of Bamboo?

669
01:13:29,246 --> 01:13:32,579
Yes, of course I have.

670
01:13:32,649 --> 01:13:35,083
I have no doubt
Su Hua-Chi rings a little bell?

671
01:13:37,888 --> 01:13:39,549
I and no other.

672
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:44,727
- Let's get out of here.
- But hold it, Bamboo.

673
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:46,729
- You don't believe that's Su Hua-Chi?
- Why not?

674
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:49,527
See there? His hands.

675
01:13:50,467 --> 01:13:53,334
Su Hua-Chi wouldn't be shaking
like that, would he?

676
01:13:53,403 --> 01:13:55,337
You can see he's a fake.

677
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:04,175
Got it. You think you're being funny?
But I ain't taken in so easy.

678
01:14:04,948 --> 01:14:07,849
But I'm not lying to you.
After all, I am Su Hua-Chi.

679
01:14:07,918 --> 01:14:09,613
Well, let's see.

680
01:15:03,407 --> 01:15:06,638
- Teacher!
- Give me the wine!

681
01:15:15,819 --> 01:15:18,083
It's water!

682
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,258
You idiot!
Now see what you've done.

683
01:15:35,338 --> 01:15:36,930
Teacher!

684
01:15:58,195 --> 01:15:59,787
This way!

685
01:16:33,463 --> 01:16:35,055
So, they were damn lucky.

686
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:37,930
Next time I see them,
I shall take them apart.

687
01:16:38,001 --> 01:16:39,935
Let's go.

688
01:17:03,460 --> 01:17:06,122
That's bad.
You must eat after a fight.

689
01:17:07,697 --> 01:17:11,463
Teacher, you know I'm sorry.
It was all because I spent the money.

690
01:17:11,535 --> 01:17:14,368
Seems bad luck
follows you around.

691
01:17:14,437 --> 01:17:17,804
I have seen a lot of things
in these past 70 years.

692
01:17:17,874 --> 01:17:21,867
But till today, I can honestly say
I've never been beaten in a fight.

693
01:17:21,945 --> 01:17:23,640
It wasn't that Bamboo
was better than you.

694
01:17:23,713 --> 01:17:25,874
It's because you've got no strength
without your wine.

695
01:17:27,384 --> 01:17:29,716
You sure can talk.

696
01:17:29,786 --> 01:17:32,050
Well, it's true.
But if I wasn't so badly trained...

697
01:17:32,122 --> 01:17:35,148
I could've beat that no-good jerk,
even though he's bamboo king.

698
01:17:36,726 --> 01:17:39,160
You mean to say you think
I'm not teaching you right?

699
01:17:39,229 --> 01:17:40,662
Is that it?

700
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:43,995
Well, it's all exercise.
just falling all over the ground.

701
01:17:44,067 --> 01:17:46,433
Boring wrist exercises.
How could I win with that?

702
01:17:53,176 --> 01:17:55,406
Don't you realize your father is...

703
01:17:55,478 --> 01:17:57,742
without question,
a real good teacher?

704
01:17:57,814 --> 01:18:00,647
Wong Chi-Ying's methods
are some of the best there are.

705
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:03,413
So why do you think he asked me
to teach you my style?

706
01:18:04,788 --> 01:18:07,256
just so you could torture me.

707
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:14,156
He wants you to train with me 'cause
he knows I've got a secret style.

708
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:19,567
- Tell me about it then.
- The Secret of my Eight Drunk Gods.

709
01:18:19,636 --> 01:18:21,604
Oh, yeah? I suppose
you'll probably teach...

710
01:18:21,671 --> 01:18:24,538
the Crawl of
the Drunken Cat to me.

711
01:18:24,608 --> 01:18:26,542
That shows your damned ignorance.

712
01:18:26,610 --> 01:18:29,636
Dozens and dozens of men
have pleaded with me to teach them.

713
01:18:29,713 --> 01:18:32,181
Always refuse. So there.

714
01:19:05,715 --> 01:19:08,377
Don't be fooled
by my staggering around.

715
01:19:08,451 --> 01:19:10,612
There's power inside to kill.

716
01:19:10,687 --> 01:19:12,848
It looks real enough,
yet it isn't.

717
01:19:12,922 --> 01:19:16,255
The fact that you're pretending
to lose lets you win.

718
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:38,606
So, clever, isn't it?

719
01:19:38,682 --> 01:19:41,583
So why haven't you shown me yet?

720
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:44,484
You must know
the importance of basics.

721
01:19:44,554 --> 01:19:47,717
Without them, all your work
is a waste of time.

722
01:19:47,791 --> 01:19:49,759
Why do you think
I've been pushing you?

723
01:19:49,826 --> 01:19:52,556
There are basics that you need
in order to master...

724
01:19:52,629 --> 01:19:54,392
the techniques
of the Eight Drunken Gods.

725
01:19:55,432 --> 01:19:58,026
- I think you're ready for it.
- Is that right?

726
01:19:58,101 --> 01:20:00,968
To study my style,
you'll find it easier...

727
01:20:01,037 --> 01:20:02,971
if you have a drink first.

728
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:08,303
Come on, drink up.

729
01:20:14,951 --> 01:20:16,885
Take another cup.

730
01:20:22,459 --> 01:20:25,519
Now, Fei-Hung,
did you go to school, boy?

731
01:20:25,595 --> 01:20:28,120
Sure. It was awful.
Real stupid professors.

732
01:20:30,533 --> 01:20:31,795
Drink down the wine.

733
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:37,503
- Cups should not rest!
- I'll sing you songs.

734
01:20:37,574 --> 01:20:39,804
And it'll put your ears
to the test, right?

735
01:20:40,977 --> 01:20:44,538
<i>Power and wealth are to no avail</i>

736
01:20:44,614 --> 01:20:47,845
<i>Let only our drinking prevail</i>

737
01:20:47,917 --> 01:20:49,851
Boy, enough. Enough!

738
01:20:53,957 --> 01:20:56,619
A sober man and the sages...

739
01:20:56,693 --> 01:20:59,025
are both lost through the ages.

740
01:20:59,095 --> 01:21:01,529
But all our brave drinkers
never shall die.

741
01:21:03,466 --> 01:21:06,401
But all our brave drinkers
never shall die.

742
01:21:06,469 --> 01:21:09,267
Shingfung produces wine...

743
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:13,570
You know why soldiers
are always so young?

744
01:21:16,513 --> 01:21:18,606
Even the king couldn't stop
my drinking!

745
01:21:19,382 --> 01:21:22,476
Let's drink a toast
to our ship that's sinking.

746
01:21:24,454 --> 01:21:26,945
With uplifting cup,
I say to the moon...

747
01:21:29,993 --> 01:21:32,621
Why does my shadow appear to swoon?

748
01:21:33,530 --> 01:21:35,395
Wine is ready in cup, you see.

749
01:21:36,466 --> 01:21:38,331
Put down my cup.

750
01:21:38,401 --> 01:21:40,392
The horses are "wazy."

751
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:44,429
Fallen in the fields of battle,
the soldier says...

752
01:21:44,507 --> 01:21:47,374
"Who will remember me?

753
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:49,378
Who will remember me?"

754
01:22:00,223 --> 01:22:04,159
<i>The god Lu. The drunkard</i>
<i>with internal strength.</i>

755
01:22:41,264 --> 01:22:45,963
<i>The god Li. A drunken cripple</i>
<i>with a powerful right leg.</i>

756
01:23:12,295 --> 01:23:16,925
<i>The god Fat Han.</i>
<i>A drunkard holding a pot in his arms.</i>

757
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:47,819
<i>The god Lan. A drunk with</i>
<i>a sudden deadly waist attack.</i>

758
01:24:14,791 --> 01:24:18,693
<i>The god Chang.</i>
<i>The drunk with the swift double kicks.</i>

759
01:24:47,056 --> 01:24:50,184
<i>Drunken Tso, the god with</i>
<i>the powerful throat lock.</i>

760
01:25:16,119 --> 01:25:19,111
<i>The artful god Han. The drunken</i>
<i>flute player with the powerful wrists.</i>

761
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:42,705
<i>The god Miss Ho.</i>
<i>The drunken woman flaunting her body.</i>

762
01:25:51,854 --> 01:25:54,345
Come on, boy.
This is serious.

763
01:25:54,424 --> 01:25:56,756
This style's meant for women,
isn't it?

764
01:25:56,826 --> 01:25:59,420
Miss Ho is a woman, yes,
but she's strong.

765
01:25:59,495 --> 01:26:01,429
Watch me and follow.

766
01:26:21,718 --> 01:26:24,915
- Can you do it?
- Oh, yeah, it's real easy.

767
01:26:24,987 --> 01:26:27,512
- Put some energy in it.
- Yeah, okay!

768
01:26:31,828 --> 01:26:34,262
This is sissy.
I won't do it.

769
01:26:39,635 --> 01:26:44,436
Mr. Wong, just why did you persuade
the people of Bull Hill...

770
01:26:44,507 --> 01:26:46,907
not to sell me their property?

771
01:26:46,976 --> 01:26:49,206
What was your reason for it?

772
01:26:50,446 --> 01:26:53,006
Was it because of that business
over your son?

773
01:26:53,082 --> 01:26:57,109
That's a personal issue,
and it will be settled in good time.

774
01:26:57,186 --> 01:26:59,518
I'm not responsible.
What is your game?

775
01:26:59,589 --> 01:27:01,955
What is yours?

776
01:27:02,024 --> 01:27:05,983
Mr. Li, I am most interested to know
why you want to buy Bull Hill.

777
01:27:06,062 --> 01:27:08,292
As you wish to know,
I'll tell you.

778
01:27:08,364 --> 01:27:12,323
That old graveyard up there,
it's been haunting us for centuries...

779
01:27:12,401 --> 01:27:14,596
disturbing family spirits.

780
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:17,833
They'll get more than $20 per lot.

781
01:27:17,907 --> 01:27:19,841
It's good money for that land.

782
01:27:19,909 --> 01:27:22,207
Then you butt your nose in
where it isn't wanted.

783
01:27:22,278 --> 01:27:25,679
- You mean you want to buy a graveyard.
- Huh? Huh?

784
01:27:25,748 --> 01:27:28,717
Don't you believe me?
There's a curse on the name of Lee...

785
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:30,719
and it must be exorcised.

786
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:33,085
I've got three mistresses
without children.

787
01:27:33,156 --> 01:27:36,387
I'd be content with a chicken egg,
but they can't produce that.

788
01:27:36,459 --> 01:27:40,725
Or might you be
becoming a little senile?

789
01:27:43,766 --> 01:27:46,200
Yeah, you like to talk some, Mr. Li.

790
01:27:46,269 --> 01:27:48,499
I don't find it amusing,
I'm afraid.

791
01:27:48,571 --> 01:27:51,005
- And what's that supposed to mean?
- Just this.

792
01:27:51,073 --> 01:27:54,668
You want Bull Hill, in order that you
can have what's under the ground.

793
01:27:54,744 --> 01:27:57,736
- Huh? You must be mad!
- The coal.

794
01:27:57,814 --> 01:28:01,045
- Bull!
- You know very well that Bull Hill...

795
01:28:01,117 --> 01:28:03,312
has a rich coal seam downriver.

796
01:28:03,386 --> 01:28:06,822
And that's a large interest
you've got in Panco Company.

797
01:28:06,889 --> 01:28:08,857
Yeah. That's why
you want to buy...

798
01:28:08,925 --> 01:28:11,052
and I'm going to see
that you don't!

799
01:28:15,998 --> 01:28:17,522
There's a real big
deposit there.

800
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,625
Now, Wong,
let's cut you in on it.

801
01:28:19,702 --> 01:28:24,901
As soon as the deal's over, I'll see
that there is 20% in it for you.

802
01:28:24,974 --> 01:28:27,966
Is that so?
I'm highly flattered.

803
01:28:28,044 --> 01:28:30,308
Kind of you, but I refuse.

804
01:28:30,379 --> 01:28:32,574
In the first instance,
it's not yours to give.

805
01:28:32,648 --> 01:28:35,048
That land belongs to the people here.
Now you can go!

806
01:28:36,385 --> 01:28:39,149
Wong Chi-Ying,
don't try to stop me.

807
01:28:39,222 --> 01:28:42,783
I'll not be thwarted over this.
There's ways and means!

808
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:06,106
<i>I will pay you $ 1,000</i>
<i>for the death of Wong Chi-Ying.</i>

809
01:29:08,284 --> 01:29:10,752
Wong Chi-Ying's dead.

810
01:29:23,366 --> 01:29:25,425
You got everything ready
for the wedding feast?

811
01:29:25,501 --> 01:29:27,435
Sure. Take a look around.

812
01:29:31,841 --> 01:29:34,275
See that there's plenty
of wine at table one.

813
01:29:40,516 --> 01:29:43,451
Well, it's you again,
Mr. Stick.

814
01:29:45,354 --> 01:29:47,515
Big funeral, huh?

815
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:50,892
Are you a damn masochist...

816
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,894
coming here,
looking for more punishment?

817
01:29:52,962 --> 01:29:54,896
Are you still itching?

818
01:29:57,934 --> 01:30:01,495
Yeah, I'm itching, all right.
My hands are restless.

819
01:30:01,570 --> 01:30:04,733
Ah, good.
I'll break another dish.

820
01:30:04,807 --> 01:30:07,298
- What's that, sir?
- Filleted boy on stick.

821
01:30:07,376 --> 01:30:08,968
Go get my stick.

822
01:30:09,045 --> 01:30:10,979
So you cook.

823
01:30:12,415 --> 01:30:14,349
I'll try this.

824
01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:17,552
Good. Real tasty.

825
01:30:18,421 --> 01:30:20,013
Master.

826
01:30:22,358 --> 01:30:24,349
Here's to you.

827
01:30:56,692 --> 01:30:57,954
Here, bite this.

828
01:30:59,295 --> 01:31:01,855
Wow! Your teeth are sharp.
Bit right through the bowl.

829
01:31:23,319 --> 01:31:24,752
Now what?

830
01:31:36,499 --> 01:31:39,297
Be careful now, toothy.
Take it easy.

831
01:31:50,646 --> 01:31:53,274
I did tell you to take it easy.

832
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:10,164
Sit still there!

833
01:32:12,768 --> 01:32:14,827
And upsy-daisy.

834
01:32:17,540 --> 01:32:19,508
And that's called
a Fart for the Stick King.

835
01:32:29,919 --> 01:32:33,184
- That's called Dog Eat Shit.
- Not quite.

836
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:40,392
No sooner said.

837
01:34:04,079 --> 01:34:06,013
He's pissed.

838
01:34:42,484 --> 01:34:44,918
Oh, boy, some good wine.
The old man will like this.

839
01:34:51,393 --> 01:34:54,157
Teacher, I got some wine for you.
Some real good stuff.

840
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:56,164
A present from Mr. Stick.

841
01:34:59,969 --> 01:35:01,800
Teacher!

842
01:35:20,189 --> 01:35:22,350
<i>Fei-Hung, one year has passed...</i>

843
01:35:22,424 --> 01:35:25,484
<i>and the time has come for us</i>
<i>to take our separate paths.</i>

844
01:35:25,561 --> 01:35:28,962
<i>I have taught you all the techniques</i>
<i>and the magic of kung fu.</i>

845
01:35:29,031 --> 01:35:31,659
<i>Practice diligently,</i>
<i>master each technique...</i>

846
01:35:31,734 --> 01:35:35,864
<i>and remember the Eight Drunken Gods</i>
<i>as the ultimate kung fu.</i>

847
01:35:35,938 --> 01:35:38,907
<i>My home is the world.</i>
<i>Try not to miss me.</i>

848
01:35:38,974 --> 01:35:41,670
<i>Return home to your father now</i>
<i>and be a good son.</i>

849
01:35:41,744 --> 01:35:45,737
<i>Just remember, should you ever need me,</i>
<i>I'll come to you.</i>

850
01:35:45,814 --> 01:35:47,748
<i>Su Hua-Chi.</i>

851
01:35:55,991 --> 01:35:59,324
Teacher! Teacher!

852
01:36:25,254 --> 01:36:28,246
- More straight.
- Master Wong!

853
01:36:29,458 --> 01:36:31,221
- Master!
- What is it?

854
01:36:31,293 --> 01:36:34,626
Li and all his man are digging up
on Bull Hill! About 20 of them!

855
01:36:34,697 --> 01:36:36,961
- What? You saw them there?
- Yes, sir.

856
01:36:37,032 --> 01:36:39,865
You, boy, tell my men
I'm up on Bull Hill. Be quick!

857
01:36:39,935 --> 01:36:41,527
Come on then!

858
01:36:43,439 --> 01:36:46,101
Over this way.
Down in the valley.

859
01:37:19,675 --> 01:37:22,075
Your skill in kung fu is renowned.

860
01:37:22,144 --> 01:37:24,237
I'd like to compliment you,
Mr. Wong.

861
01:37:25,881 --> 01:37:30,284
Who are you? I haven't met you before.
Why do you want to kill me?

862
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:35,952
I'm Thunderleg.
For money, I assassinate.

863
01:37:36,024 --> 01:37:39,084
Today I have an opponent
that's worthy.

864
01:37:39,161 --> 01:37:41,629
I'd like to pay
my respects to you.

865
01:37:43,198 --> 01:37:45,996
I've heard of that cold-blooded
assassin that everyone fears...

866
01:37:46,068 --> 01:37:48,036
Thunderleg, who'd sell
his brother for money.

867
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:51,498
You got it.

868
01:37:51,573 --> 01:37:54,508
But killing me,
you won't find that so easy.

869
01:37:55,711 --> 01:37:59,112
Then I guess that
you'll wish me success.

870
01:38:19,435 --> 01:38:22,836
Hands Over Doorknobs,
and Legs Break Down Doors.

871
01:38:31,413 --> 01:38:34,382
You see, 30% hands, 70% legs.

872
01:39:17,125 --> 01:39:19,719
Wong Chi-Ying, are you ready
to meet your death yet?

873
01:39:33,542 --> 01:39:36,204
Father, are you all right?
Don't worry. I'm here, all right?

874
01:39:36,278 --> 01:39:38,269
What are you here for?
This match mine.

875
01:39:38,347 --> 01:39:40,281
You'll see.
I'm a master now.

876
01:39:40,349 --> 01:39:42,442
Whoever insulted you
pays with his life.

877
01:39:42,518 --> 01:39:44,452
That I swear.
I'll fight now.

878
01:39:47,890 --> 01:39:49,824
It's you again.

879
01:39:50,993 --> 01:39:52,927
I'm real glad you got here.

880
01:39:52,995 --> 01:39:54,929
You can help bury
your old man, shitface.

881
01:39:58,133 --> 01:40:02,399
Master Wong, it was a real sad day for
you the day you fathered that asshole.

882
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:05,831
You watch out, or you'll
have a body with no ass!

883
01:40:08,076 --> 01:40:13,605
Dumbhead, I suggest you go clean shit,
or I'll have to bury you too.

884
01:40:13,682 --> 01:40:16,412
I will die, bastard,
but the worms'll grow fat on you!

885
01:40:16,485 --> 01:40:19,147
So, I'm unlucky today.

886
01:40:19,221 --> 01:40:21,280
Two will die for the price of one.

887
01:40:22,190 --> 01:40:23,680
Up yours!

888
01:40:26,862 --> 01:40:30,662
Hey, hold it! Hold it!
Wait for me!

889
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:34,833
- Wait!
- Teacher! How'd you get here?

890
01:40:34,903 --> 01:40:36,837
Oh, now we'll
really have fun.

891
01:40:36,905 --> 01:40:39,100
Su Hua-Chi has to see this fight.

892
01:40:39,975 --> 01:40:42,671
Su Hua-Chi, go!

893
01:40:42,744 --> 01:40:44,678
Go away.
This is not your business.

894
01:40:44,746 --> 01:40:47,943
That's where you're wrong.
It's my business, all right.

895
01:40:48,016 --> 01:40:52,316
Sure is. Don't be afraid.
I promise that I won't lift a finger.

896
01:40:52,387 --> 01:40:54,378
That won't be necessary.
You'll see.

897
01:40:54,456 --> 01:40:56,788
He can do it.
He'll outwit you every time.

898
01:40:59,561 --> 01:41:01,358
Hey! Drink, boy!

899
01:41:42,771 --> 01:41:45,433
Teacher, it's so strong.
What is it?

900
01:41:45,507 --> 01:41:48,237
One hundred percent proof.

901
01:41:48,310 --> 01:41:50,244
I'm drunk.

902
01:42:43,899 --> 01:42:47,835
I'm the drunk
with inner strength.

903
01:42:58,580 --> 01:42:59,945
Cripple Li!

904
01:43:28,844 --> 01:43:32,211
The drunk with
a strong right leg.

905
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:34,441
Rugged, strong leg, go!

906
01:43:51,867 --> 01:43:55,667
A sudden attack to the waist!
Come on! Show him Fat Han!

907
01:43:57,839 --> 01:44:00,467
With a big pot in his arms,
Fat Han's gone mad!

908
01:44:16,124 --> 01:44:18,718
Okay. Not bad.

909
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:21,024
Patience.

910
01:44:21,096 --> 01:44:23,087
You've not seen it all yet.

911
01:44:24,166 --> 01:44:25,724
Artful Hong.

912
01:44:29,905 --> 01:44:33,204
He's the flute player
with the strongest wrist.

913
01:45:00,368 --> 01:45:02,302
Out of tune.

914
01:45:03,438 --> 01:45:05,804
Your flute is bent.

915
01:45:05,874 --> 01:45:09,207
Now, throat lock.
Powerful lock.

916
01:45:09,277 --> 01:45:10,710
So lock it then.

917
01:45:33,235 --> 01:45:36,261
Now your lock is broken.

918
01:45:48,884 --> 01:45:50,613
The Devil's Shadowless Hand!

919
01:45:52,654 --> 01:45:54,485
Very clever.

920
01:45:56,758 --> 01:45:58,692
Drunken Chang!

921
01:46:04,065 --> 01:46:06,124
Drunken Chang
won't reach old age.

922
01:46:23,418 --> 01:46:25,010
Your drunken gods,
how many left?

923
01:46:27,522 --> 01:46:29,285
Ho! Ho!

924
01:46:37,232 --> 01:46:39,564
- I forgot to do my practice!
- What?

925
01:46:39,634 --> 01:46:41,067
I didn't follow with it.

926
01:46:43,872 --> 01:46:46,864
- Can't you teach me now?
- Use my style!

927
01:47:10,632 --> 01:47:13,032
- Oh, my.
- Fei-Hung!

928
01:47:14,069 --> 01:47:16,560
She'll appear there
without her shadow.

929
01:47:16,638 --> 01:47:20,096
just perform the actions.
Watch close and you'll see one.

930
01:47:20,175 --> 01:47:24,737
Try to combine all seven gods and try
and see her as your own Miss Ho.

931
01:47:26,781 --> 01:47:29,648
Ho? You are Miss Ho? Sure.

932
01:47:40,495 --> 01:47:42,986
Damn!

933
01:47:43,064 --> 01:47:45,532
This is called
Widow See Her Lover Off.

934
01:47:52,107 --> 01:47:55,440
That's called
Fat, Old Woman On Toilet.

935
01:48:02,050 --> 01:48:03,984
Old Woman Miss Toilet Seat.

936
01:48:10,892 --> 01:48:12,826
Putting On Her Makeup.

937
01:48:16,297 --> 01:48:19,130
Pretty Girl Looks In Her Glass.

938
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:20,929
These are the famous
Eight Drunken Gods?

939
01:48:22,470 --> 01:48:25,030
So you think that you're
the only master here.

940
01:48:25,106 --> 01:48:27,734
Let me tell you,
my drunk gods don't mess around.

941
01:48:27,809 --> 01:48:31,006
Nobody can fight like they do!

942
01:49:59,667 --> 01:50:02,363
I must be getting addicted.
Here's to Miss Ho!

943
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:53,782
He done it.

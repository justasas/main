"Five hundred dollars for
the death of Chen Kuo-Wei."

2
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,487
Hey, Friend!

3
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,204
Your style's not bad.
But take it easy, you look beat.

4
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,439
You must be the Four Door Fist Champion,

5
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,601
Chen Kuo-Wei?

6
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:35,567
Yes I am, and who might you be?

7
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,002
I'm Yen Tieh-hsin.

8
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,559
I've heard of your devil's kick,

9
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,645
It's famous in the Kung-Fu world.
It has never been defeated...

10
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,686
And it never will.

11
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,966
I suppose I should warn you.

12
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,045
I've been given good money to kill you.

13
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,241
What the hell are you talking about?
Someone's paid you to kill me?

14
00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:03,481
I'll give you twice as much to kill him!

15
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,007
You could, only my honor comes first.

16
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,723
You must realize I'm paid to kill.
The contract's sealed.

17
00:02:11,724 --> 00:02:14,366
- So you must die.
- Don't be so sure of that...

18
00:02:14,367 --> 00:02:18,843
For I, champion of the four Door Fists,
have never yet been defeated!

19
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,251
I don't care who you are,
I'll break every bone in your body...

20
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:24,242
and send you to hell.

21
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,682
"Wong Kei-Ying Martial Art School"

22
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,807
Kai Hsien!

23
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,644
- What's the matter, Master?
- I'm going out, keep an eye on them.

24
00:03:55,645 --> 00:03:56,687
Yes, sir.

25
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,121
Stop!

26
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,842
We won't practice this today.

27
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,604
Let's practice the Fist of Five Styles
which I taught you a few days ago.

28
00:04:14,605 --> 00:04:15,839
He's so lame...

29
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,683
- Three-legged cat.
- Four-eyed rat.

30
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,645
Start now.

31
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,799
Dragon Sees Tiger.

32
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,009
Tiger's rear, Snake's Tongue Darts Out.

33
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,325
Panther Sees Fire,

34
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,481
White Crane Spreads Wings.

35
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,680
Hold it!

36
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,608
Your wrists are too weak.
You can't learn it well, understand?

37
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:23,679
I suppose you think that was funny,
playing tricks on your teacher!

38
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,728
We'll see. Take that! And that!

39
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,127
- It wasn't me!
- Who was it? Tell me.

40
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,599
Who was it?

41
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,284
Wong Fei-Hung.

42
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,801
Wong Fei-Hung.

43
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,323
Even though Master Wong is your father,

44
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,727
you don't have a right
to cause trouble here.

45
00:05:46,728 --> 00:05:49,644
You think Kung-Fu
is just a performance.

46
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,599
You're telling me my Kung-Fu is bad?

47
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,046
Not too bad, but bad enough.

48
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,443
Show me exactly what's wrong with it.

49
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,119
Look at your Panther Sees Fire.

50
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,042
Well what's wrong?

51
00:06:05,043 --> 00:06:08,601
You've exposed your body.
It's easy to attack you.

52
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,286
And that Horse Stance is
bow-legged. Just a kick...

53
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,442
and you'll fall.

54
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,604
Shut up! Shut up you turkeys!

55
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,283
You'd like to test your
teacher's Kung-Fu, would you?

56
00:06:40,284 --> 00:06:42,931
We can all learn from each other.

57
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,402
I can stand almost anything, you bum!
But I've taken enough of this bullshit!

58
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,886
You've exposed your body again.
Do you know that, teacher?

59
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,921
Your hat!

60
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,081
Here you go!

61
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,530
Pork belly, shut up!

62
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,047
Look! Right foot! Snake stance!

63
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,121
Bastard!

64
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,399
Wong Fei-Hung,
you've taught Hsien a lesson.

65
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,368
We all feel very happy about it.

66
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,802
He's too arrogant, I can't stand it.

67
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,647
You really showed him!

68
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,363
That's great...

69
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,439
Eat more then!

70
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,079
No, I'm talking about that girl.

71
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,722
That perfect frame she's got.
Really sexy!

72
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,931
- How much?
- 30 cents.

73
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,199
Not bad!

74
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,363
I'm willing to trade 10 years
just for a kiss by her!

75
00:08:31,364 --> 00:08:35,763
Kissing is for children.
I could get her to hug and kiss me.

76
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,523
I don't believe you!

77
00:08:37,524 --> 00:08:40,205
You want to bet on it?
I'll bet you a whole dinner.

78
00:08:40,206 --> 00:08:41,919
Deal.

79
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:46,323
She's hot, she wouldn't
look at you twice!

80
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,444
All right! A whole dinner then.

81
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,566
Just watch.

82
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,961
He's looking for trouble.

83
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,922
This flower is beautiful.
Trust me, try it on.

84
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,519
- Excuse me!
- My eye hurts.

85
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,639
What can I do?

86
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,885
Something got into my eye.
Help me get rid of it, miss. Please, hurry.

87
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,920
Harder.

88
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,482
- He did it!
- Did you see that?

89
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,249
Thanks. Snake!

90
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,970
Don't be afraid...
I'll kill it. Don't be afraid.

91
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,359
That's a great technique.

92
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,362
That's great. I must try
that on your sister.

93
00:09:35,363 --> 00:09:37,203
What did you say? My sister?

94
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,167
Thought you could take advantage
of my daughter, did you?

95
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,763
Me touch her? She was asking
for it, that dumb bitch.

96
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,007
Mother!

97
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:56,039
You wanted to lay your
filthy hands on her.

98
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,522
On her? That's a laugh.
She's much too ugly.

99
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,642
Think you're real smart, huh?
Well, I'll teach you a lesson, boy.

100
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,330
So you want to play Kung-Fu? Try this!

101
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,045
The old bitch is tough.

102
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,401
Come on, you guys! Hey!

103
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,440
Some friends they make.

104
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,402
You're nothing but a skinny old woman,
so I'll let you win.

105
00:11:00,403 --> 00:11:01,403
Excuse me!

106
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,959
Watch where you're going!

107
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,962
Stumbling about like a drunken stooge!

108
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,723
Antique jade!

109
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,808
Mister, want to buy?

110
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,921
You sure it's real?

111
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,399
Of course.

112
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,159
It's a family heirloom.
It's worth the money, sir.

113
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,639
- How much?
- 10 dollars.

114
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,801
That's too expensive!

115
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,241
It's worth it!

116
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,599
Only 10 cents?! Hey mister!

117
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,082
Mister, I can't sell it that cheap.
Please give it back to me. It's all I have!

118
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,401
I couldn't sell such a
valuable piece for only 10 cents!

119
00:11:58,402 --> 00:12:00,129
Then I'll keep the jade and the money.

120
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,320
Hey, give me back my jade.

121
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,319
Mister, you broke my jade!
Pay me back!

122
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,846
You expect payment from me? Take this!

123
00:12:10,847 --> 00:12:12,559
Father...

124
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,404
- Please, at least give me something.
- No!

125
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,567
What happened?

126
00:12:20,568 --> 00:12:24,724
He's broken my jade and
then he refused to pay me!

127
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,491
Shithead. Piss off.

128
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,925
Who're you calling Shithead?

129
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,406
I'm calling you!

130
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,399
Hand over that man's money!

131
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,399
Pay? Not before I put you in the ground.

132
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,243
It's too bad you feel that way.

133
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,679
There's nothing been going right today,
so you caught me in a bad mood.

134
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,569
Now, I'm gonna have to
teach you how to pay!

135
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,321
Get up!

136
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Wanna kill me?

137
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,006
This is dangerous!

138
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,965
You barely missed my knuckles!

139
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,080
- This is for you, now get going!
- Thank you, sir.

140
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,840
I'm doomed, I'm dead!

141
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,449
Don't be afraid,
it's just the blunt end.

142
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,839
I have no intention of killing you...

143
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,841
yet!

144
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,047
Don't...!

145
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,570
That one really came close.

146
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,683
And watch what you're doing.

147
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,521
Drop dead!

148
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:01,367
Fists have no eyes, knives have no heart!
Sometimes I can hit by mistake!

149
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,319
I chop, chop, chop... the meat!

150
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,846
I slice, slice, slice... like a cucumber!

151
00:15:09,847 --> 00:15:12,810
I beat, beat, beat... you like garlic!

152
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,125
I'm glad I came across you.
You sure have brightened my day!

153
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,403
It's been ages, brother.
You still look great.

154
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,799
Your brother is old now.

155
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,690
What a beautiful niece I've got.

156
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,323
She's still a kid. Just a bit naive.

157
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,681
Where's Fei-Hung?

158
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,439
He went out.

159
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,921
This naughty boy always goes out to play.
He's a young man now.

160
00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:46,922
I think you may not recognize him.

161
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,328
This time, stay longer.

162
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,090
Fei-Hung, don't go away.

163
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,442
Come greet your auntie and cousin.

164
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,559
Come here, now.

165
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,641
Coming...

166
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,081
Shit!

167
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,401
Say hello.

168
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,882
Auntie, cousin.

169
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,883
- Cousin.
- Fei-Hung.

170
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,480
What happened to your neck?

171
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,082
I... I slept without a pillow.

172
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,079
Without a pillow? Let me help you.

173
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,324
- No thanks, auntie.
- Come on, relax.

174
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,561
Auntie.

175
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,001
Mother!

176
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,646
Feel better now?

177
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,886
Yes.

178
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,719
Brother,

179
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,007
Fei-Hung really looks smart.

180
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,769
He's quite tactful and clever.

181
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,330
Brother, you're really a good father.

182
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,325
Yes, I'm very strict to him.

183
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,363
No wonder I heard people praising
him as soon as I came here.

184
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,959
Really? What did they say?

185
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,199
The son of Wong Kei-Ying is very smart.

186
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,850
He's also a man of justice.

187
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,682
I'm very proud of him.
Come here, my son.

188
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,407
Sit down.

189
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,844
But there are many sex
maniacs in this village.

190
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,359
That's right.

191
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,001
One of them harassed your
niece on the street just now.

192
00:17:36,002 --> 00:17:40,050
When I went to rescue her,
he even attacked me.

193
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,240
You mean to tell me both of you
were attacked here in my own town?

194
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,681
Could you recognize him?

195
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,401
As if I could forget.
Yes, I'd recognize him.

196
00:17:52,402 --> 00:17:54,607
Good, let's find him now.

197
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,050
I'll teach him a real good lesson.
Fei-Hung, come with me.

198
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,719
Uncle! You don't have to go out.

199
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,482
Why?

200
00:18:02,483 --> 00:18:05,245
That guy is right here.
He's standing in this very room.

201
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,839
Who? Where?

202
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,923
Standing right over there.
He's your son Wong Fei-Hung.

203
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,241
You...

204
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
You...

205
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,405
Son-of-bitch!

206
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,721
Kneel down!

207
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,321
Father...

208
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,039
You bastard!

209
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,644
You have dishonored me.

210
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,760
Wong Kei-Ying!

211
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,007
I'm doomed.

212
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,799
Wong Kei-Ying.

213
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,882
Master Li, what has happened?

214
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,690
I'll tell you what.
I'm looking for your son.

215
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,721
Why?

216
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,442
Because he's nothing but a wild animal.

217
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:08,082
He attacked my son for no reason,
breaking his legs, arms, and skull.

218
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,488
He really beat him up.

219
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,929
He looks like a dumpling.

220
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,362
Wong Kei-Ying! I want justice!

221
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,450
- You beast, I must kill you.
- No, Dad... No...

222
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,930
Brother, you mustn't kill your own son.

223
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:28,967
Yes!

224
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,487
I must kill him, he's a disgrace!

225
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,731
Sounds bad for a teacher of your
standing to flog his own son to death.

226
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,768
Mr. Li didn't come to witness
how you punish your son.

227
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,408
If he must be punished, I suggest
that Mr. Li here is quite capable.

228
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,165
Stop him!

229
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,680
I'm responsible for what I've done.

230
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,366
So let him punish me.

231
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,685
Take this.

232
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,681
Now, I promise I won't fight back.

233
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,723
You dare make fun at this time?

234
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,891
Wong Kei-Ying, what are you gonna do?

235
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,331
As from this moment, I disown him.

236
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,282
This slime is no longer mine.
Do what you like with him.

237
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,568
Mr. Li, I have a proposition.

238
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,691
Let Fei-hung take ten strikes
without any resistance.

239
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,689
Ten strikes should be enough.
Now, Mr. Li, do you approve?

240
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,768
I don't need ten strikes
to kill him, three is enough.

241
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,402
Master, listen.
I'm going to fix that squirt.

242
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,851
Master Chao, be sure you leave
him looking just like I look now.

243
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,799
The Divine Eight.

244
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,644
That palm style of yours,
it's really something.

245
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,881
I'm only getting started!

246
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,847
I'm not dead yet!

247
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,010
You want to cut off my posterity?

248
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,841
Enough!

249
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,001
You've made your ten strikes, Mr. Chow.

250
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,208
You said you would kill
me within three strikes.

251
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,925
Snake and Crane together.

252
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,251
Strike the vital points.

253
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,328
Let's try your Divine Eight again.

254
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,365
I told you I've got style.

255
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,923
Hey! My jacket's getting dirty, take it!

256
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,320
You regret not paying
for that jade now, huh!

257
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,568
- It's me!
- You hit your master.

258
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,089
- Young Master, are you alright?
- Young master, are you okay?

259
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,167
Master, now I look just like you.

260
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,799
Wong Kei-Ying,

261
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,959
you win with your smart tricks.

262
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,961
I'll get you back.

263
00:24:38,962 --> 00:24:39,962
Let's go!

264
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,040
You watch out!

265
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,679
Careful with my son, hurry.

266
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,762
- I'll get you yet!
- So don't come back!

267
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,885
Careful, careful.

268
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,204
He came in with one cripple
and left with two.

269
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,119
You fight well, I give you that.

270
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,009
- But I'll still kill you!
- Brother.

271
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,999
It's useless to beat him anymore.

272
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,843
Let's punish him by Kung-Fu practice.

273
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,479
I've tried with that bastard.

274
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,402
Right!

275
00:25:11,403 --> 00:25:13,607
From now on, you are forbidden
to leave the house.

276
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,289
We'll start with five
hours of Horse Stance!

277
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,721
Now don't move.

278
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,968
Have some more boiling water, bastard!

279
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,887
Hey, are you comfortable?

280
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,647
Are your legs shaking, are they aching?
You know, I feel sorry for you.

281
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,083
Poor little chicken!

282
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,568
You feel itchy? Want me to help you?

283
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,562
Stop. Don't do that!

284
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,250
I'm just carrying out my orders.
See, it's your father's idea.

285
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:03,239
He says for every bowl you break,
you stay another hour,

286
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,401
you bastard!

287
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,888
Master, you're back!

288
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,360
Yes, his stance appears
to be pretty steady.

289
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,159
- Did he slack off?
- No, I've been watching him.

290
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,286
Really?

291
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,199
Finally some progress.

292
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,680
Yes, I'm very tired.

293
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,042
- Are you really that tired?
- I am, sir.

294
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,642
But you've got a chair, right?

295
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,124
What? A chair? Let me see!
Damn it, a chair...

296
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,528
You dare cheat me
when I'm punishing you.

297
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,769
I really can't do anything about you.

298
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,006
I'll ask your uncle to come
tomorrow and fix you.

299
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,481
Who's he?

300
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,001
Beggar So.

301
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,000
Help me, To Tao!

302
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,487
Hurry!

303
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,282
Practicing your Kung-Fu upside down, huh!

304
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:26,011
- I'm dying!
- Here, I brought you food.

305
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,771
I'll go get something to drink.

306
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,051
My neck!

307
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,846
Get me down, quickly.

308
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,371
Come on, get up.

309
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,563
You came down so quickly.

310
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,801
Untie me!

311
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,921
Eat this.

312
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,523
Hey, is it true So Hui
is gonna fix you?

313
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,644
- That's right.
- That's bad news for you.

314
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,881
Why?

315
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,730
Do you know anything about Beggar So?

316
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,565
I heard he's very cruel.

317
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,450
All his students have if not
broken arms then broken legs!

318
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,999
Really?

319
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,570
I'm telling you the truth.

320
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,759
Nui was his student and you
know what happened to him?

321
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,807
What?

322
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,919
He lost all his teeth and hair.
His nose got twisted.

323
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,729
Even his own father
couldn't recognize him.

324
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,449
That monster gets pleasure out of
torturing people, he's a real sadist.

325
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,047
- What should I do then?
- You think about it yourself.

326
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,847
You've got to help me,
I don't know what to do!

327
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,369
- Escape, that's the only way!
- Escape, that's the only way!

328
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,319
You're clumsy!

329
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,890
You should try to pay more attention!

330
00:31:13,891 --> 00:31:16,645
- Just go.
- I'll leave now.

331
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,369
"Yue He Restaurant."

332
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,805
Sir, here are the dumplings.

333
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,404
Please have a seat.

334
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,161
Excuse me, do you mind if I sit here?

335
00:31:45,162 --> 00:31:47,242
No, sit down. Go on.

336
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,967
You're by yourself, good.
I don't like to eat alone.

337
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,919
The food here is very good.

338
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,241
Everything looks and tastes great.

339
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,451
Real good smell, really fantastic.

340
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,127
What can I get you, sir?

341
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,931
Why you're alone? Where's Old Shang?

342
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,610
- What's that?
- No, go ahead, eat.

343
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,650
What would you like to eat?

344
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,841
A bowl of shark's fin as appetizer.

345
00:32:16,842 --> 00:32:19,725
- Sorry. We got no shark's fin.
- That's too bad.

346
00:32:19,726 --> 00:32:24,169
Then I want a roasted goose leg. The left
one. A chicken and a steamed grouper.

347
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:28,359
- Sorry, we have no grouper.
- Then any fish will do.

348
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,966
Also a stewed abalone and
shrimp noodles. Hurry!

349
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,129
And half a catty of
Shaoxing wine, hurry!

350
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:36,690
One wine!

351
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,328
You have a great appetite.

352
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:44,085
It is necessary to eat
well to become strong!

353
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,531
Here's the left goose leg, chicken...

354
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,891
- Half litter of Shaoxing wine.
- Yes... no thanks.

355
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,721
- Have a little wine. Be my guest.
- Really, I...

356
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,559
Here, just taste that.

357
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,759
Eat up!

358
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,842
Go on, don't be shy.
Help yourself to what you want.

359
00:33:27,843 --> 00:33:29,842
Enjoy yourself.
Don't stand on ceremony. Here.

360
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,367
Drink...

361
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,079
Go ahead.

362
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,764
I eat...

363
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,731
Drink...

364
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,408
You must be starving!

365
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,567
Very nice.

366
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,247
They sure know how to cook here.
That meal was really something.

367
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,159
I'll pay the bill, don't refuse me.
I'll go and pay it now.

368
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,279
Buy me lunch tomorrow.
I'm leaving. I'll pay today.

369
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,122
You must finish your dinner, okay?

370
00:35:22,123 --> 00:35:24,088
See you tomorrow. Bye for now.

371
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,322
Take care, see you tomorrow.

372
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,443
That will be exactly $1.05.

373
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,931
Someone else will pay the bill.

374
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:36,729
Really? Who?

375
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,322
The old man over there.

376
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,921
You know him?

377
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,080
He's my father.

378
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,601
Your father?

379
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,363
How many fathers do you have?

380
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,599
He's the boss of this
inn and I'm his son.

381
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,931
That makes you a bastard.

382
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,123
So you just want to eat and run?
Look there.

383
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,047
"PAY OR DIE!"

384
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,687
I ain't poncing meals from you.
Forgot my money, that's all.

385
00:36:18,688 --> 00:36:21,524
I'll come back tomorrow
and pay you then.

386
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,122
"PAY OR DIE!"

387
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,128
Gorilla, beat him up!

388
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,561
Tiger's Claw.

389
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,887
No, hold it, stop. Let's talk.

390
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,361
Stop it.

391
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,726
Go ahead, beat him.

392
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,519
I'll get back what you've eaten.

393
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
Now!

394
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,202
Roasted goose's leg. The left one.

395
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,239
And the fish.

396
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,480
That's enough.

397
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,329
Also half a catty of Shaoxing wine.

398
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,724
Now that you emptied my belly,
I feel hungry again.

399
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,604
Hey, that's enough, or do
you want to kill the boy?

400
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,482
No, it's not enough. He is to
do the toilet cleaning for us.

401
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,045
You wanted something to clean?

402
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,600
Thanks old man.

403
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,129
Old bum! How you dare
interfere with our business!

404
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,766
Just look how strong I am.
Watch me jump!

405
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,047
Jump then!

406
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,285
Now you're jumping all right!

407
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,324
This is how to wash your face.

408
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,361
Damn you!

409
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,730
Stop eating!

410
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,761
- We're friends, remember?
- Okay, let's be friends.

411
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,603
You've got arms of iron,
but you've brains of straw.

412
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,048
Stop that, let's get out of here!

413
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,200
This way...

414
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,641
You know what?

415
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,248
I can't help wondering
how old you are.

416
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,764
For your age, you sure are tough.

417
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
A necessity.

418
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,806
I've had to be tough to be
able to survive to this age.

419
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,609
Just look at you.
You're weak and useless.

420
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,050
Today was just a bad day.

421
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,845
If I hadn't fallen into the trap,

422
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,164
I'd have beaten them.

423
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,361
Sounds like an excuse.

424
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,642
I forgot to ask why you
couldn't pay for your meal.

425
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,930
That's a long story.
Old man, may I know your name?

426
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,280
I'm Mr. So.

427
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:05,846
Hey, there's a fellow with the
same name screwing up my life!

428
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,010
It's all his fault!

429
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,441
- Who are you talking about?
- He's this creep named Beggar So.

430
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:15,681
My own father asked
this guy to train me.

431
00:42:15,682 --> 00:42:17,205
So you're afraid of him?

432
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,528
Afraid? Of course not!

433
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,919
I have heard rumors.

434
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,559
He's very cunning, violent and mean.

435
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,925
But I'll Show him!

436
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,845
That old fart. Wait until
I see him, I'll tear him apart.

437
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,964
You'll show the fart, huh?

438
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,010
Hey, just where do you come from?

439
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:43,569
The sky is my roof and
I sleep where ever I may.

440
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:48,124
- So you're a bum?
- Everyone calls me Beggar So.

441
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,640
Your name is Beggar So as well?

442
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,920
Beggar So?

443
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,161
That's the name.

444
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,568
That was close. Good thing I'm fast.

445
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,648
Not fast enough!
You can't escape from me!

446
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,564
Your father paid me well to train you
and that's what I'm going to do!

447
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,364
How long will this take?

448
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,719
- One day?
- One year exactly.

449
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,801
I'll never make it!

450
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,122
You already have your cash,
so you can relax.

451
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,999
I wouldn't do that.
I'm going to enjoy this!

452
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,001
I'll see you in hell!

453
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,001
You're strangling me.

454
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,204
Well, you're just a stupid old fool.

455
00:44:39,205 --> 00:44:42,249
You're just an old beggar who likes
to pretend you're a real tiger.

456
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:44,925
I'll show you what a tiger's about!

457
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,568
I see your tiger's got a bad paw, huh?

458
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,481
Tiger-Fist!

459
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,525
It's still there!

460
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,165
All that Kung-Fu looks like dancing.

461
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,601
The Crane attacks!

462
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,839
Crane's Beak. Angry Crane.

463
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:48,966
Crane eats the Shrimp!

464
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,524
- The Crane Flies.
- How's your head?

465
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,728
Your fingers are
stronger than my teeth!

466
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,766
I'm coming to get you!

467
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,841
You scared me!

468
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,370
Climbing trees to get away now, are we?

469
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,043
What? I'm just using Monkey Kung-Fu.

470
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,439
Ready to learn?

471
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,839
Answer! Answer!

472
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,842
Please stop, I want to learn.

473
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,170
But I don't like your
style of recruitment.

474
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:38,841
Let me down!
I don't want to die like this.

475
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,929
I thought you were
supposed to be a teacher.

476
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,842
But you are trying to kill me.

477
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,079
All students with style
must learn how to fall.

478
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,082
That was only your first lesson.

479
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,319
Trying to escape?

480
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,845
I just wanna take a piss.

481
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,726
So do it there!

482
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,367
From the right jar to the left jar.

483
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:30,842
The back jar to the right jar.

484
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,564
The back jar to the front jar.

485
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,643
Left jar to the right jar.

486
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,362
The right jar to the front jar.

487
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,441
Left jar to right jar,
right jar to left jar.

488
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,808
I can never finish it!

489
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,241
Continue!

490
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,447
This is torture. Fine!

491
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,131
Fei-Hung! Fei-Hung!

492
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,007
Have a good wash, you old bastard!

493
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,805
Hey you, get out of here.

494
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,690
Do you hear me? Are you deaf?

495
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,131
Are you blind? Can't you see I'm busy.

496
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,729
No hanging around you bum.
Move your ass.

497
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,247
Is this your place?
What if I refuse to move then?

498
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,639
A big mouth and a wet ass.

499
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,802
It should be taught some manners.

500
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,361
How does it feel?

501
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,361
Nice and dry?

502
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:12,761
Right you twerp! I'll give you dry!
I'll shove you in the head first.

503
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:24,761
Come on...

504
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,927
What's that supposed to be, Kung-Fu?
Who taught you that load of shit?

505
00:52:46,928 --> 00:52:48,570
Who's your master?

506
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,520
No-one calls my father's Kung-Fu shit!

507
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,319
Judging by that, your old
man's Kung-Fu stinks.

508
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,324
I wouldn't ask him to clean my shoes.

509
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,487
I think you'd better call me father.

510
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,041
Go to hell!

511
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,600
Sit down!

512
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,603
Get up! Sit down again!

513
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,488
All my dogs must obey.

514
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,760
Quit playing!

515
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,405
Take my shoes.

516
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,927
What...?

517
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,968
I don't even need to use my hands.

518
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,731
You'd better use them, I'm not scared!

519
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,801
Had enough?

520
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,848
I won't stop until I send
you straight to hell!

521
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,840
Don't come here!

522
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,041
Ah shit!

523
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,882
You've become a cowardly turtle!

524
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:04,885
Your skull's like butter.

525
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,330
You could study kung-fu for the rest
of your life and still not beat me.

526
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,362
Killing a nobody like you...

527
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,361
would only ruin my reputation.

528
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,759
Crawl between my legs...

529
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:33,603
and then go home to your pig-sty!

530
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,087
Crawl!

531
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,001
Wait!

532
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,522
Aren't these your pants?

533
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,963
Judging by that, your old
man's Kung-Fu stinks.

534
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,204
I wouldn't ask him to clean my shoes.

535
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,846
Your skull's like butter.

536
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,650
You could study kung-fu for the rest
of your life and still not beat me.

537
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,366
Killing a nobody like you...

538
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,479
would only ruin my reputation.

539
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,519
Crawl between my legs,
then go home to your pig-sty.

540
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,521
Crawl!

541
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:10,844
You idiot, this wine is very expensive.

542
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,248
It smells good!

543
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,242
Master, enjoy your wine,
I'll dry your clothes.

544
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,761
Hey, Why are you so sexy?

545
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,609
- The clothes caught fire...
- It's on fire!

546
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,001
Oh god! You've burnt
my best cloak I have!

547
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,049
My back!

548
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,320
- My wrists!
- Your wrists are not strong enough.

549
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:21,799
More rabbit food...
and the tea's weak & cold.

550
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,801
Stay quiet and eat.

551
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,759
Master, you're giving me a headache.

552
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,046
Eat your meal.

553
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,201
What's wrong?

554
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,366
You're so tired you can't
even use your chopsticks?

555
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:08,242
Master, I'm finished.

556
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,885
That was quick.

557
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,291
Now, use these smaller
cups to empty it again.

558
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,731
Go on.

559
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:22,209
I wish I'd known about this part first.

560
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,086
This is killing me.

561
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,680
- Hey, Hung...
- Yes?

562
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:42,169
Crack this walnut for me.

563
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,404
No, you break it like this.

564
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,970
Now you try.

565
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:57,128
Please, Master!
Haven't I cracked enough?

566
01:04:58,200 --> 01:04:59,804
Master, why don't we go for a walk?

567
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:02,521
All right...

568
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:04,920
Open now...

569
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,081
- Master, you're good!
- Of course.

570
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:25,725
Observe well... place your bets!

571
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:27,889
Old man, you should leave now.

572
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:29,441
Leave?

573
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,606
How can I buy good wine
with so little money?

574
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:37,450
I've still got more money to win.

575
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:44,725
Come on, bet...
Trust me, bet there!

576
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,999
Turn it over!

577
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,199
Hurry up!

578
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:56,248
Turn it over!

579
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,567
Quit shouting!

580
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:10,369
You're amazing, Master. You did it again.

581
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,961
That's great.

582
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,799
Put down your bets.
We're getting rich. It's easy!

583
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:19,801
You were lucky.

584
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,201
I'll play with you...

585
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,081
in one go!

586
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:27,529
Right, this is my lucky day.

587
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:29,800
Come on.

588
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,726
- Choose.
- No problem.

589
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:03,881
Turn it over.

590
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,081
It's not there.

591
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,282
You think you're quick, huh?
Well, my eyes are quicker.

592
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,486
- So, you're trying to cheat, huh?
- So you're a swindler.

593
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,809
Police is here, run!

594
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:49,839
You're a dirty thief.
Give me back my money!

595
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:53,049
You'll never get your money back!
Do you know who I am?

596
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:55,571
Who cares!

597
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:00,569
I'll tell you who I am,
I'm Iron-Head Rat.

598
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,851
I'll show you with this brick.

599
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,410
Very hard indeed!

600
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:08,806
Scared?

601
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,207
Hey. baldy!

602
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,079
Give me back the money!

603
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:17,129
I don't care who you are! I'll beat you.

604
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,085
I warn you, shitface,
I choose who I bury next!

605
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,245
You don't mind to get hurt, do you?

606
01:08:24,246 --> 01:08:25,651
I'll let you try my iron head!

607
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:49,039
Master, his head is too hard!

608
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:50,839
Don't give up!

609
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,842
Let's see you stop my iron head!

610
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,561
This is fun!

611
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,408
Good, very good.

612
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:48,648
Bet you never guessed you'd
end up in someone's pants!

613
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:23,363
An iron hammer for an iron head?

614
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:47,246
Can you take it?

615
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,722
That's enough, please!

616
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,328
Master, my wrists are breaking!

617
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,009
- Lazy!
- No.

618
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:41,648
My hands are gonna break!

619
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,522
No more exercises.
Go fetch me some wine.

620
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:51,922
Yes,

621
01:11:51,923 --> 01:11:53,649
"Ru Yi's Restaurant."

622
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:04,606
Waiter!

623
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,971
Corning. What do you want?

624
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,919
- Some wine.
- Shall I fill it up?

625
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:13,479
No, three cups will be enough.

626
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:14,527
Three cups?

627
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:17,763
Hurry up, don't just stand there.

628
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,324
Damn it! Where's that
stupid boy with my wine?

629
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,804
Idiot!

630
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:10,881
That's him!

631
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,324
Old man, who are you?

632
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:22,730
Who's asking?

633
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:29,286
Old man, have you heard
of the King of Sticks?

634
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:35,768
Yes, I have. Have you ever
heard of Beggar So then?

635
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,361
Beggar So?

636
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,806
In person!

637
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:43,040
Let's go!

638
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,246
Don't go. He doesn't
look like Beggar So.

639
01:13:46,247 --> 01:13:47,287
- What?
- Look.

640
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:55,201
He's trembling, he can't
be the real Beggar So.

641
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:04,409
So you think you're being funny?
I'm not fooled that easily.

642
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:07,805
But I'm not lying, I am Beggar So!

643
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,759
Master.

644
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:05,807
Give me the wine!

645
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:16,921
It's water!

646
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,322
Idiot! Now see what you've done!

647
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,400
Master!

648
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:36,759
They're lucky!
If I ever meet them again,

649
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,728
I'll kill them both. Let's go!

650
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:06,327
Cheer up, eat something.

651
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,487
Master, it's all my
fault you were beaten.

652
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:14,121
It seems bad luck follows you around.

653
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:19,519
I've been through a lot of things,
but until this day...

654
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,602
I've never suffered such
humiliation like that!

655
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,244
He wasn't better than you, but you've
no strength without your wine.

656
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:29,210
You sure can talk.

657
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:35,724
True, but if I had been taught better,
I could've beaten that jerk.

658
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:39,731
You mean to say I'm not
teaching you right?

659
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:46,564
You're just pushing me around.
You're teaching me how to get beaten.

660
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:57,769
Your father is without question
an excellent martial arts Master.

661
01:17:57,770 --> 01:18:01,079
His methods are among the best.

662
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:04,004
So why would he ask me
to teach you my style?

663
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,569
He wants you to torture me.

664
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:14,371
He asked me because he knows
I've got a secret style.

665
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,161
What's that?

666
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:18,648
The Eight Drunken Gods.

667
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:24,326
It's nothing special.
That shows your damned ignorance.

668
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:31,968
Many people have asked me to teach
them but I turned them all down!

669
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:10,759
Don't be fooled by my staggering,
there's power inside to kill.

670
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:15,846
It looks real enough, yet it isn't.
Pretending lets you win.

671
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:37,885
Clever, isn't it?

672
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:40,724
Why haven't you shown me it before?

673
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,519
Didn't your father tell you that...

674
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:47,649
foundation is very important.

675
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:53,644
I do this because I want you
to have a good foundation.

676
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,839
I think you're ready now.

677
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:58,762
Really?

678
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,521
To study my style, you'll find it
easier if you have a drink first.

679
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,640
Drink up.

680
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,441
Have another cup.

681
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,361
Fei-Hung, have you ever gone to school?

682
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,688
I've spent a few years
in a private school.

683
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,085
"Drink up the wine."

684
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:36,808
- "May our cups never rest."
- "For I'll sing you a song."

685
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,848
"I'll put your ears to the test."

686
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:47,566
"Power and wealth are no avail to us.
When only drinking prevails."

687
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,442
Boy, enough, enough.

688
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:58,329
"Sober men and sages are
lost through the ages."

689
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,361
"All our brave drinkers
shall never die."

690
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:06,445
"All our brave drinkers shall never die."

691
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,883
"Shing Fung produces
the finest of wines."

692
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:13,047
"The best soldiers of Shien
Yang are always young."

693
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:18,887
"Even the King couldn't
stop my drinking."

694
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,240
"Let's drink a toast to
our ship that's sinking."

695
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,002
"With uplifted cup,
I say to the full moon."

696
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,168
"Why does my shadow appear to swoon?"

697
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,847
"Wine in a radiant cup you see."

698
01:21:37,200 --> 01:21:40,362
"Put down that cup the
horses are awaiting thee."

699
01:21:40,363 --> 01:21:43,364
"Fallen on the battlefield, the
soldier says, who will remember me?"

700
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,011
"Who will remember me?"

701
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:49,250
"Who will remember me?"

702
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:04,040
The God Lu, the drunkard
with inner strength.

703
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:46,041
The God Li, the drunken cripple
with the powerful right leg.

704
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:17,088
The God Jun, the drunkard
holding a pot in his arms.

705
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:48,164
The God Ian, the drunkard with
the sudden deadly waist attack.

706
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:18,720
The God Chan, the drunkard
with the swift double-kicks.

707
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:50,209
The God Tso, the drunkard
with the powerful throat lock.

708
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:19,488
The God Han, the drunken flute
player with powerful wrists.

709
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:43,325
The God Miss Ho, the drunken
woman flaunting her body.

710
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:54,321
Concentrate! This is serious.

711
01:25:54,880 --> 01:25:57,439
Isn't this style for women?

712
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:01,081
Miss Ho is a woman, yes,
but she is strong. Watch me.

713
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:07,441
Do like I do!

714
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:23,405
Continue practicing!

715
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,360
Okay, I will.

716
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:26,881
Practice hard!

717
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,448
This is for sissies. I won't do it!

718
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,641
Wong Kei-Ying!

719
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:46,280
Why do you persuade the Bull Head Hill
villagers not to sell me their land?

720
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:48,570
What was your reason for it?

721
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:52,682
Was it because of that
business over your son?

722
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,565
That's a personal issue.

723
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,929
It'll be settled in good time.

724
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:00,046
I'm not responsible.
What is your game?

725
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:01,879
What is yours?

726
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:04,087
Mr. Li, why do you want to buy the hill?

727
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,929
As you wish to know, I'll tell you.

728
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:14,447
That old graveyard up there has been haunting
us for centuries, disturbing family spirits!

729
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:19,480
They'll get more than $20 per lot,
it's good money for that land.

730
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,081
Then you butt your nose in
where it isn't wanted!

731
01:27:22,082 --> 01:27:24,242
You mean you want to buy the graveyard?

732
01:27:25,960 --> 01:27:29,005
Don't you believe me?
There's a curse on the name of Li!

733
01:27:29,006 --> 01:27:33,285
And it must be exorcised.
I've got three mistresses without children!

734
01:27:33,286 --> 01:27:36,409
I'll be content with a chicken egg.
But they can't produce that!

735
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:39,366
Maybe you've just become impotent.

736
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,930
You can't hide anything
from me, Mr Li.

737
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,530
And what's that supposed to mean?

738
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:54,802
Li Wan-Hao, I think you just
want what's hidden in the hill.

739
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:57,127
What would that be?

740
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:59,369
- The coal.
- The coal?

741
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,482
Bull Head Hill contains
a rich coal deposit.

742
01:28:01,483 --> 01:28:06,611
You secretly deal with the Coal Company to
make profit from the selling of the coal.

743
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:10,366
You can fool the villagers,
but you can't fool me!

744
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:19,561
Since you know it, I won't deny.

745
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:24,243
If you don't interfere,
I'll give you 20% of the profit.

746
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,884
20%? You'd spend so much on me?

747
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:32,330
Listen, Li Wan-hao,
the hill belongs to the villagers.

748
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:35,251
No one can take it away,
get out of here!

749
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:39,051
Wong Kei-Ying,
you're trying to go against me,

750
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:42,369
No matter how good your Kung-Fu is,
you are going to pay for this!

751
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:06,244
$1000 for the death of
Wong Kei-Ying of Fushan.

752
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:10,324
Wong Kei-Ying?

753
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,802
"Teacher's Birthday Ceremony."

754
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,679
Master.

755
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:26,523
- Is everything ready for tonight?
- Yes.

756
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,762
Hurry up, there will be
many guests tonight.

757
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:42,608
Hey, Master Hsu.

758
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:46,601
Big Funeral?

759
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,199
Are you a dumb masochist?

760
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,005
Coming here looking for more punishment?

761
01:29:53,006 --> 01:29:54,411
Didn't you suffer enough last time?

762
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:02,199
I just wanna have something
to eat and someone to beat.

763
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,168
Alright. I'll make you
an extra special dish!

764
01:30:04,169 --> 01:30:05,839
Master, what would it be?

765
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:07,439
Bamboo shoot and pork.

766
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:09,442
- Go get my stick.
- Okay.

767
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:10,721
Pork?

768
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:13,607
I'll have a piece first.

769
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:17,801
Right, it tastes good!

770
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,241
Master.

771
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:23,521
Cheers.

772
01:30:59,880 --> 01:31:02,281
Wow, your teeth are sharp!
They bit right through the bowl.

773
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,400
Now what?

774
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:39,762
Be careful now, toothy.
Take it easy.

775
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:53,411
I did tell you to take it easy.

776
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:09,481
Sit still!

777
01:32:17,640 --> 01:32:19,847
A fart for the King of Sticks.

778
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,764
This is 'Hungry Dogs Eats Shit!'

779
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:33,481
Not quite!

780
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:40,841
You like it?

781
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,281
He's drunk!

782
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:44,841
The old man will like this.

783
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:55,764
Master, the King of Sticks gave
us wine. It's free of charge.

784
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:01,041
Master.

785
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:03,321
Master.

786
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:07,601
Master.

787
01:35:08,440 --> 01:35:09,441
Master.

788
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:22,120
Fei-Hong, one year has passed...

789
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:27,039
and it's time for us to
go our separate paths.

790
01:35:27,040 --> 01:35:31,559
I have taught you all the techniques
and the magic of kung fu.

791
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,679
Practice diligently,
master each technique...

792
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:37,684
The Eight Drunken Gods
is the ultimate Kung-Fu.

793
01:35:37,685 --> 01:35:41,079
My home is the world.
Try not to miss me.

794
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:42,445
Go home and be a good son.

795
01:35:42,446 --> 01:35:47,207
Remember this, If you ever need me,
I'll be there. Beggar So.

796
01:35:56,040 --> 01:35:57,599
Master...

797
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,650
Master!

798
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,081
Higher!

799
01:36:25,560 --> 01:36:27,688
- Harder!
- Master Wong!

800
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:31,719
- Master Wong...
- What is it?

801
01:36:31,720 --> 01:36:35,406
Master Wong, Li and his men
are digging on Bull Head Hill!

802
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:36,720
Really?

803
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:40,490
Tell the men I'm going there. Quick!

804
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:45,768
This way! Quick!

805
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:20,919
Wong Kei-Ying,

806
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:24,527
Your skill in Kung-Fu is
renowned, I compliment you.

807
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:30,921
Who are you? I don't know you.
Why do you want to kill me?

808
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:36,325
I'm Yen Tieh-hsin.
I kill for money.

809
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:42,010
Today I have a worthy opponent,
I'd like to pay you my respects.

810
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:48,730
I've heard of you. The cold-blooded
assassin who'd sell his own brother.

811
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:50,720
That's me.

812
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:55,919
But killing me,
you won't find that so easy.

813
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,685
Then I suppose you'll
want to wish me luck.

814
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,570
Hands are for door knobs
and legs break down doors.

815
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:34,167
30% from the hands,
the rest are from the legs.

816
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:20,282
Wong Kei-Ying. Are you
ready to meet your death?

817
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:34,639
Master.

818
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:36,449
Father, are you alright?

819
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,528
Idiot, you're back?

820
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,446
It's alright. Don't be afraid. I'm here.

821
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,049
He dares to attack my father?
I'll give him a good lesson!

822
01:39:48,120 --> 01:39:49,167
You again?

823
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:55,445
Good. You can help bury
your old man, shitface.

824
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:02,171
Master Wong, it's too bad
you have such a disgraceful son.

825
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,402
You watch out, or you'll
have a body with no ass!

826
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:13,366
Dumbass, go and clean pig-stys
or I'll have to kill you too.

827
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:16,411
I won't die, bastard,
but the worms'll grow fat on you!

828
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:21,846
Okay, I give a discount today,
killing two for the price of one!

829
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:23,641
Up yours!

830
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:32,519
Wait... wait for me.

831
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:34,329
Master, what are you doing here?

832
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:39,286
How can Beggar So
miss a great fight?

833
01:40:39,880 --> 01:40:43,771
Beggar So, it's none of your business.
Go away!

834
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:49,811
You are mistaken.
This is very much my business.

835
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:54,722
But don't worry, I'm not
going to fight you.

836
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:57,487
He is good enough to do it.

837
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,888
Come. Drink first.

838
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,810
Master, this wine is strong.
What kind is it?

839
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:47,891
San Pien Wine.

840
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:49,561
I'm drunk!

841
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:47,848
I'm the God Lu, the drunkard
with inner strength.

842
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:00,969
The cripple Li!

843
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:31,850
The drunk with a strong right leg.

844
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:34,241
The God Ian!

845
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:56,244
A sudden attack to the waist,
the God Jun!

846
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:00,366
Holding a pot in his arms,
Han's gone mad!

847
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:18,931
Well done, the Eight Drunken Gods...

848
01:44:19,800 --> 01:44:23,407
Patience, you've not seen it all yet.

849
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:25,521
The God Han.

850
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,048
He's the flute player
with the powerful wrists.

851
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:01,481
Impressive!

852
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:04,891
Your flute is bent.

853
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:07,001
The God Tso,

854
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:11,288
- drunkard with the powerful...
- Throat Lock.

855
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:35,045
Now your lock is broken.

856
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:50,840
The Devil's Shadowless Hands.

857
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:53,760
Yes, you're very observant.

858
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:57,847
The God Chan!

859
01:46:04,720 --> 01:46:06,085
The God Chan won't reach old age!

860
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:25,209
Where's the drunken Miss Ho?

861
01:46:26,280 --> 01:46:29,602
Miss Ho... Ho...

862
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:36,961
Wait!

863
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:40,319
- Master, there's a problem.
- What?

864
01:46:40,320 --> 01:46:41,560
I didn't bother to learn this!

865
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:46,809
- Can you teach me now?
- It's too late!

866
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:13,767
Fei-Hung!

867
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:18,485
She'll appear without a shadow,
just perform the actions.

868
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:25,044
Combine the other <i>7</i> styles,
and make your own Miss Ho.

869
01:47:27,040 --> 01:47:29,361
Ho? You want Ho? Sure.

870
01:47:43,280 --> 01:47:44,884
This is called Widow Seeing Lover off.

871
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:54,966
Woman sitting on a toilet Seat.

872
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:03,441
You don't sit right!

873
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:12,966
Putting on Make-up.

874
01:48:16,440 --> 01:48:18,363

1
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,650
Go!

2
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:16,160
Brother, this is your favorite tea.

3
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:18,066
Come on; drink it while it's hot.

4
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,946
Hey, there, Pao.
Your cough better?

5
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,275
Yes, a lot.

6
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,351
Good. Your health is everything.

7
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,851
Please be careful.
You hear?

8
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,944
Don't make me worry.

9
00:02:36,055 --> 00:02:37,352
I won't.

10
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:41,185
I should go check up on Bull.

11
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,254
He's tending the horses, right?

12
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,525
Well, this mission is critical.

13
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,193
I should go check.

14
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:51,634
You understand, right?

15
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,263
Go ahead.

16
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:07,912
Bull.

17
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,580
Hello, Pao.

18
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,920
Hey, listen,
why don't you take a rest?

19
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,288
I'll handle it.

20
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:15,326
Thanks, Pao.

21
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:17,157
Don't mind if I do.

22
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,972
He said be careful.

23
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,045
Don't worry.

24
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,278
Someone's coming!

25
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,587
Pardon me.

26
00:04:10,783 --> 00:04:12,341
My name's Hung Yat-fu.

27
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,653
I know who you are.

28
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,052
You're Bill Man.

29
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,725
Detective?

30
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,919
Yes. Government orders.

31
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,825
I was working an opium case.

32
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,557
Except my cover was blown.

33
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:28,099
So I came here to borrow a horse.

34
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:29,498
You mean--

35
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,092
Wait!

36
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,408
I'm a detective.

37
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,976
Stop!

38
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,239
Take it.

39
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,775
Thank you!

40
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:45,407
Hold on!

41
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:48,214
Brother, that horse is mine!
Let him go.

42
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,291
- Run!
- I'll return the horse!

43
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,293
Don't move!

44
00:04:56,396 --> 00:04:57,829
Chun-yuen Delivery Service!

45
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,196
I think he means it.

46
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,772
Brother, let's get them.

47
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:09,766
Quiet!

48
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,372
I think we should let them be.

49
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,376
Let's go.

50
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,707
- Brother!
- But they--

51
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:15,712
Go!

52
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,713
Man, come on!

53
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,443
- Come on, let's--
- All right.

54
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,124
Pao, we'd better leave now.

55
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,855
- I agree. Let's ride!
- Right!

56
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,452
Boss.

57
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:04,496
Boss, you're back.
Here, I'll take that.

58
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,258
Mr. Luk.

59
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,789
Mr. Luk, please.

60
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,261
This way, if you will.

61
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,759
Check it, please.

62
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:49,864
Paper.

63
00:06:55,481 --> 00:06:57,039
Check it.

64
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,879
It's correct!

65
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,245
Chun-yuen Delivery is always trustworthy.

66
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,551
Master Yu.

67
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,389
In here, please.

68
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,662
Yes, Master Yu.
It's correct.

69
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,394
- Show them out.
- Yes.

70
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:19,737
Mr. Luk.

71
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,737
Thank you, Master Yu.

72
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,275
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

73
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,377
Bill. You've worked hard.

74
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,452
It's my duty.

75
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,177
Pao?

76
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,619
Feel all right?

77
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,553
I'm fine, thanks.

78
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,461
- Wine for all.
- Yes!

79
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,029
- Drink.
- Cheers!

80
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,105
Well done.

81
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,771
Tell me!
How could you possibly lose it?

82
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,246
Master Yu, I wasn't expecting this.

83
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,316
Oh, really!

84
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:10,046
Listen!

85
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,885
I mean it.

86
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,016
You get it back now...

87
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,889
or you see that bag?

88
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,223
That's you!

89
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,733
Master Yu.

90
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,233
So he took the horse...

91
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,894
and he's got the opium...

92
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,063
there's no way that he's gonna find us.

93
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,108
Anyway, that detective
is a long ways away.

94
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,239
There's nothin' to worry about.

95
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,645
What about Robinson?
What will you tell him?

96
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,579
We'll pay his loss.

97
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,913
Double it, if that's better.

98
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,413
You think he wants money?

99
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,150
Don't worry.
I can fix it.

100
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,691
Just trust me with this.

101
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,657
In a day or two, it'll disappear,
I swear.

102
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,887
Don't tell your older brother about it.

103
00:08:51,998 --> 00:08:53,761
Brother, why did you get up so early?

104
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,833
Master Man.

105
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:14,177
What is this?
Opium?

106
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,278
No, wait!
You don't understand!

107
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,721
It's for the servants!
You know. Come on.

108
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:33,304
My brother...
we have been together...

109
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,533
for a lot of years now.

110
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,976
I know you well.

111
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,377
I've taken care of you...
looked after you.

112
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:47,379
But... I won't stand here

113
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,977
and watch you destroy yourself.

114
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,320
Do I make myself clear?
And also--

115
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,393
- Listen.
- Hey!

116
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,998
I've been hearing
that you're having lots of women...

117
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,589
and gambling, too.

118
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,896
How do you afford this?

119
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:09,006
Look...you have to trust me.

120
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,370
That's bullshit!

121
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,177
You smuggling?

122
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,474
There's...no way I could.

123
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,208
No? Then what's this?

124
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,354
This opium I found on your horse!

125
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,021
You used our good name to smuggle it in!

126
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,722
No!

127
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:35,528
You go to the police and surrender!

128
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,695
No! Don't take me to the police station!

129
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,601
- Just let me go!
- Forget it!

130
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:43,004
No, Bill!
Bill, why?

131
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,374
Please listen.

132
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:50,540
He has his whole family here to look after.

133
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,379
You can't send him away!

134
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,885
Enough!
What about our family name?

135
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,955
I can't let him ruin that.
Let's go!

136
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,455
No! Please!

137
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,291
Brother...

138
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,795
Okay. I'll go with you.

139
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,792
May.

140
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:20,876
My son.

141
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,656
Let me hold her.

142
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,329
Listen.

143
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,768
The kids are still young.

144
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,467
Please take care of them for me.

145
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,614
Brother Bill,
they can't live without their dad.

146
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,843
Tell your brother that you'll go straight!

147
00:11:58,951 --> 00:11:59,849
Tell him!

148
00:11:59,952 --> 00:12:00,850
She's right.

149
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,318
I will!

150
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,715
Stop!

151
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,760
Stay alert.

152
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,672
Bill, go take a look.

153
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,672
Okay.

154
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,072
Brother...

155
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,672
I'll do it.

156
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:02,043
Pao, you be careful!

157
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,342
Right.

158
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,266
Pao!

159
00:13:55,734 --> 00:13:58,032
Pao, why did you do that?

160
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:00,971
Because... I don't want to be

161
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,007
a deliveryman for the rest of my life!

162
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,879
Since I was a kid,
no matter how hard I tried,

163
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,948
I've always been the little brother of Bill!

164
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,175
I want to be rich!

165
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,759
Pao has betrayed us.

166
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,958
I know that.

167
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,401
So you and he are partners!

168
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,180
Freeze!

169
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,942
Why? Why did you join forces to trap me?

170
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,648
You! You have ruined the corporation!

171
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,698
- Search!
- Yeah!

172
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,834
Yu Hoi-yeung!

173
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,128
Toss him in the river.

174
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,160
Now rest.

175
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,166
Rest well, Bill.

176
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:12,772
Rest in peace.
I'll hold a funeral in your honor...

177
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:18,282
and make you a grave to worship...you.

178
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,611
Pao.

179
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,447
You're overdoing it a little.

180
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:24,351
You surprise me a bit...
like you care.

181
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,127
I'm over it now.

182
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:39,227
You did well.
No one can stop us.

183
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,863
We can do anything.

184
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,137
Now you get Bill's job.

185
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,178
I will not be a deliveryman forever.

186
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,439
What about our friend?
Robinson?

187
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:55,182
I'll handle it.

188
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:05,148
- Watch out!
- Move out!

189
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,485
Move! Move! Move!

190
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,628
I'm moving here.

191
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:31,180
Hey, Ma! Come here!

192
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,782
What? What's wrong?
What's the matter?

193
00:22:35,887 --> 00:22:37,445
It's not what I want.

194
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:38,716
So, what do you want?

195
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,121
It's just not right!

196
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:44,323
He's done the monkey
a lot of different ways.

197
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,300
His legs are spread apart.

198
00:22:55,407 --> 00:22:56,669
That's not the monkey.

199
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:01,976
Bring it to me.

200
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,676
Get out!

201
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,721
Ma! Make it real.

202
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:23,156
Raise your legs!

203
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,837
And pull back.

204
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,234
Monkey on the cloud.

205
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,042
Monkey pisses.

206
00:23:40,318 --> 00:23:41,410
Somersaults.

207
00:23:42,454 --> 00:23:43,978
1...2...

208
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,057
3...4!

209
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,722
Ma, don't overdo it!

210
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,933
Okay! Choose any gesture you want.

211
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,436
Yeah!

212
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,007
Monkey on the ground.

213
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,167
Monkey gets the peach.

214
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,302
Monkey looks right.

215
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,401
Monkey looks left.

216
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:11,215
Now!

217
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,719
It's not right!
Try again!

218
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,087
Monkey looks at the moon.

219
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,996
Monkey on the cloud.

220
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,068
That's not bad. Go on.

221
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,681
Hey, you think you can do something

222
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,251
that we haven't seen before?

223
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,446
Sure!

224
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,057
Monkey in the water.

225
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:56,291
Bring him up.

226
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,986
- Right!
- Yes! Higher!

227
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,563
- Wait! No!
- Higher!

228
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,995
Not yet!

229
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,230
No hands!

230
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,204
Do it! You got it!

231
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,403
Act more like a monkey.

232
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,076
Rise!

233
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:21,384
Lazy monkey yawns!

234
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,086
Last stance!

235
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,921
Monkey climb.

236
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,995
Monkey runs!

237
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,460
Faster! Faster!
You got it now!

238
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,161
Son, keep drawing!

239
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:51,509
Okay. When you're done,
clean up there, too.

240
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,954
Keep goin'!
Keep goin'! Keep goin'!

241
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,320
Keep goin'! Don't stop!
Faster! Faster!

242
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,017
Master is back!

243
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,095
- Get away!
- Now just--

244
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:05,662
The Master's home?

245
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:06,822
The Master's home!

246
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,492
My God! My father's here!

247
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:18,206
Tidy up now!
Hurry up!

248
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:23,305
Move the paper off this desk!

249
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,677
Take away that ladder!

250
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:27,479
Close the door!
Reset the curtains!

251
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,887
Master, you're home.

252
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,016
Why did you return so early?

253
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,650
I've already finished my work,

254
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,160
so I came home early.

255
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,696
I miss all of you.

256
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,400
It's gorgeous!

257
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:47,494
I thought you would really like it,
so I bought it for you.

258
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,471
Where is Ka-yip?

259
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,303
Master?

260
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,877
Do you like it?
How do I look?

261
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,744
Very nice.

262
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,476
Now, where is Ka-yip?

263
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:03,320
He is studying.

264
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:04,410
Studying?

265
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:12,253
All right, stop stalling.
Where is my son?

266
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,197
He is inside.

267
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,871
Wait! Wait!

268
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,172
- Hello, nephew.
- Uncle.

269
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,088
Hurry up. Hurry up!

270
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:40,385
I want you to study hard
and take over my business,

271
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,392
but all you do is paint!

272
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,429
But, Dad, I'm creating a handbook
of Monkeyish Fist.

273
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,430
- A what? What is that?
- Master...

274
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,625
Can you make money from that thing?

275
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:52,066
You do nothing at all
to prepare for your future

276
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,899
in the business world

277
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,803
except stay home
and draw monkeys all day!

278
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,307
Master, don't get angry.

279
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,071
Father, please listen to me.

280
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,170
I only need eight more stances
to finish my handbook.

281
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,612
Get down on your knees.

282
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:08,777
Father, I'll become truly famous
if I publish this handbook.

283
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:11,151
And then I'll become
a great teacher as well.

284
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:12,917
- Yeah, he's right!
- No! No!

285
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,288
It's all right here in your head!

286
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:19,593
I must punish you thoroughly
in front of our ancestors.

287
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,222
It is my duty.

288
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,062
- Bring it to me!
- Yes, Master.

289
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,503
Stop!

290
00:28:32,577 --> 00:28:35,444
What's the matter?

291
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,639
It's family business.

292
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,511
And so is that.

293
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:41,446
What's wrong with this?

294
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,612
You just encourage the kid.

295
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,122
Look, can I ask a question?

296
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,384
What do you call me?

297
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:48,618
I call you Uncle.

298
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,456
And what is our relationship, huh?

299
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,189
I'm your oldest brother's son.

300
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,331
Please take it out.

301
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:57,901
Chan's family tree.

302
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:02,630
My dear nephew, listen.

303
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,801
Turn to the first page, if you will.

304
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,641
It's clearly written that... many...

305
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,613
Many years ago...

306
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,274
Many, many years ago,

307
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:16,046
the ancestors of the Chan family

308
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:19,055
swore to become truly famous.

309
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,125
Now, I'm your uncle, I believe.

310
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,922
Isn't that correct...Chan Sing-kam?

311
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,322
So...what are you saying?

312
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,059
On your knees!

313
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,735
And you...

314
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:34,998
Yes?

315
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,733
... refer to me as what?

316
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,499
Uncle-in-law.

317
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:47,346
Listen... if I die all of a sudden,

318
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:51,684
I would become your ancestor,
just like the others.

319
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,088
I want that respect now.

320
00:29:55,393 --> 00:29:57,088
The respectable uncle.

321
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,396
Who's the senior here?

322
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:03,464
It's you, Uncle.

323
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,195
I couldn't hear you.

324
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,396
I said, who's the senior here?

325
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:10,303
Of course it's you, Uncle.
I'm sorry.

326
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,467
Good.

327
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:16,343
Now, I know you want Ka-yip
to succeed your business.

328
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:18,278
He's done nothing wrong.
I mean...

329
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:20,374
why do you beat him like that?

330
00:30:21,753 --> 00:30:24,517
Because all he ever wants to do is paint.

331
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:28,820
Don't you see that it's his dream
to finish the sketches?

332
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,986
Is there anything wrong in that?

333
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,995
If you force him to quit now,

334
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:36,066
to give up on that dream...

335
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,156
well, something tells me

336
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:38,895
that's not exactly your style.

337
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,595
Meaning what?

338
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:44,698
You always finish your work. Right?

339
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,209
And you'll do whatever it takes
to get it done,

340
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,279
won't you?

341
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:49,403
I've heard it all.

342
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:55,585
All right. Look...

343
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:01,517
I know you don't like us to practice.

344
00:31:01,626 --> 00:31:03,856
Here we are...

345
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,259
my dad and l...

346
00:31:06,965 --> 00:31:10,093
so poor that we have to live here.

347
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,105
I'll not forget...

348
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:20,205
...all you've done for us.

349
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:21,938
- Uncle.
- Uncle.

350
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:27,182
However, Dr. Sun Yat-sen
was once heard to say

351
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:30,152
that Chinese kung fu
is our country's heritage.

352
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,950
That's right!

353
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,318
That's right!

354
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:34,448
Good speech!

355
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,221
Then let Ka-yip publish his handbook.

356
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:38,886
I want him to follow me.

357
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,897
He will study hard.

358
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,331
- The Chan family will be famous!
- Yes!

359
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,308
I hear that you like to draw the monkey.
Then draw this.

360
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,571
All right, go ahead!

361
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,340
I know Monkeyish Fist.

362
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,511
That hurt!

363
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,387
Watch out!
Move! It's urgent!

364
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,491
Come on!
Over here!

365
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,540
Good one.

366
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:35,552
Wait. You shouldn't use this to...

367
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:36,551
hurt anyone.

368
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:38,087
Well said!

369
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:41,789
He's bluffing again.
Oh, man.

370
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:45,056
Here, catch.

371
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:48,155
So... how would you guys like to...

372
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,824
play a little ball?

373
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,100
Are you...scared?

374
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:56,938
So, what kind of game do you like?

375
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,702
How about fighting?

376
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,869
Grand Uncle, you're good at that.

377
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,380
Grand Uncle?
So, where's your beard, huh?

378
00:33:06,751 --> 00:33:10,312
So. All grand uncles have beards.

379
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,389
- Let's say that--
- Allow me.

380
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:16,317
Let's say your sister marries
my grandfather

381
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:17,621
and they have a son.

382
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:19,822
How should my son greet
your sister's son?

383
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,057
I'll tell him.

384
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:23,665
"Grand Uncle."

385
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:24,666
What?

386
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,134
- Grand Uncle!
- Grand Uncle!

387
00:33:26,237 --> 00:33:27,499
Oh, Grand Uncle?

388
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:29,505
Are you makin' fun of me?

389
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:32,837
Let's get him!

390
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,174
I'm hungry!
We're late for dinner.

391
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:39,079
Eat later!

392
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:44,087
Kid, I want to fight with you alone!

393
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,553
Well? You afraid?

394
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:49,426
I told you I haven't eaten!

395
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:54,430
If you want to fight, let's save some time
and do it together.

396
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,692
Come on!
I'm in a hurry here.

397
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,529
Hit me! Here!

398
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:58,761
Go ahead!

399
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:03,701
Oh, no!

400
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,208
Your breath stinks!

401
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:10,780
Wow! What a move!

402
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,612
Father, our students are always active.

403
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,118
They love extracurricular exercises.

404
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,881
No matter-- football, basketball,

405
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,889
every kind of ball game.

406
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,016
They're good at swordplay, too.

407
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,889
It develops camaraderie
and healthy competition.

408
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:25,189
Super Rod!

409
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:28,564
And they especially love
anything to do with baseball.

410
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,635
Why haven't you learned
the Chinese sword?

411
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,328
You're a traitor!
How 'bout that?

412
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:34,462
Isn't that right, Father?

413
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,767
So, you see,
we intend to build a church

414
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,569
here on the campus.

415
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:40,303
But the funding could be an issue,
you know?

416
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,276
Well, don't worry.

417
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:44,448
Wait!

418
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:51,779
It's the curve ball that can't be hit!

419
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,183
Good hit!

420
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,536
Are you hurt?
Have you been hurt?

421
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:11,835
- You're okay?
- You're sure?

422
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,001
I'm fine.
Don't worry, Mom.

423
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,672
Grand Uncle, are you all right?

424
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,441
Everything is all right.

425
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:23,042
So, no one was injured.

426
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:36,189
May the Good Lord bless you.
Amen!

427
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,631
Gently.

428
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,942
Who was it that hurt you?

429
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,772
I did.

430
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:50,507
You want all the glory.

431
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:51,741
Did you fight?

432
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,511
Let me show off once, okay?

433
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,348
Me.

434
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,519
He used a bat on you?

435
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,053
No...

436
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,926
- A ball?
- A ball?

437
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:09,192
Nephew, listen to me.

438
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,733
- I didn't plan to hit him.
- Of course not.

439
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,427
I just wanted to hit the ball.

440
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,199
- Then ball hit him. The ball hit him.
- That's right!

441
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,001
Yes, of course.
It makes sense.

442
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:21,169
So then...it was an accident.

443
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,577
You didn't intend to hurt Father Ma.

444
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,979
That's right!

445
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:27,880
It was solid contact!

446
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:28,883
A good hit!

447
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,180
A good hit?

448
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,051
Well, what is the matter with you?

449
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:35,789
Please stop hitting my son!

450
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:36,951
I hit him because
I want him to be good.

451
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:38,494
I have to teach him a good lesson!

452
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,359
Don't you see?

453
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:41,453
Mom!

454
00:36:46,804 --> 00:36:50,035
[Music] If you hit him again [Music]

455
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:53,542
[Music] I won't let you sleep in our room [Music]

456
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,839
- [Music] I won't let you sleep-- [Music]
- Keep quiet, won't you?

457
00:36:55,947 --> 00:37:00,509
[Music] You can sleep alone
in the sitting room [Music]

458
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,518
Shut up!

459
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:06,684
Oh, God!

460
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,888
What is it, husband?

461
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,932
What's the matter?

462
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,661
It's a notification.

463
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:19,895
- Of what?
- Of what?

464
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:22,529
Some kind of ritual or something?

465
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,404
You're both being sent to another school!

466
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:27,067
- What?
- Sweet!

467
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:28,509
What famous school is it?

468
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,945
Canton High School.

469
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,072
Oh, no!

470
00:37:32,183 --> 00:37:33,081
Wow!

471
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:35,152
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, great!

472
00:37:44,862 --> 00:37:46,261
Good morning, Mandy.

473
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:48,855
Good morning, Uncle Wah.

474
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:50,024
Thank you.

475
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,841
Grand Uncle!

476
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:09,044
- Stop!
- Stop!

477
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,883
Hey! What did I tell you?

478
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:16,390
You promised not to call me that anymore.

479
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,461
I have a name, right?

480
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:20,860
Yes, Tak. I promise.

481
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,866
Now, we didn't go to Canton,
but got off in Shao-xing.

482
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,095
Are you sure we can find him?

483
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,433
We haven't started looking yet.

484
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,041
Gotta give it a chance.

485
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,136
I know. But, Grand Uncle--

486
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,478
Right. Tak.
It's gonna be hard to find him.

487
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,785
Look.

488
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:49,053
At least we have to...to try.

489
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,129
I mean, come on!
We're here, aren't we?

490
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,102
I mean, you want to finish your book, right?

491
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:01,330
- Yeah! Of course!
- Well, all right!

492
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,101
That's what I want to hear,
Grand Nephew.

493
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:05,903
Wait!

494
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,535
Let's be fair.
You call me Ka-yip.

495
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:12,582
Okay, Ka-yip.
Down to business.

496
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:16,949
We're here is to find
the famous kung fu master

497
00:39:17,054 --> 00:39:18,487
who plays Monkeyish Fist.

498
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:19,487
Bill Man.

499
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,488
That's right.

500
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:21,683
So, where do we begin?

501
00:39:24,495 --> 00:39:26,190
We're here.

502
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,697
Let me help you.

503
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:31,199
Get the luggage, okay?
Mind my paintings!

504
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,223
Do you know Bill Man
who plays Monkeyish Fist?

505
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,695
No!

506
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:01,924
Are you sure?

507
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:03,693
- Ask him.
- Hey!

508
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,398
Doctor.

509
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:09,700
Come on, show me your tongue.

510
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,470
Listen, I just need to know,

511
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,668
have you treated any monkey--

512
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,370
What? I'm not a vet.

513
00:40:15,479 --> 00:40:16,844
But-- Wait, wait, wait.
Hey!

514
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:19,108
I'm sorry.
Have you treated a guy around here

515
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:22,481
named Bill Man
who plays Monkeyish Fist?

516
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,484
No!

517
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,179
No. Wait. Wait. No.
Get out!

518
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,996
You'll get all you need here.

519
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,404
Come on, everyone's welcome!

520
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:45,668
We have different schools
of kung fu play

521
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,540
from both the north and the south.

522
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:51,877
All are worth watching
and at a very cheap price as well.

523
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,883
If you want to watch, follow me.
Come on.

524
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,687
Wow! It's Chinese kung fu!

525
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:04,158
Hey! A show there, too!

526
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,824
- You're there, I'm here.
- Okay.

527
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:17,968
You can eat all kinds of crab
in Shing's Restaurant.

528
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:19,872
Only the freshest, see.

529
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,275
You can have it extra spicy,
which is just that way I like it.

530
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:23,971
Or no spice at all.

531
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:25,639
There's a whole selection of fresh fruit

532
00:41:25,749 --> 00:41:27,080
if you go to White Cloud Temple.

533
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:29,812
An array of appetizers
and dessert is included.

534
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,319
You'll be satisfied.

535
00:41:31,422 --> 00:41:32,912
- Hey, please stay.
- Hey.

536
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,957
If you don't like veggies,
you can eat meat.

537
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,551
- I came for Bill Man.
- You mean with crab sauce?

538
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,152
Oh, sure.
We can make that for you.

539
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,323
No! He's a kung fu master!

540
00:41:44,034 --> 00:41:46,059
You mean king crab.

541
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,501
Yeah, we've got that.

542
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:51,871
My God!
I just want the kung fu master!

543
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:54,035
Sister, someone is having an issue here!

544
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:55,543
He's playing Monkeyish Fist!

545
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:02,480
Monkey jumps.
Monkey jumps again.

546
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,291
Stop!

547
00:42:09,727 --> 00:42:12,252
- Okay.
- Teach him a lesson.

548
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,762
Monkeyish Fist.

549
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:23,997
He's drawing you!

550
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,633
Wait. Don't go!

551
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:43,621
Lady, it's great!
Don't run so fast! I can't follow you.

552
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,657
Slow down!

553
00:42:51,502 --> 00:42:53,902
You stop following me, or I'll jump.

554
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:57,269
Oh, you're kidding!
I'll draw it, too.

555
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,025
- Nice job!
- Perfect!

556
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:26,102
Thank you, hero.

557
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:28,194
You there!

558
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,865
Still want to draw?

559
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:34,676
I suppose not.
See ya!

560
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:35,972
Wait a minute!

561
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,349
Look, you're in my way!

562
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,423
Move it!

563
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,895
Hey! Ka-yip!
I'm coming down!

564
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:56,194
Never mind me!
Just go after the girl!

565
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,358
Girl? Where?

566
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,958
The one in blue!

567
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,661
She plays excellent Monkeyish Fist.

568
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:02,966
Okay! I'll go now.

569
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,700
Hurry up!
I want to draw her!

570
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,325
Over here!
Lots of vegetables!

571
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,028
Uncle Fook, how are you today?

572
00:44:31,135 --> 00:44:33,126
- Did you come for the fruits?
- Yes.

573
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:36,104
Wow! The bananas are great.

574
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,101
The bridge.
It's the girl!

575
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:41,575
Here, Mandy, take some apples.

576
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:47,082
All fresh!
Over here! Over here!

577
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,447
What's the big deal?

578
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:53,047
What am I afraid of?

579
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,715
Hey, you!

580
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,467
Does it smell good?

581
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:07,628
Oh, yes!

582
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:09,501
- Want a taste?
- Sure.

583
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:10,573
Go!

584
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:15,238
Wow!

585
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:17,006
That's great!
I'll take two.

586
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:18,741
Okay.

587
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,476
Here's two.

588
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,518
Hey!
Watch out!

589
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:28,721
Look out!
Don't block my way!

590
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,795
Hey! Watch out.

591
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,764
Hey, listen.
Catch that girl for me, can you?

592
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,771
Please, no.
I'm too busy.

593
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,305
- Will this do?
- Let's go.

594
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,286
Don't get too close.

595
00:46:58,816 --> 00:46:59,748
Catch it.

596
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:09,049
- It's no good.
- Oh, no?

597
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,592
Then, here!

598
00:47:10,694 --> 00:47:12,924
Wait. Stop wasting the wine.

599
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,158
But you said it's not good.

600
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:18,291
- I was only joking.
- My head hurts!

601
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:20,427
You old monkey!

602
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:23,770
It's broken!

603
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:27,503
I told you not to waste my wine, didn't l?

604
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:29,442
But you're the one who broke it!

605
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,412
You could have stopped it with your hands.

606
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,607
Yeah, but how?

607
00:47:32,716 --> 00:47:34,547
Here. Look.
Just like this.

608
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:35,549
Just like this?

609
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:36,778
Or like this.

610
00:47:36,887 --> 00:47:39,481
- Or like this.
- Or you could have done this.

611
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,091
- Look at him...
- Look at him...

612
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,820
- Shake...
- Shake...

613
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,990
Monkey's claw!

614
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:56,096
Here it goes!
Lazy monkey yawns.

615
00:47:57,574 --> 00:47:58,768
Monkey runs.

616
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,838
Monkey doesn't care.

617
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,513
Wait!

618
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,357
Ghost!

619
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:20,259
Stay back!

620
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:21,922
- It's cold!
- I know Monkeyish Fist!

621
00:48:22,032 --> 00:48:23,829
It's cold!

622
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,439
I'm gonna kill you!

623
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:36,710
- You'd kill your Grand Uncle!
- Grand Uncle?

624
00:48:38,548 --> 00:48:40,277
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

625
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:41,942
You stink bad.

626
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,565
What are you two doing there?
Get lost, don't touch!

627
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:01,832
Next time come to my country,

628
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,497
I would love to show you around.

629
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,505
That'll be great.

630
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,132
Definitely, you have to come
to my country.

631
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:07,039
Yeah, I'll definitely...

632
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:22,926
You get out.

633
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:25,757
Is this Chun-yuen Delivery?

634
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:27,295
Get out.

635
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,562
- It's Mr. Man's horse.
- Get out!

636
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:35,433
Hey, Rocky!

637
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:39,336
He's a friend.
It's all right.

638
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:40,410
Be polite.

639
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:44,103
Rocky, rain's coming.
Let's go.

640
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,310
Let's go inside.

641
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,215
Tend to the horse.

642
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:00,393
Please.

643
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,261
Mr. Hung, after my brother
lent you the horse,

644
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:06,336
he was killed later that night.

645
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:08,904
I couldn't even find his body.

646
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,735
Bill was so unlucky.

647
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:13,803
I feel like...

648
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:16,242
I was responsible.

649
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:20,508
Listen. You weren't.

650
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:22,244
It wasn't your fault.

651
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,917
All deliverymen...

652
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:27,923
...are prepared for the risk.

653
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,088
Tell me why this is now a trading firm.

654
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:37,596
I didn't want my men
taking that risk again.

655
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:42,760
And I don't want Pao
to feel upset for Bill's death...

656
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,103
so I have to trade with the foreigners.

657
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:48,006
The company's now become a trading firm.

658
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,782
I came here to bring the horse back...

659
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:59,245
...and to watch Master Man
playing Monkeyish Fist.

660
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,121
I'm afraid I will not have that honor.

661
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:06,954
Can you show me?

662
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,692
No! I do not want to play Monkeyish Fist.

663
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,291
Well, is he a match for that girl?

664
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,768
All I know is that she is as powerful
as her father is.

665
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:16,532
How good are they?

666
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,130
Don't push it.
You hear?

667
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,345
What is that?

668
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:28,418
Come here.

669
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:31,812
Here's how it looked to me.

670
00:51:34,191 --> 00:51:36,318
I have no idea what you're doing.

671
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,319
Here, take it.

672
00:51:40,497 --> 00:51:41,987
Hold it tightly.

673
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:48,137
- I recognize that.
- Wow!

674
00:51:48,238 --> 00:51:49,671
That's great!

675
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,035
Was that One Palm, Four Stances?

676
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:54,166
Please tell me.

677
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,245
- It's you.
- It's none of your business!

678
00:51:57,547 --> 00:51:59,378
Who is your master?

679
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,272
Why should I tell you?

680
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:03,909
It's important that I know.

681
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,385
Okay! Bill Man is my Master.
So what?

682
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:07,286
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Let go of me!

683
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:08,914
I knew it.
Bill Man.

684
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,151
Can you take me there?

685
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,297
Wanna fight?

686
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,512
Oh, this is good!

687
00:52:33,617 --> 00:52:34,743
My friend...

688
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,443
it seems you're new to this.

689
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:37,645
Right?

690
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,681
You're absolutely right.

691
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:42,985
He's just learned it.

692
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,955
Your master.
Take me to where he is.

693
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,561
Trouble is, he likes to roam around a lot.

694
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,396
If I see him, I'll tell you.

695
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,394
- Come on! Let's get outta here!
- All right, then.

696
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,472
Do that.

697
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,405
Clean up.
Pull down the curtain. Hurry.

698
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,140
Sir, I'm sorry.
It'll be okay soon.

699
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:15,923
What's the matter?

700
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,391
Detective.

701
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,225
What's he doin' here?

702
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:23,526
I'm not really sure.

703
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:26,932
But don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

704
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:28,732
- Just watch out.
- Yes.

705
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,306
You see, once I fought with Master Man.

706
00:53:32,409 --> 00:53:34,673
I know his stances very well.

707
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:36,302
That young lad,
he didn't play well at all.

708
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:37,607
He's a rookie.

709
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:40,982
That's strange.

710
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:43,518
Bill's the only one to play
One Palm And Four Stances.

711
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,611
And that's what I saw.

712
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,451
Mr. Hung...

713
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,548
do you think my brother is still alive?

714
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:51,024
That's right.

715
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:53,687
When I asked them
where Bill was to be found,

716
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,458
they wouldn't answer.

717
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:56,827
Very secretive.

718
00:53:56,933 --> 00:54:00,027
I had to tell you.
Do you want me to follow the case?

719
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:04,472
- Yes.
- Yes. We'd be grateful.

720
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:07,805
Thank you.
Find out what you can.

721
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:10,812
I'm going now.

722
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:26,655
And halt!

723
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:28,492
What's wrong?

724
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:29,895
I was wondering.

725
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,560
What if it's not really Bill there?

726
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:36,105
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.
It has to be Bill.

727
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,299
If it's not, then it's his student.

728
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:40,501
We should make him our master.

729
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:43,704
Of course!
Otherwise, how can I finish my handbook?

730
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:46,680
Yeah! Anyway, we've him brought
so many presents!

731
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,546
He'll be moved to tears.

732
00:54:48,652 --> 00:54:49,744
Let's go!

733
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:54,315
Thank you, everybody.

734
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:55,322
Bye. Thanks.

735
00:54:55,425 --> 00:54:57,620
- See you later.
- All right, bye.

736
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:00,161
Well! What's up here?

737
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,622
We're new students.

738
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:06,861
- What are these?
- Presents for our master.

739
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:21,512
You want to be my students?

740
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,551
- Uh, no.
- No, not exactly.

741
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,624
Why'd you come here?

742
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:31,387
- Mandy. Inside.
- Right.

743
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:37,198
Hey! Come on!

744
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:38,528
How do you know them?

745
00:55:38,635 --> 00:55:40,330
I met them in the market the other day.

746
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:42,064
You showed them your kung fu again?

747
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,662
- Oh, no, no, no. I did not.
- No?

748
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:45,934
- How about some more tea?
- Open!

749
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:49,338
So, what now?

750
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:52,006
Well, he just has to see that we mean it.

751
00:55:52,115 --> 00:55:54,413
Yeah! We have to prove it to him.

752
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:55,643
Right!
So knock again.

753
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:58,277
Wait, wait, wait.
Maybe we should kneel.

754
00:55:58,388 --> 00:56:01,789
Stupid fool!
Just kneel when he opens the door.

755
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,359
- Forget about them.
- Yes.

756
00:56:04,461 --> 00:56:05,792
Open up!

757
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:08,227
One last thing.

758
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:11,129
There was a guy looking for Bill.

759
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:12,360
Oh, yeah.

760
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:13,731
Who wants to see Bill?

761
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:14,667
I don't know.

762
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:16,363
This guy who saved me.

763
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:18,441
- He's a kung fu master.
- Yeah! That's right!

764
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,135
Hey, hey!
Why'd you come here?

765
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:23,212
To be your students!

766
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:25,247
What? Get up.
Come on.

767
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:27,316
Master Bill.
Good to see you.

768
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:29,810
Hung Yat-fu?

769
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,615
Then you are Bill Man!

770
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,815
Please! Take us as your students.

771
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:38,758
Hey! My dad lives in seclusion.
Leave him alone.

772
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:40,261
I see.

773
00:56:40,363 --> 00:56:42,297
But Pao said you were dead.

774
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:45,835
He said you were killed by thieves.

775
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:47,493
- Mandy.
- Yes.

776
00:56:47,604 --> 00:56:48,400
Show these lads to the door.

777
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,370
Right. Come on.
Time to go.

778
00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:51,667
- Please.
- Give us a moment.

779
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:53,367
- No, no, no.
- Please wait.

780
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:54,909
- No, no.
- This way. This way.

781
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:58,174
- Out. Out!
- Get out.

782
00:56:58,281 --> 00:57:00,340
Go! Go!

783
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:01,348
- All right!
- All right!

784
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:02,918
No, I said out!

785
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,316
Have you heard?

786
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:07,549
Chun-yuen Delivery
has become a trading firm.

787
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,390
It has nothing...

788
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:13,922
to do with me.

789
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:16,157
Freeze!

790
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,962
Listen.
I'm warning you.

791
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:21,059
Don't come back here. Go!

792
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,604
What a pity.

793
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:26,732
Now I have no chance
to see your Monkeyish Fist again.

794
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,308
How can you live
in seclusion like this?

795
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:38,410
Master Man, you fought for justice.

796
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:42,550
I think that it's best to let it go.

797
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:44,388
If I don't show it...

798
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:47,658
then all will be safe.

799
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:48,731
I see.

800
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:51,664
Master Man, you're a man of compassion.

801
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,793
It's truly an honor knowing you.

802
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:01,238
You are the light that I must follow.

803
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:04,903
Let's enjoy the wine together.

804
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:15,285
Hey!

805
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:19,328
Stop!

806
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:30,929
My arm!

807
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:37,012
What happened?

808
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:38,307
They took Mandy!

809
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:40,910
What is it?

810
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,416
It's Pao.
He's taken Mandy.

811
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:45,579
Will you be all right?

812
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:48,054
I'll be fine!
Go save her!

813
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:05,599
Mandy?

814
00:59:42,545 --> 00:59:45,912
Are you okay?
Wake up!

815
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:48,540
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

816
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:50,243
Mandy.

817
00:59:58,094 --> 00:59:59,527
Opium water?

818
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:02,722
How much was it?

819
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:06,564
Only a little.
Just two bottles.

820
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:09,035
It's much too much to drink!

821
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:12,774
Oh, I don't know.

822
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:15,400
The opium water can kill her.
What are you doing?

823
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:22,843
Now then, dear brother...

824
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:27,013
some folks say
that a woman is your better half.

825
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:31,025
So then...she's a lot more than that.

826
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:33,095
She saved your life!

827
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,199
Pao, you have to end this.

828
01:00:38,301 --> 01:00:41,168
You're guilty of smuggling opium.
You will be hanged!

829
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:44,933
So what?
I deal in opium.

830
01:00:45,041 --> 01:00:46,508
Not so bad.

831
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:48,201
Besides, I've got the foreigners
backing me up.

832
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,744
Why should I be afraid?

833
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:55,580
But...there is one way...

834
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:58,085
that you could help me.

835
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:02,849
Detective...

836
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:05,723
if you help me, I'd be grateful.

837
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:07,887
I'm listening.

838
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,464
Kill him!

839
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:15,532
I'm an officer, not a murderer.

840
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:20,169
Well, you don't have to.

841
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:21,971
Arrest him
as the opium smuggler,

842
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:24,672
and he'll be the one to be hanged,
and you'll be a hero.

843
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:26,680
Forget it!

844
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:27,750
What's wrong with you?

845
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,045
I'm not stupid.
You won't let me go!

846
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:32,314
That's right.

847
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:36,048
- Stop! Stop now!
- No! Don't!

848
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:37,649
Come on!

849
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:39,421
- Kill him!
- Leave her alone!

850
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:40,496
Mandy!

851
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:41,893
- Don't touch her!
- Don't do it!

852
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:44,091
Bastard! Stop!

853
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,760
Pao, don't you do it!

854
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,700
Don't hurt Mandy!

855
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:51,637
- What are you doing?
- Kill him!

856
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:53,174
Do it!

857
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:55,369
Hung Yat-fu, what are you waiting for?

858
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:56,672
Kill me!

859
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:58,838
I said do it!

860
01:01:58,948 --> 01:02:00,779
I won't do it!

861
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:03,181
What are you doing?

862
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:04,514
- Where are you taking her?
- Let her go!

863
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:05,917
Leave her alone.

864
01:02:10,793 --> 01:02:13,193
I mean it.
Do it now!

865
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,528
No.

866
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:26,865
Do it! Die!

867
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:28,197
Kill him!

868
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,602
Why did you stop?
Keep going! Kill him!

869
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:34,437
Drink this!

870
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:36,705
If you drink wine, it will kill the pain.

871
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,988
Now, you can do it!

872
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,258
We have to get her out!

873
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:32,091
Take Mandy away!

874
01:04:33,769 --> 01:04:35,066
Hung Yat-fu!

875
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:36,604
Run!

876
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:41,837
Go!

877
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:55,449
Death means nothing to real heroes.

878
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,287
What's with you?

879
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,691
Save me!

880
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:24,919
You mean... he's still not eating?

881
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:30,987
He hasn't eaten for three days.

882
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:34,827
And how is the girl doing lately?

883
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,399
I'm not allowed to see her.

884
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,559
But you could have tried to sneak a look.

885
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,330
I wasn't able to.

886
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:45,373
You mean that you didn't
even bother to try, did you?

887
01:05:45,474 --> 01:05:48,068
Grand Uncle, you're not better yet.

888
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:50,042
It's best that you stay in bed.

889
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:54,310
Ma, I got to admit
that I'm worried for Mandy.

890
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:58,148
We both are!

891
01:05:58,254 --> 01:05:59,915
And Bill as well.

892
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:02,252
We understand.

893
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:04,553
Take it away.

894
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:08,494
It's just, when he said he'd care for her,

895
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:11,998
we swore we wouldn't interfere.

896
01:06:12,101 --> 01:06:13,864
We must not break that oath.

897
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:19,498
Ma, Bill needs us now,
you know, to take care of him.

898
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:20,836
Yes, I know.

899
01:06:20,943 --> 01:06:23,173
He's hurt pretty badly, too, you know.

900
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:25,440
Let us take care of him.

901
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:28,540
But you two are also hurt.

902
01:06:30,553 --> 01:06:32,384
- We are young.
- Able.

903
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,251
We'll take the pain.

904
01:06:34,357 --> 01:06:37,793
Ka-yip!

905
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:39,087
Grand Uncle!

906
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,377
Now, remember, stay quiet.

907
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:06,455
Okay.

908
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:14,220
Mandy. Mandy!

909
01:07:20,669 --> 01:07:23,968
Master Man,
you better eat something.

910
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:25,404
Don't you want to help Mandy?

911
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:27,942
You can't if you don't stay strong.

912
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,909
- Wake up.
- Master Man.

913
01:07:30,012 --> 01:07:30,910
Wake up!

914
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:32,913
If you eat, you'll be strong.

915
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:35,575
We'll be glad to care for Mandy.
How about it?

916
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:36,912
You haven't recovered.

917
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:38,247
Your body needs time.

918
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:39,412
Your mind does, too.

919
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:41,581
- Yeah, that's right.
- All right?

920
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:44,659
Madam Chan, you promised
not to bother me.

921
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,387
Leave us alone.

922
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,221
- Just--
- Grand Uncle. Ka-yip.

923
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:51,594
Let's go.

924
01:07:54,236 --> 01:07:57,000
Madam, Master is home.

925
01:07:59,408 --> 01:08:01,342
Dear, has it all been handled?

926
01:08:01,444 --> 01:08:02,604
It has, my dear.

927
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:06,169
I've buried Hung Yat-fu's body
in the forest behind our house.

928
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:09,012
- He is at peace.
- That's great!

929
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:12,782
Master Man,
you need not worry any longer.

930
01:08:12,888 --> 01:08:14,617
Hung has been buried.

931
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:16,054
Master Man, you don't have to--

932
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:17,557
I heard.

933
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:28,028
Mr. Chan, your kindness is appreciated.

934
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,977
Master Man, one request.

935
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:47,487
My son, won't you take him on
as your student?

936
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:48,989
I'd be grateful.

937
01:08:49,091 --> 01:08:50,649
So he could finish his book.

938
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:52,386
All right!

939
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:01,865
Mandy, we need you to wake up now.

940
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,336
You hear?

941
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,000
Mandy, I need a model for my book.

942
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:12,012
Listen, Mandy, your business,
well, that's our business, too.

943
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:15,675
We'll get revenge for Hung Yat-fu.

944
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:17,012
- Wait.
- Wake up.

945
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:18,586
Are you serious?

946
01:09:20,456 --> 01:09:22,981
Well, I said that just to wake her up.

947
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:27,361
Let's say she does wake up.
Then what?

948
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:29,590
So? Don't take it so serious--

949
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:32,566
Master, she's awake!

950
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,500
- Come in here!
- Mandy's awake!

951
01:09:34,603 --> 01:09:35,865
Come quick!

952
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:40,301
Mandy.

953
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,880
Mandy, you're awake.

954
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:53,314
I'm glad that you're awake.

955
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:58,119
- Mandy.
- Old Monkey.

956
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:01,956
I'm glad.

957
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:08,969
Death....

958
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:13,132
Death means nothing to real heroes!

959
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:50,804
All right!

960
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,939
Now then, Master,
you have two new students!

961
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:55,311
- Master!
- Master!

962
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,783
You have our respect!

963
01:10:57,886 --> 01:11:01,219
Now they can learn...
Monkeyish fist.

964
01:11:59,481 --> 01:12:00,607
Oh, man.

965
01:12:12,695 --> 01:12:14,094
Madam.

966
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:22,463
Lesson one!

967
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,867
Mandy, are you all right?

968
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:29,568
Come on. Come on.

969
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:30,667
No, I'm okay.

970
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:43,122
It hurts!

971
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:44,658
It really hurts!

972
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:52,596
Master Man, how about they take a rest?

973
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,396
Yeah, how about it?

974
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:55,902
Go rest.

975
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:57,402
Finally.

976
01:12:57,506 --> 01:12:59,269
Not you.
Continue!

977
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,535
Monkey gets peaches!

978
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:09,915
Every finger should be powerful.

979
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:11,679
Understand?

980
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:18,224
Am I clear now?

981
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:20,887
Yeah.
I need to change now.

982
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:22,623
No.

983
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:23,698
Continue.

984
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:32,340
Monkey rolls the ball.

985
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,218
Stop.

986
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:55,458
Look, you have to play
the fist with strong eyes

987
01:13:55,564 --> 01:13:57,156
and you have to be quick

988
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:58,460
because your enemy
is right over there!

989
01:14:00,235 --> 01:14:02,135
You're kidding.

990
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:03,670
What did I do?

991
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:06,639
I wasn't talking about him!

992
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:09,609
A monkey is wise
and with special potential!

993
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:15,349
Master, I'll test it out on you.

994
01:14:16,618 --> 01:14:17,482
Come on.

995
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:19,110
Your fingers aren't strong enough.

996
01:14:21,256 --> 01:14:22,382
Let's go!

997
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:57,751
Using only your forearm
and shoulders is not enough.

998
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:01,563
Again!

999
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:09,626
The power should...
come from your waist!

1000
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:34,123
Good drawing!

1001
01:15:40,669 --> 01:15:43,570
- Grand Uncle, you're great!
- Yeah, I know.

1002
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:45,139
Back to work!

1003
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:58,547
Wine can raise your energy.

1004
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:05,258
It will also make you brave.

1005
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:08,591
If you match it with your fists,

1006
01:16:08,697 --> 01:16:12,724
you'll find it far more powerful.

1007
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:17,770
Don't stop drinking.

1008
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:20,933
Makes you be strong.

1009
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:36,550
- I should always be drunk!
- I hope I never wake!

1010
01:16:39,227 --> 01:16:41,627
Let's clear our sorrows together.

1011
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:21,727
This is great!

1012
01:17:37,019 --> 01:17:38,748
Master.

1013
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:49,456
Well?

1014
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:55,098
Well?
Let's go!

1015
01:17:57,272 --> 01:17:58,864
Let's go!

1016
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:02,970
- Master!
- Master!

1017
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:21,317
I, Bill, have no regrets...

1018
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:29,736
There's trouble!

1019
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:31,237
Master Man!

1020
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:34,103
Master, we have trouble.

1021
01:18:34,209 --> 01:18:37,610
Ka-yip and Grand Uncle have disappeared!

1022
01:18:46,088 --> 01:18:47,715
Fred, wait.

1023
01:18:47,823 --> 01:18:49,552
- It's them.
- Yes.

1024
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:50,556
Take him down.

1025
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:51,626
Right.

1026
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:55,322
- Would you like a light?
- Would you like a light?

1027
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,469
You two, clear out.

1028
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:07,701
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1029
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:11,603
Gentlemen, what would you
like to deliver, if I may?

1030
01:19:14,049 --> 01:19:15,516
A package.

1031
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:17,976
And where is it?

1032
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:20,979
Right here.

1033
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:29,358
"For Mr. Yu of Chun-yuen Delivery."

1034
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:31,159
That's right.

1035
01:19:34,636 --> 01:19:36,695
What's in the package?

1036
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:41,705
A couple of items he might be interested in.

1037
01:19:47,582 --> 01:19:50,415
For Yu Hoi-yeung and Pao Man.

1038
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:53,647
He's in the office.
He's our manager.

1039
01:19:53,755 --> 01:19:54,915
I'll take it to him now.

1040
01:19:56,758 --> 01:19:58,157
Don't bother.

1041
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:59,659
We'd be glad to take it.

1042
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:01,319
It's personal.

1043
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:03,488
Oh. Then follow me.

1044
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:15,773
After you.

1045
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:21,141
Right this way.

1046
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,913
You sure this is the way?

1047
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:29,889
Mr. Yu and Mr. Pao live a sheltered life.

1048
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:31,686
They're afraid, I bet.

1049
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:32,782
It's a trap, then.

1050
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:35,192
We're not afraid.
We're ready for anything.

1051
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:37,492
Hey, don't show off.

1052
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:41,899
Master said to keep yourself hidden
in front of your enemies always.

1053
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:44,062
That's right.
I forgot.

1054
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:46,072
What are you looking at?

1055
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:47,641
Let's go.

1056
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,535
If you move left,
I'll attack on the right.

1057
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:52,772
And vice versa.

1058
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:54,439
If you move your head, I'll kick your ass.

1059
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:55,948
If you turn, I'll show you the knife.

1060
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:57,712
If you run, I'll still attack.

1061
01:20:57,819 --> 01:20:58,808
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1062
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,252
I don't have any idea
what you guys are talking about.

1063
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,017
- So? Neither do we.
- So? Neither do we.

1064
01:21:03,124 --> 01:21:05,092
Follow me!

1065
01:21:12,167 --> 01:21:14,226
Hey, delivering, too?

1066
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:15,894
See you later, then.

1067
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,500
Hey, you're blocking the way.

1068
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:23,601
The problem is we didn't ask nicely.

1069
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:25,179
Move it!

1070
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:34,712
See? It's a trap, just like I said.

1071
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:36,450
Come on!

1072
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,452
Here's to you!

1073
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:02,706
Drop something?

1074
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:12,249
He hasn't had enough.

1075
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:13,725
Then neither have we.

1076
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:18,727
- Here's lookin' at you!
- Here's lookin' at you!

1077
01:22:31,846 --> 01:22:34,076
- You okay?
- I'm not sure.

1078
01:22:34,182 --> 01:22:35,149
Squeeze the vein.

1079
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:25,956
Return dagger.

1080
01:23:28,603 --> 01:23:30,798
Lazy chicken flies.

1081
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:15,171
My brother is nothing but a fool.

1082
01:24:15,283 --> 01:24:19,583
I see his students
are just as foolish as he is.

1083
01:24:19,687 --> 01:24:21,814
Tell me something.

1084
01:24:21,923 --> 01:24:25,689
You realize we can't let you leave.

1085
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:29,127
At least not in one piece.

1086
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:34,668
Pao, as Bill's successors
you know we are sworn to kill you.

1087
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:40,200
Let's see how much you've learned
in your training.

1088
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:45,709
Can you hang on, Ka-yip?

1089
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:47,406
Sure.

1090
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:51,246
I'm a successor of Monkeyish Fist.

1091
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:34,318
The kid's an amateur.

1092
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:51,738
So, you want Monkeyish Fist so bad?

1093
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:52,972
Well, here's the real thing!

1094
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:09,425
It's not in the book!

1095
01:26:19,507 --> 01:26:21,202
That's not Monkeyish Fist.

1096
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,252
Tak!

1097
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:05,781
Attack!

1098
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:14,626
Kill them now!

1099
01:27:28,209 --> 01:27:29,267
- Master?
- Master?

1100
01:27:41,656 --> 01:27:42,953
- Mandy.
- Mandy.

1101
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:56,126
- Are you okay?
- Let go of me!

1102
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:58,102
We're fine.
Where's Master?

1103
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:23,853
Man Pao!

1104
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:32,439
Yu Hoi-yeung...

1105
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:33,564
how have you been?

1106
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:38,409
Master, are you doing better?

1107
01:28:38,513 --> 01:28:40,378
Master, you shouldn't be here.

1108
01:28:40,481 --> 01:28:41,948
Then, who would save you two?

1109
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:43,745
Enough!

1110
01:29:00,902 --> 01:29:02,164
Four more ounces.

1111
01:29:41,042 --> 01:29:44,637
Master Yu, this will be easy.

1112
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:47,207
His wound has barely healed.

1113
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:58,047
Master, let me fight.

1114
01:30:10,271 --> 01:30:11,932
Pao, stay where you are!

1115
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:43,726
Those who are not involved,
go away now!

1116
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:25,938
You haven't had enough.
Four ounces more!

1117
01:31:44,866 --> 01:31:46,458
Had enough?

1118
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:48,865
Okay, then.
Rod stance.

1119
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:07,484
Okay, you can release the power now.
Go ahead!

1120
01:32:23,237 --> 01:32:24,636
Monkey's tail!

1121
01:32:33,514 --> 01:32:34,845
Master!

1122
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:56,628
Fierce monkey turn.

1123
01:33:00,074 --> 01:33:02,599
Two Palms, Eight Stances.

1124
01:33:05,680 --> 01:33:07,614
Lazy monkey piss.

1125
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:13,386
Man Pao!

1126
01:33:20,428 --> 01:33:22,362
Master.

1127
01:33:22,463 --> 01:33:24,556
Monkey grabs fruit!

1128
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:39,178
4 palms, 16 stances.

1129
01:34:12,947 --> 01:34:14,574
Why, Master?

1130
01:34:14,682 --> 01:34:15,944
- Master.
- Master.

1131
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:22,782
Brother...

1132
01:34:28,896 --> 01:34:30,090
Let's go.

1133
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:32,989
Brother!

1134
01:34:43,611 --> 01:34:44,407
Let's ride!

1135
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:46,377
- Yes!
- Yes!

1136
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:49,980
Take the flag!

1137
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:54,651
Good morning, Master.

1138
01:34:56,857 --> 01:34:59,621
- Uniforms.
- Yeah.

1139
01:35:00,728 --> 01:35:02,127
Take it.

1140
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:11,569
Let's ride!

1141
01:35:11,672 --> 01:35:13,037
- Yes!
- Yes!

1142
01:35:16,644 --> 01:35:17,440
I saw that!

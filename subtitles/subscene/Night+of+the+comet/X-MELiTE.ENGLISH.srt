1
00:01:18,007 --> 00:01:19,975
<i>Une coupe de champagne</i>
<i>s'il vous plaît.</i>

2
00:01:21,377 --> 00:01:24,369
<i>Garçon, un café s'il vous plaît</i>.

3
00:01:26,682 --> 00:01:30,209
<i>T'as de très beaux yeux,</i>
<i>je peux t'acheter un verre?</i>

4
00:01:54,477 --> 00:01:55,808
<i>Bonjour, Giles.</i>

5
00:01:55,845 --> 00:01:56,812
<i>Ça va?</i>

6
00:01:56,846 --> 00:01:58,336
You're late.

7
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,439
<i>Ça va bien, merci</i>.

8
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:04,308
So how's my girl?

9
00:02:04,353 --> 00:02:06,218
Serviced and ready to go.

10
00:02:11,727 --> 00:02:14,355
Papers are in the glove box.

11
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:16,428
I got you something.

12
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:19,199
Just a little bon voyage.

13
00:02:21,403 --> 00:02:23,701
You open it.

14
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,173
So you don't get lost.

15
00:02:31,947 --> 00:02:33,710
Maybe I want to.

16
00:02:35,584 --> 00:02:37,484
I'll miss you, Holly.

17
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:45,718
Come here.

18
00:02:56,505 --> 00:02:59,702
<i>Ladies, I'd like</i>
<i>to introduce you to Giles</i>.

19
00:02:59,742 --> 00:03:04,145
As you can see,
he's a real peach.

20
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,614
He's quick to learn
and eager to please.

21
00:03:06,649 --> 00:03:08,116
He doesn't get tired,

22
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,176
and he goes off
like a firecracker.

23
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:28,268
What more could a girl want?

24
00:08:50,192 --> 00:08:51,989
You looking for a lay?

25
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:57,421
Oi.

26
00:09:04,907 --> 00:09:06,534
You shopping?

27
00:09:06,575 --> 00:09:08,065
How much?

28
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:17,409
What are you after,
handsome?

29
00:09:18,954 --> 00:09:19,943
A handjob.

30
00:09:19,988 --> 00:09:21,956
How much?

31
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,617
50?

32
00:09:24,893 --> 00:09:27,726
Without a condom,
and dirty talk.

33
00:09:35,804 --> 00:09:38,967
Well, don't just sit there.

34
00:09:45,814 --> 00:09:47,975
Don't you have any lube?

35
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:48,983
What?

36
00:09:49,017 --> 00:09:50,882
Lube.
KY.

37
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:51,977
Um...

38
00:09:54,122 --> 00:09:55,919
- Out.
- What?

39
00:09:55,958 --> 00:10:00,088
I'm not paying top dollar
for amateur hour.

40
00:10:00,128 --> 00:10:01,459
I'll be good.
I promise.

41
00:10:01,496 --> 00:10:02,622
Fuck that.

42
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:05,899
You can do anything.

43
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:10,161
20 bucks.

44
00:10:18,246 --> 00:10:19,975
Show me your tits.

45
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:39,360
Gonna be a good girl?

46
00:10:49,444 --> 00:10:50,809
Give me your hand.

47
00:11:06,128 --> 00:11:08,323
Oh, that's better.

48
00:11:09,431 --> 00:11:13,094
Now, what's a sweet face like
you doing hawking your fork?

49
00:11:14,436 --> 00:11:15,664
I'm broke.

50
00:11:15,704 --> 00:11:17,968
That's not what
I'm paying you for.

51
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:19,405
Come on.

52
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:24,777
Now, what's a sweet thing
like you doing on the streets?

53
00:11:26,148 --> 00:11:27,672
I love sex.

54
00:11:27,716 --> 00:11:29,183
Yes.

55
00:11:29,217 --> 00:11:30,650
Um, I'm a slut.

56
00:11:30,686 --> 00:11:32,278
I just can't get enough.

57
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,548
Yeah, you fucking whore.

58
00:11:33,588 --> 00:11:35,385
You're all the same.

59
00:11:35,424 --> 00:11:37,289
Oh, baby, I can feel
you getting hot.

60
00:11:37,325 --> 00:11:38,622
That's better.

61
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,820
How old are you?

62
00:11:39,861 --> 00:11:41,294
17.

63
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,592
You like us young?

64
00:11:43,632 --> 00:11:45,759
Young and tight.

65
00:11:45,801 --> 00:11:47,769
Come on, dirtier.

66
00:11:47,803 --> 00:11:51,637
Ah, my tight, young pussy's
aching for your big juicy cock.

67
00:11:51,673 --> 00:11:52,867
Take it, you bitch.

68
00:11:52,908 --> 00:11:53,897
Make me beg.

69
00:11:53,942 --> 00:11:54,874
I'll teach you.

70
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,434
Teach me a lesson.

71
00:11:56,478 --> 00:11:58,469
Oh, you fucking whore.

72
00:11:58,513 --> 00:12:01,311
Oh, make me scream.
Come on, come on.

73
00:12:01,349 --> 00:12:03,078
That's better.
That's better.

74
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:04,608
Yes.

75
00:12:04,653 --> 00:12:06,018
Harder!

76
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:07,351
No!

77
00:12:20,202 --> 00:12:21,191
Where did you get this?

78
00:12:21,236 --> 00:12:23,261
Freedom of Information.

79
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:24,795
Got mine as well.

80
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,543
Look at you.

81
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:32,513
The prick made me suck him off
then arrested me anyway.

82
00:12:33,982 --> 00:12:36,610
Ligurian arrested me.

83
00:12:36,651 --> 00:12:39,211
His kid had just been born.

84
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:43,289
Does he know?

85
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:45,020
I'm meeting him for dinner.

86
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,426
Don't you tell him, Holly.

87
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:49,089
He'll stop you if he finds out.

88
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:51,065
I can't just disappear.

89
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:53,795
Forget the past.

90
00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:57,293
In Paris,
it'll be all future.

91
00:12:59,674 --> 00:13:01,198
To the end.

92
00:13:01,243 --> 00:13:02,301
To the beginning.

93
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:13,182
Show it to me.

94
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:23,459
First class.

95
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:28,135
I'm proud of you, Holly.

96
00:13:30,305 --> 00:13:32,865
A little something
to help you stay retired.

97
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:35,801
Happy birthday.

98
00:13:50,592 --> 00:13:52,753
I don't know what to say.

99
00:13:52,794 --> 00:13:55,456
Say a prayer for me
in that hunchback's church.

100
00:13:57,032 --> 00:13:59,398
I never thanked you.

101
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:01,664
What for?

102
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:04,228
Giving me a chance.

103
00:14:08,643 --> 00:14:11,009
Why did you pick me?

104
00:14:11,813 --> 00:14:13,474
I needed a blonde.

105
00:14:16,818 --> 00:14:19,218
You looked tough.

106
00:14:19,254 --> 00:14:21,085
You looked like a survivor.

107
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,917
I wasn't wrong.

108
00:14:29,397 --> 00:14:31,831
Be careful, Holly.

109
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:34,028
Don't forget what he is.

110
00:14:53,822 --> 00:14:55,983
Say something to me in French.

111
00:15:05,867 --> 00:15:08,836
Don't say what it means.

112
00:15:25,654 --> 00:15:27,417
What are you after?

113
00:15:27,455 --> 00:15:28,422
A hand job would be good.

114
00:15:28,456 --> 00:15:29,980
50, up front.

115
00:16:25,113 --> 00:16:27,445
- Hi.
- Hi.

116
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:29,279
Got a spare ciggie?

117
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:30,807
Don't smoke.

118
00:16:30,852 --> 00:16:32,342
Nobody smokes anymore.

119
00:16:32,387 --> 00:16:33,513
It's feral, eh?

120
00:16:33,555 --> 00:16:34,886
Stunts your growth.

121
00:16:34,923 --> 00:16:36,788
Puts you in an early grave.

122
00:16:36,825 --> 00:16:37,917
What's your name?

123
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:39,392
Shay.

124
00:16:39,427 --> 00:16:42,157
I'm Cindy.

125
00:16:42,197 --> 00:16:43,425
Buy me a soft serve, Shay?

126
00:16:43,465 --> 00:16:45,626
I'll pay you back.

127
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:48,135
Okay.

128
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:51,468
Can I get a soft serve,
small fries, and a Coke?

129
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:21,727
Don't flash your money around.

130
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,705
There's a lot of eyes,
and they're always watching.

131
00:17:34,282 --> 00:17:36,409
You must be starving, eh?

132
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:37,509
You want some?

133
00:17:37,552 --> 00:17:38,883
This'll fill me up.

134
00:17:39,788 --> 00:17:41,380
I'm a real sweet tooth.

135
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:45,583
Haven't seen you
around here before.

136
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:46,753
I just got here.

137
00:17:56,704 --> 00:17:58,103
Can you lend me a dollar?

138
00:17:58,139 --> 00:17:59,106
I'll pay you back.

139
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,767
I can get a smoke for a dollar.

140
00:18:05,013 --> 00:18:06,503
You're a real friend.

141
00:18:09,451 --> 00:18:11,351
Don't keep your cash
in your pocket either.

142
00:18:33,641 --> 00:18:35,233
Happy birthday, Holly.

143
00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:45,116
Come here.

144
00:18:54,929 --> 00:18:56,658
Ever felt like running away?

145
00:18:58,032 --> 00:19:00,728
Ever felt like
changing your life?

146
00:19:05,507 --> 00:19:08,476
What's your dream, Holly?

147
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,071
If you could do anything,
go anywhere, what would it be?

148
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:23,887
Before my mum died,
she took me to Paris.

149
00:19:25,994 --> 00:19:28,428
That's what I remember
about her.

150
00:19:30,465 --> 00:19:31,989
She was happy.

151
00:19:34,536 --> 00:19:36,470
I've always wanted to go back.

152
00:19:36,504 --> 00:19:37,994
Let's do it.

153
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,132
Let's go to Paris.

154
00:19:40,175 --> 00:19:42,473
I'm getting out.

155
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,308
I'm gonna disappear,
and I want you to come with me.

156
00:19:45,346 --> 00:19:47,678
Money won't be a problem.

157
00:19:47,715 --> 00:19:49,512
What about your family?

158
00:19:49,551 --> 00:19:51,382
I don't love them.

159
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:01,219
Open it.

160
00:20:12,006 --> 00:20:13,633
Put it on.

161
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:15,802
You have to.

162
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:18,979
It's bad luck otherwise.

163
00:20:24,118 --> 00:20:25,483
What?

164
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:56,009
Let's go.

165
00:23:39,514 --> 00:23:41,482
Sorry.

166
00:23:41,516 --> 00:23:43,848
It's all right.

167
00:23:43,885 --> 00:23:46,410
Look me in the eyes
and say that.

168
00:23:52,126 --> 00:23:53,855
It's all right, Michael.

169
00:23:55,463 --> 00:23:57,829
Pack your bags.

170
00:23:57,865 --> 00:24:01,028
Tomorrow I'll be rich enough
to set us free.

171
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:07,326
Monkey, be quiet.

172
00:26:09,297 --> 00:26:11,060
Fuck.

173
00:26:16,737 --> 00:26:18,671
I'll give you
the group discount.

174
00:26:18,706 --> 00:26:22,267
100 a hole, 50 a hand,
that's 350.

175
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,904
That's right boys.

176
00:26:24,946 --> 00:26:26,504
It's real too.

177
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:37,586
Fuck.

178
00:26:54,008 --> 00:26:55,100
Rocky.

179
00:26:55,142 --> 00:26:56,234
Rock.

180
00:26:56,277 --> 00:26:58,472
I got her.
You fuckin' tryin' to avoid me?

181
00:26:58,512 --> 00:26:59,638
No.

182
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,704
What the fuck
you runnin' from, then?

183
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:02,477
You fuckin' scrote.
Where's my money?

184
00:27:02,516 --> 00:27:04,643
I seen her, Rock,
stealin' Karlene's trade.

185
00:27:04,685 --> 00:27:06,710
It's my stretch,
you fuckin' slut.

186
00:27:06,754 --> 00:27:08,312
No, no, no, I wasn't.

187
00:27:08,356 --> 00:27:09,323
That's fuckin' bullshit!

188
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:10,551
Shut up, Karlene.

189
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:12,115
Thinks she's so fuckin' good.

190
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,060
Do somethin'.
Do somethin'!

191
00:27:15,096 --> 00:27:16,495
- Give us the money.
- I don't have any.

192
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,497
What the fuck did you say?

193
00:27:17,531 --> 00:27:19,055
I spent it.

194
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:26,597
See that?

195
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:28,802
See fuckin' that?

196
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:30,606
Fuckin' lying bitch.

197
00:27:30,645 --> 00:27:32,135
Listen, you fuckin' slut.

198
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:35,342
Next time, it's a hot shot.

199
00:27:35,383 --> 00:27:39,046
Stay off our fuckin' street,
or you're dead, cunt.

200
00:27:45,826 --> 00:27:48,192
You fuckin' bitch.

201
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,668
Bel, hey, it's Holly.

202
00:27:58,706 --> 00:28:00,901
Hi, are you working?

203
00:28:00,941 --> 00:28:02,704
Yeah, now.

204
00:28:02,743 --> 00:28:04,574
No, no, no,
just a couple of hours.

205
00:28:06,147 --> 00:28:07,341
Okay.

206
00:28:07,381 --> 00:28:09,679
Yeah, no, that's fine.
Bye.

207
00:28:09,717 --> 00:28:13,483
Um, well I'm swinging by yours,
like, in two minutes.

208
00:28:13,521 --> 00:28:14,681
I can come get you.

209
00:28:14,722 --> 00:28:16,087
It's good money.

210
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:20,789
Yeah, no, that's not
gonna help me, so...

211
00:28:20,828 --> 00:28:21,795
No, it's all right.

212
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:23,729
Okay, bye.

213
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:29,859
Hey, Monique, it's Holly.

214
00:28:31,105 --> 00:28:32,732
You working?

215
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:34,502
It's good money.

216
00:28:34,542 --> 00:28:36,407
Come on, Mon,
you're my last hope.

217
00:28:39,547 --> 00:28:42,243
Yeah, thanks anyway.

218
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:46,618
Dramas?

219
00:28:48,723 --> 00:28:51,191
It's the night for it.

220
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:52,886
Full moon.

221
00:28:52,927 --> 00:28:54,918
Everyone's a little crazy.

222
00:28:54,962 --> 00:28:56,793
Great.

223
00:28:56,831 --> 00:28:59,197
Maybe I can help.

224
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:01,861
Can you find me a brunette
who can fuck and suck?

225
00:29:01,902 --> 00:29:03,494
Look out!

226
00:29:03,537 --> 00:29:04,834
Fuckin' asshole!

227
00:29:04,872 --> 00:29:06,134
Why don't you watch
where you're going?

228
00:29:06,173 --> 00:29:07,401
You could've fuckin' killed me!

229
00:29:07,441 --> 00:29:09,033
You fuckin' idiot!

230
00:29:12,313 --> 00:29:14,781
She's perfect.

231
00:29:14,815 --> 00:29:17,682
Wait up.

232
00:29:17,718 --> 00:29:20,312
Hey, I'm talking to you.

233
00:29:20,354 --> 00:29:21,685
Fuck off!

234
00:29:22,723 --> 00:29:24,054
Want a job?

235
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:25,149
I said piss off, lady.

236
00:29:25,192 --> 00:29:27,524
Don't you understand English?

237
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:30,655
I need a girl right now,
and you're perfect.

238
00:29:30,698 --> 00:29:31,995
Threesome at the Hyatt.

239
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,624
Couple of hours, tops.

240
00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:37,364
It's 300.

241
00:29:40,608 --> 00:29:42,803
When was the last time
you made that much?

242
00:29:45,713 --> 00:29:47,305
Nothing weird?

243
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:49,373
Nothing weird.

244
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:50,974
Just one bloke?

245
00:29:51,018 --> 00:29:53,316
Just me and the guy.

246
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,555
$400.

247
00:30:00,628 --> 00:30:02,323
Wait.

248
00:30:02,363 --> 00:30:04,456
I need the money.

249
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:05,829
Just give me a chance.

250
00:30:20,147 --> 00:30:22,274
How old are you?

251
00:30:22,316 --> 00:30:24,079
19.

252
00:30:24,118 --> 00:30:25,813
Don't bullshit me.

253
00:30:27,188 --> 00:30:28,587
17.

254
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,123
You got anything else
to wear?

255
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:34,224
Just this.

256
00:30:35,629 --> 00:30:37,028
Put it on.

257
00:30:42,469 --> 00:30:44,437
What's your name?

258
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:45,870
Shay.

259
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:47,464
It's $300, Shay.

260
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:49,407
Okay.

261
00:30:50,277 --> 00:30:53,041
I'm Holly.

262
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,877
Let's go.

263
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,992
You okay?

264
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:11,122
Yeah.

265
00:31:11,165 --> 00:31:12,462
Nervous?

266
00:31:12,499 --> 00:31:13,466
No.

267
00:31:17,838 --> 00:31:19,635
Just follow my lead, okay?

268
00:32:53,434 --> 00:32:54,867
Better out than in.

269
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:58,704
Present company excepted.

270
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:16,917
You like that?

271
00:33:36,777 --> 00:33:41,111
When I fuck you,
when I make you come,

272
00:33:41,148 --> 00:33:44,675
I know it's all an act,

273
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:46,549
an illusion.

274
00:33:46,587 --> 00:33:49,283
It doesn't matter.

275
00:33:49,323 --> 00:33:51,814
I want the illusion.

276
00:33:51,859 --> 00:33:53,986
That's what I'm paying for.

277
00:33:55,763 --> 00:33:58,493
Just for an hour,
I've got the biggest dick...

278
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:03,227
The magic touch.

279
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:07,297
I can make you come
in under a minute.

280
00:34:15,049 --> 00:34:16,949
Prove it.

281
00:35:16,777 --> 00:35:19,075
Oh, yeah.

282
00:35:45,572 --> 00:35:47,506
Mm.

283
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,041
Yeah?

284
00:35:56,683 --> 00:35:58,150
No, no.

285
00:35:58,185 --> 00:35:59,482
You're early.

286
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,852
No problem.

287
00:36:01,889 --> 00:36:04,619
Come up.

288
00:36:04,658 --> 00:36:05,750
Fuck!

289
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:06,759
I got business.

290
00:36:06,793 --> 00:36:09,626
Get in the bathroom
and shut up.

291
00:36:09,663 --> 00:36:11,290
Take your clothes.

292
00:36:11,331 --> 00:36:12,628
Come on, move!

293
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:14,896
Move!

294
00:36:38,892 --> 00:36:39,984
Hello, Willie.

295
00:36:43,363 --> 00:36:44,625
Lovely night for it.

296
00:36:44,665 --> 00:36:48,101
Yes, top night, Mr. Bennett.

297
00:36:48,135 --> 00:36:50,933
Things went great,
I'm happy to say.

298
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:52,905
Fine.

299
00:36:58,579 --> 00:36:59,944
Well, come on.

300
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,914
Make me happy.

301
00:37:15,896 --> 00:37:17,727
They loved the gear.

302
00:37:19,132 --> 00:37:21,430
You too?
Did you love it too?

303
00:37:21,468 --> 00:37:22,662
Yeah.

304
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:24,534
I had a taste, Mr. Bennett.

305
00:37:24,571 --> 00:37:27,199
I'm not gonna deny it.

306
00:37:27,241 --> 00:37:29,106
Of course you did, Willie.
Yeah.

307
00:37:29,142 --> 00:37:31,235
A good salesman's
got to know his product.

308
00:37:31,278 --> 00:37:32,768
Here.

309
00:37:35,249 --> 00:37:37,979
You better count that.

310
00:38:04,978 --> 00:38:07,947
Do you like bowling, Willie?

311
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:09,346
Dunno.
Why?

312
00:38:14,655 --> 00:38:18,113
Because now you're
a bowling ball.

313
00:39:49,716 --> 00:39:51,809
Drive!

314
00:39:51,852 --> 00:39:53,547
<i>You've rung Holly</i>.

315
00:39:53,587 --> 00:39:55,111
<i>I'm tied up right now,</i>

316
00:39:55,155 --> 00:39:56,850
<i>but if you leave your name</i>
<i>and number, I'll call you back</i>

317
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:59,222
<i>to arrange an appointment</i>.

318
00:40:00,694 --> 00:40:02,252
Gotcha.

319
00:40:11,238 --> 00:40:12,671
Fuck.

320
00:40:12,706 --> 00:40:13,695
Fuck.

321
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:18,507
Calm down.

322
00:40:18,545 --> 00:40:20,513
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Shh.

323
00:40:20,547 --> 00:40:21,946
- He shot him in the head!
- Shut up!

324
00:40:23,316 --> 00:40:24,681
I saw it!
I saw it!

325
00:40:24,718 --> 00:40:27,243
Just calm down, all right?

326
00:40:27,287 --> 00:40:28,549
All right?

327
00:40:34,995 --> 00:40:37,987
Oh, shit.

328
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,269
What the fuck
are you looking at?

329
00:40:45,305 --> 00:40:46,272
Where to?

330
00:40:46,306 --> 00:40:48,297
Just drive.

331
00:40:51,978 --> 00:40:54,173
He knew we were there.

332
00:40:54,214 --> 00:40:55,738
He didn't see us.

333
00:40:55,782 --> 00:40:56,942
How do you know?

334
00:40:56,983 --> 00:40:59,611
You're safe.

335
00:40:59,653 --> 00:41:01,644
Oh, fuck.

336
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:24,536
Stop.

337
00:41:24,578 --> 00:41:26,045
Stop!

338
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:32,351
You don't know me.

339
00:41:32,385 --> 00:41:34,114
I don't know you.

340
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:38,880
Hey.

341
00:41:39,726 --> 00:41:42,058
Wait!

342
00:41:42,095 --> 00:41:43,562
Where to?

343
00:41:45,332 --> 00:41:47,061
Where can I take you?

344
00:41:49,102 --> 00:41:51,536
Look, give me a destination
or get out.

345
00:41:59,813 --> 00:42:01,110
You all right?

346
00:42:04,751 --> 00:42:07,481
Everyone's crazy tonight.

347
00:42:14,661 --> 00:42:16,925
What's that?

348
00:42:16,963 --> 00:42:18,726
Don't worry.

349
00:42:18,765 --> 00:42:21,757
Shh.

350
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:26,102
Can't leave him at home.

351
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:29,040
He's part of my act.

352
00:42:29,075 --> 00:42:30,804
Look, can I take you somewhere?

353
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:34,546
I'm hungry.

354
00:42:42,055 --> 00:42:44,046
How about your favorite
restaurant?

355
00:43:44,351 --> 00:43:47,718
Vegas is the place
for any serious magician.

356
00:43:47,754 --> 00:43:51,656
My old man used to say
that if you conquer Vegas,

357
00:43:51,691 --> 00:43:53,488
the world will follow.

358
00:43:53,526 --> 00:43:55,426
If you could work
at any casino,

359
00:43:55,462 --> 00:43:56,451
which one would it be?

360
00:43:56,496 --> 00:43:58,191
Caesar's.

361
00:43:58,231 --> 00:43:59,960
How come?

362
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,991
It's the coolest.

363
00:44:02,035 --> 00:44:05,232
And he played there once
on the same bill as Tom Jones.

364
00:44:05,271 --> 00:44:07,637
Who?

365
00:44:07,674 --> 00:44:09,574
Tom Jones?

366
00:44:09,609 --> 00:44:11,076
The singer.

367
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,511
Forget it.

368
00:44:19,552 --> 00:44:21,383
Your Dad sounds cool.

369
00:44:22,889 --> 00:44:25,323
Yeah, he was.

370
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:28,794
I used to watch his shows
over and over.

371
00:44:35,502 --> 00:44:37,197
My dad was magic too.

372
00:44:37,237 --> 00:44:39,569
He disappeared when I was born.

373
00:44:48,348 --> 00:44:50,179
What, you never saw him?

374
00:44:52,819 --> 00:44:54,309
I got a stepdad.

375
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:08,998
Aren't you cold?

376
00:45:09,035 --> 00:45:11,902
I left my coat at the hotel.

377
00:45:11,938 --> 00:45:13,633
Here.

378
00:45:19,913 --> 00:45:23,576
So what did you want to be
when you grew up?

379
00:45:24,751 --> 00:45:27,743
I never had a dream
or anything.

380
00:45:27,787 --> 00:45:29,448
Not like you.

381
00:45:34,027 --> 00:45:36,325
Maybe I could be your...

382
00:45:39,332 --> 00:45:41,823
Your lovely assistant.

383
00:45:51,678 --> 00:45:52,940
Hello, Holly.

384
00:45:52,979 --> 00:45:56,380
I'm Willie's friend.

385
00:45:56,416 --> 00:45:58,213
You going somewhere?

386
00:45:58,251 --> 00:46:00,242
Where's your friend?

387
00:46:00,286 --> 00:46:01,480
Willie was a greedy turd.

388
00:46:01,521 --> 00:46:02,852
He always got a double act.

389
00:46:02,889 --> 00:46:04,254
I don't know
what you're talking about.

390
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,287
That was foreplay.

391
00:46:09,329 --> 00:46:12,264
Do you want to fuck with me?

392
00:46:12,298 --> 00:46:14,994
Your friend
with the pink lipstick.

393
00:46:15,034 --> 00:46:16,001
She was from the street.

394
00:46:16,035 --> 00:46:18,128
I don't know her name.

395
00:46:18,171 --> 00:46:19,331
Wrong answer.

396
00:47:15,428 --> 00:47:20,730
Look into my eyes and listen
to the sound of my voice.

397
00:47:20,767 --> 00:47:23,531
There is nothing
but the sound of my voice

398
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:25,060
and my eyes.

399
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:30,438
I will count backwards
from five.

400
00:47:30,476 --> 00:47:33,468
When I reach one,
you will be under my spell.

401
00:47:35,348 --> 00:47:37,282
Five.

402
00:47:37,317 --> 00:47:40,309
I want you to completely
free your mind.

403
00:47:42,422 --> 00:47:44,185
Four.

404
00:47:44,224 --> 00:47:47,057
All tension flows
from your body.

405
00:47:49,863 --> 00:47:51,694
Three.

406
00:47:51,731 --> 00:47:54,393
You feel totally relaxed.

407
00:47:56,703 --> 00:47:59,069
Two.

408
00:47:59,105 --> 00:48:00,936
You're light as a feather.

409
00:48:03,943 --> 00:48:05,774
One.

410
00:48:05,812 --> 00:48:08,804
A deep sleep envelopes you.

411
00:48:21,461 --> 00:48:23,725
Can you hear me?

412
00:48:23,763 --> 00:48:25,788
Yeah.

413
00:48:25,832 --> 00:48:27,356
Tell me your name.

414
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,766
Shay Maree Ryan.

415
00:48:31,537 --> 00:48:33,437
How old are you, Shay?

416
00:48:33,473 --> 00:48:35,134
17.

417
00:48:36,776 --> 00:48:39,836
Tell me something
about yourself.

418
00:48:39,879 --> 00:48:41,870
I never forget a face.

419
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:47,815
Where are you from?

420
00:48:47,854 --> 00:48:50,584
Up north.

421
00:48:50,623 --> 00:48:53,353
Why are you here?

422
00:48:53,393 --> 00:48:55,327
Mum died, so I ran away.

423
00:48:58,698 --> 00:49:00,359
Sorry.

424
00:49:02,835 --> 00:49:04,928
Do you have a boyfriend?

425
00:49:04,971 --> 00:49:06,131
No.

426
00:49:15,615 --> 00:49:18,140
Look at me.

427
00:49:22,455 --> 00:49:24,889
You're beautiful.

428
00:49:29,963 --> 00:49:31,453
Don't.

429
00:49:42,742 --> 00:49:44,334
Can I see you again?

430
00:49:46,612 --> 00:49:49,581
Do you want to see me
or <i>see</i> me?

431
00:49:51,851 --> 00:49:52,977
I want to see you.

432
00:49:59,826 --> 00:50:01,953
"Harry the Impossible."

433
00:50:01,995 --> 00:50:04,657
Will you call?

434
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,492
I don't just hypnotize anyone,
you know.

435
00:50:12,372 --> 00:50:14,363
It wouldn't work out.

436
00:50:16,142 --> 00:50:20,010
How do you know if you don't
take a chance?

437
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,323
What's in the bag, bitch?

438
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:34,417
Hand it over,
and you won't get hurt.

439
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:35,518
You're the one'll get hurt.

440
00:50:35,561 --> 00:50:36,994
Aww teach her
some manners, Rock.

441
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:38,520
I'll teach her some fuckin'
manners, all right.

442
00:50:38,564 --> 00:50:40,327
Oh, fuck!

443
00:50:40,366 --> 00:50:41,424
My fuckin' eyes!

444
00:50:49,275 --> 00:50:51,368
My fucking head!
You bitch!

445
00:51:12,298 --> 00:51:15,392
I fuckin' hate you people.

446
00:51:15,435 --> 00:51:16,800
Open your mouth!

447
00:51:19,105 --> 00:51:21,505
Open your mouth!

448
00:51:51,471 --> 00:51:53,268
I want a room.

449
00:51:53,306 --> 00:51:55,638
$25 the half,
$30 the hour.

450
00:51:55,675 --> 00:51:58,007
Five bucks for the towel.

451
00:51:59,378 --> 00:52:02,472
No, for the...
for the night.

452
00:52:02,515 --> 00:52:04,915
80 bucks for the night.

453
00:52:10,123 --> 00:52:13,615
Room three, first floor,
end of the corridor.

454
00:52:13,659 --> 00:52:15,092
Thanks.

455
00:52:41,154 --> 00:52:47,093
<i>Whoo, oh, my God!</i>

456
00:54:45,177 --> 00:54:47,338
Hey.
Hey.

457
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:48,540
Hey, Mum.

458
00:54:56,155 --> 00:54:57,884
Don't you ever be afraid

459
00:54:57,923 --> 00:55:00,585
to take a chance, Shay,
you know?

460
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,558
We're looking for your friend.

461
00:56:16,602 --> 00:56:18,536
I don't know her.

462
00:56:18,571 --> 00:56:22,803
Yeah, but you know what she
looks like, though, don't you?

463
00:56:22,842 --> 00:56:24,434
Huh?
Don't ya?

464
00:56:24,477 --> 00:56:26,206
No.

465
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,488
Ah!

466
00:56:39,925 --> 00:56:41,586
Don't you?

467
00:56:43,596 --> 00:56:45,962
Stop, stop.

468
00:56:49,435 --> 00:56:51,062
All right.

469
00:56:51,103 --> 00:56:53,094
All right!

470
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,708
She didn't see you.

471
00:56:56,742 --> 00:56:58,733
She can't hurt you.

472
00:57:01,947 --> 00:57:04,108
You can't trust women.

473
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:07,119
Shit just fuckin' flies
out of their mouth

474
00:57:07,153 --> 00:57:08,620
without them even thinking.

475
00:57:08,654 --> 00:57:10,451
It's biological.

476
00:57:10,489 --> 00:57:12,081
It's because they got
a cunt hidden away.

477
00:57:12,124 --> 00:57:14,217
It's natural they're gonna
be hiding something.

478
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,921
With a bloke,
it's all just there, isn't it?

479
00:57:15,961 --> 00:57:17,428
What you see is what you get.

480
00:57:17,463 --> 00:57:19,158
But women are fuckin' liars.

481
00:57:19,198 --> 00:57:20,961
I fuckin' hate women.

482
00:57:23,836 --> 00:57:25,633
Start looking.

483
00:58:18,023 --> 00:58:19,752
Where's Rose?

484
00:58:19,792 --> 00:58:22,158
Don't know.

485
00:58:22,194 --> 00:58:23,855
Who are you?

486
00:58:23,896 --> 00:58:27,161
I heard you from next door.

487
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,962
Have you got anything?

488
00:58:29,001 --> 00:58:31,060
No.

489
00:58:31,103 --> 00:58:32,798
Got a smoke?

490
00:58:32,838 --> 00:58:35,432
Sorry.

491
00:58:35,474 --> 00:58:37,203
Fuck.

492
00:58:39,545 --> 00:58:41,740
What time is it?

493
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,271
It's late.

494
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:46,011
Where the fuck is she?

495
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,954
I'll get you some water.

496
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:26,418
Okay?

497
00:59:28,594 --> 00:59:30,619
Sweet.

498
00:59:35,467 --> 00:59:38,368
Here I am, baby.

499
00:59:38,404 --> 00:59:39,894
Who the fuck are you?

500
00:59:39,939 --> 00:59:41,964
She's the girl from next door.

501
00:59:42,007 --> 00:59:44,635
Well, she can fuck off,
because we're fuckin' busy.

502
00:59:44,677 --> 00:59:47,271
I was just seeing
if your friend was all right.

503
00:59:47,313 --> 00:59:49,304
He's not my friend.

504
00:59:49,348 --> 00:59:50,781
Hurry.

505
00:59:52,284 --> 00:59:54,252
Come on.

506
00:59:57,222 --> 00:59:58,689
Hurry up.

507
01:00:00,459 --> 01:00:02,723
Come on. Come on.

508
01:00:02,761 --> 01:00:04,285
Come on!

509
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:19,402
Half.

510
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:25,840
Half.

511
01:00:26,452 --> 01:00:27,441
Half!

512
01:00:34,693 --> 01:00:37,560
Fuck.

513
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:38,528
Fuck, fuck.

514
01:00:38,564 --> 01:00:39,553
The back of your hand.

515
01:00:39,598 --> 01:00:41,361
Shut up, bitch!

516
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,267
Shut up.

517
01:00:44,303 --> 01:00:45,292
Fuck!

518
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:16,925
Ooh.

519
01:01:25,277 --> 01:01:27,871
You got any money?

520
01:01:27,913 --> 01:01:29,938
No.

521
01:01:29,982 --> 01:01:31,813
Bullshit.

522
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:34,216
Cutie like you.

523
01:01:34,253 --> 01:01:36,619
Come on.

524
01:01:36,655 --> 01:01:38,452
Give us some money.

525
01:01:39,858 --> 01:01:42,019
I don't have any.

526
01:01:42,061 --> 01:01:44,222
Fuck you.

527
01:01:47,866 --> 01:01:50,357
<i>Hey, open the fucking door</i>.

528
01:01:50,402 --> 01:01:51,562
<i>Come on, sweetheart</i>.

529
01:01:51,603 --> 01:01:52,865
<i>Open the fucking door</i>.

530
01:01:52,905 --> 01:01:54,338
The welcome wagon.

531
01:01:54,373 --> 01:01:56,933
Cunts.

532
01:01:57,776 --> 01:01:59,038
That's the way it is.

533
01:01:59,078 --> 01:02:02,070
They fucked me.
Now it's your turn.

534
01:02:08,554 --> 01:02:11,045
I could tell 'em you're here.

535
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:13,354
They'd pay me for it.

536
01:02:30,576 --> 01:02:33,272
Thanks.

537
01:02:35,147 --> 01:02:37,843
Get fucked.

538
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:12,836
Hey.

539
01:04:14,413 --> 01:04:15,437
Pink lipstick.

540
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,471
Run!

541
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:05,897
Gotcha.

542
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,731
Get in!

543
01:05:38,697 --> 01:05:40,358
Are you all right?

544
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:50,034
What did he do to you?

545
01:05:52,611 --> 01:05:54,238
Police radio.

546
01:05:54,279 --> 01:05:55,610
What?

547
01:05:55,647 --> 01:05:57,444
He's a cop.

548
01:05:59,051 --> 01:06:01,679
Fuck.

549
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,553
You should go home.

550
01:06:04,589 --> 01:06:05,578
I can't.

551
01:06:05,624 --> 01:06:08,388
Somewhere else, then.

552
01:06:08,427 --> 01:06:10,418
There's nowhere else.

553
01:06:13,699 --> 01:06:15,894
I could stay with you.

554
01:06:15,934 --> 01:06:19,802
I'm going to the airport
to get on a plane out of here.

555
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:24,072
That guy'll come after me.

556
01:06:29,815 --> 01:06:32,477
I offered you a job.
No one forced you.

557
01:06:32,517 --> 01:06:34,485
You don't give a shit.

558
01:06:34,519 --> 01:06:35,918
I just saved you.

559
01:06:35,954 --> 01:06:38,479
I don't owe you anything.

560
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:43,787
You can have the car.

561
01:06:43,829 --> 01:06:44,796
I can't drive.

562
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:46,457
Get out.
Get out!

563
01:06:46,498 --> 01:06:48,159
Get out!

564
01:08:04,910 --> 01:08:06,673
Hey.

565
01:08:06,711 --> 01:08:07,803
Fuck off!

566
01:08:08,847 --> 01:08:10,280
It's Shay.

567
01:08:10,315 --> 01:08:13,148
Fully didn't recognize you.

568
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,312
Where you going?

569
01:08:17,355 --> 01:08:18,617
Nowhere.

570
01:08:18,657 --> 01:08:21,251
Can I come?

571
01:08:21,293 --> 01:08:22,624
I saw a guy get killed.

572
01:08:22,661 --> 01:08:24,492
You okay?

573
01:08:26,731 --> 01:08:28,221
I think someone's after me.

574
01:08:28,266 --> 01:08:29,927
Who's lookin' out for you?

575
01:08:32,737 --> 01:08:34,364
Rocky will help.

576
01:08:34,406 --> 01:08:35,896
He looks after me.

577
01:08:35,941 --> 01:08:36,965
He'll love you.

578
01:08:37,008 --> 01:08:38,407
Yeah.

579
01:08:38,443 --> 01:08:40,843
I'll go get him.

580
01:08:40,879 --> 01:08:43,211
Lend me some ciggie money?
I'll pay you back.

581
01:08:49,087 --> 01:08:50,918
You're a real friend.

582
01:08:50,956 --> 01:08:52,446
Don't move.

583
01:09:06,104 --> 01:09:07,537
Get in.

584
01:09:07,572 --> 01:09:09,335
I'm waiting for someone.

585
01:09:10,275 --> 01:09:12,266
Shay, get in.

586
01:09:17,816 --> 01:09:20,307
I met my first trick
on this street.

587
01:09:22,187 --> 01:09:24,519
I was so scared.

588
01:09:24,556 --> 01:09:26,387
This big old man.

589
01:09:28,627 --> 01:09:31,721
I thought he was gonna
have a heart attack on me.

590
01:09:33,598 --> 01:09:37,694
I promised myself,
before I turned 30, I'd quit,

591
01:09:37,736 --> 01:09:42,696
move to Paris,
reinvent myself.

592
01:09:43,575 --> 01:09:48,035
It's my birthday today.

593
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:52,038
I've been fucking for money
since I was 15.

594
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:54,745
I want a new life.

595
01:09:54,786 --> 01:09:58,244
There's this guy.

596
01:09:58,290 --> 01:09:59,757
He doesn't know
that I'm leaving,

597
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:02,351
and I don't want him to.

598
01:10:02,394 --> 01:10:04,157
He can help us.

599
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:08,155
Who is he?

600
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:11,067
He's a cop.

601
01:12:15,193 --> 01:12:16,558
Don't worry, ladies.

602
01:12:16,594 --> 01:12:18,892
Safe as houses here.

603
01:12:18,930 --> 01:12:19,897
Take a load off.

604
01:12:19,931 --> 01:12:22,024
This is Bob's place.

605
01:12:22,067 --> 01:12:23,728
No secrets between him and me.

606
01:12:23,768 --> 01:12:25,736
Except where the bodies
are buried.

607
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:31,532
Good one.

608
01:12:40,418 --> 01:12:42,409
- Who's this?
- Shay.

609
01:12:42,454 --> 01:12:44,285
We were on the job together.

610
01:12:44,322 --> 01:12:46,051
You see what happened?

611
01:12:46,091 --> 01:12:48,582
- He shot him in the head.
- Who shot him?

612
01:12:48,626 --> 01:12:50,025
A cop named Bennett.

613
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:51,892
He tried to kill us.

614
01:12:51,930 --> 01:12:54,125
He's after us, Michael.

615
01:12:54,165 --> 01:12:56,599
Where'd you park
his car darlin'?

616
01:12:58,303 --> 01:13:00,897
We didn't say anything
about a car.

617
01:13:06,711 --> 01:13:08,838
Gotcha.

618
01:13:11,149 --> 01:13:14,209
Mate, you got more bruises
than a Queensland banana.

619
01:13:17,255 --> 01:13:19,917
I reckon your nose looks better
on this side.

620
01:13:23,228 --> 01:13:24,490
Fonzie got busted!

621
01:13:55,994 --> 01:13:58,724
Laugh now, you fuckin' dog!

622
01:13:58,763 --> 01:14:00,822
Where's my car, cunt?

623
01:14:02,634 --> 01:14:03,726
Settle down.

624
01:14:03,768 --> 01:14:04,735
Get out of my way.

625
01:14:04,769 --> 01:14:06,293
You made enough mistakes
tonight.

626
01:14:06,337 --> 01:14:08,669
Fuckin' settle down.

627
01:14:08,706 --> 01:14:11,368
Look at my suit.

628
01:14:11,409 --> 01:14:13,240
That bitch broke
my fuckin' nose.

629
01:14:13,278 --> 01:14:15,576
- You can have the girl.
- What do you care?

630
01:14:15,613 --> 01:14:17,308
Holly's mine.

631
01:14:20,819 --> 01:14:23,344
Oh, mate.

632
01:14:23,388 --> 01:14:25,185
She's a fuckin' whore.

633
01:14:29,194 --> 01:14:31,424
She's pissing off.

634
01:14:31,463 --> 01:14:32,862
Her place was empty.

635
01:14:32,897 --> 01:14:33,886
She's coming with me.

636
01:14:33,932 --> 01:14:36,799
No, no, look at her bag.

637
01:14:36,835 --> 01:14:38,496
I saw the ticket.

638
01:14:41,206 --> 01:14:43,538
Whores only love money.

639
01:14:43,575 --> 01:14:45,509
Everything else is an act.

640
01:15:32,957 --> 01:15:34,948
<i>Back to the car</i>.

641
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:18,333
He was lying, Michael.

642
01:16:32,884 --> 01:16:35,785
I remember the first time
I saw you.

643
01:16:40,725 --> 01:16:43,193
I arrested you just so
I could hear your voice.

644
01:16:51,970 --> 01:16:53,995
I'm gonna believe you, Holly.

645
01:16:54,038 --> 01:16:57,371
We're rich enough to disappear.

646
01:16:57,408 --> 01:16:59,239
What about Shay?

647
01:16:59,277 --> 01:17:01,472
It's just you and me now.

648
01:17:01,512 --> 01:17:03,036
She's my friend.

649
01:17:05,984 --> 01:17:07,884
It's just you and me now.

650
01:17:09,554 --> 01:17:12,352
Look in my eyes and say yes.

651
01:17:20,898 --> 01:17:21,990
No.

652
01:17:25,169 --> 01:17:26,830
I can't.

653
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:32,002
Tell me it wasn't all an act.

654
01:17:33,044 --> 01:17:35,706
Police!
Police!

655
01:17:35,747 --> 01:17:36,714
Get in the car.

656
01:17:36,748 --> 01:17:38,443
Get in the car!
Move!

657
01:17:38,483 --> 01:17:40,383
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!

658
01:17:40,418 --> 01:17:41,715
Drop the fucking gun!

659
01:17:41,753 --> 01:17:43,721
Drive,
or I'll fucking kill you!

660
01:17:43,755 --> 01:17:45,848
Come on!
Step on the fucking peddle.

661
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:47,824
Come on!

662
01:17:57,669 --> 01:17:58,727
Faster!

663
01:18:04,976 --> 01:18:06,102
Come on!

664
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:10,507
Come on!

665
01:18:14,585 --> 01:18:16,075
Come on!
Faster!

666
01:18:32,704 --> 01:18:34,069
Holly.

667
01:18:34,105 --> 01:18:35,538
Okay.

668
01:18:35,573 --> 01:18:37,063
Holly.

669
01:18:49,053 --> 01:18:50,782
The case.

670
01:19:23,488 --> 01:19:25,649
It's just a scratch.

671
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:27,885
You're still beautiful.

672
01:19:29,827 --> 01:19:31,454
What time's your flight?

673
01:19:34,198 --> 01:19:36,428
I'll never make it now.

674
01:19:36,467 --> 01:19:38,526
You've got to try.

675
01:19:40,972 --> 01:19:42,064
I'll call Harry.

676
01:19:43,474 --> 01:19:45,271
Who?

677
01:19:45,309 --> 01:19:47,641
The taxi driver.

678
01:19:47,678 --> 01:19:49,543
He's also an escape artist.

679
01:20:13,905 --> 01:20:15,532
It's ringing.

680
01:20:15,573 --> 01:20:17,131
Oh my God.

681
01:20:17,175 --> 01:20:18,642
Holly?

682
01:20:20,211 --> 01:20:21,974
Holly, lie down.
Lie down.

683
01:20:25,049 --> 01:20:26,141
Just lie down.

684
01:20:32,123 --> 01:20:33,556
<i>Tenir moi</i>.

685
01:20:37,395 --> 01:20:39,295
Holly?

686
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:40,991
Holly?

687
01:20:41,032 --> 01:20:43,125
Somebody help me!

688
01:20:43,167 --> 01:20:45,727
Help me!

689
01:20:45,770 --> 01:20:47,260
Somebody help me!

690
01:20:47,305 --> 01:20:50,103
Help me!

691
01:24:40,771 --> 01:24:43,433
I usually
pull him out of a hat.

692
01:25:10,701 --> 01:25:12,601
You like me, don't you?

693
01:25:15,206 --> 01:25:17,037
Yeah.

694
01:25:26,984 --> 01:25:29,976
I want you
to make me disappear.

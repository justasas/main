So, okay, that's great.

1214
01:29:19,437 --> 01:29:20,725
Can I take this jacket off?

1215
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,223
- It itches.
- No, you can't.

1216
01:29:22,232 --> 01:29:24,100
I just want to take
another picture, all right?

1217
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:25,352
- Please?
- No.

1218
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,648
Now,
you just hold on to that.

1219
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:28,146
- Stay there. Okay, perfect.
- Oh, brother.

1222
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:34,151
Hold that.

1223
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:37,280

1226
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:42,626
<i>Can't tell on these things.</i>

1227
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:44,916
Hey, if you're gonna throw
those guns away,

1228
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:46,209
<i>can I have one?</i>

1229
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:51,134
Don't look at me.

1230
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:52,800
I mean, I don't know
where she gets that stuff.

Handsome.

1233

Maybe I could be
a nun or something.

1234
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:09,737
Ooh,
I just love these pictures.

1235
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:11,989
[BRIAN] You've only taken
about 30 of 'em.

1236
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,278
You know, we're going to need
some more film soon.

1237
01:30:13,283 --> 01:30:14,366
- Let me straighten your tie.
- Okay.

1238
01:30:15,702 --> 01:30:17,912
God, they look
like the Brady Bunch.

1239
01:30:19,497 --> 01:30:21,206
What are you waiting for?

1240
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:23,209
Can I see 'em?

1241
01:30:23,209 --> 01:30:25,043
We're waiting
for the light to change.

1242
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:26,629
We do not cross
against the light.

1243

Are you nuts,
Auntie Regina?

[SIGHS] You may as well
face the facts, Samantha.

The whole burden of civilization
has fallen upon us.

1246
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:45,265
What's that supposed to mean?

1247
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:50,278
It means we do not cross
against the light.

1248
01:30:52,405 --> 01:30:54,569
That's totally stupid!

1249
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,067
There's nobody here!

God, I'm sorry, but you shouldn't cross
against the light like that.

Hey, you guys are
survivors too, huh?

1256

- What?
- Nothin'.

Great car.

1258

Thanks, I have 23 of them.
You want to go for a ride?

1259

More than you know.

What's his name?

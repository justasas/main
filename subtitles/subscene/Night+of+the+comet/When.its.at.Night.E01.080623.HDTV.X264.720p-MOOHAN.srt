1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,010
<i> Cultural assets and individuals in this
program have been altered fictionally.</i>

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,790
<i> They have no real-life
associations with this drama.</i>

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,640
The standard for beauty
can't help but be subjective.

4
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,040
Of course there are some commonly accepted beautiful qualities.

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,900
Round shoulders, a supple and
curvy waist, and skin as smooth as silk.

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,840
But more important than these
is the impression made.

7
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:41,000
- To give off one's own personal feeling.
- Time to close the doors.

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,730
Roger.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,980
The first exhibition room is all clear.

10
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,970
The second floor art gallery is all clear.

11
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,750
The special exhibition room is all clear.

12
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,920
The rear exit is all clear.

13
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,900
What kind of impression are
you getting? Does it look beautiful?

14
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,030
Yes.

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,610
What do you think?

16
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,740
I think it looks like
a perfect, authentic item.

17
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:42,960
A perfect, authentic item...
But this is...

18
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,610
a fake.

19
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,650
Then how do you define
a real, authentic item?

20
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,040
Something that is relatively
antique? Something expensive?

21
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,020
Or something
made by a famous artisan?

22
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,550
It's not easy to find an authentic item
that is beautiful, historical and rare...

23
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:12,040
all at the same time.

24
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,040
But everyone here today is in luck.

25
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:22,620
The item I'm about to show you
is a true diamond in the rough.

26
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,640
Stop right there!

27
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:18,970
Stop!

28
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,570
Hey!

29
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,990
Ah!

30
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,580
Ah!

31
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:32,020
Grab him!

32
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,650
Go after him!

33
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,740
Hold on!

34
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,650
Ow!

35
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:54,580
Get down.

36
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,620
Aw, man...

37
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,740
Aw, man.

38
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,010
Ouch.

39
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,950
Are you manhandling me?
Are you? I'll remember your face.

40
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,840
It really hurts!

41
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,830
Good job.

42
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,580
As you can see,
the situation was handled perfectly.

43
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,760
With our museum's security system, you have absolutely nothing to worry about.

44
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:29,970
Director, the Buddha statue
has disappeared.

45
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,550
What?

46
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,980
Perfectly handled, eh?

47
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,800
That's all the time we have for
today's "Discovering Cultural Assets."

48
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,790
I'm your host Hwayoung Lee.

49
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,860
And I'm the art expert
Beomsang Kim. Good night.

50
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,890
Who are you?
Whom do you work for?

51
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,850
I'm Chohee Heo from the Cultural Heritage Administration's Cultural Assets

52
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,910
Crime Regulations Team.

53
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,860
Night After Night

54
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:17,690
<i> Episode 1</i>

55
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,630
Stay still.

56
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,670
It tickles. Do it gently.

57
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,610
Are there a lot?

58
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,700
Yeah, there are huge chunks. How
do you even manage to hear anything?

59
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,000
Oh my, oh my...

60
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,570
Gently!.

61
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,790
My neck already hurts like crazy.

62
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,790
Who told you to take those
security training exercises so seriously?

63
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,960
You're not exactly young anymore.

64
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,870
They said to do it
like it was the real deal.

65
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:56,840
Good for you. Does anyone even
notice your efforts? Will you get a raise?

66
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:03,010
As the thief, you're supposed to make everyone's life easier by getting caught.

67
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,800
At your age you don't even know how to behave properly in the public sphere?

68
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,550
Gyoon! I told you not to criticize my behavior.

69
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,630
Yes, Sis.

70
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,610
Come here. Put your
head here, it's your turn.

71
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,710
You're going to get an earful
when you get to work tomorrow.

72
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,780
Was that your first
security training exercise?

73
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,600
Were you intentionally
trying to screw us over?

74
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,790
Chief Kim, I already
apologized for her. Calm down.

75
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,030
How can I when we were embarrassed like that in front of the director?

76
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,870
And Chief Noh, your subordinate is like this because you coddle her all the time!

77
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,870
Explain yourself. Explain to me
why you caused such a ruckus!

78
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,740
I was just following
the security training guideline.

79
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,000
What?

80
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,960
Rule three of the guideline says
to try one's best in any given role...

81
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,730
to recreate a realistic situation in order to properly preempt all possible outcomes.

82
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,600
I just tried my best.

83
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,940
Hey, Chohee!

84
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,820
What? You're
quoting the guideline to me?

85
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,790
Excuse me.

86
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,820
Hello?
What? Got it.

87
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:40,550
It's a tip that Hwaja Ji
turned up in Insa-dong.

88
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,640
I'll listen to the rest
when I get back. I'm sorry.

89
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,570
Hey, hey!

90
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,710
Chief Kim...

91
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,940
"Discovering Cultural Assets," you say? That TV program is quite interesting.

92
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:09,990
The president is quite pleased
that our school is receiving attention...

93
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,020
and our image is improving
thanks to your efforts.

94
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,830
I haven't done much.
I'm just merely a lecturer.

95
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:23,930
Praising me is an insult to the professors who work so hard to advance the school.

96
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:30,800
You're way too humble
for your own good.

97
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,830
If anyone deserves an
official position here, isn't it you?

98
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,980
Not at all, Dean.
I'm nowhere near qualified enough...

99
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,750
I'm far too young and inexperienced
to take an official position here.

100
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,660
I'm not ready yet.

101
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,660
Do you really mean that?

102
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,650
Yes, I do.

103
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,640
I feel so relieved
that you said that.

104
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:04,950
The truth is, the
appointment for professorship....

105
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,720
has already gone to
your colleague, Yongchul Gong.

106
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,000
Excuse me?

107
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:22,910
[His father is a public official.
We have to consider that, don't we?]

108
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,760
So what if he's the son
of a government minister?

109
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,860
You know what
an idiot Yongchul is.

110
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,690
It makes no sense
to give him the position.

111
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,750
Oh, hello, sir.

112
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,720
It's been a while, Minju.

113
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,680
Frankly speaking, in what way
is he better than me?

114
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,630
Are either his research accomplishments or lecture evaluations better than mine?

115
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,940
Does he have anything other than
being born into the right family?

116
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,620
I'm hardworking, competent
and the students respect me.

117
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,700
So how could they choose
that scoundrel above me...

118
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,700
- Hello.
- Oh my!

119
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,950
Oh my goodness!

120
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:07,950
How could they make that
blockhead a professor? Am I wrong?

121
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,800
When someone's talking to you,
you're supposed to respond, dear friend.

122
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,920
Do you really want
to continue living like that?

123
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,890
Like what?

124
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:22,670
Pretending to be
nice, humble and cool.

125
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,870
Aren't you tired of being
the master of pretenses?

126
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,990
You're so naïve.

127
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,970
There's only one
way to fight against...

128
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:41,810
public powers that try to ruin
my bright future, like Yongchul's father.

129
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:47,740
Appearing to be an excellent,
perfect and faultless person.

130
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,890
Is there such a person?
No, hence just appearing to be.

131
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,870
That's the strategy of my life.

132
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,890
What's the use of carrying that around?
Take notes. Do you have a pen?

133
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:55,980
You're spewing
nonsense. Gotta go.

134
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,990
Hey, where are
you going? I'm not done.

135
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,690
Can you give me an autograph?

136
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:04,570
Sure. Busy, huh?
Let's talk next time! Bye.

137
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:05,820
Your name is...

138
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,900
Hwaja Ji!

139
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,040
You should leave the regulations team and join our investigations team.

140
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,590
You're so talented at catching criminals, why limit yourself to art thieves?

141
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,800
I was going to wait for you guys,
but she was getting away.

142
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,660
Isn't this better than losing her?

143
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:13,840
Besides, she's not an art thief. She's an international smuggler of cultural assets.

144
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,650
Leave the arresting to us.

145
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,710
Acting so recklessly might get
you stabbed by a scary guy like me.

146
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:26,780
See this? Got this from the right-hand man of the Bendengee crime family.

147
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,620
It hurt.

148
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:35,790
If a you get a scar like this, people will think that you went through childbirth.

149
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:40,960
Take it down a notch,
all right, Ms. Heo?

150
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,000
Her spandex outfit
yesterday was killer...

151
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,660
The security guys were drooling
and talking about getting her digits.

152
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,980
Do they know anything
about her personality?

153
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,570
If they knew,
they wouldn't say anything...

154
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:03,990
Don't take it to heart, Chohee.
They didn't mean it in a bad way.

155
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,750
Are you okay?

156
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,780
Yes.

157
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:11,940
There's a joint meeting between the regulations and investigations teams.

158
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,840
Collect the relics and go on ahead.

159
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,670
Okay.

160
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:17,730
Good job, Chohee.

161
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,600
I'm so tired, but there's
still a ton of work left.

162
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,000
Chohee!

163
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,960
Yes?

164
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,840
The Hwaja Ji problem
taken care of?

165
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,830
Yes.

166
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:48,630
This is so incredibly like her. Why catch
a criminal we've chased for over a year...

167
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,890
right when it's time
to go home for the day?

168
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:55,720
And all by herself, too.
Going to earn all the honors by herself?

169
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,560
She doesn't have
a collective mindset at all.

170
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:04,740
I don't see what's wrong? She's pretty impressive. She tries hard and does well.

171
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:11,010
So what? She loses out to you in personality, beauty and education level.

172
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,020
High school dropout versus
a person who studied abroad in Japan.

173
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:21,880
Sangho, the first time you saw Chohee you said she was totally your type.

174
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,570
Your preference in women
has changed a lot.

175
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:27,870
It changed a long time ago. In the
20th century it was the glamorous type...

176
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:30,870
but in the 21st century
it's the innocent type like Joohyun.

177
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,950
We have to prepare
for the meeting, so hurry up.

178
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,570
Yes, sir.

179
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,680
What's Chief Noh's deal?
Why does he always coddle only Chohee?

180
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,760
Isn't it obvious from the way they always leave our dinner meetings together?

181
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,650
Are you two
gossiping right now?

182
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:01,000
I absolutely hate gossip.
Excuse me.

183
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,800
Don't gossip. Joohyun!

184
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,600
Yes, sir, it's me.
I'm on my way right now.

185
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,590
Yes, yes.
I'll see you soon.

186
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:32,020
"Where there is a will, there is a way." What excellent calligraphy.

187
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,860
I heard you were punted aside
for the professorship appointment?

188
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,820
What? Oh, yes...

189
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,900
I met your school's
dean the other day.

190
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,730
When I heard Minister Gong's son
was appointed, I gave him my two cents.

191
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,740
I told him not to regret it
when some other school lures you away.

192
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:05,800
Speaking of which, what do you
think about my helping you out a bit?

193
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:16,750
Have you ever heard of the two
national treasures that disappeared?

194
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,970
Are you talking about the items
lost during the Korean War?

195
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,550
National treasure no. 372, a blue vase with a lotus-arabesque design...

196
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,950
along with no. 413, a blue-white porcelain bowl of a chrysanthemum design...

197
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:32,960
was said to be lost or destroyed during the war and removed from the official list.

198
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:39,010
There was no evidence to back the theory that the owner took the vase to Japan.

199
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,960
People continued to search fruitlessly after its removal from the list in 1962.

200
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,780
Through Hwaja Ji
who was arrested today...

201
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,900
we've verified that Ichihiro Tanaka in Japan currently possesses the vase.

202
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,040
Are you saying it's authentic?

203
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,970
That's for you to decide.

204
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,580
Ah, right.

205
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:11,000
Since the news reached the chairmen
of Dongsan Group and Hyunjae Group...

206
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,790
the chance
of it being real is high.

207
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,950
But I don't trust
anyone else other than you.

208
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:22,710
If is it authentic,
what will you do?

209
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,610
The Cultural Heritage Administration
will go and retrieve the item.

210
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:28,740
That would be like
the blind daring of a fledgling.

211
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:36,590
The criminal investigations team will go. We'll definitely bring the item back.

212
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,930
I wish we could do that, but unfortunately we don't have the right to do so.

213
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,760
Since it's private property now, international law forbids us to recover it.

214
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,920
What a loss!

215
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,810
Our objective lies elsewhere.

216
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,770
This guy joined forces
with a domestic crime organization...

217
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:59,970
the Makdae Family and one of the three great yakuza families in Japan, Ryusekai.

218
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,580
He goes back and forth between Korea and Japan, smuggling cultural assets.

219
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:09,990
Known only as Mr. Kim,
we know neither his face nor his name.

220
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:13,700
But he has been putting out
feelers in order to buy the vase...

221
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,990
and he has contacted Hwaja Ji.

222
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:19,860
I don't care about the cost,
as long as the item is authentic.

223
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,780
I want it before
someone else gets a hold of it.

224
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:31,920
Wouldn't we be able to arrest him
if we asked the Japanese police for help?

225
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,910
Just arresting
Mr. Kim is not enough.

226
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:37,770
We need to take this opportunity
to round up even the accomplices.

227
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:41,760
Our ultimate goal is to acquire a complete family tree of the smugglers...

228
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,830
who are cooperating
with the crime organizations.

229
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,020
A complete round-up, you say...

230
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:51,590
For this mission, we ask the CHA
to dispatch one officer to Japan with us.

231
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,980
It should be someone
fluent in Japanese. Then...

232
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:07,570
I recommend Chohee Heo.
Chohee, can you do it?

233
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,770
Can you do it?

234
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,950
I will try my best.

235
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,030
Hanako Suzuki will
come looking for you.

236
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:54,040
She's an antiques dealer, and apparently we're not the only ones she contacted.

237
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,810
Be careful.

238
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,820
Hanako Suzuki...

239
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,970
Welcome.

240
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:15,610
I heard Hanako Suzuki made a reservation here for me...

241
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:17,880
Your name, please.

242
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,960
Bumsang Kim.

243
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,610
Please come this way.

244
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,740
Ah, one more person
will come in the evening.

245
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,800
She's already here and waiting.

246
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,740
Already?

247
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,990
Hello. I'm Hanako Suzuki.

248
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,880
How long has she been
using the name Hanako Suzuki?

249
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:01,680
About fifteen years? But not many
people know that Hwaja Ji and...

250
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,850
the famous Japanese antiques dealer Hanako Suzuki are one and the same.

251
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:12,850
The problem is whether Hwaja Ji
gave us all the information she has.

252
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,990
Then if she left anything out,
Chohee could be in danger.

253
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,580
Our team is staking out nearby
so there shouldn't be any problems.

254
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,560
If I had known,
I would have gone instead.

255
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,850
At least then
I wouldn't be so worried.

256
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:37,010
I understand how you feel,
but Chohee is a veteran at this.

257
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:39,000
She'll do just fine,
so don't worry.

258
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,890
Yes, I agree.

259
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:51,850
By the way, you're fluent in Japanese, right? Can you help me with something?

260
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,830
Oh, fo' sure I can.

261
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,590
An important fax is going to come from Japan. Can you tell me when it arrives?

262
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,850
Yes, sir.

263
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,590
Looks totally slick.

264
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:16,610
She has an hourglass figure.
Thirty-two inches, B cup, without a doubt.

265
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,960
He looks really familiar...

266
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:37,740
I'm well aware of your reputation,
Mr. Kim, and it's an honor to meet you.

267
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,020
Do you know me?

268
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:45,800
You're so famous in this circle,
how could I not know you?

269
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:50,650
Of course I know you, you thief.'

270
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,740
What an honor.

271
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,650
The TV appearances paid off.

272
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,740
When can I see the vase?

273
00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:02,970
Excuse me?

274
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,990
I'm sorry.
I forgot momentarily...

275
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,710
Um, I heard you were
quite fluent in Korean.

276
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,760
‘Wh - what?'

277
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:23,790
Ah, Korean...
I can speak it a little.

278
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:32,760
Your Japanese is so fluent,
I mistook you for a Japanese person.

279
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,840
You flatter me.
Can I see the item today?

280
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,030
I'm sorry, but the owner
is on a business trip.

281
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:49,830
He'll be back the day after
tomorrow. I'm so very sorry.

282
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,950
Business trip?
Until the day after tomorrow?

283
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,860
Is she bluffing?'

284
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,760
Stop doubting
and accept it, you jerk.

285
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:07,010
It can't be helped. I'll just spend
the time exploring the nearby area.

286
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,990
I will be your tour guide.

287
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,030
I don't want to be a bother.

288
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,630
It's not a bother at all.

289
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:21,770
Making sure that you don't experience any discomfort is part of my job as well.

290
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:25,690
I will be your guide.

291
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:30,980
If it's all right with you, then thank you. Ah, I'll be right back.

292
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:59,690
Why does she insist on being my guide? Does she have an ulterior motive?

293
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,700
Is she interested in me?

294
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,970
Ah, my popularity
is international, isn't it?

295
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,970
I came here to work, not play.

296
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:29,740
Bumsang Kim? The guy from TV?
No wonder he looked so familiar.

297
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,850
A TV personality
is a thief as well?

298
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,690
Your jacket.

299
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,890
Just as I thought.

300
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,820
No, let me.

301
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,690
No, let me.

302
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,840
Thank you.

303
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,010
Oh, by the way...

304
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,020
Yes?

305
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,600
What perfume do you use? The scent is, how should I put it, tantalizing.

306
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,600
It's... well...

307
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,680
It's cucumber
scented soap, you jerk.

308
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,580
Mr. Kim~

309
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,620
I definitely heard it was
room seven. What happened?

310
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:39,660
A woman named Hanako
reserved it in my name.

311
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:44,780
That's correct,
but Mr. Kim is already here.

312
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,760
I'm Mr. Kim,
so whom are you talking about?

313
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,000
Let me check once more.

314
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:06,590
Ah, hello? What?
Hanako was arrested?

315
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,990
Ah, sir, I'm sorry.

316
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:16,620
I didn't realize there were two reservations made by the name of Kim.

317
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,760
Sir?

318
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:32,810
Excuse me, aren't you Mr. Bumsang Kim from "Discovering Culture Assets?"

319
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,940
You are, right?

320
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,870
Get an autograph!

321
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:37,640
Can we get an autograph?

322
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:53,950
Ah, sir, would it be too much to ask if you could come look at some pottery with us?

323
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,620
Excuse me?

324
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,740
Sure, why not?
It's not a very hard thing to do.

325
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,640
Thank you.

326
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,630
Let's go, then.

327
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,970
Thank you.

328
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,910
Hello, Chief?

329
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:30,640
Bumsang Kim? He's Mr. Kim?

330
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,800
Yes, I didn't expect Mr. Kim
to be such a famous person.

331
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,730
Be careful not to get caught
until he contacts some accomplices.

332
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,860
I don't think he has
caught on yet, so don't worry.

333
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:49,630
Ah, did you ask the owner
Ichihiro Tanaka for his cooperation?

334
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:54,910
Turns out he's part of the yakuza. And he's extremely good friends with Hanako.

335
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:01,740
So much for that. I could be in trouble
if I get caught pretending to be Hanako.

336
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:05,680
As soon as we get his picture, I'll send it to you, so try not to run into him.

337
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,750
Mr. Kim, what do you think
about this one? Is it okay?

338
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,910
Anyone with an expert eye
for pottery would know.

339
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:27,720
It's an excellent blue and white vase.
Fifty thousand dollars is far too cheap.

340
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,610
This is worth 50 thousand dollars?

341
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,700
That would be a complete rip-off.

342
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,880
A rip-off?
What are you talking about?

343
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,780
That's one of the
cheaper prices in our store.

344
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,720
The piece this man here is buying
is worth 1.5 million dollars.

345
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:52,960
A 1.5 million dollar vase...

346
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,840
Wow, that's amazing.

347
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,980
May I take a look at it?

348
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,870
I'm sure just looking at it
is not a problem.

349
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:05,850
Though I'm not sure
you'll know anything just by looking.

350
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:12,670
Koreans may be good at making pottery, but we're the expert appraisers.

351
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:20,960
Ah! Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

352
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:28,580
I'll repay the 1.5 million dollars.

353
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,030
But only if this vase
is an authentic piece of art.

354
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,780
Wh - what?

355
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,690
You manage such a huge store...

356
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:43,770
and you don't know what color the bottom of an authentic vase should be?

357
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,770
Let me explain.

358
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:52,740
It's normal for pottery
baked a long time ago...

359
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,740
to become brown without shine
and luster due to natural oxidization.

360
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:02,010
But a replica would remain a shiny,
deep brown without any changes.

361
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:06,860
This is one hundred percent fake.

362
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,880
Oh, that's cute!

363
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:31,550
<i> Chohee is a veteran at this.
She'll do just fine, so don't worry.</i>

364
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:37,940
Sure, she's a veteran.
A veteran at causing scandals.

365
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:42,020
Why isn't this fax coming?

366
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,620
You were invited
to that man's house?

367
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:58,780
Yes. He keeps insisting
that I stay a night at his house...

368
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,860
and I feel bad
repeatedly refusing.

369
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,000
Since I was just going to rest today,
it's okay, right? I'll see you tomorrow.

370
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,720
Let's go.

371
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,600
Um...

372
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,650
I'm sorry if I'm causing
an inconvenience by tagging along.

373
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,010
Not at all.
Women are always welcome.

374
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,000
Is that so?

375
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:42,990
Goodness. Why does she keep following me? Does she like me that much?

376
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:48,650
Ah, I almost forgot
to introduce myself.

377
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:50,900
My name is Ichihiro Tanaka.

378
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,760
Ichihiro Tanaka?

379
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,710
What is your name?

380
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,690
This is Hanako Suzuki.

381
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:06,920
Hanako Suzuki? An antiques dealer I know is also named Hanako Suzuki.

382
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,750
That Hanako is
an antiques dealer, too?

383
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:17,010
She's quite famous in that line of work.
You've never heard of her?

384
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:22,620
Um, you're talking about Hanako
who lives in Kyoto, right?

385
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:26,010
Oh, you know her?

386
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:32,950
Yes, I know her.
I've met her a couple of times.

387
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,960
Wasn't she very well known
at the Gogirae auction?

388
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:48,610
Hanako means "flower child." I think it fits you more than my friend Hanako.

389
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:52,640
You're very beautiful, Ms. Hanako.

390
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,670
Ah, we're here.

391
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,900
Welcome.

392
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,830
What do you mean
you're at Tanaka's house right now?

393
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,990
It sort of happened.

394
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,710
[What are you going to do if they
catch on that you're not Hanako?]

395
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,010
I fibbed that we just happen to have
the same name, so I think it's okay.

396
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:38,710
What do you mean, it's okay?
Chohee, I want you out of there now.

397
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:40,820
Leave Mr. Kim behind
if you must. Now!

398
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:46,780
I can't leave him behind.
I'll leave with him tomorrow, okay?

399
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,570
Bye, Chief.

400
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:50,700
Chohee! Chohee!

401
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,010
Chief, what happened?

402
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,760
Change of plans.

403
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:00,580
Forget the accomplices. We're going to arrest Mr. Kim first thing in the morning.

404
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,750
Officer Cho! Contact Japan and
have them stake out Tanaka's house.

405
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,820
Yes, sir.

406
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:10,810
Joohyun, sorry but can you find me
the first flight out tomorrow?

407
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,920
You're going to go yourself?

408
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,020
What's your identity?

409
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,740
You've been
deceiving me all this time?

410
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:28,570
Ha, you may have deceived me,
but you can't deceive this sword.

411
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,740
Mr. Kim?

412
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:38,900
Mr. Kim, wonderful.
It was like watching a movie.

413
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:44,820
You've just learned it now,
but your posture is very good.

414
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,570
Not at all.

415
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:54,930
Thank you for allowing me the honor of touching an authentic Masamune sword.

416
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:04,900
Now that Ms. Hanako is here,
shall we go take a look?

417
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:05,810
What?

418
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:10,640
Ah, Mr. Tanaka offered to show us
the pottery he has collected.

419
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:16,820
What if he offers to show us the national treasure, the blue vase? What do I do?

420
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:20,800
I also have in my possession
a very valuable vase.

421
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,010
It's an authentic item hard to find
even in the Korean National Museum.

422
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:27,690
You also have vases?

423
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:28,850
What kind of design...

424
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,680
Ms. Hanako!

425
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:37,690
Are you awake now?
Here, sit up.

426
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,020
I'm sorry.
It seems I've overworked you.

427
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:51,920
No. I've caused you
a lot of trouble today. I'm sorry.

428
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,970
It's fine. Mr. Tanaka said he'd show us the vase tomorrow, so get some rest tonight.

429
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:03,630
- Mr. Kim?
- Ms. Hanako?

430
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:09,600
Please, go ahead.

431
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,910
No, you first.

432
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:16,640
Ah, the thing is...
I forgot to tell you.

433
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,610
The owner wants to meet you
first thing tomorrow.

434
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:24,610
Really? What happened
to the business trip?

435
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:33,550
Ah, I'm sure there's no other reason than that he felt bad about making you wait.

436
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:37,550
Well, the sooner
I meet him, the better.

437
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,670
What were you going to say?

438
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:45,010
Ah, it wasn't very important.

439
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,880
Pleasant dreams.

440
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,870
Crazy bastard!

441
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:08,840
Ah, that last line...
was very cool.

442
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:21,990
Ha, when we make it
out of here tomorrow, you're dead.

443
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:24,010
"Pleasant dreams," my butt.

444
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:37,550
Ugh, this is so stuffy.
I was crazy to put this on. Ugh, ugh.

445
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,550
Isn't that a
Danwon Hongdo Kim original?

446
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:03,970
What is this?
They're all from Korea.

447
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:09,020
What are all these
valuable pieces doing here?

448
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,810
Now where is that vase?

449
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:21,680
Mr. Kim, Mr. Kim!
We found the item.

450
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,600
Yeah? Who has it?

451
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,570
Ichihiro Tanaka. He's a member
of the Tashiokumi yakuza family.

452
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:31,670
Tanaka?

453
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:35,960
Where does he live?

454
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,020
Figures, the vase wouldn't be
so carelessly protected.

455
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:19,880
What's wrong?

456
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,560
It's nothing. Let's go.

457
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:50,900
Dad, don't go.

458
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,830
Dad!

459
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,920
Dad, don't go.

460
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,730
Dad...

461
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,730
Don't go.

462
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:02,610
Dad!

463
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:05,860
Don't go, don't go.

464
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:11,860
Tanaka sure is a piece of work.
Thinking to put this good-luck pole here.

465
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,570
Who is it?

466
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:20,870
Maybe I shouldn't have said
that last line so soon.

467
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:28,620
I mean, after all, Hanako followed me
all the way here. Was I too indifferent?

468
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:36,000
No, no. Sometimes women are
turned off by too much attention.

469
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:42,710
There's always tomorrow.
Ah, that feels good.

470
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:56,620
Ack!

471
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:59,560
I'm sorry, ma'am!

472
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,570
What the heck am I doing?
Where did it go?

473
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:19,990
Ah, seriously!
What is this? This is crazy.

474
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,840
Oh my!

475
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:25,860
Ms. Hanako?

476
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:28,920
M - Mr. Kim?

477
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:44,690
The Japanese weather
is very hot, no?

478
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,580
Why are you in
the hot springs if it's so hot...

479
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,910
That's what I'm saying.
This is driving me crazy.

480
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:01,550
And I was going
to let things be tonight.

481
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:07,700
But if Hanako's going to throw herself at me, it wouldn't be polite to do nothing.

482
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:15,550
Look here. I know
what it is that you want.

483
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:16,680
Huh?

484
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:21,690
I know what you want.

485
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,890
Oh my!

486
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,620
- Are you okay?
- Are you crazy?

487
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,560
What do you want?
What are you trying to pull?

488
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:47,650
Crazy bastard! Psycho! Pervert!

489
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:02,990
What a crazy pervert.
Darnit, what's going on?

490
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:08,760
Wait til you're arrested tomorrow.
That'll be the end of you, Mr. Kim!

491
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:15,730
Oh my, pervert.
I can't believe it!

492
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:21,840
What? Pervert? Psycho?
Who's the psycho here?

493
00:49:22,810 --> 00:49:27,760
She's the one who followed me here because she likes me. Darnit.

494
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:36,980
Hello, thirty-two B cup,
what are you doing here?

495
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:44,890
Mr. Kim, hand that here.

496
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:02,980
Ah, what is this...
What bad luck.

497
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:09,010
And what Japanese woman buys her underwear from Korean infomercials?

498
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,020
Hold on.

499
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:21,890
Hanako Suzuki? An antiques dealer I know is also named Hanako Suzuki.

500
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:30,670
I've met her a couple of times. Wasn't she very well known at the Gogirae auction?

501
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:37,870
Hanako Suzuki.
Something smells fishy.

502
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:51,570
Right, kitty?
Do you smell it, too?

503
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,970
Chohee?

504
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:12,760
Yes, I'll get out now. Yes.

505
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,980
Why are you so startled?

506
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:28,740
I had to borrow some make-up since
I came here empty-handed yesterday.

507
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:37,570
Yesterday I was quite rude.
I'm sorry.

508
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:43,760
Well, it's not a big deal.
Let's pretend it never happened.

509
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:51,700
Thank you for understanding.
Shall we go?

510
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,920
Ah, sure.

511
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:58,900
Mr. Kim,
not that way. This way.

512
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,870
I should say goodbye
to Mr. Tanaka.

513
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:06,990
I already asked for his understanding, explaining how we're so busy and all.

514
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:11,680
Still, he even offered
to show us a very valuable vase.

515
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,660
Mr. Kim, we don't have
much time, so we should hurry.

516
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:21,040
No matter how busy we are,
shouldn't we at least take a look...

517
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,560
at the blue vase with
the lotus-arabesque design?

518
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:31,860
What?
What are you talking about?

519
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:34,820
I suggest you stop pretending
to be a Japanese woman.

520
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:39,990
Didn't you know?
The real Hanako Suzuki is Korean.

521
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,710
And according to my sources,
she was already arrested.

522
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:53,930
Then who would you be?
What is your identity?

523
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,810
Oh, Mr. Tanaka!

524
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:06,770
Trying to run off now, are we?

525
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:11,940
Did you forget that this is the home of
Tanaka, close friend of the real Hanako?

526
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:15,910
Mr. Kim! Over here!

527
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:18,040
I'll be right there!

528
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:24,550
Let's continue our talk a little later.
Come on, Ms. Fake Hanako.

529
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,590
Can't you go by yourself?

530
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:39,850
Nice crib.

531
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,980
Here we are.

532
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,960
It's quite an honor
to show the vase to you two.

533
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:35,850
This is the blue vase
with the lotus-arabesque design.

534
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:45,930
Isn't it beautiful?

535
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:47,780
Amazing.

536
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:55,810
This hue, this pattern,
it couldn't be more perfect.

537
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,560
It's perfect, isn't it?

538
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:02,850
Yes, perfectly... copied.

539
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:05,750
What?

540
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,810
This is a replica.

541
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:19,650
Boys! Your target is the antiques
dealer Tsukimoto in Kyoto.

542
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,000
Go crush him!

543
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,740
Yes, sir!

544
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:32,960
Mr. Kim, I don't know how to repay you.
If there's anything you need, tell me.

545
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:39,800
I merely told you a fake was a fake. There's no need for you to thank me.

546
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:46,610
You've helped me twice so far. If I don't repay you, I can't call myself a real man.

547
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:51,590
A true samurai repays his debt.
Anything at all I can do for you.

548
00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:54,590
Really?

549
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:55,820
Of course.

550
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,960
If you want, I can even
assassinate a person for you.

551
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,840
Is there someone you'd like
to have knocked off?

552
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,660
If that's the case...

553
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,570
I'd like to have that.

554
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,590
My Sumire?

555
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:28,930
What are you up to,
asking for the cat?

556
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:31,790
Shut your trap, Ms. Fake Hanako.

557
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:43,550
As you requested, I've packed up
all the items that Sumire uses.

558
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:52,610
This is Sumire's toothbrush,
hairbrush, and food bowl.

559
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,000
Excuse me.

560
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:04,980
A guest has been waiting
for quite a while.

561
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,880
A guest? Who?

562
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,610
He says his name is Mr. Kim.

563
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:14,670
He came here on Hanako Suzuki's introduction to look at an item.

564
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:20,620
Unfortunately, we'll have
to say our farewells now.

565
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:24,960
Mr. Kim, Ms. Hanako,
please take care.

566
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:29,990
Sumire, take care.

567
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:43,770
Then shall we continue
our conversation from earlier?

568
00:57:46,740 --> 00:57:50,650
This isn't just any item, is it?

569
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:54,740
Look at that.
You have quite an eye.

570
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,910
Please have a seat.

571
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:12,660
So you've come to see the blue vase, have you? It's a rare and good item.

572
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:17,830
I came to buy a different item.

573
00:58:25,590 --> 00:58:28,790
Is this a valuable item?

574
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:36,830
Well, it's a fairly good porcelain bowl.

575
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:39,750
Hey!

576
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,810
Mr. Tanaka,
wait a moment, please.

577
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:47,740
The blue and white porcelain bowl
with a chrysanthemum design.

578
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:52,790
The rumor that one of the lost treasures was at Mr. Tanaka's house wasn't a lie.

579
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:56,840
The problem is that it wasn't
the vase. It was this bowl.

580
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,830
So tell me.
Who are you?

581
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:10,780
Let me ask you one thing.
Are you Mr. Kim from Ryusekai?

582
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,000
What kai?

583
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,750
Ryusekai.

584
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:20,670
Dunno what that is, but I think the
Mr. Kim you're looking for is inside.

585
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:24,690
I think you're right.

586
00:59:24,690 --> 00:59:27,920
Hey, where are you going?
Tell me who you are first!

587
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:31,660
I bet she's an Aries.

588
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:40,700
Sumire, this bowl is
far too beautiful for you to eat out of.

589
00:59:44,830 --> 00:59:46,940
If you don't want to die, run.

590
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,030
What is she babbling about?

591
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,950
Get them!

592
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:16,810
Wait!

593
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:18,640
Wait!

594
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,990
Stay back.

595
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,720
Stop it!

596
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:30,850
Stay there.

597
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,810
What are you doing?

598
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:48,620
Stop!

599
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:57,730
Darnit, I guess he found out?

600
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:02,900
What the? Why are
you taking off your clothes?

601
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,960
It's hard for me
to run in this, all right?

602
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:07,570
Oh my!

603
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:09,980
What do we do?

604
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:13,790
You asked for the cat because you knew the bowl was a valuable item, didn't you?

605
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:17,650
You thief.

606
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,550
How can you just steal someone else's precious property like that?

607
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:25,760
I thought
you were giving it to me...

608
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:35,780
So, you think you're justified in trying
to walk out with an item worth millions?

609
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:45,940
Wasn't it just
the cat's food bowl to you?

610
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:48,920
Either way, it's mine.

611
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,860
You mean it's your cat's.

612
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:52,870
What?

613
01:02:55,890 --> 01:03:01,720
Everything is given a value
according to how cherished it is.

614
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:07,000
But you didn't even value
this bowl as much as the cat.

615
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,560
Isn't that why
you gave it to me for free?

616
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:14,600
That's because I didn't know
how expensive it was.

617
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,880
Look at it
from my point of view.

618
01:03:15,880 --> 01:03:19,890
That bowl is just
a dollar sign to you, isn't it?

619
01:03:20,860 --> 01:03:25,000
But to us, it isn't.
To us, it's a national treasure.

620
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:31,920
It signifies the history, the memories and the pride that our ancestors left to us.

621
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,610
Our?

622
01:03:37,930 --> 01:03:39,820
Our...

623
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:43,620
I'm talking about mankind here!

624
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:55,900
I thought the bowl was better off in the hands of someone who appreciates it...

625
01:03:55,900 --> 01:04:01,630
not a man who couldn't
even recognize its beauty.

626
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:11,000
That's why I took it without
saying anything. That's all.

627
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:24,770
Please cherish it like it deserves to be. After all, it survived hundreds of years.

628
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:38,870
Wait!

629
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,700
You can't just leave.

630
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:45,760
Give me back Sumire.

631
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,690
I'm not
taking it back for free.

632
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:04,640
Everything is given a value according
to how much it's cherished, right?

633
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:08,910
The amount that
I cherish Sumire is...

634
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:13,860
equal to this.

635
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:31,690
Are we nearly there?

636
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:32,940
Almost.

637
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:40,640
Chohee, where are you?

638
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:44,940
What do you mean
it's the wrong Mr. Kim?

639
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,020
If it's not Bumsang Kim,
then who is Mr. Kim?

640
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:50,680
Tanaka has bad manners.

641
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,030
He has a horrible temper.

642
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:53,940
I thought we were
heading to an early grave.

643
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:59,800
Excuse me a moment.
Who here is Mr. Kim?

644
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:06,040
Um... Run.

645
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,880
What's with the bad karma today?

646
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,930
I'm sorry for everything, Mr. Kim.

647
01:06:52,030 --> 01:06:54,750
Why the sudden polite tone?

648
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:58,750
What are you
going to do with the bowl?

649
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:05,650
What do you think? I'm going to
take it home and look at it every day.

650
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:08,930
I'm going to look at it
again and again until I'm sick of it.

651
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:12,780
Have you considered
donating it to the country?

652
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:15,800
Say what?

653
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:17,670
Do - nate.

654
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:18,840
Donate?

655
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:26,960
It's a cultural asset. A national treasure! Shouldn't everyone be allowed to see it?

656
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:32,590
Look here. I'm as far from
being patriotic as you can get.

657
01:07:32,590 --> 01:07:35,550
I have this philosophy.

658
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:38,750
One can't share one's lover -
it can't be shared, right?

659
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:42,750
Likewise, beauty cannot
be shared with others.

660
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:49,620
And our relationship ends here,
Ms. Hanako. Then, sayonara.

661
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:53,910
Donate, my butt.

662
01:07:55,760 --> 01:08:01,010
All right, fine. Let's see how far
that crappy philosophy gets you.

663
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:03,940
What a crappy guy.

664
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:12,680
And I had just managed
to tie it all together.

665
01:08:17,770 --> 01:08:20,610
I can't go outside
like this. Darnit.

666
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:00,560
[The number you have called...]

667
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:02,770
Why isn't he picking up?

668
01:09:03,820 --> 01:09:11,000
Hey, Jonggyu, I'm back.
I picked up something fabulous in Japan.

669
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,700
Come to my house
as soon as you get off work.

670
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:21,890
Huh, was
Brad Pitt on my flight?

671
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:35,660
<i> We love you, Bumsang Kim!</i>

672
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:37,840
<i> Let's protect and
preserve our cultural assets!!</i>

673
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:42,800
What in the world is going on?

674
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:47,590
What led to your success
in bringing it back?

675
01:09:47,590 --> 01:09:49,990
Did you have any difficulty
in bringing it back?

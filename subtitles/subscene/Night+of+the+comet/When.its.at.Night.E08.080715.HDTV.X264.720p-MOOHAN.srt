<i> Cultural assets and individuals in this
program have been altered fictionally.</i>

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,860
<i> They have no real-life
associations with this drama.</i>

3
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,190
There was an uproar seven years ago
when General Shovel stole it.

4
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:32,060
National treasure no. 238,
the “Sowonhwagaecheob.”

5
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:37,160
General Shovel... Taesoon Heo.

6
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,260
Hey, what brings you
here at this hour?

7
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,880
Let's have
a glass of wine together.

8
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:00,050
She has impeccable timing.

9
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,100
<i> Episode 8</i>

10
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:12,910
Coming over to a guy's house later
at night? You're bolder than I thought.

11
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:20,970
I thought we were dating.
If we're dating, this isn't such a big deal.

12
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,970
You're the one who ignored me
when I suggested a fake relationship.

13
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,050
Have a change of heart?

14
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,290
Not exactly...

15
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,100
If you have something to say,
spit it out. What is it?

16
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,200
You wouldn't come over at this hour just
to drink wine with me. Why'd you come?

17
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,220
If I ask you something,
can you answer me honestly?

18
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,280
That big, huh? Seeing how you're
stalling for dramatic effect and all.

19
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,240
Go ahead. I'll tell you the truth.

20
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,030
I saw you at the museum today.

21
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,940
Why did you meet Chairman Jang?

22
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,250
We're searching for
Mr. Kim and Dongpal Kim.

23
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:19,930
You guys focus on retrieving
the items from the Yeoju case.

24
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,070
Yes, sir. About Chairman Jang
from the Ohsung Group.

25
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,020
Yes?

26
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,030
Supposedly he visited
the museum today.

27
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,920
Chairman Jang did?

28
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,190
That's strange for a man
who hates being in the public eye.

29
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,110
Joohyun, are you going home?

30
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:42,950
Chohee left already, so why can't I?

31
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,010
Joohyun, we need to get going.

32
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,880
Okay. I have some business
to take care of. Goodbye.

33
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:58,980
Oh, they're gearing up for war. Looks like
they'll be pulverizing someone today.

34
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,130
Joohyun isn't that kind of person.

35
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,010
I hope she gets over
her broken heart soon.

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,100
You need to get over it first.

37
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,960
By the way, Mr. Nah, why did
Chairman Jang visit the museum?

38
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:19,010
He thought the “Bihaedangjib” was there
and wanted to see me on the side.

39
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,020
You? Why?

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,210
“Bihaedangjib.” Chairman Jang.
Can't you make the connection?

41
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,210
Don't you remember
the charity auction?

42
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:34,040
It was ruined because
I affirmed the “Bihaedangjib.”

43
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,090
Do you know how much
trouble I got into?

44
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,250
Really?

45
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:44,150
Yes. I had a hell of a time
trying to calm him down.

46
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,180
Is that so?
What a relief.

47
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,010
What do you mean, a relief?
He totally chewed me out.

48
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,320
Well, that's not
exactly what I meant...

49
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,070
To tell you the truth,
I was worried.

50
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,170
Worried about what?

51
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,880
It was Chairman Jang who sent you
to Japan to get the vase.

52
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:11,930
Who knows what else
he'd ask you to do?

53
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,020
It isn't easy saying no
to a person like him.

54
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,960
I was afraid you'd get caught up
in something like that again.

55
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,070
That's why I came to see you today.

56
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,110
Since when did you worry
about me like this?

57
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:38,280
You're right. There's certainly
no need for me to worry about you.

58
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:47,000
But I felt I needed to get involved so
you'd stop walking down the dark path.

59
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:54,190
You're a better fit with being
the CHA's advisory member, you know.

60
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,880
Well, I said what I came here for,
so I'll be going then.

61
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,140
Hey, the bottle's open,
you might as well stay and drink.

62
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,880
Drink? No, it's okay.
Don't come out. I'll go on my own.

63
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,310
No, I'll give you
a ride home. Hold on.

64
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,940
It's okay, really.

65
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:24,220
I told you before, I can't let a woman
go home alone at this hour. One sec.

66
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,930
What's that?

67
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,010
Hey, hey!

68
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,250
Do all women of the regulations team
enjoy snooping around people's houses?

69
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,890
I wasn't snooping. I was just looking.
Are you restoring something?

70
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,850
What else?
Let's go, come on.

71
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,160
I told you, it's okay.

72
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,050
This is it?

73
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,160
So this is her house.

74
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,110
Shouldn't we have called first?

75
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,100
We can't give her
the time to prepare herself.

76
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,930
That's right. It has to be a surprise attack
so we can drive her into a corner.

77
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:21,280
Dears, thank you.
I won't forget this.

78
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,870
Don't thank us.
We're doing what we have to.

79
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:30,220
We can't let Bumsang fall into
Chohee's hands. No way, absolutely not.

80
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,980
All right, then, let's go.

81
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,200
Who are you?

82
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,290
Your sister's home, right?

83
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,950
Ah, you came to see my sister?

84
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,310
He's cute.

85
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,910
Oh my, did you see him smiling?
His eyes were twinkling.

86
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,000
We'll do it ourselves.

87
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,260
I'm sorry I don't have anything
good to offer in refreshment.

88
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,870
Oh no, it's okay.
What did you say your name was?

89
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,240
Ah, my name is Gyoon Heo.

90
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,960
Gyoon...

91
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,930
Gyoon Heo who wrote
the “Dongeuibogam?" How cute.

92
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,270
That would be Joon Heo.

93
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,080
Gyoon Heo wrote
“The Tales of Honggildong.”

94
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,980
Why'd you open your big mouth?
Foot in the mouth, I tell you.

95
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,900
Dears, what are you doing?
Did you forget why we came here today?

96
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,900
That's right. What brings
you here to meet my sister?

97
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,290
See, the reason we came here is...

98
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,970
We came to congratulate Bumsang and her about their beautiful relationship...

99
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,930
sincerely from
the bottom of our hearts.

100
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,210
Mmph, mmph, that's not it.

101
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,200
We wish them eternal happiness.

102
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,980
Why would they?

103
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,940
What? They offered you
a part-time job at the CHA?

104
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,220
Have they gone off the deep end?

105
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,040
Gyoon, I'm coming home
so let's talk when I get there.

106
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,290
Why'd they invade your home?

107
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,980
Why else?

108
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,970
You started the rumor that we're dating.
How are you planning to fix this?

109
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,220
A man's word is his honor, and
there's no use crying over spilled milk.

110
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,260
We'll just break up later.

111
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,240
What, a month later?
Because of differences in personality?

112
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,030
Shall we make it men trouble? Chohee's
indecent life, something like that?

113
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,250
Ugh, let's just stop here.
I'm wasting my breath.

114
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,100
Why isn't the bus coming?

115
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:53,110
I told you I'd give you a ride home.

116
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,160
You drank.

117
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:03,140
And I don't wanna fall victim to your
humanism sham. Know what I'm sayin'?

118
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,000
That's why you have
a ton of work but no men.

119
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,070
Think what you will.

120
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,910
Chohee!

121
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,200
What?

122
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,210
What if... if...

123
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,060
If what?

124
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,020
If another item that your father stole surfaces, what are you going to do?

125
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,270
I'll try my best to recover it. Why?

126
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,950
I'm just asking.

127
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,970
Just asking?

128
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,090
Yeah, hey, bus number 431, right?
It's here. Go home then.

129
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,030
Okay, I'm going.
See you tomorrow.

130
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,200
Bye.

131
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,300
Ugh, it's so hot.

132
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,290
Officer Cho?

133
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,240
Yes?

134
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,000
Did you see Chohee?

135
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,240
My guess is she's
somewhere with Bumsang.

136
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,890
You know how it is. This is the most
passionate time of the year for couples.

137
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,900
You think that's all? After all the rumors
surrounding them, they're finally dating.

138
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,170
That's what I'm saying.

139
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:13,210
It's you.

140
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,140
The person I like is you,
not Bumsang.

141
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,910
Are they really dating?

142
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:25,050
What was that, Chief?

143
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,030
What? Oh, nothing.
By the way, Officer Cho?

144
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,280
Yes?

145
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,250
If you have some free time, can you look
into Chairman Jang's recent activities?

146
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,940
Chairman Jang?

147
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,240
Yes. You know how we got nothing
out of the charity auction raid.

148
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,330
I heard he showed up
at the museum.

149
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,190
He's not one to do things without reason,
so I want to check up on him.

150
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,220
Understood.

151
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:52,210
Hey, isn't that Joohyun?

152
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,130
I never expected to see the princess
so down in the dumps like that.

153
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:08,070
That's what im saying. She's so
lifeless these days, like a sick puppy.

154
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,950
Chohee and Bumsang shouldn't
express their affections so blatantly.

155
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,310
Chief, we'll see you later.

156
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:18,250
Okay.

157
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,020
Jingoo, let's go.

158
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:21,020
Okay.
We'll be back.

159
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:33,040
Joohyun, have you eaten?
C'mon, I'll buy you lunch.

160
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,980
I want to see you eat some.
Why aren't you eating?

161
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,150
Joohyun?

162
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:52,090
Chief, I'm so incredibly embarrassed.

163
00:12:53,210 --> 00:13:01,030
I didn't even realize that they were
dating, and I thought he was into me.

164
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,950
Can you imagine how
dumbfounded he must've been?

165
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:10,080
Joohyun, did you like him for real?

166
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,880
Does anyone pretend
to like someone else?

167
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,300
Then you should've
told him seriously how you felt.

168
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:26,010
You were always so playful that no one,
including Bumsang, took you seriously.

169
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,970
Chief, what should I do?

170
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:38,970
First things first, eat up. And go back
to how you were, cute and lively.

171
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:43,210
Everyone's worried
because you're so depressed.

172
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,280
Joohyun. Joohyun?

173
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,850
Chief, I'm such a bad person.

174
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:13,040
Now that Bumsang dumped me,
I understand how you must've felt.

175
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:20,260
You were so into me, yet all I did
was talk about Bumsang in front of you.

176
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,150
How hurt you must've been, Chief.

177
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,110
Um, Joohyun, the thing is...

178
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:37,110
I am such a cruel person.
Chief, can you ever forgive me?

179
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,050
Yeah. Why don't you eat?
Go on then.

180
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,900
Ah, it's so hot!

181
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,290
Why make us do workshops with
the shopkeepers in this sweltering heat?

182
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,120
It's a bother for both parties.

183
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,240
That's what I'm saying.

184
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,120
Chohee, you don't look tired at all.

185
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,290
Compared to working on-site,
this is nothing.

186
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:18,330
Why are you two making
such a big fuss over nothing?

187
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:20,050
Big fuss?

188
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,070
I see.

189
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:26,100
Now that you're dating Bumsang,
you've got nothing to fear?

190
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:32,070
Chohee, I'm Mr. Nah.
Your superior!

191
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,250
How dare you say
I'm making a big fuss over nothing!

192
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,340
Stealing Bumsang
from Joohyun is one thing.

193
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,270
Now you say whatever you want to your
elders? How can you change overnight?

194
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:45,120
What did I do wrong?

195
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,870
Excuse me.

196
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:56,280
I have somewhere I have to stop by first.
You two can handle the last place, right?

197
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,000
Wh - what?

198
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,200
I did most of the work until now.
So I'll leave the last one to you, okay?

199
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:12,130
She's definitely going off on
a secret date with Bumsang, isn't she?

200
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:16,890
How could they go on a date
during working hours? She's changed.

201
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,070
She's a different person.

202
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,950
- Uncle.
- Oh, hey.

203
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,220
Isn't it hot?

204
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:31,340
Thanks.

205
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,170
Snap it off, like this.

206
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:41,020
I thought you'd be all sullen,
but I was wrong.

207
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,300
Why would I be?

208
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:48,970
Congressman Lee took
the “Bihaedangjib,” didn't he?

209
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,020
When I heard,
I was angry enough to chew nails.

210
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,020
You must've felt terrible.

211
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,980
There's nothing I can do about it.
This is the line of work I chose.

212
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,270
By the way, I told Gyoon to meet us here.
I wanted us to have lunch together.

213
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:13,940
Gyoon, too? Man, I can't stay. I have
an important meeting I have to attend.

214
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,920
That's too bad.

215
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh, Chohee?

216
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,100
Yes?

217
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:26,130
More of Taesoo's items are surfacing
now the statute of limitations is ending.

218
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,950
Which items?

219
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:36,880
You know the “Sowonhwagaecheob?”
I think it's gonna make an appearance.

220
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,200
“Sowonhwagaecheob?”
Do you know who has it?

221
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:49,980
A guy who deals with the filthy rich says
that Chairman Jang seems to have it.

222
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:57,030
It seems it's a bit damaged so
he's looking for someone to restore it.

223
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,160
He's looking for
someone to restore it?

224
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:12,230
But it won't be easy. After all, it may
be a rare item, but it's also stolen.

225
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:17,320
I think I know who's doing it.
I'm sorry, I have to get going.

226
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,130
Hey, Chohee! Chohee!

227
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,150
[Chohee Heo]

228
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,020
Don't we have a meeting later?
Why in such a hurry to meet me?

229
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,920
Why did you lie to me last night?

230
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,930
What are you talking about?

231
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,860
“Sowonhwagaecheob.”
You're still going to play dumb?

232
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,980
The item you're restoring,
it's the “Sowonhwagaecheob,” right?

233
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:30,020
And that's the real reason you met
Chairman Jang at the museum. Isn't it?

234
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,280
Fine, you're right.

235
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:42,130
Let's not beat around the bush.
Report it to the police.

236
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:47,330
Restoring a stolen item is a felony.
I can't turn a blind eye when I know.

237
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,900
If you report it yourself,
you won't get into too much trouble.

238
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,210
What if I can't?
No, what if I don't want to?

239
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:59,000
Bumsang!

240
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,260
I know that the “Sowonhwagaecheob”
is an item your father stole.

241
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,150
I know you want to get it back
like the “Bihaedangjib.”

242
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,920
That's why I didn't feel comfortable
with Chairman Jang's request.

243
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,870
Then you should have refused.

244
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:23,330
Did he offer you a professorship?
Is that why you couldn't say no?

245
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,950
Why do you live your life like that?
You don't have to live the way you do.

246
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:37,340
What's wrong with the way I live my life?
Turn me in if you want to.

247
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:44,010
But keep this in mind. I'm not living my
life by cheating or trampling on others.

248
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:49,130
I'm just working with people
who realize and need my abilities.

249
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:52,960
I never once thought
that was so incredibly wrong.

250
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,890
I'm leaving.

251
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,130
Bumsang, remember this.

252
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:08,880
I don't intend to turn you in.
But you shouldn't live like this.

253
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,270
I think that you absolutely shouldn't.

254
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:18,120
It's true that no one can live life without
dirtying their hands at least once.

255
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:24,980
Compromising oneself to get what
one wants isn't necessarily a bad thing.

256
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:31,960
But you know what?
A sin is still a sin.

257
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:38,930
No matter what anyone says,
that's what I think.

258
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,270
Ugh, so hot.

259
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,220
What are we eating later?
Let's eat cow intestine, okay?

260
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,210
How can you be thinking about dinner?
Joohyun's in so much pain...

261
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,060
Why didn't Chohee
make it to the meeting?

262
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,010
It's strange. She never misses
a meeting if she can help it.

263
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,890
- Did something happen?
- Do you think...

264
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,330
They already got into a couple's tiff?

265
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,060
You're being a little too blunt.
Come on, let's go.

266
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,030
Definitely too blunt.

267
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,320
What did I say?

268
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:18,080
They're always like that. Just let
their comments slide off your back.

269
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,920
Don't worry about me.

270
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,940
Bumsang, I'm sorry we couldn't
provide protective custody for you.

271
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,070
What?

272
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:28,150
We should have used
a couple of men to protect you.

273
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,300
But the procedure for approval is very
particular and its options are limited.

274
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,190
It's fine. No need to worry.

275
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,160
Thank you for being so understanding.

276
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,180
You're going to dinner, right?

277
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,150
I have something
to take care of at home.

278
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,860
Then let's have a drink next time.

279
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,190
Sure. Goodbye then.

280
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,210
What is it you wish to say to me?

281
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:56,060
The “Sowonhwagaecheob”
is a stolen national treasure.

282
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,850
As I'm sure you already know.

283
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,290
I'm sure it's not easy for you
to own a stolen good...

284
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,910
so why don't you take this
opportunity to do something good?

285
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:09,140
You want me to
donate it to the country?

286
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,140
Yes.

287
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,200
You're quite a bold woman.
What if I refuse?

288
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,030
Then I have no other option but to take
care of the matter according to the law.

289
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:28,030
You'll be charged for possession of
a stolen good, Bumsang for restoration.

290
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:33,910
And since it's a national treasure,
it won't be a light sentence.

291
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:43,080
So the reason you came to me first
is out of consideration for Bumsang?

292
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,100
As I'm sure you already know,
he's a person with a valuable talent.

293
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:57,940
If you make the right decision,
everything can end without a fuss.

294
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:05,290
Sir, please cherish people as much
as you cherish your possessions.

295
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,240
I entreat you.

296
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:16,180
I'm sorry, but I'll have to refuse. If things
go public, he'll be the one hurt, not me.

297
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,940
It seems you're the one
who has to make a decision.

298
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,870
Did I leave the cover open?

299
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,150
What the...

300
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,960
What in the world?
How could this happen?

301
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,330
What now?
What do I do?

302
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,170
Shouldn't you tell Chairman Jang?

303
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,130
You don't know what he's like?

304
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:58,070
He won't believe that it was stolen
and he won't just let this slide.

305
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,330
Did you call the police?

306
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:05,240
The “Sowonhwagaecheob” is a national
treasure. A stolen national treasure!

307
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,110
You don't know what'll happen
if I involve the police?

308
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:13,860
What are you going to do? Who could have taken it? Have any theories?

309
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:17,890
None.
Ah, I don't know.

310
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,340
Chohee Heo.

311
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:28,110
The item you're restoring,
it's the “Sowonhwagaecheob,” right?

312
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:31,980
Let's not beat around the bush.
Report it to the police.

313
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,110
Why didn't Chohee
make it to the meeting?

314
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:38,260
She never misses
a meeting if she can help it.

315
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,240
Hey! What are you saying?
What about Chohee?

316
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,060
Hey!

317
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:51,940
It's you, isn't it?
You took it?

318
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,160
You're the only one it could be.
Where did you hide it?

319
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:01,050
Bumsang, what are you
talking about? I took what?

320
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,130
You're going to play dumb?

321
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,050
Fine.

322
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,270
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

323
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,100
Bumsang!

324
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,280
Hey!

325
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,950
What are you doing?
What do you think you're doing?

326
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,020
The “Sowonhwagaecheob.”
You really don't know?

327
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:29,900
What?

328
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:34,060
Only you and Chairman Jang knew
I had it. Where did you hide it?

329
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:37,130
You lost it?

330
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,990
Lost it?

331
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,930
Fine, where were you during
the meeting? After fighting with me?

332
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,100
Can't tell me?

333
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,120
I was...

334
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,880
Anyway, it wasn't me.
I didn't steal it.

335
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,210
Don't lie. It has to be you.
You're the only one!

336
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,960
Sis, I...

337
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:18,280
Oh wow, sorry. Sis, I'm sorry.
Sir, I'm sorry.

338
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,290
This house really needs a doorbell.
Please continue.

339
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:32,880
I'll give you until tomorrow
to put it back. If not, I'll...

340
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,110
I don't know what I'll do.

341
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:55,870
Sis, I'm really sorry.
I ruined the mood, didn't I?

342
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,260
But he's quite the indiscreet person.

343
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,240
Sis, did something happen?

344
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,910
No, it's nothing.

345
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,940
That bastard!

346
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,990
Man... Now she's
haunting me in my dreams.

347
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,220
[Chairman Jang]

348
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,130
Yes, sir.

349
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,120
Good work.

350
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:33,090
Chohee, why are you so out of it?

351
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,030
Should I move this?

352
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,120
First check the inventory
to see if we're missing anything.

353
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,130
Hey, Sangho!
Who made this pile? Did you?

354
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,990
Do it again, okay?

355
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,010
Chohee!

356
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:16,880
Chief.

357
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,000
You were avoiding me
just now, weren't you?

358
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:24,160
No. I have to
organize the things here.

359
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,280
If you avoid me like that,
I'll feel apologetic towards you.

360
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,150
Can't we try to be more
comfortable with each other?

361
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:39,950
Frankly speaking,
I think that'll be a little hard.

362
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,910
I was never fully comfortable
with you in the past either.

363
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:53,100
And the reason I'm avoiding you is
I end up lying to you against my wishes.

364
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:55,870
So I'm ashamed of myself...

365
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,130
But there's no need
for you to feel sorry.

366
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:13,110
Man, after seeing your expression,
I'll take back everything I said.

367
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,300
Let's try to be more
comfortable with each other.

368
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:20,100
I practically twisted your arm.

369
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,880
It's okay if you do.

370
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,940
Chohee, don't bum around
and help us out here.

371
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,280
I should get back to work...

372
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:42,110
You're not done with the restoration?
You said you could do it quickly.

373
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,970
It seems I'll need
a little more time.

374
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,880
I guess it can't be helped.
Is a week enough time?

375
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,940
Yes.

376
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,310
By the way, it seems you know
a very interesting woman.

377
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,320
Excuse me?

378
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,090
Yesterday afternoon Chohee Heo
from the CHA came to see me.

379
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,940
She asked me to donate the
“Sowonhwagaecheob” to the country.

380
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:22,040
And she advised me to cherish you
and not just my possessions.

381
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,960
She was a very bold woman.

382
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:38,930
'Anyway, it wasn't me.
I didn't steal it.'

383
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:43,340
It really wasn't her.
Then who in the world...

384
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,220
Yes, Mr. Nah. What's up?

385
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:56,220
What? Chohee got hurt?

386
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:01,280
Which hospital is it?
Okay, I'm headed there.

387
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:18,940
For Chohee of all people to be in the
hospital, it certainly doesn't feel right.

388
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:23,030
I know what you mean. She's most like
herself when she's working her butt off.

389
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,890
With the up comes the down.

390
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:29,090
She found herself a boyfriend
and was going on dates.

391
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,300
Then something like this happens.

392
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:35,910
It's so sad, it really is.

393
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,110
Did you contact Bumsang?

394
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,080
Yeah.

395
00:34:40,970 --> 00:34:49,090
But I don't think he'll be happy that
she hurt herself saving another man.

396
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,870
He'll be pissed.

397
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:54,230
Chief!

398
00:34:56,150 --> 00:35:00,080
I'm worried that Chohee's
hurt worse than we presumed.

399
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,980
She'll have to stay
in the hospital for a while.

400
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,200
This isn't good.

401
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,100
For the time being, you two
will have to juggle her duties. Okay?

402
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,970
Yes, sir.

403
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:14,080
Then let's go home.

404
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,300
Get Joohyun to do some of the work.
I'm not doing anymore.

405
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,150
I can't tell Joohyun to do more work.

406
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,320
Then you do it.

407
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,050
Fine, I'll do it.

408
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,100
Chief.

409
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:52,080
Oh, how are you feeling?

410
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,140
Lie back down.

411
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,210
I'm sorry.

412
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,230
Are you okay?

413
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:10,980
That's a relief.

414
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,970
I'm sorry you're hurt
because of me, Chohee.

415
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,250
Please don't be.

416
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:32,180
At a time like this just say,
“Thanks, Chohee.”

417
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,150
Thanks, Chohee.

418
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:56,990
I'll stop by whenever I have time
tomorrow, so take care of your body.

419
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,920
Take care of her body? Sounds like he's
talking to a woman who just had a baby.

420
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,070
Maybe I'm biased
because he has a kid already?

421
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:07,970
I'm fine. Please
don't worry about me, Chief.

422
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:12,300
“Please don't worry about me, Chief.” What's with her?

423
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:19,010
I'll be leaving then. Lil' bro, you're going
to stay here with her, right?

424
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:23,890
Of course. Do you realize you've been
saying you'd leave for thirty minutes?

425
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,980
Gyoon, why are you being so rude?

426
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:31,330
No, it's okay.
I'm really leaving. Get some rest.

427
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,330
Okay, goodbye, Chief.

428
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,300
Yeah.

429
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,250
Are you really leaving?

430
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,090
Yup.

431
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,160
Then I'll walk you out.

432
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:42,150
Sis, I'll be right back.

433
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,220
Let's go.

434
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,310
Bumsang.

435
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,310
- Hey.
- The “Sowonhwagae...”

436
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,300
You first.

437
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,170
No, you first.

438
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,870
Is your arm all right?

439
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:30,040
It hurts a little,
but nothing I can't handle.

440
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:37,150
Did you find
the “Sowonhwagaecheob?”

441
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,020
No, not yet.

442
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,190
What are you going to do?

443
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,160
Won't youl get into big trouble
if Chairman Jang finds out?

444
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,000
Probably.

445
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,070
I wonder who took it.

446
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:03,110
Why didn't you tell me
you went to see Chairman Jang?

447
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:11,100
How could you say nothing
when I was making you out to be thief?

448
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:19,330
Have you ever been
accused of being a thief?

449
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,310
When I was younger, whenever
something disappeared at school...

450
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,310
they pointed fingers at me.

451
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,330
All because of my father.

452
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:36,140
No matter how much I said
I didn't do it, no one believed me...

453
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:40,200
until they could see
the missing item for themselves.

454
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,230
If the person is not ready to believe,
it's no use defending myself.

455
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:54,060
Do you believe me now?

456
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,070
I'm sorry.

457
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,220
You know how to apologize.

458
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:09,320
Yeah, and I also know how to
slice apples. Where's the knife?

459
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,300
How rude!

460
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,870
I'll accept your apology.

461
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:24,000
Hey, you need to wash it first!

462
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,940
A little dirt won't kill me.

463
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:36,210
Chief, we'll be back later.

464
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:38,920
Okay, but where are you going?

465
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,140
We're definitely
not going to the sauna.

466
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,310
We're on our way to Madam Oh's bar
to track Dongpal Kim down.

467
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:50,100
We're definitely not going there to see
Ms. Kim who works there. So he says.

468
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,980
Please call me as soon as
you find out anything.

469
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:58,880
Yes, sir. By the way, Chief,
about Chairman Jang.

470
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,220
Yes?

471
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:04,920
He cleaned up after the charity auction
so well that there are no scraps at all.

472
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,120
Yeah, the tracks
are completely spotless.

473
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:16,080
There's a rumor he'll release an item,
but the underlings won't spill anything.

474
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,280
Let's keep an eye on him.
He'll make a mistake one day.

475
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,940
Is that all?

476
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:29,310
Oh, and it's not very important,
but about the vase at Tanaka's house.

477
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,030
Yes, what about it?

478
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:35,340
I don't know what got into Chairman
Jang, but apparently he really wants it.

479
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,860
He even sent someone
to Japan to get it for him.

480
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,060
Officer Cho, wasn't that vase
determined to be a fake?

481
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:45,170
Was it?
Anyway, we'll be off then.

482
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,090
Okay.

483
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:48,040
Jingoo, let's go to see Ms. Kim.

484
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,260
We'll be back later.

485
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,060
So Chairman Jang
sent someone to Japan?

486
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,860
I know it's not an easy thing to ask,
but please look into it, okay?

487
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,190
I'll try, but I can't
guarantee anything.

488
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,190
That's why I'm asking you.
I'm counting on you, okay?

489
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,090
Okay.

490
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,080
Hey.

491
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:46,060
The food doesn't look too appetizing.

492
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:50,000
There you go, finding fault
in everything. Did you eat?

493
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,120
Not hungry.
Did Chief Kang stop by?

494
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,230
Yeah. He came yesterday.

495
00:42:56,230 --> 00:43:00,960
The least he can do is nurse you all
night, and he didn't even drop by today?

496
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,960
Hey, Chief Kang's a busy person.

497
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,330
Why are you
looking at me like that?

498
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,270
You like him that much?

499
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:13,170
There you go again. Goodness...

500
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,920
How's the search for
the “Sowonhwagaecheob” going?

501
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:25,020
I understand you're anxious about it, but
consider my feelings and stop asking.

502
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:30,080
Bumsang, that's hurtful.

503
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:31,870
What is?

504
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:38,330
It's true that I'm curious about it
since it's an item my father stole.

505
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:40,900
But I'm also worried about you.

506
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:47,890
I'm not trying to take credit
or anything, but I do feel upset.

507
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:54,980
Hey, hey, there's no reason to feel upset.
Here, have a quail egg and cheer up.

508
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:57,920
I'm being nice so take it already.

509
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,870
Why are you acting out
of character? I don't want it.

510
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,250
Let me ask you something.

511
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,870
What?

512
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:17,080
Is there another reason behind your
quest to retrieve all your father's items?

513
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:24,850
It's because I'm
self-conscious and selfish.

514
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:34,320
The last time I saw him, I told him
that if he doesn't return everything...

515
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,920
I'll never see him again.

516
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:46,120
That I'll never forgive him. To go plead
forgiveness to my dead mother.

517
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:54,960
And I haven't seen him since.

518
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:07,330
Sometimes I can't help but think that he
can't come home because I said all that.

519
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:16,300
If I put everything back where they
belong, maybe he'll come home then.

520
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,120
Something like that.

521
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,870
That's nonsense, you know.

522
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:23,330
It is, isn't it?
It's complete nonsense.

523
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:32,160
I'm not repaying my father's debts.
I'm not so filial or patriotic.

524
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:39,150
I want my conscience to be at peace.
I'm looking for them to live in peace.

525
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,960
Man, you're being complicated.

526
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:48,990
Bottom line is you miss your father.
You hope that he's alive.

527
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:57,970
He's alive. If you get all the items back,
he'll come back. Believe in that.

528
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,250
Here's some grilled beef.

529
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,930
Bumsang.

530
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:14,160
Oh, hello.

531
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,090
Hi. How's Chohee?

532
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:19,220
She just fell asleep.

533
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:21,320
I guess I came too late.

534
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,070
Go on in. She was
waiting for you all day.

535
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:26,340
I'll be going then.

536
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:32,070
Bumsang, you want to
go grab a drink with me?

537
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:36,940
Let me pour you a drink.

538
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:55,030
This line of work usually runs
in the family. Is that your reason?

539
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:58,960
Close enough.
My grandfather is a potter.

540
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,070
I see.

541
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:08,930
He must be proud of you. To be a
famous art expert at such a young age.

542
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,220
That's not necessarily true.

543
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:15,040
What about you? Did you start off
in the cultural assets unit?

544
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,320
No, I started off in
the violent crimes unit.

545
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:24,160
But I haven't left since I joined the
investigations team seven years ago.

546
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,100
You have an aptitude for it?

547
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:33,880
Not necessarily, but I do like it.
I'm lucky to be doing work that I enjoy.

548
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:38,010
Of course, it's a great blessing
to be able to do work that you enjoy.

549
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:44,960
But sometimes in this line of work,
there are unfortunate situations.

550
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:56,060
Young and talented people like you
deal with stolen goods or restore them.

551
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:02,860
I hope you don't do
anything illegal like that.

552
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:08,230
I don't really like
the phrase “stolen goods.”

553
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:12,090
What do you mean?

554
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:19,000
To someone with your job, it's important
whether or not an item is stolen.

555
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:22,930
But to someone who does
restoration work like me...

556
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:27,900
cultural assets are patients
in need of a doctor's care.

557
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:35,020
A doctor shouldn't discriminate against
patients dying in front of their very eyes.

558
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:36,330
My work is the same.

559
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:42,120
When there's a cultural asset before me,
it's not that important if it's stolen or not.

560
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:48,230
Am I right to assume that you'll do
restoration work for stolen goods?

561
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:51,220
A cultural asset is just that.

562
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:56,220
I'm saying that theoretically using
“stolen goods” to describe it is wrong.

563
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,990
That's an extremely
sophistic take on things.

564
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:05,200
Please consider it the worthless
philosophy that a man has of his job.

565
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:13,210
Bumsang, the more I get to know you,
the more intriguing you are.

566
00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:16,960
The same goes for you. Cheers!

567
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:26,100
Thank you for the meal, Chief.

568
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:30,940
You're welcome. I want to go for
another round, but I have to hurry home.

569
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:34,040
I heard you have a daughter.
Her name is...

570
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:36,120
Jiyoon.

571
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,890
Jiyoon. Jiyoon Kang.
What a pretty name.

572
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,030
The girl is prettier than the name.

573
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:46,000
I'm a fool when it comes to my kid.

574
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:51,970
By the way, is the investigations team
still investigating General Shovel?

575
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,120
General Shovel?

576
00:49:54,120 --> 00:50:00,010
I told you before that he hasn't been
active in years. Most consider him dead.

577
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:03,120
So you're saying he could be alive.

578
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,990
I guess. But why bring up
General Shovel all of a sudden?

579
00:50:08,870 --> 00:50:13,020
I was just curious because
he's such a legendary art thief.

580
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:16,320
You should get going.
Jiyoon must be waiting.

581
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,100
Okay. Bumsang, let's have
another drink next time.

582
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,230
Sure.

583
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,210
Jeez, I forgot...

584
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:00,220
Goodness, something will
fly right into her mouth.

585
00:51:56,110 --> 00:52:00,240
'You said that a fake with memories
is the same as being authentic...

586
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,980
but this art expert thinks otherwise.'

587
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:07,220
'The line remains drawn between
what's fake and what's authentic.'

588
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:10,940
'This is an authentic Goryeo
celadon porcelain set...

589
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,940
though it's only worth thirty bucks.'

590
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:21,900
'I give this as a gift to you, your brother and the father you believe will return.'

591
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:35,260
I've asked all my superiors to look
around, but I've come up with nothing.

592
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:38,170
You didn't mention me, did you?

593
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:42,860
Of course not. I'm searching in roundabout ways so don't worry.

594
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,990
Okay, thanks.

595
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:48,040
No problem.
Hey, is Chohee still in the hospital?

596
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,290
She has to stay a few more days.

597
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:54,190
Oh yeah? Maybe I'll go visit her later
with a bouquet of flowers.

598
00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:57,950
Hey, why would you go visit her?

599
00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:00,960
And why are you calling her
by her first name? It's insulting.

600
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,040
What the? You're being weird.

601
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,870
I'm calling her Chohee ‘cause that's her
name. So why do you feel insulted?

602
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:09,970
That was quite a curious reaction.

603
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:13,890
What's curious?
I'm saying Chohee will feel insulted.

604
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,180
Hey, I have to get going.

605
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:16,940
Where are you going today?

606
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:19,150
I'm following the
investigations team today.

607
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:23,120
The art thief Mr. Kim is after me so
I want to be there when they catch him.

608
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,130
Bumsang, how have you been behaving
at the CHA to be targeted already?

609
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:29,020
That's what I'm saying.

610
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,310
There must be something huge
happening if they didn't even notice you.

611
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,270
Call me if you hear anything, okay?

612
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:42,180
Okay.

613
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,960
Do we really have to go out
when it's this hot?

614
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,010
Stop talking if you're clueless.

615
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:50,960
Stop fighting, stop fighting.

616
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,080
I'm sorry. Did you wait long?

617
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:58,180
You have your hands full with your love
life. Why do you want to come with us?

618
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:02,190
Oh, I enjoy on-site work very much.
Officer Cho, you know, right?

619
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:05,310
And how can I sit out
when you're going after Mr. Kim?

620
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:07,860
This is odd.

621
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:11,250
We thought you forgot us all since
you're always nursing your girlfriend.

622
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:14,170
There's a rumor that you set up
a living at the hospital.

623
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:18,870
Bumsang, you're really
planning on going with us?

624
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,090
We might not make it back
to Seoul tonight.

625
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:27,010
Don't worry, I'll be fine.
A man can't go back on his word.

626
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:30,070
One moment, please.

627
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,990
Yes, yes, sir.

628
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,020
I'm sorry. Something came up,
and I have to get going.

629
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,240
Look here.

630
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:44,190
What the.
He totally went back on his word.

631
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:49,990
If he weren't so glib, I wouldn't feel
so insulted. He is way too slick.

632
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:53,940
That's what I'm saying.
He's definitely running off to Chohee.

633
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:58,920
Let them be. It's the best time of their
relationship, so cut them some slack.

634
00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:03,070
Poor Joohyun is the one left in the dust. My poor Joohyun...

635
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,940
Yes, Chief.

636
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,020
What did you say?

637
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,250
At the museum?

638
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:35,150
Were you surprised that
I suddenly asked you to come?

639
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,230
No.

640
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:40,330
I can tell that you were
considerably surprised.

641
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:44,140
Why did you call me?

642
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:48,980
How much longer do I have to wait
for the “Sowonhwagaecheob?”

643
00:55:50,110 --> 00:55:55,080
Just a couple more days,
and you can see it again.

644
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,950
A couple of days, you say?

645
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:09,240
Why are you sitting up?

646
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:13,090
I told you to rest at home. Why are
you here so early in the morning?

647
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:18,340
Why else? My only sister is laid up in the
hospital, so how can I enjoy being alone?

648
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:21,920
What is this?

649
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,110
This? A Goryeo celadon porcelain set.

650
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:28,910
It's authentic?
Where did you get it?

651
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,160
Was it Bro?

652
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:37,230
Who are you calling “Bro?” I'd better
not catch you saying that again.

653
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:44,100
To not be able to call my brother-in-law
by his proper title... What a sad fate.

654
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:47,060
Oh ho, now you're ducking my hits?

655
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:48,920
You wanna die?

656
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,240
So Bro is...

657
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,900
“Bro” again!

658
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,050
Mr. Bumsang Kim is
our nation's best art expert.

659
00:56:57,050 --> 00:57:00,860
So this must be incredibly rare.
How much is it worth?

660
00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:02,340
Thirty bucks.

661
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,980
Thirty bucks?

662
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:08,190
There's a Goryeo celadon
porcelain set worth thirty bucks?

663
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:14,130
Oh, I nearly forgot. I was going
to watch some baseball today.

664
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,200
So the restoration will be
complete in a couple of days?

665
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,230
Yes, sir.

666
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:26,070
You don't watch
much television, do you?

667
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:27,980
Excuse me?

668
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:32,160
Everyone's in a frenzy today about it,
but apparently you missed it?

669
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:40,320
National treasure no. 238, the
“Sowonhwagaecheob,” stolen in 2001...

670
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,240
has returned to the museum
after seven long years.

671
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:47,340
An anonymous donor has returned
the “Sowonhwagaecheob” to the people.

672
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,020
[The unidentified donor
used a delivery service...]

673
00:57:55,290 --> 00:57:58,310
Hey, Gyoon.
Go back to that just now.

674
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,280
What?

675
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,250
[...Prince Ahnpyeong's handwriting.]

676
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:06,320
[With a width of 16.5cm
and a length of 26.5cm...]

<i>Episode 13</i>

4
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,930
Chief Kang.

5
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:32,960
Chief.

6
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,920
What happened?Was it really
Taesoo's remains found at the site?

7
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,030
Is it Taesoo?

8
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:44,160
Yes, it seems certain.

9
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,050
We'll need further examination
to figure out the cause or time of death.

10
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:00,350
How... could this happen...

11
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,350
Did you call Chohee?

12
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,280
No, I couldn't.

13
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,370
I should call her now,
but I'm not sure how to tell her.

14
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,140
You're meeting your father for the first
time in seven years with a band-aid?

15
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,300
How clumsy.

16
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,910
You're that excited?

17
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,010
I'm a bit antsy and nervous and stuff.

18
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,140
Everything will be fine, right?

19
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,340
Of course. Congratulations.

20
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:51,910
You're congratulating me
when I haven't even met him yet?

21
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,940
What should I do?
The food's getting cold.

22
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,240
Should I clear the table?

23
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,230
Yes, Chief.

24
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:20,930
Daddy, don't leave. Daddy!

25
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,040
This is the last time.
It really is.

26
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,970
Dad! Dad!

27
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,990
Give these back!

28
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:34,210
Hey, Chohee. Chohee,
this is the last time, okay?

29
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,950
I'm serious. So won't you
forgive me this once?

30
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,220
I don't want to find him at all.
I don't care if he's dead or alive.

31
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:47,320
If he's alive, I'll catch him myself.

32
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:58,220
Chohee, don't worry.
I'll come back. I promise I will.

33
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,150
‘I have a wish that
I cannot speak aloud to anyone.'

34
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,980
‘It's okay if he never
comes back to see us.'

35
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,260
‘Please, I just want him to be alive.'

36
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,220
‘Please just let him be alive.'

37
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,310
Chief, where's Dad?

38
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:25,980
Chohee.

39
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:33,300
Chief, it's not true, right?

40
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,330
Chief, it's not true, right?
Dad's not dead. Right?

41
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:45,200
Chief... Please tell me
that Dad isn't dead. Please?

42
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:57,250
Chohee, I know you don't want
to believe it, but Taesoo is dead.

43
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:08,910
It's not true, Chief. It can't be true.
Why would he be dead?

44
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,000
Bumsang, you tell me.

45
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,380
My dad isn't dead.
You said he wasn't dead.

46
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,270
He's not dead.
Chief, he's not.

47
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,160
Dad, how could you leave like this?

48
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:17,070
Are you and Gyoon okay
with going on your own?

49
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:23,170
Of course. That's why I didn't let
Uncle Hwang or Chief come.

50
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,150
Is that why Bumsang isn't here?

51
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,220
I'm not sure.
I haven't seen him all day.

52
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
I see.

53
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:38,380
Um, Chief? Stop worrying
about me and go home.

54
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,210
Chohee.

55
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,390
It's enough that you stayed up
with me for several nights.

56
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:56,190
I want us three to be together for
the last time. Just Dad, Gyoon and me.

57
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:05,020
Chief, we'll be going then.

58
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,280
Chohee, don't forget that
everyone's worried about you.

59
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,040
Thank you.

60
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,360
Let's go, Gyoon.

61
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,010
Dad, are you at peace now?

62
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,250
How could you do this?

63
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:01,070
Didn't you miss us?
How could you just leave like this?

64
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,910
We waited for you for so long.

65
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:21,050
Dad. Gyoon and I will live
with smiles on our faces. Okay?

66
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,390
We'll come visit again, Dad.

67
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,200
[Taesoo Heo.]

68
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,180
Don't cry...

69
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,070
Should we have forcibly tagged long?

70
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:07,910
How could we intrude when they want
to say goodbye to their father?

71
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,190
So what's the cause of death?

72
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,120
Nothing particular.

73
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,910
Basically, no signs of foul play could
be determined from the remains.

74
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,200
I heard he was at the site
of the Paekche kingdom ruins?

75
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:36,390
The end of a thief's life is obvious.
He was buried alive while digging.

76
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,070
It's possible.

77
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,320
I can't help thinking this is all a relief.

78
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,030
What is?

79
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:52,990
Knowing for certain instead of
wondering whether he's dead or alive.

80
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,980
There's closure.

81
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,210
I guess.
If we consider Chohee, I agree.

82
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:10,070
You're right, but...
I wish he could've been alive.

83
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,370
Hello.

84
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,150
When did you get here?

85
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,170
Just now. I didn't wait long.

86
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,000
Did you say your farewell?

87
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,310
Yeah.

88
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,000
Are you okay?

89
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,260
Yeah.

90
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,160
Really?

91
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,260
Yeah.

92
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:21,170
You know what? I thought I had
no good memories of my father.

93
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,140
After all the fighting
and crying and resenting...

94
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:31,190
I thought we shared no memories,
but I was wrong.

95
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:37,390
After sending my father away
after looking for him so long...

96
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,930
I remember even the trivial details.

97
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:51,380
How my dad helped me
to paint my nails when I was six.

98
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:58,370
How he breathed on my hands
to keep them warm during the winter.

99
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:05,940
How he cooked noodles for
Gyoon and me late in the night.

100
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,050
They're really trivial things,
but I remembered all of them at once.

101
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,010
I see.

102
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:26,140
I wonder what you would've said
if you got to meet him again.

103
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,090
I would've asked him to forgive me.

104
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:39,130
To forgive me for saying
I never wanted to see him again.

105
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:45,120
Though those words
mean nothing now.

106
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,380
I really wanted to tell him that.

107
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,190
He forgave you a long time ago.

108
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:07,150
You really think so?

109
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:11,370
Yeah, of course.
He was your father, after all.

110
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,930
You're probably tired.
Why aren't you resting?

111
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,100
Because of this.

112
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,210
What is this?

113
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,920
Chief Kang gave it to me
at the funeral home.

114
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,930
Dad's possessions found at the site.

115
00:13:53,310 --> 00:14:01,220
[Chohee, Gyoon. I don't know why
it's so hard for me to go back to you.]

116
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,310
[A few days ago, I missed you so much
I found myself wandering near home.]

117
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,980
[And I saw you guys from afar.]

118
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:22,300
[Seeing how bright and healthy you guys
turned out to be, I felt so sorry to you.]

119
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,180
[And I was grateful to you as well.]

120
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,960
[When will I be able to return to you?]

121
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:38,310
[I'll be able to go back when I'm done
with the work I must complete.]

122
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:46,370
[Until then, don't forgive me.]

123
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:54,270
[And I don't know when it will be,
but I will surely return to you.]

124
00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:01,930
[Until then... Until then, wait for me.]

125
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,080
Are you okay?

126
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,340
Why are you back at work?
You should've taken a few days off.

127
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:47,070
I agree. We'd be fine
even if you're gone longer.

128
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:50,940
You're making me sad.

129
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,980
What?

130
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,960
It sounds like you're saying
our team doesn't need me.

131
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,170
No, that's not what I meant -

132
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:02,230
Mr. Nah! I understand that you're
rivals for becoming the next chief...

133
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,120
but how could you say that?

134
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,340
What did I say that's so wrong
that you're all riled up like this?

135
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:14,070
Just imagine how much pain Chohee
must be in after sending her father away.

136
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:18,940
Shouldn't we be working hard together
in order to help her forget her sadness?

137
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,970
Yet you want her to not come in?

138
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,380
Joohyun, that's not what Mr. Nah meant.

139
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:28,940
Joohyun, he's right. If you're so hard on Mr. Nah, it'll make me feel bad.

140
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,320
No, it's fine.

141
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:37,060
Joohyun, I realize how much you care
about Chohee, so cut the sermon short.

142
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,090
I'll just shut up on my own.

143
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,990
Mr. Nah!

144
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:54,050
I'm grateful and slightly taken aback
by your efforts to comfort me...

145
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:57,050
but can you take things
down just a notch?

146
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:03,180
Sure, I'll consider it.
Chohee, are you really okay?

147
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,910
I'm trying to be.

148
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:12,140
Wow, you're definitely
in a class of your own.

149
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:17,110
If I found out my father
passed away like that, I'd...

150
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,020
What do you mean, “like that?”

151
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,160
You know what I mean.
I'd feel so weird if it were my father.

152
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,130
Like a heavy rock were
pressing down on my chest.

153
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:36,050
The next chief should definitely be
a solid person like you!

154
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,970
<i> Hwangjae Nightclub, Mr. Oh
532-0472</i>

155
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,250
What is this?

156
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,080
It was inside Taesoo Heo's wallet.

157
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,020
I was uneasy about it so I took it before
returning everything else to Chohee.

158
00:17:52,980 --> 00:18:00,090
It's in the 500s. We're looking at Seocho
or Kangnam, or even Songpa. But why?

159
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,200
Are you thinking it was murder?

160
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,340
Yes.

161
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,390
And you have a reason to think so?

162
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,900
The middleman Heo met immediately
after his prison release told us...

163
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,050
someone was chasing Heo.

164
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,120
And to create the false cell phone account and the counterfeit passport...

165
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,950
the person must've known for a fact
that Taesoo Heo was dead to do so.

166
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:28,110
You know we found
no signs of foul play.

167
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,010
But the possibility is there.

168
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,100
What do you plan to do?

169
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:38,120
I'm supposed to go meet the thief
who worked with Taesoo Heo last.

170
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,920
A thief? Who?

171
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,980
Is it someone I know?

172
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,050
No. I heard about him
through a middleman.

173
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,910
Apparently he went clean
and lives a normal life now.

174
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,150
I'm not sure I'll get the information
I want, but it won't hurt to try.

175
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,010
And Officer Cho
is looking up that number.

176
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,970
Taesoo Heo was found dead?

177
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,090
From the state of his remains,
he seems to have died a long time ago.

178
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:12,960
So Mr. Kim was telling the truth.
Then who the hell is Robin Hood?

179
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,260
Um, sir. About that CHA employee
who came last time. Chohee Heo.

180
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,140
She's Taesoo Heo's daughter.

181
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,030
Are you sure?

182
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:32,040
Yes, we verified it at the funeral.

183
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,140
I want more information about her.

184
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:49,060
'If I found out my father
passed away like that, I'd...'

185
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,970
It seemed like he was being chased.

186
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,350
Why are you standing there?

187
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,250
I completely forgot with everything
that's been happening...

188
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:14,110
but supposedly Dad was
being chased by someone.

189
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,290
I heard about that from Chief Kang.

190
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:20,000
You heard?

191
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,150
What about it?

192
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,030
I keep thinking uneasy thoughts.

193
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:31,980
What if Dad's death
was caused by someone -

194
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,240
I told you about
the cause of death, didn't I?

195
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,330
Yes, I know.

196
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,940
Chohee.

197
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,130
Yes?

198
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:47,350
Frankly speaking, it'll be hard to find
someone in your father's line of work...

199
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,130
who was never chased by someone.

200
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:57,270
At one time, Hwang had all kinds of
suspicious characters tailing him.

201
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,350
So what you're saying is...

202
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,070
Yeah, don't think thoughts like that.

203
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,200
Okay, I'll try to think
more positive thoughts, Chief.

204
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,020
Celadon porcelain was created
because jade was so rare.

205
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,000
How wonderful it would be
if one could make jade out of clay.

206
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:28,320
Just like how the alchemists of the west
sought to create gold from lead...

207
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,990
the effort and passion people put in
led to the creation of this new treasure.

208
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,120
Rather, something more valuable
than jade was created.

209
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,940
The Goryeo celadon before you.

210
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,020
I have a question.

211
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,040
Shoot.

212
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,190
What's the most expensive item here?

213
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,040
Don't ask what's the most expensive.
Ask what's the most valuable.

214
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:57,130
What's the most expen -
I mean, most valuable item here?

215
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:03,380
Let me see, the most valuable treasure.
What's your most valued treasure?

216
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,040
Sorry for making you take around
such an amateur group.

217
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:14,970
Not at all. It was relaxing. I'm tired of
debating with the people of our trade.

218
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,070
Hey, while you're at it, why don't you
lead our preservation lab as well?

219
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,200
You're determined to use me since
I was cut from most of my gigs, right?

220
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,070
It's better than bumming around.

221
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,030
You're right, I'll do it.

222
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,930
By the way, did you
hear about Yongcheol?

223
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,900
Why? Did he cause trouble again?

224
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,080
He insisted seriously to the investigations
team that you were Robin Hood.

225
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,170
What?

226
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:40,090
I hope the real Robin Hood is caught soon
so Yongcheol will stop causing problems.

227
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,270
He won't keep his trap shut.

228
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,390
- Hey, I gotta go. I'll call you later.
- Okay.

229
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,920
Excuse me, can I have
some plums? These here.

230
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,060
- You want plums?
- Yes.

231
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,030
- How many do you want?
- However much is written here.

232
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,280
- As written?
- Yes.

233
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,050
Hello, how are you?

234
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:12,000
We're the police.
We ask for your cooperation.

235
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,000
The current user is a Juhyeon Kim.

236
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,320
Seeing how there's no business name,
it's a personal account.

237
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:29,140
It was used by your average family until
August of 2006. Used by a Hojun Lee.

238
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:33,260
Until November of 2003...

239
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,920
it was used by the construction site office
of the Ohseong Parkville apartments.

240
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,360
Before that -

241
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,380
Hold on.

242
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,200
Did you just say Ohseong Parkville?

243
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,920
Ohseong Parkville,
as in the Ohseong Group?

244
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,250
It was built by Ohseong Construction,
so I'm assuming yes.

245
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:56,390
What connection does Heo have with
the Ohseong construction site office?

246
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,990
Why did he have this number?

247
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:04,240
It seems certain that
Chairman Jang is involved.

248
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:09,230
Yes, I'm here to meet the person
who worked with Heo last.

249
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,270
Okay, then we'll talk in detail
back at the office.

250
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,330
I'll take them for you.

251
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,250
You don't need to...

252
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,260
Okay, one, two...

253
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:33,960
Three.

254
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:37,920
Satisfied?

255
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,340
Yes.

256
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,190
Do you want to take a picture?

257
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:43,300
No, I'm fine.
I don't take pictures.

258
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,070
Why not?

259
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,110
Well, I just stopped
taking them one day.

260
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,120
Don't you have to go
to the Incheon museum?

261
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,110
Go on. I have to work, too.

262
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,010
I have plenty of time.
I can go after I help you.

263
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,040
You don't need to help me.

264
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:09,210
You think I'm not onto you?
If I don't help you, later you'll definitely -

265
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:11,260
Fine, let's go.

266
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,180
Okay. Lead the way.

267
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,080
He's quite photogenic.

268
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,000
Remind the president
of the Tokyo office...

269
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:27,280
not to show that we're disappointed
until Iwazaki broaches the subject first.

270
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,130
Yes, sir.

271
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,240
What is it?

272
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:38,330
It seems to be the information
you requested on Taesoo Heo.

273
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,390
Chohee Heo and Gyoon Heo.

274
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,920
They're brother and sister.

275
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:02,170
Sir! This boy. He was helping
with the landscaping until recently.

276
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,010
What?

277
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:15,000
Careful, careful.

278
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,030
Why are we always moving boxes
instead of regulating?

279
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,120
Chohee, don't push yourself too hard.

280
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,980
This is the last of it.

281
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,060
Yeah, take things easy.

282
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,250
We have a meeting tomorrow,
so I wanted to wrap things up.

283
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,140
Hurry, hurry.

284
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,320
She's really straining, isn't she?

285
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,980
You should physically exert yourself
when things are complicated in the mind.

286
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:46,060
Hey, why is Joohyun so overprotective
of Chohee all of a sudden?

287
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,380
I'm not sure.

288
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,060
There's something up her sleeve.

289
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:58,180
After losing Bumsang, it's definitely
not in character for her to be so friendly.

290
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,120
I think the extreme strain of her broken
heart threw her into an identity crisis.

291
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:13,100
Extreme... identity crisis?
You suddenly sound so smart these days.

292
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,160
- Good job.
- Thank you.

293
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,940
Chohee.

294
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,300
How'd you know to find me here?

295
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,090
Eunju told me where you were.

296
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,200
Is that so?

297
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:36,920
Um...

298
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,380
I'm almost done here.
Did you eat lunch?

299
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,160
Yeah, I did.

300
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,370
Oh, you did.

301
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,390
So what's Gyoon up to today?

302
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,230
Gyoon? He should be home today.

303
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,030
Why?

304
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:57,380
No reason. Just curious.

305
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,040
Work hard, and I'll see you later.

306
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,030
Okay.

307
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:05,200
He's only curious about Gyoon?

308
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,980
Who is it?

309
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,380
Who is it?

310
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,350
What the! Who are you guys?

311
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,320
Grab him!

312
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,250
Let go!

313
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,970
Bro! Run!
It's dangerous! Hurry!

314
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,000
Stop right there!

315
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,130
Stop right there!
When I get my hands on you!

316
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,180
Bro!

317
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,360
Go that way. Hurry!

318
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,190
I think we lost them.

319
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,930
Who were those men?

320
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,130
What?

321
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,200
Why were they chasing you?

322
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,970
Dunno. I have no idea.

323
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:30,390
How can you not know?
They clearly have a problem with you.

324
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,980
I wouldn't cause any problems.

325
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,170
Let's go. Let's grab something
to drink since you're here.

326
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,180
Stop right there, Robin Hood.

327
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,230
I know that you're Robin Hood.

328
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,340
Now, answer me.
What have you been up to?

329
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:14,170
Who were those men,
and why are you stealing?

330
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,960
Those men were probably
Chairman Jang's men.

331
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,000
What?

332
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:30,240
They probably figured out that I worked
part-time at his house to get information.

333
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:34,350
You went into his house?
Are you out of your mind?

334
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,110
Why are you so fearless? Do you know
what kind of person he really is?

335
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,130
Do you have any idea
how dangerous your actions are?

336
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:47,390
I prepared for this when I started.

337
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,360
Gyoon.

338
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:57,210
My sister hated our father.
Yet at the same time, she missed him.

339
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:03,030
And she always felt sorry to him.
That's how she lived her entire life.

340
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:10,120
I can't watch her live
trapped in his shadow anymore.

341
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,370
I wanted her to lead a normal life,
the kind where she dates and marries.

342
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,970
And eventually makes me an uncle.

343
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:24,100
I wanted to give her that kind of life.

344
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,310
You idiot.
That doesn't mean you should...

345
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:35,320
I'm sorry about stealing
the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook.

346
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,150
You might think I'm being shameless,
but I don't want to regret doing it.

347
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,360
Yeah, it's me.

348
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,940
Your car's in front of my house,
so I was wondering if you were here.

349
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:01,210
Yeah, I'm nearby with Gyoon.

350
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:05,100
You're with Gyoon?

351
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:08,120
Yeah. We'll be there soon.

352
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,170
Okay, sure.

353
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,330
Gyoon.

354
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,080
Yes?

355
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:40,170
Promise me one thing.
Don't steal again.

356
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:46,100
You said your sister was all you had.
The same goes for her.

357
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,020
You're everything to her.

358
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:57,220
As of this moment, I'm forgetting that
you're Robin Hood. So you do the same.

359
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:03,370
And don't ever do it again.
For you and for your sister's sake.

360
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,150
Can you promise me this?

361
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,260
Yes.

362
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:30,300
Didn't I tell you that Taesoo Heo
was taken care of seven years ago?

363
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,980
And I've been proven correct.

364
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:41,150
So please put your trust in me now.

365
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:45,130
It's not difficult to trust you
if you do things well.

366
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:54,900
Since Taesoo is dead,
who do you think this Robin Hood is?

367
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:01,020
I'm not sure.
Who could it be?

368
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:08,130
It's Taesoo's son, Gyoon Heo.
His older sister is Chohee Heo of the CHA.

369
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:13,080
Ch - Chohee is Taesoo's daughter?

370
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:19,250
Tsk, tsk. You're so slow.
How can I entrust anything to you?

371
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:35,190
What? Three men couldn't catch one kid?
How could you flub up like that!

372
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,300
Incompetent fools. Leave me!

373
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,180
Um, sir?

374
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:49,280
What?

375
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:55,100
I have a good idea
that'll make you feel better.

376
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,190
Would you trust me this once?

377
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,180
Did your talk with
Chairman Jang go well?

378
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:25,160
We're going to be busy for awhile.
Yonggu, go round up all the boys.

379
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,140
Why, why, why?

380
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,030
Stop trying to know everything.

381
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,940
Every time you know too much,
things screw up.

382
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,950
So stop it, okay?

383
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,270
I just want to be loved by you.

384
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:46,920
Dongpal.

385
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,170
Yes?

386
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,330
Let's go already.

387
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,020
Yes, sir.

388
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,250
It was a man
who spoke Japanese well.

389
00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:01,130
Fluent in Japanese. Do you remember
anything about his appearance?

390
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:07,030
Not sure. I don't really remember
since it was seven years ago.

391
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:12,910
So seven years ago this man and Heo got
into a fight at the construction site office.

392
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,390
Right.

393
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:17,030
Then do you remember
why Heo was being chased?

394
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:23,260
Taesoo was originally going to sell the
seven national treasures to a rich man.

395
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:29,370
But he suddenly had a change of heart.
When he refused to sell, things got ugly.

396
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:37,070
But I didn't understand why he insisted
on returning them to the museum.

397
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:42,150
The man who fought with Heo.
Do you know whom he worked for?

398
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:44,970
Well, he was probably
working for some rich guy.

399
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:47,240
Was it Chairman Jang
of the Ohseong Group?

400
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,060
I have no idea.

401
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:00,980
Chief! Would this look
better on me, or would this one?

402
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:09,210
Don't tell me you're about to say
that both would look great on me.

403
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:17,220
How did you know? I don't know
how you read my mind so well.

404
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:29,230
Was he teasing me? No way.
Then again, both would look good on me.

405
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:36,970
Chief! What did you talk about
with the shop owner?

406
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,030
Just this and that.

407
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,100
Don't you have to go to the museum?

408
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:49,090
The thing is, it's already closed. This is because you keep dragging me around.

409
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:53,010
When did I drag you around?
You kept following me.

410
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:57,060
Oh my, Chief!
When did I follow you around?

411
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,140
Jeez, if you say things like that,
people will call you shameless.

412
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,910
Even in the past
you always dragged me around.

413
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,060
Fine. Let's go.

414
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,990
Chief, we're just gonna leave?

415
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,130
Then what else?

416
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,180
“I'm hungry.
Let's have some noodles first.”

417
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,320
It's your cue to say this.
How strange.

418
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,030
I'm hungry.
Let's have some noodles first.

419
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,060
Chief, I'll buy the sweet and sour pork!

420
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,990
I didn't prepare much,
but help yourself. Eat.

421
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,040
Wow.

422
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:41,230
I should come over every day. It's really
good. I was getting sick of eating out.

423
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,000
Is it really good?

424
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,960
Yup.

425
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:53,120
By the way, Gyoon, why was the house
so messy? Did someone come over?

426
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,910
About that, I was trying to clean
the house, but it ended up like that.

427
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:03,060
That was the result
of attempted cleaning?

428
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:09,240
Gyoon's definitely special. What younger
brother cleans the house? Right, Gyoon?

429
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,190
Absolutely, Bro.

430
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:15,060
What's this? You're totally on the same
wavelength. What are you two up to?

431
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,240
We're not up to anything.

432
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,930
Nothing up these sleeves.

433
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:26,170
Chohee, why don't you
let Gyoon travel a little?

434
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,390
Travel? That was out of the blue.

435
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:35,900
When we were talking earlier, I sensed
that he wanted to get some fresh air.

436
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:41,090
But he's too worried about you. So you
take the first step and tell him to go.

437
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,210
Gyoon, is that how you feel?

438
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,320
What? Um, well, not exactly, but...

439
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,150
Silly boy, why didn't you tell me?

440
00:40:54,290 --> 00:41:00,030
Don't worry about me and go.
Go and get some rest, okay?

441
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,070
Sis.

442
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:10,280
Don't mind me in this sibling moment.
I'm just going to eat quietly.

443
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,210
Go on, eat.

444
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,900
Don't come out. Go in.

445
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,990
It's okay.

446
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,320
Really, don't come out.

447
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:28,030
I know about your philanthropic mindset,
but it's fine. I want to see you off.

448
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:35,030
Hey.

449
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,150
What?

450
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,300
Thanks for today.

451
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,160
For what?

452
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:43,220
For treating Gyoon like a brother.

453
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,070
I'm so busy taking care of myself that
I can't give him the attention he needs.

454
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:59,200
But you listen to him and
take care of him. So thank you.

455
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,220
If you're that grateful,
do me a favor.

456
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,130
What favor?

457
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:11,200
While Gyoon's on his trip,
stay over at my house.

458
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,160
What?

459
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:16,380
I won't be at peace
knowing you're home alone.

460
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:22,310
I won't make you uncomfortable in
any way, so just until Gyoon comes back.

461
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:27,940
Man, you call that a joke?

462
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,080
I'm not joking.

463
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:34,370
That's so ridiculous. Why would I go
to your place when I can stay here?

464
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:38,080
And nothing's going to happen
to me if I stay home alone.

465
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:44,240
Thanks for the concern,
but no more silly jokes.

466
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,180
Go home.

467
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,950
Aren't you leaving?

468
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:51,380
I'm leaving.

469
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:53,380
Leave then.

470
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,950
Why aren't you leaving?

471
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,970
I'm leaving.

472
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,910
Bye.

473
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,940
Why is he joking
with such a serious face?

474
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:58,370
‘Promise me one thing.
Don't steal again.'

475
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:04,120
‘You said your sister was all you had.
The same goes for her.'

476
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,160
‘You're everything to her.'

477
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:45,980
“To be or not to be.
That is the question!”

478
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,030
Do you know what this means?

479
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,280
Idiots.

480
00:44:56,090 --> 00:45:00,370
To die or to live,
that is the question.

481
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:08,220
Written by Brother Shakespeare,
the greatest writer born to England.

482
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:13,150
How silly of Brother Shakespeare.
He calls that a question?

483
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,230
Of course you should live.

484
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,190
I give up on you.

485
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:24,070
Anyway, your lives are
gonna change starting today.

486
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:31,270
We come into the world
butt naked and leave butt naked!

487
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:39,040
Let's give it our all
and not hold back!

488
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:45,380
When the boys gather later,
train them well.

489
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:52,900
Our first priority is to find the man who fought with Heo at the construction office

490
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,960
but it's difficult since we don't
have any specific information.

491
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:02,390
It seems clear that Chairman Jang
has something to do with Taesoo's death.

492
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:04,340
I think we can assume that.

493
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:10,050
So we plan to find out the relationship
between Heo and Chairman Jang.

494
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:13,010
And one more person. Robin Hood.

495
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,190
What?

496
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:23,260
Only Hwang, Chairman Jang and Robin
Hood knew about Taesoo's seven items.

497
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:29,080
Are you saying Robin Hood had
something to do with Heo's death?

498
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:35,050
We can't say he was
related to Taesoo's death, but...

499
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:38,200
Chohee.

500
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:40,020
Chief.

501
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:45,020
Chief, what brings you here?

502
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:49,290
Um, I just came to talk with Chief Noh.

503
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:52,030
Chief Kang, isn't there
a security training exercise today?

504
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,120
- Yes.
- You should go prep for that.

505
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,910
- Yeah, I have to go.
- Okay.

506
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:10,950
Um, Chief? What did you
discuss with Chief Kang?

507
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:13,310
Oh, it's nothing important.

508
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:19,360
We're getting major pressure from
above about the Robin Hood situation.

509
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:32,370
Gyoon, where are you?
The bus terminal?

510
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:39,230
Yeah, I told my grandfather about you,
so don't worry. Yeah, we'll talk again.

511
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:47,960
Bumsang, can we talk for a moment?
There's something I want to ask you.

512
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,930
I want to ask you about Robin Hood.

513
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:59,240
If Chohee's father is not Robin Hood,
you're the only witness to see him.

514
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,980
So I wanted to ask you
for some specific details.

515
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:06,290
I believe I already
told you everything I know.

516
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:08,980
Last time you just said
it was a young man.

517
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:12,280
If you can give me a physical description,
it'll really help with the investigation.

518
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:20,230
He was masked and wearing a hat
so I can't tell you his physical description.

519
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:25,960
But you can probably tell me
his body size and height, things like that.

520
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:29,290
Average height, average size.

521
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:35,220
And now in retrospect, I may have been
hasty to assume it was a young man.

522
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,980
What do you mean?

523
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:40,190
The thing is...

524
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:42,240
Chief! Chief!

525
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,320
Bumsang, Bumsang!

526
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:45,980
What is it?

527
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:47,140
Robin Hood is back.

528
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,120
What was it this time?
The “Gimainmul” shaped double goblets?

529
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,200
The “Gimainmul” double goblets?
Hwang mentioned it...

530
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,330
So you mean another one of Heo's
items were sent to the museum?

531
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:02,380
I don't know who Robin Hood is,
but what a hassle. Anyway, let's go. Hurry.

532
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:05,200
Bumsang, what are you doing?
Let's hurry up and go.

533
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:09,210
I'll meet you at the museum.

534
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,050
How could he just walk off?

535
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,350
- Let's go.
- Let's hurry.

536
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:19,300
A two dollar ticket, please.

537
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,150
Gyoon!

538
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,920
Bro!

539
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,380
Why, what's wrong?

540
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,210
Is it you?
Did you do it again?

541
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,390
What?

542
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:45,900
Another one of your father's items
came to the museum. Did you steal it?

543
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,280
Someone who knows Heo?

544
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:02,210
Who's returning these items
when Taesoo Heo is dead?

545
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,960
What a humdrum.

546
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,910
Don't you mean conundrum?

547
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:17,150
Um, Chohee?

548
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:19,940
Yes?

549
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:29,200
I've thought about it, and I think Robin
Hood is someone related to your father.

550
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,370
Does anyone pop into mind?

551
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:41,380
Why are you so curious?
We've already covered all the grounds.

552
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:47,120
C'mon, let's go to the meeting.

553
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,060
What meeting? What are you doing?

554
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,100
What's wrong with you?

555
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:59,130
Why are you so tactless? Why do
you keep asking her about her father?

556
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,010
It's fishy.

557
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:03,120
What is?

558
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,940
Look, the darkest place
is under the candlestick.

559
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:08,910
It has to be someone Heo knows -

560
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:12,110
Let me see.

561
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,210
Maybe!

562
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,120
Maybe?

563
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,160
- Hwang?
- Chief Noh?

564
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:17,040
Darn...

565
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,230
- Chief Noh?
- Hwang?

566
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,310
Who is Robin Hood?

567
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,280
You really didn't do it?

568
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,310
It really wasn't me. Why would I
after promising I wouldn't yesterday?

569
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,910
Please believe me.

570
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:42,170
Then who in the world is it?

571
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,130
I have no clue what's going on,
but I'm not getting good vibes about it.

572
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:53,310
Lay low at my grandfather's place and
don't tell anywhere where you are, okay?

573
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:55,160
Okay, I'll do as you say.

574
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:58,370
Get on, the bus is about to leave.

575
00:51:59,070 --> 00:51:59,980
Okay.

576
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,170
Um, Bro?

577
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:04,150
Yeah?

578
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:10,360
I don't have to worry about my sister,
right? You'll take care of her?

579
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,350
Of course, that's a given.

580
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:19,140
Then I'll leave her
in your care until I return.

581
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:24,920
Okay, and taking care of her will always
be my responsibility, so don't worry.

582
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,350
Go on then.

583
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,920
Bye, Bumsang.

584
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:31,010
Thank you.
Bumsang, really thank you.

585
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:51,930
“Bumsang?”
I definitely like “Bro” better.

586
00:52:55,220 --> 00:53:00,050
Why are we having a security
training exercise on this hot day?

587
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:04,350
No matter how hard I try to find the
positive aspect of this, I end up so angry.

588
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:11,020
What if Chohee makes fools
of us all again like last time?

589
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,060
Everyone'll hate on
our regulations team.

590
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:16,940
If she does, I'm gonna
let her have it. I swear, I will.

591
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:21,130
Mr. Nah, that's not a good attitude.

592
00:53:21,130 --> 00:53:26,310
Why are you hating and ostracizing the
diligent Chohee? You shouldn't do that.

593
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:32,150
Joohyun, I'm already steamed as it is,
so let's stop right here.

594
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,000
What will you be doing?
Are you joining the training exercise?

595
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:43,070
I was given a very important responsibility. Preparing refreshments.

596
00:53:55,310 --> 00:54:00,900
Dressed all in black on this hot day.
What are we doing? We look like crows.

597
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:05,080
That's what I'm saying. Why can't we just
sorta pretend to do it instead of all this?

598
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,990
Yes, this is Officer Cho.

599
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,150
Yes. Yes, sir.

600
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:14,320
Hey, Jinguk, we have to
head over to the security office.

601
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,350
What now?

602
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:18,300
If they beckon, we must go.
Chohee, wait for us.

603
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,220
Okay, I'll be here.

604
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,220
Bumsang, how are you?

605
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:37,050
Wow, you look cool. What are you
doing in all black in this sweltering heat?

606
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:40,030
Right? We have a security
training exercise today.

607
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,920
What brings you here?

608
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:45,030
I came to take a look
at the item Robin Hood sent in.

609
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:50,050
Yeah? I wonder who that Robin Hood is.

610
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:57,090
Seeing how he only sends in Dad's items,
he definitely has some connection to Dad.

611
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:02,010
I have no idea who he is
and why he's doing it.

612
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,120
By the way, Gyoon left on his trip today.

613
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,060
Oh, did he?

614
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:11,370
But he wouldn't even tell me
where he was headed.

615
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:16,310
Traveling is like that.
You go where your feet take you.

616
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,320
I guess so.

617
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,190
This is the “Gimainmul” double goblets
Robin Hood sent today.

618
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:31,190
Can we use the X-ray room right now?

619
00:55:31,190 --> 00:55:34,110
Why? Is there a problem?

620
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:37,170
I don't think it's authentic.

621
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:42,950
No way. All of the items Robin Hood
sent in so far were national treasures.

622
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,230
I'm sorry, but you need to leave
because of the training exercise.

623
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,150
You can't leave once the exercise begins.

624
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,280
Sure.

625
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,380
Okay.

626
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:56,300
What should we do, sir?

627
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,300
We have no choice. Let's take
a look at it tomorrow. Good work.

628
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:04,020
Chohee, please take it easy this time.

629
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:08,240
Yeah, let's make things easier for
everyone and not overexert ourselves.

630
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,900
Then I'll just turn myself in
as soon as the exercise starts.

631
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,070
Why so extreme?

632
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:15,940
You know that we have to
start over from the beginning then.

633
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,090
Then I'll stay uncaught until the end.

634
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:19,180
Extreme!

635
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,980
Too extreme.

636
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:24,200
It was a joke. Your reactions...

637
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,920
Even her jokes are extreme.

638
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,270
Everyone, focus.

639
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,380
We'll start the exercise
at precisely 2100 hours.

640
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:47,180
Doing your best is great, but don't cause
physical harm to one another.

641
00:56:51,130 --> 00:56:56,030
Now, now, there are only ten minutes left
so let's hurry things along.

642
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,380
A fake Robin Hood.

643
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,330
Why are you so serious?

644
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,930
No, it's nothing.

645
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:16,340
I get to leave early thanks to the training
exercise. C'mon. I'll buy you a beer.

646
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,260
Sure.

647
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:42,010
Okay then, the twenty-third security
training exercise will begin now.

648
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:45,070
Start!

649
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:46,120
Yes, sir!

650
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:58,260
Excuse me?

651
00:58:05,010 --> 00:59:23,190

1
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,449
<i>Since before recorded time</i>

2
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:46,455
<i>it had swung through the universe
in an elliptical orbit so large</i>

3
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:52,427
<i>that its very existence remained
a secret of time and space.</i>

4
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:56,719
<i>But now, in the last few years
of the 20th century,</i>

5
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,888
<i>the visitor was returning.</i>

6
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:11,942
<i>The citizens of Earth would get
an extra Christmas present this year,</i>

7
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:15,067
<i>as their planet orbited
through the tail of the comet.</i>

8
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,286
<i>Scientists predicted a light show
of stellar proportions,</i>

9
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:22,871
<i>something not seen on Earth
for 65 million years.</i>

10
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:27,041
<i>Indeed, not since the time
that the dinosaurs disappeared,</i>

11
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,834
<i>virtually overnight.</i>

12
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:37,343
<i>There were a few who saw this
as more than just a coincidence.</i>

13
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,267
<i>But most didn't.</i>

14
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,378
I'm showing you
the top of the line here.

15
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,881
This is the best we have.
This is $9.50.

16
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,012
- $9.50?
- But wait a minute.

17
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:25,228
This is $8.00, okay?
This is $7.50.

18
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,596
This lady over here,
she's wearing the $7.50.

19
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,473
- Yeah, I like it.
- Let me tell you about this thing.

20
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,001
Blow on it there.

21
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:55,125
See?
See how nice that is?

22
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,717
Isn't that great?

23
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,837
I know you got $9.50.

24
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,313
- Will it work?
- Oh, yeah.

25
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,901
I know it will.

26
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,145
This spring, look at it.

27
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,691
Isn't that nice.

28
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:18,486
And the other side.
Look at it.

29
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,949
Isn't that great?
$9.50.

30
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,653
<i>Enjoy the movie.</i>

31
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,371
Excuse me,
where's the men's room?

32
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,331
- One minute.
- Do you work here or not?

33
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,449
Hey, Regina.

34
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,746
Regina, give that thing
a rest, will ya?

35
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,868
In a minute, Mel.

36
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,122
<i>Look, I don't pay you to do
that kind of stuff around here.</i>

37
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:36,466
<i>Regina, I want you
to clean everything up</i>

38
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:39,006
<i>so we can get out of here
in time to watch the comet.</i>

39
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,253
Everything's cleaned up.

40
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,471
Damn!

41
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,933
I want you to take this flashlight
and walk the house.

42
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,973
Aw, Mel,
they throw things at me.

43
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:49,562
Who cares?

44
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,181
Walk the house.

45
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,228
Have you ever been hit
with Dots, Mel?

46
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,602
Milk Duds?
Those things hurt.

47
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,774
I-- I don--

48
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,022
Oh, how are you, sir?

49
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,023
The refreshments
are right over there.

50
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,696
Thank you.
Thank you.

51
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,866
I don't want those weirdos cutting up
the seats, you understand?

52
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,414
Okay, okay, okay.

53
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:12,084
Replacing Reg in third place

54
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:16,673
is Reg, third place.

55
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,840
Wait a minute.

56
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,593
<i>Somebody named DMK
in sixth place.</i>

57
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:25,761
<i>When did this happen?</i>

58
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,179
<i>Look, don't be an overachiever,</i>

59
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,348
you'll fit in better
with your age group, okay?

60
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:32,226
This is really annoying.

61
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,349
<i>Regina, Regina,
look this way.</i>

62
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,225
<i>Regina!
Look at me!</i>

63
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,727
Read my lips.

64
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,772
<i>Flashlight.</i>

65
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,652
Walk house now, hm?

66
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,947
Okay, Mel.

67
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:48,870
Let me take this for you.

68
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,412
Uh, uh, that, that's great,
they go to profits.

69
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,535
And listen, stay out
of the projection booth.

70
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,706
And stay away from Dupree!

71
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,796
I'm gonna fire that guy
some day.

72
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,665
He's been doing to me what
he's been doing to her in the booth.

73
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:02,669
<i>David, that was a scream.</i>

74
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,762
<i>You're right,
I'm gonna check it out.</i>

75
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,097
<i>You stay here.</i>

76
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,307
<i>I'm talkin'
about a mint condition print</i>

77
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,596
of It Came from Outer Space.

78
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,638
In 3D, man.

79
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,481
Yeah, right,
Tres Dimensiones.

80
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:17,896
Look, you know as well as I do,
you got film freaks

81
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:19,986
who'd go down on you
for a bootleg print of that.

82
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,940
Oh, a hundred bucks?

83
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,032
Hundred bucks, right.

84
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,697
Something wrong
with the phone here

85
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,285
or did I hear you say
a hundred dollars?

86
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,371
Look, a hundred dollars
isn't going to get it this time.

87
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:33,199
Because I'm gonna have
to spend the night in here

88
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,122
waiting for you
to bring the print back.

89
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,961
Think I'm gonna miss this comet thing
for a lousy hundred dollars?

90
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,007
Okay, $110's
a little better, yeah.

91
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,552
Hey, Reggie, here's the deal.

92
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,217
You leave,
I let you in the back door.

93
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,761
Okay, I leave, you let me back in.
Mel thinks everybody's gone.

94
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,850
Larry, do you know anybody
named DMK?

95
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,059
No, ow!

96
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,645
No, you gotta have the print back
by 6:00 in the morning.

97
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:57,766
You know, if we spend the night
in here, we're gonna miss the comet.

98
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,644
It's not like you can't see it
on television, you know.

99
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:02,486
All right, hey,
get your guy here in an hour.

100
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,482
Yeah, well, maybe I want
to see it for real, okay?

101
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,904
Hey, television's real.
Television's very real.

102
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,454
<i>So, what do you say?
I'll give you $15.</i>

103
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,457
Are you kidding?

104
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,121
We spend the night in here
and we end up making it.

105
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:17,414
And you give me 15 bucks?

106
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,832
Do you know what
that makes me look like?

107
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,627
Reggie, I'm not giving you 15 bucks
for making it with me.

108
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,669
Okay, well, just so we have
that straight, okay?

109
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,386
Yeah, for sure.

110
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,972
I mean, you'd be worth
a lot more than 15 bucks.

111
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,466
<i>Everybody knows that.</i>

112
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:37,768
<i>The first earthlings to see the effects
will be in Newfundland.</i>

113
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,982
<i>Or Newfoundland.</i>

114
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,732
<i>This is expected
to begin at-- at 2:04.</i>

115
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,776
- That's Pacific Standard Time.
- Hey, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy.

116
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,527
<i>Uh, interesting, uh, sidebar
to this story is the fact that</i>

117
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:53,325
<i>all telecommunications
seem to be out</i>

118
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,868
<i>in that part of the world.</i>

119
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,707
<i>Uh, this could have--</i>

120
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,041
Hello.

121
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,965
Samantha, you sound pissed.

122
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,889
I just had it out with Doris
once and for all again.

123
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,684
She wants me to like,
haul chips and dips around

124
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,054
for her little comet party.

125
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,807
Yeah, well, speaking of Doris,
look, I need your help.

126
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,810
Tell her that, uh, you know
all about this field trip

127
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,982
that I'm gonna take, okay,
with my science class?

128
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,197
We're gonna go to the observatory
to watch the comet.

129
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,816
She won't go for it.

130
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,909
<i>She'll go for it.
Just tell her, okay?</i>

131
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,278
Okay.

132
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,584
Doris.

133
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,249
Reggie's on the phone.

134
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,252
She's not having car trouble?

135
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:46,715
She's gonna be out all night

136
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,926
with her science class
at the observatory.

137
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,633
I know all about it.

138
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,632
<i>We gotta get outta here.</i>

139
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:55,884
Yeah, hi, Doris.

140
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,977
<i>What's this about a science
class, Regina?</i>

141
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:59,846
Well, you want me to do better
in science, don't you?

142
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,854
I want you home in five minutes
after you finish work.

143
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,193
If you want to watch the comet,
you can do it here.

144
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,314
Look, Doris, like, I'm 18, okay?

145
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,736
And I can watch the comet
wherever I want to watch the comet.

146
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,952
Here, Samantha.

147
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,787
You and your sister share
a lot of secrets.

148
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,281
I want you to share
this one with her.

149
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,376
<i>If it were up to me,
I couldn't care less what she did.</i>

150
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,791
But if your father
makes it back home

151
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,631
without some Sandinista
blowing his brains out,

152
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,216
<i>he's gonna hold me responsible</i>

153
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,256
<i>for any kind of trouble
you two girls get into.</i>

154
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,930
What we have here is
a chain of command.

155
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,391
The Major jumps on me,
I jump on you.

156
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,343
Did you get that?

157
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,017
Okay.

158
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:45,354
Now, are you going
to join the party?

159
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,522
Join the party for what, Doris?

160
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,441
So I can watch Chuck
from across the street

161
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,906
stick his hands
down your pants?

162
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,695
I think that's something
Daddy should know.

163
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,406
Chuck's a nice guy.

164
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,747
He's certainly nice to be with
while Daddy's down in Banana Land.

165
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:03,039
You were born with an asshole, Doris,
you don't need Chuck.

166
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,972
<i>Looks like a-- a-- a real nice crowd
we have out here tonight.</i>

167
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,734
Sarah, Chucky.

168
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,069
Hey, where have you been?
You're gonna miss everything.

169
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,859
- It's gonna start.
- Oh, kids.

170
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:34,198
I'll never marry
another man with kids.

171
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,364
In 1910,
Halley's Comet returned.

172
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,453
Everybody thought
they were going to die then.

173
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,203
What was that?

174
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:48,329
Look!

175
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,798
You want to know
what bugs me about all this?

176
00:09:58,807 --> 00:09:59,970
What?

177
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:05,222
Well, I'm always afraid someone's
gonna see us, you know?

178
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,313
See us how?

179
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,774
There's no windows.
They can't see through walls.

180
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,811
Well, Superman
can see through walls.

181
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,901
Not these walls,
they're made out of steel.

182
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:16,365
Used to be a fire law.

183
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,238
Uh!

184
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,204
Superman can see through steel.

185
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:24,415
Nope, it's the one thing
he cannot see through.

186
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,408
That's lead, you nerd.

187
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,212
- Lead?
- Yeah.

188
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,047
I mean, Superman can see through steel
like it wasn't there even.

189
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,165
Huh.

190
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,380
Larry!

191
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:36,969
<i>Well, I guess I'm the only
one who's not outside</i>

192
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,087
<i>watching the meteor shower.</i>

193
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,259
<i>I just might put
the radio station</i>

194
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,178
<i>on autopilot
and sneak out myself.</i>

195
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,627
<i>This is the big K in Los Angeles.</i>

196
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,625
<i>A great looking morning
in Southern California.</i>

197
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:25,220
<i>Fifty thousand watts of coiled steel
and passion FM in the AM.</i>

198
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,714
<i>It's wake up time
in the city of angels.</i>

199
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,924
<i>And I'm Steve LaBeau.</i>

200
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,392
<i>God damn it!</i>

201
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,641
What? What?

202
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,144
I've been waiting by that door
for the last 30 minutes

203
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,892
and that pinhead hasn't brought
the film back yet!

204
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,518
Oh, give the guy a break.

205
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:41,737
I mean, people are late
sometimes.

206
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:45,157
No, something's wrong.

207
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,823
If he screwed that film up,
we could all be in a lot of trouble.

208
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,119
I'm gonna go over there
on the bike.

209
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,537
Aw, jeez, don't I get
an Egg McMuffin or anything?

210
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,414
You could do me a favor.

211
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,371
I did you a favor last night.

212
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,713
That guy calls,

213
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,875
you tell him
I'm on my way over

214
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,627
and I'm very, very, very,
very pissed!

215
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,304
Hey what about my 15 bucks?

216
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,969
Tell him you're pissed too.

217
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:30,653
DMK.

218
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,748
You trust people you get
screwed over every God damn time.

219
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,841
Oh, is that you?

220
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,425
Yeah, it's about friggin time.

221
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:53,638
Uh!

222
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,954
Yeah!

223
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,838
End of you, DMK.

224
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,677
You're history.

225
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,150
God, bad smog.

226
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,869
Shit!

227
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,697
Shit.

228
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,625
Oh, damn it!

229
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,332
Just great!

230
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,706
Uh!

231
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,966
Places closed everywhere.

232
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,302
I hate days that
start like this!

233
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,484
Okay.

234
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:10,571
Oh, damn it, damn it!

235
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:25,290
Uh, gross.

236
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,339
<i>Larry?</i>

237
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,514
Whoa, what is this,
trick or treat?

238
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,558
Come here!

239
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,676
What?

240
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,520
Come here!

241
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,014
Come here, your ass.

242
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:34,655
Uh, look, I don't know
what your scene is,

243
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,774
but don't do
anything stupid, okay?

244
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,945
No, no, you don't seem
to understand.

245
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,743
<i>I've been trained
to take care of myself.</i>

246
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,537
You know what I'm saying?

247
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,954
I don't want to hurt you.

248
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,667
Oh, shit.

249
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,676
No, let go!

250
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,010
Let go of me!

251
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:07,013
No!

252
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,024
Come on, come on, come on!

253
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,913
Samantha?

254
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,204
Doris?

255
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,910
- Samantha?
- What?

256
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,672
God, what are trying to do,
give me a heart attack?

257
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:04,257
I thought you were Doris.

258
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:05,751
You know she decked
me last night?

259
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,172
Knocked one
of my teeth loose even.

260
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,296
<i>Wait till Daddy hears
about that.</i>

261
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,640
<i>You know how he's always telling me
to be careful with my mouth</i>

262
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,760
on account of the dental plan
doesn't cover anything cosmetic.

263
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,557
Ooh, anyway, get this--

264
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:19,477
I think Chuck and Doris spent
the night together last night.

265
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,474
<i>Wait till Daddy hears
about that.</i>

266
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,852
I mean, even if he isn't pissed off
about my mouth,

267
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,695
which I can't imagine.

268
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,490
What's happening?

269
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,609
Oh yeah, I guess you are
a little confused.

270
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:33,737
God, you look terrible.

271
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,331
I ran away last night
after she slugged me.

272
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:37,745
Left a note and everything.

273
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,993
I didn't have
any place to go,

274
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,871
so I spent the night
in a lawn storage shed.

275
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,840
Pretty gross with the Synerol
and everything.

276
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,459
God, look at this kitchen.

277
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,170
I'm not cleaning this up.

278
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:54,262
So anyway, since I was still here
this morning I thought,

279
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:57,852
"Hey, I'll go to pep squad practice
and split after."

280
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,814
Except for I don't know
if pep squad practice is on or not.

281
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,182
I can't get anybody
on the phone.

282
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:07,029
Sammy, you can't get anybody
on the phone because everybody's gone.

283
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,899
What?
Would you grab the milk please?

284
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,275
I swear to God!

285
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,867
You made me swallow my gum.

286
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,408
There's nobody!
I mean, there's nobody!

287
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:19,783
Oh, right, nobody.
I'm sure.

288
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,035
- Come here.
- Hey!

289
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:23,996
Hey, back off!

290
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,622
This sweater cost 80 bucks.

291
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,423
Buffy?

292
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:35,761
Stupid dog.

293
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,719
Look.
Look at this!

294
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:41,893
At what?

295
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,811
Doris isn't at Chuck's.

296
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,275
I'll show you Doris.

297
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:48,562
Here's Doris.

298
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,859
This is all that's left of her.
This and dust.

299
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,150
Look.

300
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,570
Here's Chuck.

301
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:04,790
Where are the kids?

302
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:11,844
<i>It's Saturday morning.
Where are the God damn kids?</i>

303
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,948
They're around.

304
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,822
They're not around.

305
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:45,665
Look, if you're trying to scare me,
you're doing it, okay?

306
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,833
I'm not trying to scare you.

307
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,001
Then stop it.

308
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,874
I'm not doing it!

309
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,376
You try calling someone.

310
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,673
Not just your pep squad--
anyone.

311
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,637
Nobody's home!

312
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:57,721
<i>Unbelievable,</i>

313
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,762
<i>that's song number sixteen
on the survey this week.</i>

314
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,807
<i>Don't forget, we preview
the top 20 every Friday night.</i>

315
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,476
<i>A great way to start a super weekend
here in the Southland.</i>

316
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,815
<i>Get down.</i>

317
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,591
Are you sure this is
the radio station?

318
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,257
- Yeah, just go on in.
- Well, don't push.

319
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,185
Do you think whatever happened
happened everywhere?

320
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,357
Like in Burbank
and places like that?

321
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,450
We'll ask the DJ.
He does the news, doesn't he?

322
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,194
Search me, I always change the channel
when the news comes on.

323
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,454
<i>There's something in here.</i>

324
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,508
So, where is he?

325
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,842
I mean, somebody has
to run this stuff, don't they?

326
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:24,889
<i>We Got Trouble, Not Us--</i>

327
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,056
<i>that's the name of the song.</i>

328
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,054
<i>And I'm Steve LaBeau
trapped inside your radio.</i>

329
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,022
<i>The guy who really cares
about you.</i>

330
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,982
<i>I mean, who else would sit
in this little box every day</i>

331
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,192
<i>just to play music for you.</i>

332
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:36,525
<i>Well, it? time to reach
into the old mailbag here.</i>

333
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,523
<i>- I got a letter from--
- Beam me up, Scotty.</i>

334
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,905
Okay, girls,
hold it right there.

335
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,494
You, the blonde,
get into the light.

336
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,488
Wait.

337
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,458
Why don't you just
let my sister go

338
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,326
and maybe you and I can
work something out.

339
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,543
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Shut up!

340
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,789
You got the wrong idea.
You, into the light.

341
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:57,838
I'll give you to five.
One, two-- no?

342
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,674
All right, let's try it this way.

343
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,970
- Five, four, three--
- Okay, okay.

344
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,722
Do you get a lot
of dates this way?

345
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,853
Open your eyes.

346
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,029
Okay.

347
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,692
Hey, I know what
you're thinkin' but--

348
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,035
<i>That you're a cretin?</i>

349
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,155
Sweetheart.

350
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:30,121
You haven't seen those freaked-out
zombies runnin' around here?

351
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,834
Yeah, I was jumped by one.

352
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,128
Well, you got off lucky.

353
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:37,423
Me and this girl pulled
into town this morning.

354
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,416
You don't work here?

355
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,173
No, I drive a truck.

356
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:44,430
I was headin' to San Diego
with this girl I picked up.

357
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,679
We were lookin'
for a gas station.

358
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,771
<i>That's when we spotted
one of those--</i>

359
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,891
Whatever they are.

360
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:57,481
Looked like it was eating--

361
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,401
Looked like it was eating a cat.

362
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,023
A dead cat?

363
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,530
Semi dead.

364
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:07,495
<i>Who'd want to eat a live cat?</i>

365
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,114
<i>Beats the shit out of me.</i>

366
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,208
This girl freaked out.

367
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,536
Took off running.

368
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,423
I spotted her about...

369
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,626
twenty minutes later.

370
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:25,342
<i>Looked like one
of those things had...</i>

371
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:26,430
What?

372
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,019
Torn her apart.

373
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,395
Oh, God.

374
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:40,399
Larry.

375
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,817
Oh, shit.

376
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,274
What's with her?

377
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,736
I think she's gonna be
sick or something.

378
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,862
This guy she knew--

379
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,782
<i>Same thing might have happened.</i>

380
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,001
Is it safe around here,
do you think?

381
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,465
Yeah.

382
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,800
I checked it out.

383
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,931
Swell.

384
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,223
Are you all right?

385
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,230
My name's Hector.

386
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,694
<i>What's yours?</i>

387
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:28,068
Just leave me alone, okay?

388
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,241
Look, I..

389
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,040
I know we got off
on the wrong foot.

390
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:38,252
<i>But considering what
the alternative is,</i>

391
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,963
<i>I think we should try to get along,
what do you say?</i>

392
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,091
Listen, this is no time
for an attitude problem.

393
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,635
Your little sister seems to be
taking this a lot better than you.

394
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:53,180
That's 'cause she doesn't know
what's goin' on.

395
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,519
And you do, I suppose?

396
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,639
Whatever's going on
isn't just here, it's everywhere.

397
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,640
She thinks we're
gonna be rescued.

398
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,608
That her dad's gonna
come back from Honduras

399
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:03,524
with the God damn
Green Berets.

400
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,987
She could be right.

401
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:08,446
Give us a break, Hector.

402
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,660
Where'd you spend the night
last night?

403
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,336
I spent the night in the back
of my truck with the girl I picked up.

404
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,634
What else do you want to know?

405
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:28,844
Skip it.

406
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,306
Steel's gotta be the answer.

407
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,721
If Sam spent the night
in a lawn storage shed--

408
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,475
What?

409
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,814
<i>Again, I'm an employee. I can't--</i>

410
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,480
<i>Just our way of saying Merry Christmas
to you from all--</i>

411
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,124
Testing.

412
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,498
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

413
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,386
This is Samantha Belmont,
one-third owner

414
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,807
<i>of the Greater
Los Angeles basin speaking.</i>

415
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,180
<i>You guys?</i>

416
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,308
<i>Hey, is anybody there?</i>

417
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,188
Where'd you get this,
a dime store?

418
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,732
Beats me.

419
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,857
It was given to me.

420
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:35,320
Yeah, well, it might be all right
for date night in the barrio,

421
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,492
but if we run into any more
of those guys outside,

422
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,286
we're gonna need
a little more stopping power.

423
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,459
Date night in the barrio?

424
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,593
And here's some other changes.

425
00:32:58,602 --> 00:33:00,937
Most of you guys
had finals this week.

426
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:04,523
Huh, later. They're history.
They're canceled.

427
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:08,145
The legal drinking age is now ten,
but you will need ID.

428
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,361
Let's be real.

429
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:12,232
I'll be taking requests from all you
teenage comet zombies

430
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,700
on the hit line.

431
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:19,789
That's 5-5-5-4-4-8-7.

432
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:23,284
Get it?
5-5-5-hits.

433
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,135
Do you know where the Armed
Forces Reserve Center is

434
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,754
at Los Alamitos?

435
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,427
Yeah.

436
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,891
My dad used to take us there
for target practice.

437
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,977
They store automatic
weapons there.

438
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:44,305
You know how to use 'em?

439
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,104
Come on, Hector.

440
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,521
The MAC-10
submachine gun

441
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,987
was practically designed
for housewives.

442
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,404
I got a call.

443
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,322
It came in on the hit line.

444
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,952
Hello?

445
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,289
- Hello.
- It went dead.

446
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,999
- Did they say they were okay?
- I don't know.

447
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,664
<i>They said
they were in the desert.</i>

448
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,207
<i>The desert.
What desert was it?</i>

449
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,297
<i>- I don't know.
- Shit! Think!</i>

450
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,756
<i>Why don't you just
pull your gun on her?</i>

451
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,000
<i>Maybe you can scare it
out of her.</i>

452
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,215
<i>They said they were like,
part of a think tank,</i>

453
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,633
<i>a research group
or something.</i>

454
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:17,972
<i>Where, was it in this State?</i>

455
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,637
<i>I forget.</i>

456
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,476
<i>Okay, let's take it real slow.</i>

457
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,391
<i>Did they mention a town?</i>

458
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:28,483
<i>Uh, someplace they were near,
like maybe Blythe, Bishop?</i>

459
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,476
<i>Uh, what about
Edwards Air Force Base?</i>

460
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,605
<i>If I knew, I'd tell you.
I didn't expect the call, you know.</i>

461
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,231
<i>I didn't take notes
or something.</i>

462
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,233
<i>Just try and remember.</i>

463
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,235
<i>You think I'm not telling you
something on purpose?</i>

464
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,658
Well, if they'll stay put,
we can get them.

465
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,281
From a psychological standpoint,

466
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,500
the radio station represents
a link to normalcy.

467
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,539
I don't think they'll wander far
as long as it's operating.

468
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:52,840
Dr. Carter, I'd just like to say
up front, I'm opposed to this.

469
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:55,802
<i>There's no reason for us
to bring those people</i>

470
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,046
or any other survivors
back here.

471
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,341
What about
the disintegration factor?

472
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,263
You just want
to let that happen?

473
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:06,058
We don't know that the condition
is progressive.

474
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,055
<i>I think we've
established that, Audrey.</i>

475
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:11,184
<i>Partial protection seems to result
in a slowing of the overall effect.</i>

476
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,606
But progression is steady
in any case.

477
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,482
- Drying of the body fluids--
- Oh, get to the point, Oscar!

478
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:19,609
We've heard this a thousand times.
What about the dust?

479
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,863
Ultimately, there is nothing left
but calcium dust.

480
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,536
Right, so there isn't even
enough hope

481
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,909
to warrant bringing
anybody back here.

482
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,166
So, what you're saying is,
we shouldn't even try.

483
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,378
Right.

484
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,628
We don't want to be caught
in the city after dark.

485
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:39,720
We'll leave tomorrow.

486
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,342
We've had an indication
of some survivors

487
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,221
in San Bernardino, as well--
four, maybe five.

488
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,764
<i>Wait, girls, just shut up!</i>

489
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:54,770
<i>Samantha, did they say
anything else? Anything?</i>

490
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:01,117
<i>Yeah. They said
be careful on the street.</i>

491
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,741
<i>Because some people were exposed
to the comet a little bit.</i>

492
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,499
<i>What happened to Doris
is happening to them.</i>

493
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:10,793
<i>Only slower.</i>

494
00:36:12,462 --> 00:36:16,458
<i>And like... they're dangerous.</i>

495
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,802
<i>Like what happened to Larry.</i>

496
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,166
You're not gonna blame me
because the phone went dead.

497
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,167
I'm not the phone company.

498
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,887
Nobody's the phone company
anymore.

499
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:18,777
What?

500
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,484
Cops?

501
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,866
Where were you guys earlier?

502
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:36,287
Oh, shit.
My license.

503
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,420
Oh, shit!

504
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,634
I know you guys are probably going
to give me a ticket or something,

505
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:52,762
but I am really glad to see--

506
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,242
<i>It's the weekend comet sale.</i>

507
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,239
<i>Everything must go.</i>

508
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,662
<i>Big savings on tuners,
turntables, car stereos.</i>

509
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,205
<i>Also demos
and crate damaged items.</i>

510
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,500
<i>This weekend only.
Henry's Stereo Warehouse.</i>

511
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:20,248
<i>Fourth and Alameda.
Free coffee for the adults.</i>

512
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,544
<i>Free balloons for the kids.</i>

513
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,299
<i>Number one.</i>

514
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,470
This is from your stepmom,
you punk.

515
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,846
They're here, they're here!

516
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,311
- What's wrong?
- It's okay, I got it.

517
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,897
- You've got her?
- Yeah, I got her!

518
00:40:06,988 --> 00:40:08,822
Sammy, Sam, it's only a dream.

519
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,821
I know.

520
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,905
I know.

521
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,159
Is there anything I can do?

522
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,253
I'm fine.

523
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,006
<i>Interstate Technologies
is an equal opportunity employer.</i>

524
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:29,172
<i>Looks like the weather
is shaping up for a great weekend.</i>

525
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:30,294
<i>You know, it's hard to believe
that there's</i>

526
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:32,968
<i>only 11 more shopping days
till Christmas.</i>

527
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,556
<i>Good luck finding
a parking space</i>

528
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,050
<i>within hitchhiking distance
of a mall.</i>

529
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,677
<i>You know how jammed
it can get.</i>

530
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:47,895
She Okay?

531
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:51,365
Yeah.
I guess so.

532
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,615
Come on in, have a seat.

533
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:02,914
Listen.

534
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,788
I have to go
to San Diego tomorrow.

535
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:07,998
Why?

536
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,509
My mom.

537
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:14,425
Some friends, my sister.

538
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,640
But you know they're gone.

539
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,100
I know, but...

540
00:41:19,352 --> 00:41:20,640
I still have to find out.

541
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:22,730
I mean, you guys know for sure,
but I don't know.

542
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,902
Did you have like,
a close family?

543
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:31,860
Yeah.

544
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,609
Pretty close.

545
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,116
You?

546
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,331
No, not really.

547
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,326
My real mom hung around
till my dad came back from Viet Nam

548
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,793
and then she split.

549
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,208
So, it's been mostly
me and Sam.

550
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:51,209
And Dad
and Third Special Forces.

551
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:52,630
Smoke Bomb Hill.

552
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,054
Fort Bragg.

553
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:04,100
But, then around
about sixth or seventh grade,

554
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:06,144
it became real obvious
that we weren't boys

555
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:08,234
<i>and we were never gonna go
to ranger school.</i>

556
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,656
So, I guess Dad figured
there was nothing more to offer us.

557
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,116
So, he found us a new mom.

558
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,824
Went off looking for a war.

559
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,826
What about the um...

560
00:42:28,421 --> 00:42:29,755
the guy?

561
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,006
Larry?

562
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:35,629
Oh, he and I weren't going steady
or anything like that.

563
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:54,363
Look, don't go
to San Diego, okay?

564
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,731
I have to.

565
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,659
But I'll be back.

566
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,531
Please, okay?

567
00:43:09,629 --> 00:43:11,588
What'll you give me
if I come back?

568
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:20,385
Texas.

569
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:24,301
<i>I'll give you Florida.</i>

570
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,099
<i>Florida and Texas.</i>

571
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,473
<i>Florida, Texas, and Hawaii.</i>

572
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:31,021
<i>Hawaii?</i>

573
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,064
<i>I wanted Hawaii.</i>

574
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,111
<i>When I come back...</i>

575
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,691
<i>I'll take you to dinner.</i>

576
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,283
<i>Your choice.</i>

577
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:58,801
Here.

578
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:16,110
Great.

579
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,864
See, this is the problem
with these things.

580
00:44:26,873 --> 00:44:28,582
Daddy would have
gotten us Uzis.

581
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,578
The car didn't know
the difference.

582
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,094
So, did you make it
with him last night?

583
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,262
Who?

584
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,260
The good humor man,
who do you think'?

585
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,688
Jeez, is that
what's buggin' you'?

586
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,227
That's no answer, man?

587
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:57,278
No, I didn't make it with him
last night.

588
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:58,691
Why are you so
weirded out?

589
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,689
Oh, right, Reg,
why should I be weirded out?

590
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,283
My sister, who swiped every guy
I ever had my eye on,

591
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:06,449
has now swiped the last guy
in the whole freaked-out world.

592
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:50,201
Mom!

593
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,379
<i>Mother.</i>

594
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,170
Ma?

595
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:28,796
I don't know who you are
out there, but I have a gun.

596
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:32,592
So, if I were you,
I'd split while I had a chance.

597
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,894
Okay?

598
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,199
Look kid, just stay away,
we don't want any!

599
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:54,738
Shit!

600
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:58,288
Get outta here,
you little creep.

601
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,257
<i>Lucky for you I like kids.</i>

602
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,267
Jesus!
There goes the neighborhood.

603
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:38,411
Shit.

604
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:46,332
Audrey, what's the code?

605
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:50,631
<i>Mm.</i>

606
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,354
We found survivors.

607
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:12,031
How long will
the blood tests take?

608
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:17,033
Not long.

609
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:21,124
I've talked with some of the others
and we decided that it would be

610
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:24,086
more beneficial to conduct
the blood tests in the field.

611
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:27,339
So, I want you to go to L.A.
with the rest of the group.

612
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,671
Whatever the majority wants.

613
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:39,392
<i>You don't seem to hold majority rule
in very high regard.</i>

614
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,769
<i>If something's wrong, it's wrong.</i>

615
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,934
<i>Majority rule doesn't have
anything to do with it.</i>

616
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,525
But it goes straight
to the core purpose of our group,

617
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,269
which is to survive.

618
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:51,271
You'll grant me that?

619
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,151
The core purpose never included
bringing outsiders to the facility.

620
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:02,346
It's about the twelfth can
you've downed this morning.

621
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:03,681
Thirsty.

622
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:06,396
Yeah, well, what are you going to do
when your complexion freaks out?

623
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:08,732
Dermatologist is dead,
you know.

624
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,226
I know, and I'm getting a rash
or something too.

625
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,570
Oh, God, you and your rashes.

626
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,985
Hey, I'm sorry if the end of the world
makes me a little nervous.

627
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,785
So, do you like him?

628
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:28,668
Come on, Sam.

629
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,833
I'm just interested.

630
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,709
Yeah, well, I guess so.

631
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:37,928
I mean, he's nice.

632
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:43,012
There was this new guy
at school, Paul Morgan.

633
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:46,395
He transferred from Taft.
Junior.

634
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:48,354
Oh, I don't hang around
with juniors much.

635
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,518
I liked him.

636
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,610
<i>Mm.</i>

637
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:58,699
I mean,
he was from Taft, but...

638
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:02,402
he was nice.

639
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,877
Kathy said he was probably
going to ask me out.

640
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,249
Kathy.

641
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:19,006
She was flunking algebra
and she was trying to figure out

642
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:21,300
some way to keep
her parents from finding out.

643
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,560
This was a really
lucky break for her.

644
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,022
No wonder
I'm breaking out.

645
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:37,112
Think we could
go home and change?

646
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,275
Look.

647
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,612
Why don't we get
a little creative?

648
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,030
What?

649
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:45,870
Do you have your, uh--
Do you have your MasterCard on ya?

650
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,284
No.

651
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,533
Good, 'cause you don't need it.

652
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,581
The stores are open!

653
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,777
Hey, Reg, which do
you like better?

654
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:07,368
This or this.

655
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,660
Um, the second one.
Yeah, definitely.

656
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,955
- How come?
- 'Cause it'll stay in style longer.

657
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,123
<i>Come on.</i>

658
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:17,336
<i>I guess you're right, actually.</i>

659
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:19,330
<i>Yeah, we gotta think
of these things, you know?</i>

660
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,900
All right, let's do it.

661
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,032
<i>You know,
I've been thinking.</i>

662
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:52,326
Don't set any dangerous
precedents.

663
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:54,791
What if Hector's got
the same problem we have?

664
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:56,330
Such as?

665
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:58,454
Such as no guys.

666
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,879
What?

667
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:02,124
Really.

668
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,881
I mean, what if Hector's gay?

669
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,714
I'm sure.

670
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:12,593
Think it over. You said he didn't
come on to you last night.

671
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:13,764
<i>So?</i>

672
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:15,637
So, that means
that the last guy on Earth

673
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,935
is either a gentleman
or a fag.

674
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,275
I mean, what are the odds.
In L.A.?

675
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,570
<i>Things could be very interesting
around here, Regina.</i>

676
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:41,455
Attention shoppers.

677
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:45,550
<i>I trust you've got credit cards
to pay for all that stuff.</i>

678
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:16,665
<i>What's the matter?
Lost something?</i>

679
00:56:16,665 --> 00:56:19,910
<i>Check with lost and found
on the second floor.</i>

680
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,412
<i>Didn't find this one.</i>

681
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:34,098
You dirty rat.

682
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:37,719
<i>Get her, boys.</i>

683
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:32,778
Whoa!

684
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:40,994
Bummer.

685
00:58:04,231 --> 00:58:05,269
Mommy.

686
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,607
<i>Take it easy.</i>

687
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,235
Well, I think it's time
to take the high ground.

688
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,410
Listen, you guys.

689
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:24,330
We're expecting
some friends here any minute.

690
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,168
Look, you just split now, okay?

691
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,662
And we'll tell them
not to hurt you.

692
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:28,914
Yeeah!

693
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,253
No imagination.

694
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,907
- Look, over there.
- Sitting duck.

695
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:08,874
<i>Hey!</i>

696
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,039
<i>Hey!</i>

697
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:14,297
Eat glass, creeps.

698
00:59:15,844 --> 00:59:17,837
<i>How'd you like that?</i>

699
00:59:22,017 --> 00:59:23,851
You guys are a bunch of wimps.

700
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:25,265
You can't hit anything.

701
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:28,519
Hi.

702
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,481
Uh!

703
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,442
♪ Da-da. ♪

704
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,033
<i>Get her.</i>

705
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,463
Knock that shit off.

706
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:09,014
Hello out there
in television land.

707
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,980
All right, here's the deal.

708
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:17,151
If bachelorette number one
isn't out here in half a tick,

709
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:20,446
I'm gonna ice
bachelorette number two.

710
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,909
Got it?

711
01:00:37,676 --> 01:00:38,793
Come on.

712
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:44,723
Let her go!

713
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:49,980
I'm sorry, miss, I can't have you
holding one of my people hostage.

714
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,100
Even if you pull the trigger,
I can still take him out.

715
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:54,146
And you.

716
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:55,894
Come on, Willy, she means it.

717
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,487
Miss, you're not
getting the point.

718
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:01,608
I can't have you holding
one of my people hostage.

719
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,743
You're crazy!

720
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,993
I'm not crazy,
I just don't give a fuck!

721
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:14,537
<i>What do you think,
20, 30 minutes?</i>

722
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:15,584
<i>No more.</i>

723
01:01:15,589 --> 01:01:17,708
They could be anywhere by now.

724
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:18,879
Let's go back.

725
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:20,752
Let's apply a little
deductive reasoning.

726
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,048
Deductive reasoning?

727
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,515
Where would adolescents
with nothing to do go?

728
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:37,397
<i>See, we worked really had
to get ahead in this business, girls.</i>

729
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:40,112
<i>And we don't get shit for it!</i>

730
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:43,658
But we do it
because we know

731
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,777
we can work our way up
through the system.

732
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,153
And the system works.

733
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:52,205
Why, just a few days ago,
we were only stock boys.

734
01:01:52,209 --> 01:01:54,294
Now we own the store.

735
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:56,379
The American way.

736
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,543
And then this happens.

737
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:02,294
What are you talking about?

738
01:02:02,302 --> 01:02:04,796
Well, I'm talking about you.

739
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:07,014
Coming in here
and ripping us off!

740
01:02:07,015 --> 01:02:08,303
What do you want?

741
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:09,926
You want us to pay for it, what?

742
01:02:13,605 --> 01:02:16,566
You wouldn't believe
what we want from you.

743
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:22,189
In your worst nightmare,
you wouldn't believe.

744
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,693
Let's play a game!

745
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:29,411
It's called scary noises.

746
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:32,957
<i>This is the closest shopping arcade.</i>

747
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:36,419
But the whole area is an absolute
monument to consumerism.

748
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,412
All we can do is hope.

749
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,460
Check all the floors
including the basement.

750
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:51,017
<i>Isn't that a scary noise?</i>

751
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,477
Wanna hear it again?

752
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:56,143
<i>Gosh, the suspense
is killing me.</i>

753
01:02:58,233 --> 01:02:59,726
Let's do it again.

754
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,484
<i>An E-ticket attraction.</i>

755
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,073
Let's do it again.

756
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,158
<i>Now, wait a minute.</i>

757
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:15,124
I don't think there's really
a bullet in here.

758
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:19,041
No, now see there, it's loaded.

759
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:22,256
I just needed to be
a little more patient.

760
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:25,422
I think this is it, girls.
I really do.

761
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:53,154
Uh... we're not with these guys.

762
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:55,532
<i>Really, like,
we just met 'em an hour ago.</i>

763
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:59,953
I mean,
look at this stuff that we have.

764
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,329
Look at this skirt...

765
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:02,706
<i>It's ironic.</i>

766
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:05,879
<i>Of all the great minds of the world,
all the great intellects,</i>

767
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:07,627
<i>who should survive?</i>

768
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:09,299
<i>Or almost survive.</i>

769
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:13,136
<i>I don't have to see the result
of the blood test.</i>

770
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:15,934
I can guess what they say
about that one.

771
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,022
You're right.

772
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,984
It would be senseless
to take her back.

773
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,354
<i>Look, I'll stay
and take care of it.</i>

774
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:29,733
Then if this Hector person shows up,
I can run tests on him too.

775
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:33,157
Of course, uh, it would be
out of the question

776
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:35,075
to let you remain
by yourself.

777
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,498
I'll stay here with you.

778
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:01,480
<i>Listen, thanks
for suggesting that I wait for Hector.</i>

779
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:03,315
<i>I mean, I know Reggie'll
probably get him,</i>

780
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,105
<i>but I'd like to have
a shot at it.</i>

781
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,728
<i>Samantha,
I need you to lie down.</i>

782
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:10,698
Hector's not exactly
a fox, but...

783
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:14,994
considering what's left,
he's not bad.

784
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:16,908
He sounds cute.

785
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,076
Is he coming back?

786
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:19,198
Yeah.

787
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:22,251
<i>But we should wait for him
at the radio station.</i>

788
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:25,079
<i>That's where he'll go.</i>

789
01:05:25,088 --> 01:05:26,251
<i>What's that?</i>

790
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:29,626
Um, I'm gonna give
you something.

791
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,502
For what?

792
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:35,882
Well, your skin's been
a little irritated.

793
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,474
Yeah, a rash.

794
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:41,562
It could be a rash, but it could also
be something else.

795
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:43,101
It's one of the main
symptoms of--

796
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:44,314
The comet, no.

797
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:49,153
See, I always get rashes like,
when I have a fight with Doris

798
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:51,113
or I break up with a boyfriend.

799
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:52,277
It's nerves, and you know,

800
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:54,617
the way things have been going
around here lately,

801
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:57,077
I'm surprised I don't look
like strawberry Jell-O.

802
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:03,664
But if I do have that stuff,
this'll get rid of it, right?

803
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:07,876
- Yeah.
- God, you had me worried.

804
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:10,920
Don't worry.

805
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:13,302
Just a pinch, now.

806
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:15,342
Ow!

807
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:23,062
So you guys are like,
geniuses, right?

808
01:06:24,189 --> 01:06:27,480
Yeah, I thought so.

809
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:37,617
We have a couple
of geniuses at my school.

810
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,408
Yeah?

811
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:43,158
Yeah, they're both wimps.

812
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:01,221
Is, uh...

813
01:07:02,977 --> 01:07:04,265
Is that it?

814
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:08,895
What did you want me
to do, Oscar?

815
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,939
Take her out back
and shoot her in the head?

816
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:16,737
I simply meant
I was glad it was... painless.

817
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:20,286
I don't think
we have to stay around.

818
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:23,406
She didn't think
that he was coming back.

819
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,871
I feel we can wait.

820
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:29,162
But, uh...

821
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:34,508
I-- I feel the radio station is
the more logical place.

822
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:42,934
Listen, Oscar, you were right about
the condition being progressive.

823
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:47,556
But it is also accelerating,
apparently.

824
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:49,774
We don't have weeks.

825
01:07:49,774 --> 01:07:51,267
We have maybe hours.

826
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:52,644
<i>I don't know.</i>

827
01:07:52,652 --> 01:07:53,895
We have a commitment.

828
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,522
But I do know, I don't have
enough to debate the issue.

829
01:07:56,531 --> 01:08:00,868
I am not going to be a party
to taking anybody else back.

830
01:08:00,868 --> 01:08:02,406
You have to live up to it.

831
01:08:04,205 --> 01:08:06,699
What do you expect
me to do, Oscar?

832
01:08:06,708 --> 01:08:08,417
Go for my gun?

833
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:10,752
Of course not.

834
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:52,999
<i>Hey, it's 450 FM in the PM.</i>

835
01:08:53,004 --> 01:08:56,215
<i>I'm Steve LaBeau, and you're listening
to 50,000 watts of rock and roll</i>

836
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:58,834
<i>at tower of power
over the City of Angels.</i>

837
01:09:18,946 --> 01:09:20,939
Reggie?

838
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:22,441
Merry Christmas.

839
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,197
Reggie?

840
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:36,087
Samantha?

841
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:44,300
- Hi.
- Hm.

842
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:45,468
Hi.

843
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:51,975
Did you happen to see
two girls runnin' around here?

844
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:53,517
One's a cheerleader.

845
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:57,568
I'm not thinking straight.

846
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:00,688
I wrote everything down, but...

847
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:02,110
I think I misspelled it.

848
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:03,653
That pad on the table.

849
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:07,911
You need this?

850
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:09,576
No, thanks, I have one.

851
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:14,293
Seems to be the perfect
Christmas gift this year.

852
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,122
I'm gonna miss Christmas.

853
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,000
Permanently.

854
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:28,383
<i>I want you to know that I thought
they were talking hypothetically.</i>

855
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:30,680
Until they found
the first survivors.

856
01:10:30,685 --> 01:10:32,144
Then they really did it.

857
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:37,149
Some of those survivors
were just kids.

858
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:39,860
Hey, wait a minute.
What's all this about blood?

859
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:45,323
They think they can
generate a serum.

860
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:47,742
A serum?

861
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:51,706
<i>We were exposed.
Not a lot. Just enough.</i>

862
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:55,455
They left the ventilating
ducts wide open.

863
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,294
The fans going.

864
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:59,539
Very scientific.

865
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:01,165
Very stupid.

866
01:11:03,551 --> 01:11:05,465
In 36 hours

867
01:11:07,013 --> 01:11:11,100
you will be able to vacuum up
the last of them up from the carpet.

868
01:11:13,561 --> 01:11:16,305
<i>Hey, you know what?</i>

869
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,026
She was right.

870
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:22,486
You are cute.

871
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:25,986
Santa Claus.

872
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:39,666
Hey.

873
01:11:58,105 --> 01:11:59,814
<i>Have you ever had hepatitis?</i>

874
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:01,559
Darn tags.

875
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:02,980
Do you have a pair of scissors?

876
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:05,400
No.

877
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:06,647
Have you ever had hepatitis?

878
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:11,285
Cute kids.

879
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:13,279
<i>They a part of you guys?</i>

880
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,121
<i>No.</i>

881
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:18,617
They're survivors
just like you are.

882
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:19,869
Neat girl, huh?

883
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:22,166
If you like the type.

884
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,880
Come on, kids,
come with me.

885
01:12:26,551 --> 01:12:28,044
<i>Have you ever had hepatitis?</i>

886
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:34,466
No, I had mono once, though.

887
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:36,844
Caught if from this guy
named Randy Sharp.

888
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:38,808
Anemia?

889
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:40,643
No.

890
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:42,562
<i>- Are you pregnant?
- Nope.</i>

891
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:43,901
Thought I was once, though.

892
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:47,063
That's not important.

893
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,315
That's what you think.

894
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:51,487
That was the longest
three weeks of my life.

895
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:58,703
You know I can't remember.

896
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:01,543
How much blood were we expected
to get from these people?

897
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:06,753
- Uh, 300 ccs, yes, that's it.
- That can't be right.

898
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:10,093
If we draw 300 ccs a day,
they'll expire altogether.

899
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:13,840
<i>No, I don't think so, now that
we've terminated brain functions.</i>

900
01:13:13,848 --> 01:13:15,591
I mean, they're brain dead.

901
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,344
All they can do now
is manufacture blood.

902
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:21,597
Well, maybe.

903
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:26,898
Well, we aren't going to get anything
like 300 ccs out of those children.

904
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:28,817
<i>No, but we will
out of that teenager.</i>

905
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,940
I hope she's just
as healthy as she looks.

906
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:33,192
Boy, did you see her hair?

907
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,569
What I've give
to have hair like that.

908
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:38,531
What is this place?

909
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,247
Do you have diabetes?

910
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,290
I mean, is this
some sort of, I don't know,

911
01:13:44,295 --> 01:13:45,879
underground hospital,
or what?

912
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:51,009
You're a very strong willed
young lady.

913
01:13:52,345 --> 01:13:53,633
Cancer.

914
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:56,139
You have cancer?

915
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,509
No, I am a Cancer.

916
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:01,887
I just want to know where I am
and what I'm doing here.

917
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:16,572
<i>Oops.</i>

918
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:19,037
Oh, gosh, uh, could you hand me
that arterial--

919
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:19,996
Got it.

920
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:31,004
Well, it's up
to the respirators now.

921
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:32,546
Why don't we prep
the children?

922
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:35,796
When we're finished with them,
we can start on that girl.

923
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:37,423
They're so cute.

924
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:38,639
I love working with kids.

925
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:42,348
<i>Yeah.
Oh, don't forget the lights.</i>

926
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:48,851
Are you taking any medication?

927
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:58,698
Have you had any medication
within the last 24 hours?

928
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:02,615
Where's my sister?

929
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:08,962
Dr. Carter,
may I see you a moment?

930
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:11,839
All right.

931
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:14,593
<i>I mean, she should be here
by now, shouldn't she?</i>

932
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:16,257
<i>Even if Hector didn't show up?</i>

933
01:15:16,262 --> 01:15:17,675
Your sister's dead.

934
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:23,101
What?

935
01:15:23,102 --> 01:15:26,222
I realize this comes
as a shock,

936
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:27,689
<i>but she had been exposed,</i>

937
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:30,525
<i>and in 48 hours
she would have died anyway.</i>

938
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:33,566
It was quite painless
I can assure you.

939
01:15:41,245 --> 01:15:43,739
My, you both have nice,
strong hearts.

940
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:45,116
Are we gonna get shots?

941
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:48,707
No, no shots, I promise.

942
01:15:49,754 --> 01:15:51,793
- Audrey?
- Not back yet.

943
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,166
Listen, we may have a situation
on our hands here.

944
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:56,715
I can't locate Rogers
anyplace in the compound.

945
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,758
<i>Shi...</i>

946
01:15:58,763 --> 01:16:00,506
I can't rule out the possibility

947
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:02,724
that he may already
have gone into transition.

948
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:08,267
We can't wait for Audrey.

949
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:10,857
You're gonna have to start with
the children and that one in there.

950
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:12,726
We need blood
to develop the serum.

951
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:15,528
We don't have enough
for everyone.

952
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,657
We're not robots, Doctor.

953
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:22,027
We're not all gonna fall over
at one time.

954
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:24,280
Some of us
will last a little longer

955
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:27,374
while others of us
have more immediate need.

956
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:30,118
You're smart.
You can figure that out.

957
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:33,748
<i>Psychology? not an exact
science, but my God, man,</i>

958
01:16:33,756 --> 01:16:35,920
<i>anybody can add two and two!</i>

959
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:42,340
<i>I'm very sorry
about your sister.</i>

960
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:44,467
It's a tragedy.

961
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:46,935
It, uh, it truly is.

962
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:58,280
And I can understand your hostility,
but no matter how upset you are,

963
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:01,741
breaking an expensive piece
of equipment won't solve anything.

964
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:04,907
I mean,
striking out at inanimate objects

965
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:06,871
<i>is really quite childish.</i>

966
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:09,207
Even you should be able
to realize that.

967
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:13,496
Jerk.

968
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:44,534
Howdy, partner.
How you doin'?

969
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:48,455
- Who are you?
- My names Hec.

970
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:50,915
Hec Gomez.

971
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:55,378
Hey, them's real fine duds
you got there.

972
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:57,714
<i>You a Maytag repairman?</i>

973
01:17:57,715 --> 01:17:59,128
How'd you find this place?

974
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:03,925
Well, uh, this lady
back in L.A. sent me.

975
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:06,389
Hey, you been to L.A. lately?

976
01:18:06,390 --> 01:18:08,179
It's cleaned out, man,
I'm tellin' ya.

977
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:10,598
Hey, come here,
I wanna show you somethin'.

978
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:11,561
Come on.

979
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:17,477
Hey, you know how the Harbor Freeway's
always bumper to bumper?

980
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:19,898
Well, you can go 150 miles
an hour if you want to.

981
01:18:20,446 --> 01:18:22,485
Me and this baby.

982
01:18:22,489 --> 01:18:25,609
We go through them freeways
like turkey crap through a tin horn.

983
01:18:31,415 --> 01:18:32,532
Hey, uh...

984
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:37,212
You like girls?

985
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:40,169
Look in here.

986
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:48,386
- She's dead.
- She ain't dead.

987
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,850
See, this lady shot her up
with sodium pentothal

988
01:18:50,851 --> 01:18:52,640
and make this fella think
she was dead.

989
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:54,054
Uh!

990
01:18:56,357 --> 01:18:59,773
So you wouldn't suck
her blood out, you asshole.

991
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:04,943
Son of a bitch!

992
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:09,073
Shit!

993
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:21,294
<i>Excuse me, everyone.</i>

994
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:23,383
<i>I'm afraid our adolescent
guest has escaped.</i>

995
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:26,299
She's quite hostile.

996
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:28,717
She may have already
gone topside, so please,

997
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:30,932
<i>take a moment
to look around you.</i>

998
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:55,912
Check those rooms
and I'll check this one.

999
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:55,864
Let's go.

1000
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:05,538
Everything's under control.

1001
01:22:05,546 --> 01:22:06,709
Good.

1002
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:38,069
You said no shots.

1003
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:39,662
This isn't a shot, sweetheart.

1004
01:22:39,663 --> 01:22:41,702
It'll just--

1005
01:22:41,707 --> 01:22:45,419
You'll just giggle and then
you'll feel a little sleepy.

1006
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:46,753
That's right.

1007
01:22:46,753 --> 01:22:49,247
And when you wake up,
do you know where you'll be?

1008
01:22:49,256 --> 01:22:52,672
- Where?
- With Santa Claus at the North Pole.

1009
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:56,843
In fact, you'll live with Santa Claus
for the rest of your life.

1010
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:59,387
Hey, there's no such thing
as Santa Claus.

1011
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:00,725
<i>What?</i>

1012
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,432
You don't believe in Santa?

1013
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:24,657
Life support systems.

1014
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:27,703
Wilson, come with me.

1015
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:30,380
- Keep an eye on her.
- Right.

1016
01:23:30,380 --> 01:23:32,715
<i>Now, Wilson!</i>

1017
01:23:32,716 --> 01:23:35,256
<i>Forget the door!
Turn off the alarm!</i>

1018
01:23:39,223 --> 01:23:40,306
Uh!

1019
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:52,648
<i>I don't know.</i>

1020
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:56,148
<i>My parents told me never
to breathe anything from strangers.</i>

1021
01:23:56,156 --> 01:23:57,239
Hey!

1022
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:00,360
Get your hands up.

1023
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:08,410
What are you guys doing?

1024
01:24:08,418 --> 01:24:10,002
They said if we breathe this,

1025
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:13,794
we could go to the North Pole
and see Santa Claus.

1026
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:15,588
That's so sick.

1027
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:16,630
Hey!

1028
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:18,128
Holy shit!

1029
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:19,504
- Whoa.
- Sam?

1030
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:20,756
I give, I give.

1031
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:22,890
They said you were dead.

1032
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:25,977
They were exaggerating totally.

1033
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:28,438
- Hey, that's a great outfit.
- Thanks.

1034
01:24:28,438 --> 01:24:29,931
<i>Is that guy
in the hallway dead?</i>

1035
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:32,775
Don't.

1036
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:45,117
Well?

1037
01:24:49,501 --> 01:24:52,371
You can give up
if you want to, Wilson.

1038
01:24:55,591 --> 01:24:58,256
But we still have
the two children and that girl.

1039
01:25:00,345 --> 01:25:01,508
I forgot my football.

1040
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:02,630
We'll get you another football.

1041
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:04,132
We'll get you a stadium.

1042
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:08,136
Now.

1043
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:22,654
Get everybody topside.
Now!

1044
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:23,617
What about them?

1045
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:26,029
Screw them.

1046
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:35,251
<i>Okay, kids, going up.</i>

1047
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:37,294
Put your hands down, kids.

1048
01:25:37,758 --> 01:25:39,672
God, don't be so stupid.

1049
01:25:52,147 --> 01:25:54,482
- Come on, kids!
- Who are the kids?

1050
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:55,942
- I'm Brian.
- I'm Sarah.

1051
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:58,152
Yeah, and I'm Aunt Reg
and that's Aunt Sam

1052
01:25:58,153 --> 01:25:59,646
and that's Uncle Hector.

1053
01:25:59,655 --> 01:26:00,818
Can I have my bunny?

1054
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:03,487
In a minute.
Beat feet, Uncle Hector.

1055
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:04,780
Uncle Hector?

1056
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:06,744
<i>Hey, it's my bunny, you know?</i>

1057
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:16,125
Where have you been?

1058
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:17,372
<i>Can we change this?</i>

1059
01:26:17,381 --> 01:26:19,045
Arranging a hotfoot
for your friends.

1060
01:26:19,049 --> 01:26:20,713
I really hate this music.

1061
01:26:20,717 --> 01:26:22,085
Give me a break!

1062
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:25,843
What are you doing?

1063
01:26:25,847 --> 01:26:29,593
I'm not kidding,
I get car sick without my bunny.

1064
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:31,936
Come on, Reg,
give the kid the bunny.

1065
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:33,851
We've stopped,
why have we stopped?

1066
01:26:33,855 --> 01:26:36,895
- Son of a--
- Don't shoot them, you idiot.

1067
01:26:36,900 --> 01:26:39,690
Okay, kids, cover your eyes
for Uncle Hector.

1068
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:44,528
Hey!

1069
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:45,867
Think tank, huh?

1070
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:48,611
Uh, look, couldn't
we just like, leave?

1071
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:49,737
Think over this!

1072
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:52,991
We can get them.

1073
01:26:52,999 --> 01:26:56,039
<i>- Hey, we'll be taking off now.
- We have to get them.</i>

1074
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:59,039
Look us up at Chasen's.
Uh, we'll party down, huh?

1075
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:00,836
- Come on.
- Come on, come on, this is fun.

1076
01:27:02,467 --> 01:27:04,927
The kids would like to say good-bye,
it's been fun.

1077
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:06,796
Hope to see you around
real soon.

1078
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,051
Is that gasoline I smell?

1079
01:27:16,106 --> 01:27:17,440
<i>Wait, wait, don't, don't!</i>

1080
01:27:41,798 --> 01:27:43,416
Wow.

1081
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:44,633
All right, Hector.

1082
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:01,726
Let go of her!
Leave her alone!

1083
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:06,151
Hector!

1084
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:13,742
<i>- Reggie.
- It's all right.</i>

1085
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:16,662
<i>It's all right. It's okay.</i>

1086
01:28:17,834 --> 01:28:19,202
<i>I got you.</i>

1087
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:20,704
<i>It's all right.</i>

1088
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:22,376
<i>It's okay.</i>

1089
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:23,714
<i>I got you.</i>

1090
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:25,333
Shhh.

1091
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,419
<i>Okay, kids, smile, come on.</i>

1092
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,675
Oh, don't-- God, you're so cute!
You're just so cute-- wait.

1093
01:29:15,725 --> 01:29:17,810
Mr. Bunny needs to be
in this picture too.

1094
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:19,429
So, okay, that's great.

1095
01:29:19,437 --> 01:29:20,725
Can I take this jacket off?

1096
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,223
- It itches.
- No, you can't.

1097
01:29:22,232 --> 01:29:24,100
I just want to take
another picture, all right?

1098
01:29:24,109 --> 01:29:25,352
- Please?
- No.

1099
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,648
Now,
you just hold on to that.

1100
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:28,146
- Stay there. Okay, perfect.
- Oh, brother.

1101
01:29:28,154 --> 01:29:30,239
<i>There's still
a few zombies around.</i>

1102
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:33,030
<i>Don't slouch.
And Sarah--</i>

1103
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:34,151
Hold that.

1104
01:29:35,912 --> 01:29:37,280
Smile.

1105
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:40,665
<i>Did the flash go off?</i>

1106
01:29:40,667 --> 01:29:42,626
<i>Can't tell on these things.</i>

1107
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:44,916
Hey, if you're gonna throw
those guns away,

1108
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:46,209
<i>can I have one?</i>

1109
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:51,134
Don't look at me.

1110
01:29:51,136 --> 01:29:52,800
I mean, I don't know
where she gets that stuff.

1111
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:58,806
<i>Smile, Hec.</i>

1112
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:02,729
Handsome.

1113
01:30:04,608 --> 01:30:06,772
Maybe I could be
a nun or something.

1114
01:30:07,527 --> 01:30:09,737
Ooh,
I just love these pictures.

1115
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:11,989
You've only taken
about 30 of 'em.

1116
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,278
You know, we're going to need
some more film soon.

1117
01:30:13,283 --> 01:30:14,366
- Let me straighten your tie.
- Okay.

1118
01:30:15,702 --> 01:30:17,912
God, they look
like the Brady Bunch.

1119
01:30:19,497 --> 01:30:21,206
What are you waiting for?

1120
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:23,209
Can I see 'em?

1121
01:30:23,209 --> 01:30:25,043
We're waiting
for the light to change.

1122
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:26,629
We do not cross
against the light.

1123
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:32,756
Are you nuts,
Auntie Regina?

1124
01:30:33,511 --> 01:30:37,302
You may as well
face the facts, Samantha.

1125
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:41,223
The whole burden of civilization
has fallen upon us.

1126
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:45,265
What's that supposed to mean?

1127
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:50,278
It means we do not cross
against the light.

1128
01:30:52,405 --> 01:30:54,569
That's totally stupid!

1129
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,067
There's nobody here!

1130
01:30:56,076 --> 01:30:59,321
See, we're talking ghost town!

1131
01:31:07,754 --> 01:31:08,837
See what happens.

1132
01:31:14,928 --> 01:31:18,549
God, I'm sorry, but you shouldn't cross
against the light like that.

1133
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:23,720
Hey, you guys are
survivors too, huh?

1134
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:29,438
- What?
- Nothin'.

1135
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:30,400
Great car.

1136
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:33,358
Thanks, I have 23 of them.
You want to go for a ride?

1137
01:31:33,363 --> 01:31:35,402
More than you know.

1138
01:31:39,077 --> 01:31:40,615
We don't know anything
about this guy.

1139
01:31:41,663 --> 01:31:42,871
Where's he from?

1140
01:31:42,872 --> 01:31:44,160
What's his name?

1141
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:46,375
- What's your name.
- Danny Mason Keener.

1142
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:48,957
<i>Danny Mason Keener, okay?</i>

1143
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:54,341
Yeah, all right, well, just be back
by midnight, okay?

1144
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:55,880
Midnight?

1145
01:31:55,885 --> 01:31:58,971
The burden of civilization
is on us, okay?

1146
01:31:58,972 --> 01:32:00,681
Oh, yeah.

1147
01:32:00,682 --> 01:32:02,220
Bitchin', isn't it?

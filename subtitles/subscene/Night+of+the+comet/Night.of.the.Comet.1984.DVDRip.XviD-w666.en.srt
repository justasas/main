1
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,829
Since before recorded time...

2
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:47,396
it had swung through the universe
in an elliptical orbit so large ...

3
00:00:47,508 --> 00:00:52,103
that its very existence
remained a secret of time and space.

4
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:56,972
But now, in the last few years
of the 20th century,

5
00:00:57,685 --> 00:01:00,448
the visitor was returning.

6
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,796
The citizens of Earth would get an extra
Christmas present this year,...

7
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:15,767
as their planet orbited
through the tail of the comet.

8
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:19,238
Scientists predicted a light show
of stellar proportions,

9
00:01:19,341 --> 00:01:23,607
something not
seen on Earth for 65 million years.

10
00:01:23,713 --> 00:01:25,679
Indeed, not since the time...

11
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,614
that the dinosaurs
disappeared, virtually overnight.

12
00:01:33,256 --> 00:01:38,056
There were a few who saw this as more
than just a coincidence,

13
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,064
but most didn't..

14
00:02:14,932 --> 00:02:18,867
I'm showing you the top of the line here.
This is the best we have.

15
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:22,234
- This is $9.50. Now this...
- $9.50?

16
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:26,106
But wait, this is $8. Okay?
This is $7.50.

17
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,506
This lady over here,
she's wearing the $7.50.

18
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:30,045
Yeah, right.
- Let me tell you about this.

19
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:56,863
Blow on it. See? See how nice that is?
Isn't it great?

20
00:02:57,809 --> 00:02:59,276
Now, I know you got $9.50.

21
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,226
And this spring, look at it.
Isn't that nice?

22
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,629
And the other side. Look at it.
Isn't that great? It's $9.50.

23
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:23,861
Enjoy the movie.

24
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,032
Excuse me. Where's the men's room?

25
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,605
- In a minute.
- Hey, you work here or not?

26
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,767
Hey, Regina.
Regina, give that thing a rest, will you?

27
00:03:30,876 --> 00:03:31,865
In a minute, Mel.

28
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:35,174
Look, I don't pay you
to do that kind of stuff around here.

29
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,374
Regina, I want you to clean everything up,
so we can get out of here

30
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:41,818
in time to watch the comet.
- Everything's cleaned up.

31
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,180
Damn!

32
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:46,849
I want you to take this flashlight
and walk the house.

33
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:48,928
Mel, they throw things at me.

34
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,261
Who cares? Walk the house.

35
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:55,266
Have you ever been hit with Dots, Mel?
Milk Duds?

36
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:58,360
Those things hurt.
- I don't...

37
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:02,103
Oh, how are you, sir?
The refreshments are right over there.

38
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,507
Thank you.

39
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:07,306
I don't want those weirdoes cutting up
the seats, you understand?

40
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:09,382
Okay. Okay, okay.

41
00:04:10,619 --> 00:04:15,555
Replacing Reg in third place is Reg.

42
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:17,885
Third place.

43
00:04:21,764 --> 00:04:22,753
Wait a minute.

44
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:26,628
Somebody named DMK in sixth place.
When did this happen?

45
00:04:26,735 --> 00:04:31,034
Look, don't be an overachiever. You'll fit in
better with your age group, okay?

46
00:04:31,273 --> 00:04:35,140
- This is really annoying.
- Regina. Regina, look over here.

47
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,005
Regina, look at me!

48
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:38,846
Read my lips.

49
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:44,444
Flashlight. Walk house. Now.

50
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:46,515
Okay, Mel.

51
00:04:48,691 --> 00:04:52,217
- Let me take this for you.
- That's great... There go the profits.

52
00:04:52,328 --> 00:04:54,319
And listen, stay out
of the projection booth.

53
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,022
And stay away from Dupree.

54
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:57,623
I'm gonna fire that guy someday.

55
00:04:57,735 --> 00:04:59,701
He's been doing to me
what he's been doing to her in the booth.

56
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:00,929
He's been doing to me
what he's been doing to her in the booth.

57
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,503
- "David, that was a scream.”
- "You're right.”

58
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:06,741
I'll go see. You stay here.

59
00:05:06,844 --> 00:05:10,609
I'm talking about a mint-condition
print of ‘It Came from Outer Space’.

60
00:05:11,515 --> 00:05:14,109
In 3D, man. Yeah, right.

61
00:05:16,554 --> 00:05:19,613
Look, you know as well as I do
you got film freaks that'd go down on you

62
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:21,816
for a bootleg print of that.

63
00:05:23,328 --> 00:05:25,853
100 bucks? 100 bucks? Right.

64
00:05:25,964 --> 00:05:29,227
Something wrong with the phone here?
Did I hear you say $100?

65
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,927
Look, $100 isn't gonna get it this time.

66
00:05:32,536 --> 00:05:34,060
Because I'm gonna have to
spend the night in here

67
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:35,968
waiting for you to bring the print back.

68
00:05:36,073 --> 00:05:38,405
Think I'm gonna miss this comet thing
for a lousy $100?

69
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,070
"Help me!”

70
00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:43,545
Okay 110's a little better, yeah.

71
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:47,210
Hey, Reggie, here's the deal.
You leave, I let you in the backdoor.

72
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,753
Okay? I leave, you let me back in.
Mel thinks everybody's gone.

73
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:53,086
- Larry, do you know anybody named DMK?
- No.

74
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:55,658
No, you got to have the print back
by 6:00 in the morning.

75
00:05:55,761 --> 00:05:58,696
You know, if we spend the night in here,
we're gonna miss the comet.

76
00:05:58,798 --> 00:06:01,630
It's not like you can't see it
on television, you know.

77
00:06:01,734 --> 00:06:03,462
all right, hey.
Get your guy here in an hour.

78
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:06,435
Yeah, well, maybe I want to
see it for real, okay?

79
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,508
Hey, television's real.
Television's very real.

80
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:12,774
So, what do you say? I'll give you $15.

81
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,238
Are you kidding?

82
00:06:15,348 --> 00:06:17,179
We spend the night in here,
we end up making it,

83
00:06:17,284 --> 00:06:18,342
and you give me 15 bucks?

84
00:06:18,452 --> 00:06:19,749
Do you know
what that makes me look like?

85
00:06:19,853 --> 00:06:23,015
Reggie, I'm not giving you $15
for making it with me.

86
00:06:24,391 --> 00:06:26,586
Okay, well, just so
we have that straight, okay?

87
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:28,285
Yeah, for sure.

88
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:32,387
I mean, you'd be worth a lot more
than $15. Everybody knows that.

89
00:06:34,301 --> 00:06:38,566
The first earthlings to see the
effects will be in Newfoundland.

90
00:06:38,905 --> 00:06:40,566
Or, Newfoundland.

91
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:44,876
This is expected to begin at 2.04.
That's Pacific Standard Time.

92
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:46,640
Hey, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy.

93
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:51,575
...Interesting sidebar to this story
is the fact that all telecommunications

94
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:55,917
seem to be out in that part
of the world.

95
00:06:56,591 --> 00:06:58,024
This could have...

96
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:05,892
Hello?

97
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:09,095
Samantha, you sound pissed.

98
00:07:09,704 --> 00:07:12,798
I just had it out with Doris
once and for all, again.

99
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:18,301
She wants me to, like, haul chips and dips
around for her little comet party.

100
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,848
Yeah, well, speaking of Doris...
Look, I need your help.

101
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:25,510
Tell her that you know all about this
field trip that I'm gonna take, okay,

102
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:29,182
with my science class. We're gonna go
to the observatory to watch the comet.

103
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:32,748
- She won't go for it.
- She'll go for it. Just tell her, okay?

104
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,088
Okay.

105
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:42,804
Doris? Reggie's on the phone.

106
00:07:44,306 --> 00:07:46,240
She's not having car trouble?

107
00:07:46,376 --> 00:07:50,175
She's gonna be out all night
with her science class at the observatory.

108
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:52,614
I know everything.

109
00:07:55,686 --> 00:07:58,984
Yeah, hi, Doris.
- What's this about a science class, Regina?

110
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:01,954
Well, you want me to do better
in science, don't you?

111
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:04,718
I want you home in five minutes
after you finish work.

112
00:08:04,828 --> 00:08:07,228
If you wanna watch the comet,
you can do it here.

113
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:10,060
Look, Doris. I have 18 years ...

114
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:13,499
Look, Doris. Like, I'm 18, okay,
and I can watch the comet wherever
I want to watch the comet.

115
00:08:14,572 --> 00:08:17,438
Here, Samantha, you and your sister
share a lot of secrets.

116
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:19,304
I want you to share this one with her.

117
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,937
If it were up to me,
I couldn't care less what she did.

118
00:08:23,682 --> 00:08:27,173
But if your father makes it back home
without some Sandinista

119
00:08:27,284 --> 00:08:28,478
blowing his brains out,

120
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:30,885
he's gonna hold me responsible
for any kind of trouble

121
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:32,717
you two girls get into.

122
00:08:33,224 --> 00:08:35,919
What we have here is a chain of command.

123
00:08:36,026 --> 00:08:38,654
The Major jumps on me, I jump on you.

124
00:08:39,264 --> 00:08:42,427
Did you get that? Okay.

125
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:48,329
- Now, are you going to join the party?
- Join the party for what Doris?

126
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,305
So I can watch Chuck
from across the street

127
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:52,672
stick his hands down your pants?

128
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:55,379
I think that's something
Daddy should know.

129
00:08:55,648 --> 00:08:58,811
Chuck's a nice guy.
He's certainly nice to be with

130
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:00,749
while Daddy's down in Banana Land.

131
00:09:00,853 --> 00:09:04,514
You were born with an asshole, Doris.
You don't need Chuck.

132
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:16,762
Looks like a real nice crowd
we have out here tonight.

133
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:29,573
Sarah, Chucky.

134
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:32,208
Hey, where have you been? You're gonna
miss everything. It's going to start.

135
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:35,412
Oh, kids.
I'll never marry another man with kids.

136
00:09:35,522 --> 00:09:38,217
In 1910, Halley's comet returned.

137
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:41,221
Everybody thought
they were going to die then.

138
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:48,764
- What was that?
- Look!

139
00:09:57,645 --> 00:09:59,840
You wanna know what
bugs me about all this?

140
00:09:59,948 --> 00:10:01,006
What?

141
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,747
Well, I'm always afraid
someone's gonna see us, you know?

142
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:10,153
See us how? There's no windows.
They can't see through walls.

143
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,483
Well, Superman can see through walls.

144
00:10:13,661 --> 00:10:17,688
Not these walls. They're made out of steel.
Used to be a fire law.

145
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:21,398
Superman can see through steel.

146
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,271
No, it's the one thing
he cannot see through.

147
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:28,668
That's lead, you nerd.
- Lead?

148
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,509
Yeah. I mean, Superman can see through
steel like it wasn't there, even.

149
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,039
Larry!

150
00:10:36,151 --> 00:10:39,086
Well, I guess I'm the only one who's not
outside watching the meteor shower.

151
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:42,223
Perhaps put the radio on autopilot
and leave me.

152
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:42,952
I just might put the radio station
on autopilot and sneak out myself.

153
00:13:18,687 --> 00:13:21,519
This is the Big K
of Los Angeles. A great-looking morning

154
00:13:21,623 --> 00:13:25,650
in southern California. 50,000 watts
of oil, steel, and passion FM in the a.m..

155
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:29,288
It's wake-up time in the City of Angels.
And I'm Steve LaBeau.

156
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:32,399
- God damn it!
- What?

157
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:33,693
What?

158
00:13:35,037 --> 00:13:36,901
I've been waiting by that door
for the last 30 minutes,

159
00:13:37,006 --> 00:13:39,337
and that pinhead hasn't brought
the film back yet.

160
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,568
Give the guy a break.
I mean, people are late sometimes.

161
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:47,315
No, something's wrong.
If he screwed that film up,

162
00:13:47,417 --> 00:13:49,816
we could all be in a lot of trouble.

163
00:13:51,253 --> 00:13:52,686
I'm gonna go over there on the bike.

164
00:13:52,789 --> 00:13:55,781
Oh, jeez!
Don't I get an Egg McMuffin or anything?

165
00:13:56,493 --> 00:13:59,461
- You could do me a favor.
- I did you a favor last night.

166
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:00,996
If that guy calls,

167
00:14:02,432 --> 00:14:06,299
you tell him I'm on my way over,
and I'm very, very, very, very pissed.

168
00:14:06,403 --> 00:14:09,735
- Hey, what about my 15 bucks?
- Tell him you're pissed, too.

169
00:14:30,195 --> 00:14:31,219
DMK.

170
00:14:36,702 --> 00:14:39,898
You trust people, you get
screwed over every goddamn time.

171
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:46,742
Is that you?
Yeah, it's about frigging time.

172
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,545
That's the end of you, DMK.
You're history.

173
00:16:31,654 --> 00:16:33,645
God, bad smog.

174
00:16:35,624 --> 00:16:36,682
Shit!

175
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:39,518
Shit!

176
00:16:41,564 --> 00:16:42,963
Oh, damn it!

177
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,565
Just great!

178
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:51,204
I don't believe this,
there's clothes everywhere!

179
00:16:55,412 --> 00:16:57,777
I hate days that start like this.

180
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:11,152
Oh, damn it, damn it!

181
00:17:24,641 --> 00:17:26,165
Eww. Gross.

182
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:34,210
Larry?

183
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,162
What is this? Trick or treat?

184
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,565
- Come here.
- What?

185
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:28,034
- Come here!
- Come here, your ass.

186
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:37,282
Alright look, I don't know what your scene
is, but don't do anything stupid, okay?

187
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:44,647
No, you don't seem to understand.
I've been trained to take care of myself.

188
00:18:44,757 --> 00:18:47,521
You know what I'm saying?
I don't want to hurt you.

189
00:18:51,332 --> 00:18:52,457
Oh, shit!

190
00:18:58,607 --> 00:18:59,596
No!

191
00:19:04,646 --> 00:19:06,136
Let go of me!

192
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:07,815
No!

193
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,554
Come on, come on, come on!

194
00:22:11,473 --> 00:22:12,531
Samantha?

195
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:16,269
Doris?

196
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,151
- Samantha?
- What?

197
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:03,684
God. What are you trying to do?
Give me a heart attack?

198
00:23:03,793 --> 00:23:06,557
- I thought you were Doris.
- You know, she decked me last night.

199
00:23:06,663 --> 00:23:08,096
Knocked one of my teeth loose, even.

200
00:23:08,198 --> 00:23:10,166
Wait till Daddy hears about that.

201
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:12,530
You know how he's always telling me
to be careful with my mouth

202
00:23:12,636 --> 00:23:15,900
on account of the dental plan
doesn't cover anything cosmetic.

203
00:23:16,005 --> 00:23:20,601
Anyway, get this. I think Chuck and Doris
spent the night together last night.

204
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:22,644
Wait till Daddy hears about that.

205
00:23:22,746 --> 00:23:26,682
I mean, even if he isn't pissed off
about my mouth, which I can't imagine.

206
00:23:27,952 --> 00:23:29,249
What's happening?

207
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:31,878
Oh, yeah, I guess you are a little confused.

208
00:23:33,425 --> 00:23:34,858
God, you look terrible.

209
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:38,588
I ran away last night after she slugged me.
Left a note and everything.

210
00:23:38,697 --> 00:23:40,891
But I didn't have any place to go,
so I spent the night

211
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:42,660
in a lawn storage shed.

212
00:23:43,001 --> 00:23:46,026
It was pretty gross with the Synerol
and everything.

213
00:23:46,204 --> 00:23:48,467
God, look at this kitchen.

214
00:23:49,574 --> 00:23:51,474
I'm not cleaning this up.

215
00:23:51,943 --> 00:23:54,309
So anyway, since I was still here
this morning,

216
00:23:54,412 --> 00:23:58,745
I thought, hey, I'll go
to pep squad practice and split after.

217
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,541
Except for I don't know
if pep squad practice is on or not.

218
00:24:01,654 --> 00:24:03,019
I can't get anybody on the phone.

219
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:07,751
Sammy, you can't get anybody
on the phone because everybody is gone.

220
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,460
What? could you grab the milk, please?

221
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:13,731
- I swear to God!
- You made me swallow my gum.

222
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:16,300
There's nobody.
I mean, there's no body!

223
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:20,403
Oh, right. Nobody. I'm sure.

224
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,307
- Come here.
- Hey!

225
00:24:23,876 --> 00:24:24,843
Back off!

226
00:24:25,044 --> 00:24:27,103
This sweater cost 80 bucks.

227
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:32,343
Muffy?

228
00:24:35,388 --> 00:24:37,219
Stupid dog.

229
00:24:37,724 --> 00:24:39,419
Look! Look at this!

230
00:24:41,295 --> 00:24:46,230
- At what?
- Doris isn't at Chuck's. I'll show you Doris.

231
00:24:48,134 --> 00:24:49,328
Here's Doris.

232
00:24:49,437 --> 00:24:52,428
This is all that's left of her,
this and dust.

233
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,268
Look, here's Chuck.

234
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,414
Where are the kids?

235
00:25:09,123 --> 00:25:12,650
It's Saturday morning.
Where are the goddamn kids?

236
00:25:37,486 --> 00:25:39,215
They're around.

237
00:25:40,089 --> 00:25:41,852
They're not around.

238
00:25:43,026 --> 00:25:46,290
Look, if you're trying to scare me,
you're doing it, okay?

239
00:25:46,729 --> 00:25:49,788
- I'm not trying to scare you.
- Then stop it.

240
00:25:49,999 --> 00:25:51,364
I'm not doing it.

241
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:55,461
You try calling someone.
Not just your pep squad. Anyone.

242
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,162
Nobody's home!

243
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,641
Unbelievable, that's song number 16
on the survey this week.

244
00:26:00,744 --> 00:26:03,712
Don't forget, we preview the top 20
every Friday night.

245
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,407
A great way to start a super weekend
here in the southland.

246
00:26:06,517 --> 00:26:07,541
Get down!

247
00:26:32,343 --> 00:26:35,870
- Are you sure this is the radio station?
- Yeah. Just go on in.

248
00:26:35,981 --> 00:26:37,312
Well, don't push.

249
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:51,954
Do you think whatever happened,
happened everywhere?

250
00:26:52,063 --> 00:26:54,224
Like in Burbank or places like that?

251
00:26:56,835 --> 00:26:59,395
We'll ask the DJ.
He does the news, doesn't he?

252
00:26:59,504 --> 00:27:02,871
Search me. I always change the channel
when the news comes on.

253
00:27:07,046 --> 00:27:08,911
Here's something in here.

254
00:27:15,121 --> 00:27:16,679
So, where is he?

255
00:27:22,328 --> 00:27:24,488
I mean, somebody has to run this stuff,
don't they?

256
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:27,461
We've got trouble. Not us.
That's the name of the song.

257
00:27:27,566 --> 00:27:28,931
And I'm Steve LaBeau
trapped inside your radio.

258
00:27:29,036 --> 00:27:30,901
The guy who really cares about you.

259
00:27:31,004 --> 00:27:32,994
I mean, who else would sit
in this little box every day

260
00:27:33,105 --> 00:27:35,164
just to play music for you?

261
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:37,869
Well, it's time to reach into
the old mailbag here. Got a letter from...

262
00:27:37,978 --> 00:27:40,071
Beam me up, Scotty.

263
00:27:40,648 --> 00:27:42,774
Okay, girls. Hold it right there.

264
00:27:42,883 --> 00:27:46,284
- You, the blonde, get into the light.
- Wait.

265
00:27:47,488 --> 00:27:49,455
Why don't you just let my sister go.

266
00:27:49,556 --> 00:27:51,182
And maybe you and I
can work something out.

267
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:52,553
- I'm not going anywhere!
- Shut up!

268
00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:54,627
You got the wrong idea.
You, into the light.

269
00:27:54,728 --> 00:27:58,993
I'll give you to five. One, two... No?

270
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:04,227
All right. Let's try it this way.
Five, four, three...

271
00:28:04,372 --> 00:28:05,703
Okay, okay.

272
00:28:06,174 --> 00:28:08,801
Do you get a lot of dates this way?

273
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:12,336
Open your eyes.

274
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,878
Okay.

275
00:28:22,223 --> 00:28:25,658
Hey, I know what you're thinking, but...
- That you're a cretin?

276
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,920
Sweetheart, you haven't seen those
freaked-out zombies running around here?

277
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:33,501
Yeah, I was jumped by one.

278
00:28:33,602 --> 00:28:35,262
Well, you got off lucky.

279
00:28:36,572 --> 00:28:38,267
Me and this girl pulled into town
this morning.

280
00:28:38,373 --> 00:28:40,102
You don't work here?

281
00:28:40,877 --> 00:28:42,606
No. I drive a truck.

282
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:46,878
I was heading to San Diego
with this girl I picked up.

283
00:28:47,383 --> 00:28:49,475
We were looking for a gas station.

284
00:28:50,754 --> 00:28:53,278
That's when we spotted one of those...

285
00:28:54,456 --> 00:28:56,083
Whatever they are.

286
00:28:57,494 --> 00:28:59,519
Looked like it was eating...

287
00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:01,520
Looked like it was eating a cat.

288
00:29:01,631 --> 00:29:03,326
A dead cat?

289
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,361
Semi-dead.

290
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,962
Who'd want to eat a live cat?

291
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,430
Beats the shit out of me.

292
00:29:11,608 --> 00:29:13,166
This girl freaked out.

293
00:29:14,278 --> 00:29:15,836
Took off running.

294
00:29:18,049 --> 00:29:22,313
I spotted her about 20 minutes later.

295
00:29:23,521 --> 00:29:26,718
- Looked like one of those things had...
- What?

296
00:29:31,462 --> 00:29:33,225
Torn her apart.

297
00:29:36,301 --> 00:29:38,029
Oh, God.

298
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:42,666
- Larry.
- Oh, shit.

299
00:29:43,975 --> 00:29:45,636
What's with her?

300
00:29:46,478 --> 00:29:49,811
I think she's going to be
sick or something.

301
00:29:49,915 --> 00:29:51,472
A guy she knew...

302
00:29:52,117 --> 00:29:54,142
Same thing might have happened.

303
00:29:58,023 --> 00:30:01,220
- Is it safe around here, do you think?
- Yeah.

304
00:30:02,395 --> 00:30:04,225
I checked it out.

305
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:09,991
Swell.

306
00:30:17,243 --> 00:30:18,608
Are you all right?

307
00:30:23,048 --> 00:30:24,413
My name's Hector.

308
00:30:25,484 --> 00:30:29,011
- What's yours?
- Just leave me alone, okay?

309
00:30:31,023 --> 00:30:35,289
Look, I... I know we got off
on the wrong foot,

310
00:30:35,963 --> 00:30:40,865
but considering what the alternative is,
I think we should try to get along.

311
00:30:40,968 --> 00:30:42,526
What do you say?

312
00:30:44,838 --> 00:30:47,932
Listen, this is no time
for an attitude problem.

313
00:30:48,209 --> 00:30:51,734
Your little sister seems to be taking this
a lot better than you.

314
00:30:52,246 --> 00:30:54,214
That's 'cause she doesn't know
what's going on.

315
00:30:54,314 --> 00:30:55,338
And you do, I suppose.

316
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:58,440
Whatever is going on isn't just here.
It's everywhere.

317
00:30:58,886 --> 00:31:01,650
She thinks we're gonna be rescued,
that our dad's gonna come back

318
00:31:01,755 --> 00:31:04,620
from Honduras
with the goddamn Green Berets.

319
00:31:04,726 --> 00:31:06,159
She could be right.

320
00:31:07,261 --> 00:31:09,320
Give us a break, Hector.

321
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:16,832
Where did you spend the night last night?

322
00:31:21,876 --> 00:31:25,538
I spent the night in the back of my truck
with the girl I picked up.

323
00:31:27,582 --> 00:31:29,948
- What else do you want to know?
- Skip it.

324
00:31:31,487 --> 00:31:33,352
Steel's gotta be the answer.

325
00:31:33,455 --> 00:31:36,252
If Sam spent the night
in the Lawn storage shed...

326
00:31:38,327 --> 00:31:39,294
What?

327
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:42,188
...again, I'm an employee. I can't.

328
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:45,563
Just our way of saying
Merry Christmas to you from all of...

329
00:32:02,552 --> 00:32:05,851
Testing, one, two, three, four.

330
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:14,093
This is Samantha Belmont,

331
00:32:14,198 --> 00:32:18,429
one-third owner of
the Greater Los Angeles Basin, speaking.

332
00:32:20,037 --> 00:32:21,527
You guys?

333
00:32:22,739 --> 00:32:24,400
Hey, is anybody there?

334
00:32:27,577 --> 00:32:30,341
Where did you get this,
a Dime Store?

335
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,110
Beats me. It was given to me.

336
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:36,179
Yeah, well, it might be all right
for date night in the barrio,

337
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,448
but if we run into any more
of those guys outside,

338
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:41,150
we're gonna need
a little more stopping power.

339
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,191
Date night in the barrio?

340
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,533
Here are other changes.

341
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,306
And here's some other changes.
Most of you guys had finals this week?

342
00:33:02,414 --> 00:33:03,034
Huh, Later.

343
00:33:03,234 --> 00:33:05,508
They are history. Canceled.

344
00:33:05,617 --> 00:33:09,883
They're history. They're cancelled.
The legal drinking age is now 10.
But, you will need ID. Let's be real.

345
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:14,648
I'll be taking take requests from all you
teenage comet zombies on the...
Hit line!

346
00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:19,892
That's 555-4487.

347
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,828
Get it? 555-HITS!

348
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:35,542
Do you know where the armed forces
reserve centre is at Los Alamitos?

349
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:36,707
Yeah.

350
00:33:37,418 --> 00:33:40,181
My dad used to take us there
for target practice.

351
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:45,124
They store automatic weapons there.
- You know how to use them?

352
00:33:46,193 --> 00:33:47,785
Come on, Hector.

353
00:33:48,162 --> 00:33:51,825
The MAC-10 submachine gun
was practically designed for housewives.

354
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:55,968
I got a call!

355
00:33:56,336 --> 00:33:59,429
It came in on the hit line.
- Hello?

356
00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:02,067
Hello?

357
00:34:02,176 --> 00:34:04,371
It went dead.
- Did they say they were okay?

358
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:06,639
I don't know.
They said they were in the desert.

359
00:34:06,747 --> 00:34:09,079
- The desert? What desert was it?
- I don't know.

360
00:34:09,184 --> 00:34:10,310
Shit! Think!

361
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:12,943
Why don't you just pull your gun
on her? Maybe you can scare it out of her!

362
00:34:14,557 --> 00:34:17,457
They said they were, like, part of a think
tank or research group or something.

363
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:19,356
Where? Was it in this state?

364
00:34:20,563 --> 00:34:23,361
- I forget.
- Okay. Let's take it real slow.

365
00:34:23,632 --> 00:34:26,233
Did they mention a town?

366
00:34:26,434 --> 00:34:29,597
Some place they were near,
like maybe Blythe, Bishop?

367
00:34:29,971 --> 00:34:32,996
- What about Edwards Air Force Base?
- If I knew, I'd tell you.

368
00:34:33,108 --> 00:34:36,168
I didn't expect the call, you know.
I didn't take notes or something.

369
00:34:36,278 --> 00:34:37,472
Just try and remember.

370
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,980
If you think I'm not telling you
something on purpose...

371
00:34:40,082 --> 00:34:41,674
Well, if they'll stay put,
we can get them.

372
00:34:41,784 --> 00:34:42,751
...leave anything out?

373
00:34:42,852 --> 00:34:45,320
From a psychological standpoint,
the radio station represents

374
00:34:45,421 --> 00:34:46,410
a link to normalcy.

375
00:34:46,522 --> 00:34:49,218
I don't think they'll wander far
as long as it's operating.

376
00:34:49,593 --> 00:34:53,460
Dr. Carter, I'd just like to say upfront.
I'm opposed to this.

377
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,589
There is no reason for us to bring
those people,

378
00:34:56,932 --> 00:34:59,162
or any other survivors back here.

379
00:35:00,402 --> 00:35:03,929
What about the disintegration factor?
You just want to let that happen?

380
00:35:04,407 --> 00:35:07,103
We don't know that
the condition is progressive.

381
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,200
I think we've established that, Audrey.

382
00:35:09,312 --> 00:35:12,372
Partial protection seems to result
in a slowing of the overall effect,

383
00:35:12,482 --> 00:35:14,450
but progression is steady in any case.

384
00:35:14,552 --> 00:35:17,884
Drying of the body fluids...
Get to the point, Oscar.

385
00:35:18,088 --> 00:35:20,716
We've heard this a thousand times.

386
00:35:20,825 --> 00:35:23,794
Ultimately, there is nothing left
but calcium dust.

387
00:35:23,895 --> 00:35:28,660
Right. So there isn't even enough hope
to warrant bringing anybody back here.

388
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:33,035
So, what you're saying is,
we shouldn't even try.

389
00:35:34,238 --> 00:35:35,205
Right.

390
00:35:37,775 --> 00:35:41,734
We don't want to be caught in the city
after dark. we'll leave tomorrow.

391
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,308
And we've had an indication
of some survivors...

392
00:35:45,416 --> 00:35:46,906
in San Bernardino as well.

393
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:47,886
Four, maybe five.

394
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:50,386
Wait a minute.
Wait, girls, just shut up.

395
00:35:50,856 --> 00:35:55,485
Samantha! Did they say
anything else? Anything?

396
00:35:58,163 --> 00:36:01,758
Yeah. They said
be careful on the street.

397
00:36:02,867 --> 00:36:06,701
Because some people were exposed
to the comet a little bit.

398
00:36:07,372 --> 00:36:11,705
What happened to Doris
is happening to them, only slower.

399
00:36:13,145 --> 00:36:17,104
And, like, they're dangerous.

400
00:36:19,419 --> 00:36:21,215
Like what happened to Larry.

401
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:59,358
You're not going to blame me
because the phone went dead.

402
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,726
I'm not the phone company.
Nobody is the phone company anymore.

403
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,506
What?

404
00:37:21,217 --> 00:37:22,309
Cops?

405
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:26,143
Where were you guys earlier?

406
00:37:34,863 --> 00:37:37,491
Oh, shit, my license.

407
00:37:38,801 --> 00:37:40,029
Oh, shit!

408
00:37:48,478 --> 00:37:50,968
I know you guys are probably going
to give me a ticket or something,

409
00:37:51,347 --> 00:37:53,042
but I'm really glad to see...

410
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,262
...the weekend comet sale.
Everything must go.

411
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,463
Big savings on tuners, turntables,
car stereos,

412
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:17,597
also demos of great damaged items.

413
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:20,438
This weekend only, Henry's
Stereo Warehouse. Fourth and Alameda.

414
00:38:20,545 --> 00:38:23,742
Free coffee for the adults.
Free balloons for the kids.

415
00:39:48,169 --> 00:39:50,660
This is for your step mom,
you little punk.

416
00:39:51,872 --> 00:39:55,864
- Ahh! They're here! They're here!
- Where?

417
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:58,376
- What's wrong?
- It's okay. I've got her.

418
00:39:58,946 --> 00:40:01,470
- You've got her?
- Yeah, I got her.

419
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:10,456
Sammy, Sam, it's only a dream.

420
00:40:11,693 --> 00:40:13,592
I know.

421
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:16,961
I know.

422
00:40:17,132 --> 00:40:19,760
...expand your career
horizons. For a clearer view of...

423
00:40:19,868 --> 00:40:21,927
Is there anything I can do?

424
00:40:23,205 --> 00:40:24,297
I'm fine.

425
00:40:24,873 --> 00:40:26,841
Interstate Technologies
is an equal-opportunity employer.

426
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:30,140
Looks like the weather is shaping up
for a great weekend.

427
00:40:30,245 --> 00:40:33,736
You know, it's hard to believe that there's
only 11 more shopping days till Christmas.

428
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:37,148
Good luck finding a parking space within
hitchhiking distance of the malls, too.

429
00:40:37,252 --> 00:40:39,447
You know how jammed it can get.

430
00:40:47,997 --> 00:40:52,456
- Is she okay?
- Yeah, I guess so.

431
00:40:55,472 --> 00:40:57,167
Come on in. Have a seat.

432
00:41:02,778 --> 00:41:06,737
Listen, I have to go
to San Diego tomorrow.

433
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,144
Why?

434
00:41:10,253 --> 00:41:11,584
My mom.

435
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:16,684
- Some friends. My sister.
- But you know they're gone.

436
00:41:17,528 --> 00:41:21,555
I know, but I still have to find out.

437
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:24,430
I mean, you guys know for sure,
but I don't know.

438
00:41:26,537 --> 00:41:28,869
Did you have, like, a close family?

439
00:41:31,875 --> 00:41:34,809
Yeah, pretty close.

440
00:41:37,682 --> 00:41:40,150
- And you?
- Not anymore.

441
00:41:41,386 --> 00:41:45,446
My real mom hung around until my dad
came back from Vietnam, then she split.

442
00:41:45,657 --> 00:41:48,922
So it's been mostly me and Sam and Dad

443
00:41:49,428 --> 00:41:51,487
and the 3rd special forces.

444
00:41:52,397 --> 00:41:56,060
Smoke Bomb Hill. Fort Bragg.

445
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,041
But then around about
sixth or seventh grade,

446
00:42:05,177 --> 00:42:07,304
it became real obvious
that we weren't boys,

447
00:42:07,413 --> 00:42:10,245
that we were never going to go
to ranger school.

448
00:42:11,383 --> 00:42:15,114
So I guess Dad figured there was
nothing more to offer us.

449
00:42:15,354 --> 00:42:19,790
So he found us a new mom
and went off looking for a war.

450
00:42:25,065 --> 00:42:27,124
What about the em...

451
00:42:29,502 --> 00:42:32,664
The guy. Larry?

452
00:42:33,306 --> 00:42:36,797
Oh, he and I weren't going steady
or anything like that.

453
00:42:52,593 --> 00:42:56,858
- Look, don't go to San Diego, okay?
- I have to.

454
00:42:58,299 --> 00:42:59,891
But I'll be back.

455
00:43:03,336 --> 00:43:04,963
Please, okay?

456
00:43:10,811 --> 00:43:13,574
What will you give me if I come back?

457
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,912
Texas.

458
00:43:24,126 --> 00:43:29,063
Could give you Florida. Florida and Texas.
Florida, Texas and Hawaii.

459
00:43:31,133 --> 00:43:35,865
- Hawaii? I wanted Hawaii.
- When I come back,

460
00:43:38,474 --> 00:43:40,566
I'll take you to dinner.

461
00:43:42,377 --> 00:43:43,674
Your choice.

462
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,486
Here.

463
00:44:15,712 --> 00:44:17,145
Great!

464
00:44:25,723 --> 00:44:27,953
See? This is the problem
with these things.

465
00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:30,050
Daddy would have gotten us Uzis.

466
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,596
The car didn't know the difference.

467
00:44:43,741 --> 00:44:46,039
So, did you make it with him last night?

468
00:44:46,277 --> 00:44:49,178
- Who?
- The Good Humor Man. Who do you think?

469
00:44:51,316 --> 00:44:54,149
- Jeez. Is that what's bugging you?
- That's no answer, man.

470
00:44:55,221 --> 00:44:57,883
No, I didn't make it with him last night.

471
00:44:58,491 --> 00:44:59,650
Why are you so weirded out?

472
00:44:59,758 --> 00:45:01,589
Oh, right, Reg.
Why should I be weirded out?

473
00:45:01,694 --> 00:45:04,161
My sister, who swiped every guy
I ever had my eye on

474
00:45:04,262 --> 00:45:07,527
has now swiped the last guy
in the whole freaked-out world.

475
00:45:50,077 --> 00:45:51,442
Mom?

476
00:45:57,084 --> 00:45:58,108
Mother?

477
00:46:01,256 --> 00:46:02,552
Mom.

478
00:47:27,111 --> 00:47:29,978
I don't know who you are out there,
but I have a gun.

479
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:34,076
So if I were you,
I'd split while I had a chance.

480
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,711
Okay?

481
00:47:47,899 --> 00:47:50,867
Look, kid, just stay away.
We don't want any.

482
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:55,430
Shit!

483
00:47:57,743 --> 00:48:00,142
Get out of here, you little freak.

484
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:10,986
Lucky for you I like kids.

485
00:48:18,764 --> 00:48:21,164
Jeez! There goes the neighborhood.

486
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:39,308
Shit.

487
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:47,359
Audrey, what's the code?

488
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:10,578
We found survivors.

489
00:49:11,385 --> 00:49:13,785
How long will the blood test take?

490
00:49:17,058 --> 00:49:18,184
Not long.

491
00:49:18,293 --> 00:49:21,557
I've talked with some of the others,
and we've decided

492
00:49:21,662 --> 00:49:26,065
that it would be more beneficial
to conduct the blood tests in the field.

493
00:49:26,235 --> 00:49:29,635
So I want you to go to LA
with the rest of the group.

494
00:49:29,738 --> 00:49:31,763
Whatever the majority wants.

495
00:49:36,913 --> 00:49:40,438
You don't seem to hold
majority rule in very high regard.

496
00:49:41,016 --> 00:49:42,916
If something's wrong, it's wrong.

497
00:49:43,018 --> 00:49:45,816
Majority rule doesn't have anything
to do with it.

498
00:49:46,156 --> 00:49:48,419
But it goes straight
to the core purpose of our group,

499
00:49:48,524 --> 00:49:49,957
which is to survive.

500
00:49:50,359 --> 00:49:52,122
You'll grant me that?

501
00:49:52,328 --> 00:49:56,423
The core purpose never included
bringing outsiders to the facility.

502
00:51:00,999 --> 00:51:03,490
That's about the twelfth can
you've downed this morning.

503
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:04,661
Thirsty.

504
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,533
Yeah, well, what're you gonna do
when your complexion freaks out?

505
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:09,765
Dermatologist is dead, you know.

506
00:51:09,908 --> 00:51:12,809
I know and I'm getting a rash
or something, too.

507
00:51:12,911 --> 00:51:14,469
Oh, God. You and your rashes.

508
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,776
Hey, I'm sorry if the end of the world
makes me a little nervous.

509
00:51:24,857 --> 00:51:26,586
So, do you like him?

510
00:51:28,594 --> 00:51:31,461
- Come on, Sam.
- I'm just interested.

511
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:38,198
Yeah, well, I guess so.
I mean, he's nice.

512
00:51:41,575 --> 00:51:44,236
There was this new guy at school.
Paul Morgan.

513
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:47,035
He transferred from Taft. Junior.

514
00:51:47,548 --> 00:51:50,142
Oh, I don't hang around
with juniors much.

515
00:51:52,953 --> 00:51:54,318
I liked him.

516
00:51:55,822 --> 00:51:59,280
I mean, he was from Taft,

517
00:52:02,229 --> 00:52:03,628
but, he was nice.

518
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:12,571
Kathy said he was probably
gonna ask me out.

519
00:52:15,009 --> 00:52:16,135
Huh, Kathy.

520
00:52:17,512 --> 00:52:20,173
She was flunking algebra
and she was trying to figure out some way

521
00:52:20,281 --> 00:52:22,841
to keep her parents from finding out.

522
00:52:25,788 --> 00:52:28,278
This is really a lucky break for her.

523
00:52:34,997 --> 00:52:38,227
No wonder I'm breaking out.
Think we could go home and change?

524
00:52:38,334 --> 00:52:42,963
- Why don't we get a little creative?
- What?

525
00:52:44,173 --> 00:52:47,801
- Do you have your a,
do you have your MasterCard on you?
- No.

526
00:52:48,377 --> 00:52:50,675
Good, 'cause you don't need it.

527
00:52:50,779 --> 00:52:53,077
The stores are open!

528
00:54:02,587 --> 00:54:07,455
Hey, Reg, which do you like better?
This?

529
00:54:09,028 --> 00:54:11,553
Second one. Yeah. Definitely.

530
00:54:11,664 --> 00:54:15,029
- How come?
- 'Cause it'll stay in style longer.

531
00:54:15,934 --> 00:54:18,266
- Come on.
- I guess you're right, actually.

532
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:21,464
Yeah, we got to think
of these things, you know?

533
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:43,455
Well, let's do it.

534
00:54:49,503 --> 00:54:53,370
- You know, I've been thinking.
- Don't set any dangerous precedents.

535
00:54:53,507 --> 00:54:55,805
What if Hector's got
the same problem we have?

536
00:54:55,909 --> 00:54:59,810
- Such as?
- Such as, no guys.

537
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:02,508
- What?
- Really.

538
00:55:04,386 --> 00:55:06,479
I mean, what if Hector's gay?

539
00:55:09,691 --> 00:55:11,420
- I'm sure.
- Think it over.

540
00:55:11,526 --> 00:55:13,755
You said he didn't
come on to you last night.

541
00:55:13,861 --> 00:55:14,828
So?

542
00:55:14,929 --> 00:55:18,830
So that means that the last guy on earth
is either a gentleman or a fag.

543
00:55:19,166 --> 00:55:21,828
I mean, what are the odds? In LA?

544
00:55:22,971 --> 00:55:26,304
Things could be very interesting
around here, Regina.

545
00:55:40,022 --> 00:55:42,286
Attention, shoppers.

546
00:55:42,692 --> 00:55:46,285
I trust you've got credit cards
to pay for all that stuff.

547
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:17,191
What's the matter?
Lost something?

548
00:56:17,727 --> 00:56:20,854
Check with lost and found
on the second floor.

549
00:56:21,731 --> 00:56:23,392
Didn't find this one.

550
00:56:32,643 --> 00:56:35,134
You dirty rat.

551
00:56:37,049 --> 00:56:38,982
Get her, boys!

552
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,274
Woa!

553
00:58:05,407 --> 00:58:07,568
Bummer!

554
00:58:11,746 --> 00:58:14,408
Well, I think it's time
to take the high ground.

555
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:25,385
Listen, you guys, we're expecting
some friends here any minute.

556
00:58:25,626 --> 00:58:29,289
Look, you just split now, okay,
and we'll Tell them not to hurt you.

557
00:58:34,569 --> 00:58:36,662
No imagination.

558
00:58:58,527 --> 00:59:00,154
Look, over there.

559
00:59:08,905 --> 00:59:09,963
Hey!

560
00:59:11,074 --> 00:59:14,703
- Hey!
- Eat glass, creeps!

561
00:59:16,947 --> 00:59:18,812
How did you like that?

562
00:59:23,186 --> 00:59:26,155
You guys are a bunch of wimps!
You can't hit anything.

563
00:59:28,226 --> 00:59:29,351
Hi.

564
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:40,764
Get her.

565
00:59:59,792 --> 01:00:01,521
Knock that shit off!

566
01:00:07,032 --> 01:00:09,796
Hello out there in Television Land.

567
01:00:11,171 --> 01:00:13,502
All right. Here's the deal.

568
01:00:14,139 --> 01:00:17,972
If bachelorette number one
isn't out here in half a tick,

569
01:00:18,077 --> 01:00:22,706
I'm going to ice bachelorette number two.
Got it?

570
01:00:38,866 --> 01:00:40,059
Come on.

571
01:00:44,905 --> 01:00:46,236
Let her go.

572
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:51,132
I'm sorry, miss, I can't have you
holding one of my people hostage.

573
01:00:51,277 --> 01:00:55,111
Even if you pull the trigger,
I can still take him out. And you.

574
01:00:55,282 --> 01:00:56,943
Come on, Willy, she means it.

575
01:00:57,051 --> 01:00:59,450
Miss, you're not getting the point.

576
01:00:59,552 --> 01:01:02,715
I can't have you holding
one of my people hostage.

577
01:01:08,429 --> 01:01:09,862
You're crazy!

578
01:01:09,964 --> 01:01:12,728
I'm not crazy.
I just don't give a fuck.

579
01:01:13,769 --> 01:01:16,532
- What do you think, 20, 30 minutes?
- No more.

580
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:19,764
They could be anywhere by now.
Let's go back.

581
01:01:19,907 --> 01:01:23,536
- Let's apply a little deductive reasoning.
- Deductive reasoning?

582
01:01:25,279 --> 01:01:28,248
Where would adolescents
with nothing to do go?

583
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:38,658
See, we worked really hard to
get ahead in this business, girls.

584
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:41,286
And we don't get shit for it!

585
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:43,695
But we do it...

586
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,695
because we know we can work
our way up through the system.

587
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:47,963
And the system works

588
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:52,471
Why, just a few days ago,
we were only stock boys.

589
01:01:53,441 --> 01:01:57,172
Now we own the store.
The American way.

590
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,411
And then this happens.

591
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,343
What are you talking about?

592
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:08,053
I'm talking about you
coming in here and ripping us off.

593
01:02:08,158 --> 01:02:11,354
What do you want?
You want us to pay for it? What?

594
01:02:14,832 --> 01:02:17,630
You wouldn't believe
what we want from you.

595
01:02:18,002 --> 01:02:22,869
In your worst nightmare,
you wouldn't believe.

596
01:02:26,143 --> 01:02:30,306
Let's play a game.
It's called ‘Scary Noises’.

597
01:02:32,216 --> 01:02:34,707
This is the closest shopping arcade,
but the whole area

598
01:02:34,819 --> 01:02:37,412
is an absolute monument
to consumerism.

599
01:02:37,621 --> 01:02:39,452
All we can do is hope.

600
01:02:39,657 --> 01:02:42,558
Check all the fiords,
including the basement.

601
01:02:49,834 --> 01:02:53,326
Isn't that a scary noise?
Wanna hear it again?

602
01:02:54,672 --> 01:02:57,266
Gosh! The suspense is killing me.

603
01:02:59,410 --> 01:03:01,037
Let's do it again.

604
01:03:03,314 --> 01:03:06,772
An E-ticket attraction.
Let's do it again.

605
01:03:10,656 --> 01:03:12,316
Now wait a minute.

606
01:03:12,458 --> 01:03:15,484
I don't think
there's really a bullet in here.

607
01:03:16,328 --> 01:03:19,956
No. Now, see there, it's loaded.

608
01:03:20,165 --> 01:03:22,962
I just needed
to be a little more patient.

609
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:26,495
I think this is it, girls.
I really do.

610
01:03:52,599 --> 01:03:54,294
We're not with these guys.

611
01:03:54,401 --> 01:03:56,869
Really, like, we just met them
an hour ago.

612
01:03:59,172 --> 01:04:02,107
I mean, look at this stuff.
Look at this skirt.

613
01:04:02,643 --> 01:04:06,942
It's ironic. Of all the great minds
of the world, all the great intellects,

614
01:04:07,048 --> 01:04:10,313
- Who should survive? Or almost survive?
- I’m so thirsty

615
01:04:11,853 --> 01:04:14,845
I don't have to see the result
of the blood test.

616
01:04:14,956 --> 01:04:17,720
I can guess
what they say about that one.

617
01:04:21,062 --> 01:04:22,529
You're right.

618
01:04:23,398 --> 01:04:27,299
It would be senseless to take her back.
Look, I'll stay and take care of it.

619
01:04:27,401 --> 01:04:31,360
Then if this Hector person shows up,
I can run tests on him, too.

620
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:36,142
Of course, it would be out of the question
to let you remain by yourself.

621
01:04:37,179 --> 01:04:39,147
I'll stay here with you.

622
01:04:59,235 --> 01:05:02,567
Listen, thanks for suggesting
that I wait for Hector.

623
01:05:02,672 --> 01:05:06,836
I mean, I know Reggie'll probably get him,
but I'd like to have a shot at it.

624
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:09,309
Samantha, I need you to lie down.

625
01:05:09,846 --> 01:05:12,007
Hector's not exactly a fox,

626
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,714
but considering what's left,
he's not bad.

627
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:20,249
- He sounds cute. Is he coming back?
- Yeah.

628
01:05:20,991 --> 01:05:24,050
But we should wait for him
at the radio station.

629
01:05:24,395 --> 01:05:27,124
That's where he'll go.
What's that?

630
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:31,824
- I'm going to give you something.
- For what?

631
01:05:32,669 --> 01:05:36,502
Well, your skin's
been a little irritated.

632
01:05:37,007 --> 01:05:38,440
Yeah, a rash.

633
01:05:38,542 --> 01:05:42,342
It could be a rash,
but it could also be something else.

634
01:05:42,614 --> 01:05:45,173
- That's one of the main symptoms of...
- The comet? No.

635
01:05:45,283 --> 01:05:49,982
See, I always get rashes,
like, when I have a fight with Doris,

636
01:05:50,089 --> 01:05:52,648
or I break up with a boyfriend.
It's nerves.

637
01:05:52,757 --> 01:05:55,782
And you know, the way things have
been going around here lately,

638
01:05:55,894 --> 01:05:58,988
I'm surprised I don't
look like strawberry Jell-O.

639
01:06:00,432 --> 01:06:04,561
But if I do have that stuff,
this will get rid of it, right?

640
01:06:06,705 --> 01:06:09,196
- Yeah.
- God, you had me worried.

641
01:06:11,043 --> 01:06:14,034
Don't worry. Just a pinch now.

642
01:06:21,887 --> 01:06:24,480
Ow!
So, you guys are, like, geniuses, right?

643
01:06:26,859 --> 01:06:28,292
Yeah, I thought so.

644
01:06:36,036 --> 01:06:38,435
We have a couple of
geniuses at my school.

645
01:06:38,838 --> 01:06:41,363
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

646
01:07:00,861 --> 01:07:02,123
Is...

647
01:07:04,165 --> 01:07:05,529
Is that it?

648
01:07:07,668 --> 01:07:10,034
What did you want me to do, Oscar,

649
01:07:10,138 --> 01:07:13,005
take her out back
and shoot her in the head?

650
01:07:13,775 --> 01:07:17,870
I simply meant
I was glad it was painless.

651
01:07:19,748 --> 01:07:22,308
I don't think we have to stay around.

652
01:07:22,984 --> 01:07:25,747
She didn't think that he was coming back.

653
01:07:26,053 --> 01:07:27,782
I feel we can wait.

654
01:07:29,091 --> 01:07:30,217
But...

655
01:07:31,393 --> 01:07:35,522
I feel the radio station
is the more logical place.

656
01:07:38,567 --> 01:07:43,503
Listen, Oscar, you were right
about the condition being progressive.

657
01:07:44,206 --> 01:07:47,698
But it is also accelerating,
apparently.

658
01:07:48,778 --> 01:07:50,506
We don't have weeks.

659
01:07:51,014 --> 01:07:53,141
We have maybe hours.
I don't know.

660
01:07:53,917 --> 01:07:56,544
- We have a commitment.
- But I do know I don't have enough

661
01:07:56,653 --> 01:08:01,589
to debate the issue. I am not going to be
a party to taking anybody else back.

662
01:08:02,225 --> 01:08:04,090
You have to live up to it.

663
01:08:05,428 --> 01:08:09,227
What do you expect me to do, Oscar,
go for my gun?

664
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,190
Of course not.

665
01:08:51,777 --> 01:08:54,745
It's 450 FM in the p.m.
I'm Steve LaBeau,

666
01:08:54,846 --> 01:08:58,246
and you're listening to 50,000 watts
of rock 'n'roll at the tower of power

667
01:08:58,350 --> 01:09:00,318
over the City of Angels.

668
01:09:20,172 --> 01:09:23,335
Reggie! Merry Christmas.

669
01:09:28,047 --> 01:09:29,240
Reggie?

670
01:09:35,555 --> 01:09:37,454
Samantha?

671
01:09:42,996 --> 01:09:43,963
Hi.

672
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:46,165
Hi.

673
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:54,398
Did you happen to see two girls
running around here?
One is a cheerleader.

674
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,504
I'm not thinking straight.

675
01:09:58,478 --> 01:10:02,972
I wrote everything down,
but I think I misspelled it.

676
01:10:03,384 --> 01:10:05,317
That pad on the table.

677
01:10:07,321 --> 01:10:11,223
- You need this?
- No, thanks. I have one.

678
01:10:13,161 --> 01:10:16,426
It seems to be
the perfect Christmas gift this year.

679
01:10:17,432 --> 01:10:21,892
I'm going to miss Christmas,
permanently.

680
01:10:24,807 --> 01:10:29,209
I want you to know that
I thought they were talking hypothetically,

681
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:31,739
until they found the first survivors.

682
01:10:31,846 --> 01:10:33,780
Then they really did it.

683
01:10:36,218 --> 01:10:38,186
Some of those survivors were just kids.

684
01:10:38,287 --> 01:10:41,050
Hey, wait a minute.
What's all this about blood?

685
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:46,826
They think they can generate a serum.

686
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:52,566
- A serum?
- We were exposed. Not a lot. Just enough.

687
01:10:54,037 --> 01:10:58,131
They left the ventilating ducts wide open.
The fans going.

688
01:10:58,374 --> 01:11:00,467
Very scientific.

689
01:11:00,809 --> 01:11:02,106
Very stupid.

690
01:11:04,814 --> 01:11:09,750
In 36 hours,
you will be able to vacuum up

691
01:11:09,919 --> 01:11:11,750
the last of them from the carpet.

692
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:18,025
Hey, you know what?

693
01:11:19,897 --> 01:11:23,196
She was right. You are cute.

694
01:11:25,536 --> 01:11:27,435
Santa Claus.

695
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:40,978
Hey.

696
01:11:59,137 --> 01:12:00,865
Have you ever had hepatitis?

697
01:12:00,971 --> 01:12:02,370
Darned tags.

698
01:12:02,841 --> 01:12:04,308
You have a pair of scissors?

699
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:08,038
No. Have you ever had hepatitis?

700
01:12:11,149 --> 01:12:12,480
Cute kids.

701
01:12:13,385 --> 01:12:15,182
They part of you guys?

702
01:12:15,288 --> 01:12:19,587
No. They're survivors just like you are.

703
01:12:19,859 --> 01:12:22,487
- Neat girl, huh?
- If you like the type.

704
01:12:23,396 --> 01:12:25,261
Come on, kids. Come with me.

705
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:29,691
Have you ever had hepatitis?

706
01:12:32,939 --> 01:12:37,705
No. I had mono once, though. Caught
it from this guy named Randy Sharp.

707
01:12:39,011 --> 01:12:41,138
- Anemia?
- No.

708
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:45,080
- Are you pregnant?
- No. Thought I was once, though.

709
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:50,356
- That's not important.
- That's what you think.

710
01:12:50,457 --> 01:12:53,324
It was the longest three weeks
of my life.

711
01:12:58,565 --> 01:12:59,896
You know, I can't remember.

712
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,128
How much blood were we expected
to get from these people?

713
01:13:03,303 --> 01:13:06,795
Oh, 300 ccs. Yes, that's it.

714
01:13:06,907 --> 01:13:11,105
That can't be right. If we draw 300 ccs
a day, they'll expire altogether.

715
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:12,370
No, I don't think so,

716
01:13:12,479 --> 01:13:15,004
now that we've
terminated brain functions.

717
01:13:15,116 --> 01:13:16,743
I mean, they're brain-dead.

718
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:20,048
All they can do now
is manufacture blood.

719
01:13:21,023 --> 01:13:23,217
Well, maybe.

720
01:13:24,125 --> 01:13:27,652
We aren't gonna get anything like 300 ccs
out of those children.

721
01:13:27,963 --> 01:13:29,725
No. But, we will out of that teenager.

722
01:13:29,831 --> 01:13:32,230
I hope she's just as healthy as she looks.

723
01:13:32,333 --> 01:13:36,429
Boy, did you see her hair?
What I'd give to have hair like that.

724
01:13:38,507 --> 01:13:39,973
What is this place?

725
01:13:41,677 --> 01:13:43,235
Do you have diabetes?

726
01:13:43,345 --> 01:13:47,714
I mean, is this some sort of,
I don't know, underground hospital
or what?

727
01:13:50,419 --> 01:13:53,081
You're a very strong-willed young lady.

728
01:13:53,657 --> 01:13:56,989
- Cancer.
- You have cancer?

729
01:13:57,259 --> 01:13:59,284
No, I am a Cancer.

730
01:13:59,628 --> 01:14:03,064
I just want to know where I am
and what I'm doing here.

731
01:14:16,746 --> 01:14:19,977
Oops. Oh, gosh.
Could you hand me that arterial...

732
01:14:20,084 --> 01:14:21,244
Got it.

733
01:14:28,726 --> 01:14:31,660
Well, it's up to the respirators now.

734
01:14:32,163 --> 01:14:33,629
Why don't we prep the children?

735
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:36,858
When we're finished with them,
we can start on that girl.

736
01:14:37,101 --> 01:14:40,070
They're so cute.
I love working with kids.

737
01:14:40,471 --> 01:14:43,166
Yeah. Don't forget the lights.

738
01:14:48,313 --> 01:14:50,543
Are you taking any medication?

739
01:14:56,154 --> 01:15:00,089
Have you had any medication
within the last 24 hours?

740
01:15:02,226 --> 01:15:04,160
Where's my sister?

741
01:15:07,966 --> 01:15:10,092
Dr. Carter, may I see you a moment?

742
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:13,367
All right.

743
01:15:13,472 --> 01:15:15,565
I mean, she should be here by now,
shouldn't she,

744
01:15:15,675 --> 01:15:17,199
even if Hector didn't show up?

745
01:15:17,310 --> 01:15:20,244
Your sister’s dead.

746
01:15:23,116 --> 01:15:26,449
- What?
- I realize this comes as a shock,

747
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:31,016
but she had been exposed, and in 48 hours
she would have died anyway.

748
01:15:32,091 --> 01:15:34,559
It was quite painless,
I can assure you.

749
01:15:42,436 --> 01:15:44,767
You both have nice, strong hearts.

750
01:15:44,871 --> 01:15:47,601
- Are we going to get shots?
- No.

751
01:15:47,941 --> 01:15:50,466
No shots. I promise.

752
01:15:51,011 --> 01:15:52,672
- Audrey?
- They're not back yet.

753
01:15:52,780 --> 01:15:55,304
Listen, we may have a situation
on our hands here.

754
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:58,317
I can't locate Rogers
anyplace in the compound.

755
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:04,386
I can't rule out the possibility that
he may already have gone into transition.

756
01:16:07,194 --> 01:16:08,957
We can't wait for Audrey.

757
01:16:09,397 --> 01:16:12,126
You're gonna have to start
with the children and that one in there.

758
01:16:12,232 --> 01:16:14,632
We need blood to develop the serum.

759
01:16:14,735 --> 01:16:17,203
We don't have enough for everyone.

760
01:16:18,773 --> 01:16:23,072
We're not robots, Doctor. We're not
all going to fall over at one time.

761
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:25,078
Some of us will last a little longer.

762
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:28,240
While others of us
have more immediate needs.

763
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:31,076
You're smart.
You can figure that out.

764
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:33,210
Psychology is not an exact science,

765
01:16:33,321 --> 01:16:36,757
but, my God, man,
anybody can add two and two.

766
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:46,026
I'm very sorry about your sister.
It's a tragedy.

767
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:48,328
It truly is.

768
01:16:55,178 --> 01:16:57,577
And I can understand your hostility.

769
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:59,307
But no matter how upset you are,

770
01:16:59,416 --> 01:17:03,215
breaking an expensive piece
of equipment won't solve anything.

771
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:07,415
I mean, striking out at inanimate objects
is really quite childish.

772
01:17:08,057 --> 01:17:10,423
Even you should be able to realize that.

773
01:17:13,530 --> 01:17:14,496
Jerk.

774
01:17:43,361 --> 01:17:45,625
Howdy, partner. How you doing?

775
01:17:46,798 --> 01:17:51,461
- Who are you?
- The name is Hec. Hec Gomez.

776
01:17:54,173 --> 01:17:57,939
Hey, them's real fine duds you got there.
You a Maytag repairman?

777
01:17:58,977 --> 01:18:01,411
How did you find this place?

778
01:18:01,647 --> 01:18:04,877
Well ah, this lady back in LA sent me.

779
01:18:05,317 --> 01:18:09,184
Hey, you been to LA lately?
It's cleaned out, man, I'm telling you.

780
01:18:10,222 --> 01:18:12,986
Hey, come here.
I want to show you something. Come on.

781
01:18:14,927 --> 01:18:18,362
Hey, you know how the harbor freeway
is always bumper to bumper?

782
01:18:18,463 --> 01:18:21,261
Well, you can go 150 miles an hour
if you want to.

783
01:18:21,901 --> 01:18:23,630
Me and this baby,

784
01:18:23,736 --> 01:18:27,262
we go through them freeways
like turkey crap through a tin horn.

785
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:33,703
Hey...

786
01:18:36,748 --> 01:18:38,739
You like girls?

787
01:18:40,286 --> 01:18:43,721
Look in here.

788
01:18:47,093 --> 01:18:49,357
- She's dead.
- She ain't dead.

789
01:18:49,630 --> 01:18:51,757
See, this lady shot her up
with sodium pentothal

790
01:18:51,866 --> 01:18:54,356
to make this fellow think
she was dead,

791
01:18:58,539 --> 01:19:01,235
So you wouldn't suck her blood out,
you asshole.

792
01:19:05,112 --> 01:19:07,012
Son of a bitch!

793
01:19:09,183 --> 01:19:10,150
Shit!

794
01:19:20,461 --> 01:19:22,156
Excuse me, everyone.

795
01:19:22,497 --> 01:19:25,159
I'm afraid our adolescent guest
has escaped.

796
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,195
She's quite hostile.

797
01:19:27,403 --> 01:19:28,767
She may have already gone topside,

798
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:31,634
so please take a moment
and look around you.

799
01:19:55,197 --> 01:19:58,325
Check those rooms,
and I'll check this one.

800
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:57,151
Let's go.

801
01:22:04,732 --> 01:22:07,564
- Everything is under control.
- Good.

802
01:22:37,431 --> 01:22:39,058
You said no shots.

803
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:41,499
This isn't a shot, sweetheart.
It'll just...

804
01:22:43,038 --> 01:22:44,369
You'll just giggle

805
01:22:44,474 --> 01:22:46,304
and then you'll feel a little sleepy.

806
01:22:46,408 --> 01:22:47,966
That's right.

807
01:22:48,076 --> 01:22:50,374
And when you wake up,
do you know where you'll be?

808
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:53,643
- Where?
- With Santa Claus at the North Pole.

809
01:22:53,749 --> 01:22:57,684
In fact, you'll live with Santa Claus
for the rest of your life.

810
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:00,480
Hey, there's no such thing as Santa Claus.

811
01:23:00,591 --> 01:23:04,890
What? You don't believe in Santa?

812
01:23:23,680 --> 01:23:25,671
Life support systems.

813
01:23:27,284 --> 01:23:31,014
- Wilson, come with me.
- Keep an eye on her.

814
01:23:31,121 --> 01:23:33,112
Yes.
Now, Wilson!

815
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:36,320
Forget the door. Turn off the alarm.

816
01:23:51,876 --> 01:23:53,571
I don't know.

817
01:23:53,678 --> 01:23:57,078
My parents told me
never to breathe anything from strangers.

818
01:23:57,348 --> 01:23:58,315
Hey!

819
01:24:00,585 --> 01:24:02,416
Get your hands up.

820
01:24:08,359 --> 01:24:09,519
What are you guys doing?

821
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:14,462
They said if we breathe this, we could go
to the North Pole and see Santa Claus.

822
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:17,395
- That's so sick.
- Hey!

823
01:24:17,503 --> 01:24:19,903
- Holy shit!
- Whoa.

824
01:24:20,005 --> 01:24:22,098
- Sam?
- I give! I give!

825
01:24:22,642 --> 01:24:26,805
- They said you were dead.
- They were exaggerating totally.

826
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:31,511
- Hey, that's a great outfit.
- Thanks. Is that guy in the hallway dead?

827
01:24:32,552 --> 01:24:33,882
Don't.

828
01:24:45,198 --> 01:24:46,563
Well?

829
01:24:50,671 --> 01:24:53,366
You can give up if you want to, Wilson.

830
01:24:56,777 --> 01:24:59,904
But we still have the two children
and that girl.

831
01:25:01,382 --> 01:25:02,679
I forgot my football.

832
01:25:02,783 --> 01:25:06,082
- We'll get you another football.
- We'll get you a stadium.

833
01:25:08,123 --> 01:25:09,089
Now!

834
01:25:21,602 --> 01:25:23,536
Get everybody topside, now!

835
01:25:23,639 --> 01:25:26,801
- What about them?
- Screw them.

836
01:25:33,482 --> 01:25:35,473
Okay, kids. Going up.

837
01:25:36,652 --> 01:25:38,847
Put your hands down, kids.

838
01:25:38,987 --> 01:25:40,817
God, don't be so stupid.

839
01:25:53,136 --> 01:25:55,365
- Come on, kids.
- Who are the kids?

840
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:56,994
- I'm Brian.
- I'm Sarah.

841
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:59,370
Yeah, and I'm Aunt Reg
and that's Aunt Sam

842
01:25:59,475 --> 01:26:00,669
and that's Uncle Hector.

843
01:26:00,777 --> 01:26:02,903
- Can I have my bunny?
- In a minute.

844
01:26:03,012 --> 01:26:05,640
- Beat feet, Uncle Hector.
- Uncle Hector?

845
01:26:05,815 --> 01:26:08,340
Hey, it's my bunny, you know.

846
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:18,252
- Where have you been?
- Can we change this?

847
01:26:18,362 --> 01:26:21,853
- Arranging a hotfoot for your friends.
- I really hate this music.

848
01:26:21,964 --> 01:26:23,363
Give me a break!

849
01:26:26,070 --> 01:26:28,163
- What are you doing?
- I'm not kidding.

850
01:26:28,272 --> 01:26:30,603
I get carsick without my bunny.

851
01:26:30,741 --> 01:26:34,973
- Come on, Reg. Give the kid the bunny.
- We've stopped. Why have we stopped?

852
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:36,138
Son of a...

853
01:26:36,247 --> 01:26:37,942
Don't shoot them, you idiot.

854
01:26:38,049 --> 01:26:41,642
Okay, kids.
Cover your eyes for Uncle Hector.

855
01:26:44,021 --> 01:26:46,683
Hey! Think tank, huh?

856
01:26:47,524 --> 01:26:49,651
Look, couldn't we just, like, leave?

857
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,455
Think over this.

858
01:26:52,697 --> 01:26:56,598
- We can get them. We have to get them.
- Hey, we'll be taking off now.

859
01:26:56,701 --> 01:26:59,568
Look us up at Chasen's.
We'll party down, huh?

860
01:27:00,205 --> 01:27:02,696
- Come on.
- Come on. This is fun.

861
01:27:03,609 --> 01:27:06,076
The kids would like to say goodbye.
It's been fun.

862
01:27:06,177 --> 01:27:08,236
Hope to see you around real soon.

863
01:27:10,716 --> 01:27:12,512
Is that gasoline I smell?

864
01:27:17,255 --> 01:27:18,916
Wait. Wait, don't! Don't!

865
01:27:42,982 --> 01:27:45,382
Wow. All right, Hector.

866
01:28:01,368 --> 01:28:04,064
Let go of her!

867
01:28:06,107 --> 01:28:07,233
Hector!

868
01:28:16,683 --> 01:28:17,877
It's okay.

869
01:28:18,886 --> 01:28:22,720
I got you. It's all right. It's okay.

870
01:28:23,691 --> 01:28:24,885
I got you. Shhhhhh.

871
01:29:08,172 --> 01:29:11,834
Okay, kids. Smile. Come on.

872
01:29:12,941 --> 01:29:15,910
God, you're so cute.
You're just so cute. Wait.

873
01:29:17,146 --> 01:29:20,603
Mr. Bunny needs to be in this picture, too.
So, okay, that's great.

874
01:29:20,717 --> 01:29:23,413
- Can I take this jacket off? It itches.
- No, you can't.

875
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:25,112
I just want to take another picture.
all right?

876
01:29:25,222 --> 01:29:27,554
- Please?
- No. Now you just hold on to that.

877
01:29:27,658 --> 01:29:29,682
- Stay there, okay? Perfect.
- Oh, brother.

878
01:29:29,793 --> 01:29:34,730
- There's still a few zombies around.
- Don't slouch. And, Sarah, hold that.

879
01:29:37,268 --> 01:29:39,327
Smile.

880
01:29:40,605 --> 01:29:43,903
Did the flash go off?
You can't tell on these things.

881
01:29:44,008 --> 01:29:47,875
Hey, if you're gonna throw
those guns away, can I have one?

882
01:29:51,148 --> 01:29:54,675
Don't look at me. I mean, I don't know
where she gets that stuff.

883
01:29:57,923 --> 01:29:59,754
Smile, Hec.

884
01:30:02,695 --> 01:30:04,128
Handsome.

885
01:30:05,864 --> 01:30:08,298
Maybe I could be a nun or something.

886
01:30:08,501 --> 01:30:10,799
I just love these pictures.

887
01:30:10,937 --> 01:30:13,097
You've only taken about 30 of them.

888
01:30:13,204 --> 01:30:15,000
You know, we're going to need
more film soon.

889
01:30:15,106 --> 01:30:16,869
- Let me straighten your tie.
- Okay.

890
01:30:16,975 --> 01:30:19,102
God, they look like the Brady Bunch.

891
01:30:20,746 --> 01:30:22,474
What are you waiting for?

892
01:30:22,948 --> 01:30:24,415
Can I see them?

893
01:30:24,517 --> 01:30:28,510
- We're waiting for the light to change.
- We do not cross against the light.

894
01:30:31,557 --> 01:30:34,685
Are you nuts, ‘Auntie’ Regina?

895
01:30:35,429 --> 01:30:38,398
You may as well face the facts, Samantha.

896
01:30:38,498 --> 01:30:42,558
The whole burden of civilization
has fallen upon us.

897
01:30:44,937 --> 01:30:47,132
What's that supposed to mean?

898
01:30:48,542 --> 01:30:51,271
It means we do not CROSS
against the light.

899
01:30:53,513 --> 01:30:55,481
That's totally stupid.

900
01:30:55,649 --> 01:31:00,585
There's nobody here. See?
We're talking ghost town!

901
01:31:08,896 --> 01:31:10,864
See what happens?

902
01:31:16,403 --> 01:31:20,066
God. I'm sorry, but you shouldn't cross
against the light like that.

903
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:25,403
- Hey, you guys are survivors, too, huh?
- Thank you.

904
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:31,541
- What?
- Nothing. Great car.

905
01:31:32,287 --> 01:31:34,948
Thanks. I have 23 of them.
You want to go for a ride?

906
01:31:35,056 --> 01:31:37,388
More than you know.

907
01:31:40,295 --> 01:31:42,559
We don't know anything about this guy.

908
01:31:42,865 --> 01:31:44,924
Where's he from? What's his name?

909
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:48,398
- What's your name?
- Danny Mason Keener.

910
01:31:48,537 --> 01:31:50,505
Danny Mason Keener, okay?

911
01:31:51,706 --> 01:31:52,832
Yeah, all right.

912
01:31:52,941 --> 01:31:56,035
- Well, just be back by midnight, okay?
- Midnight?

913
01:31:57,212 --> 01:31:59,646
The burden of civilization is on us, okay?

914
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:03,082
Oh, yeah. Bitching, isn't it?

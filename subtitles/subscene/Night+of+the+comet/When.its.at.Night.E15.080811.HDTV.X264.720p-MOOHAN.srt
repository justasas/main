<i> Cultural assets and individuals in this

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,760
<i> They have no real-life
associations with this drama.</i>

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,850
You're hiding something
from me, aren't you?

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,970
What are you talking about?

5
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:27,010
I overheard your call with Chief Kang.
What are they doing at my house?

6
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,820
This was found in Gyoon's room. I think
he used it for his Robin Hood activities.

7
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,880
And...

8
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,640
What else?

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,900
We found these, too.

10
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:57,950
You're hiding something, aren't you?

11
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,810
I'm not.
Why do you keep asking that?

12
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,690
Look at me!

13
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:06,030
Look me in the face and tell me.

14
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,680
What are you hiding?

15
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,900
What is it you're unable to tell me?

16
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,840
Hello, who is this?

17
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,870
[This is Ohseong Jang.]

18
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,700
Who did you say you are?

19
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,890
Chairman Ohseong Jang
of the Ohseong Group.

20
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,040
<i> Episode 15</i>

21
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,630
Who was that?
Why do you look like that?

22
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,670
Chairman Jang.

23
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:49,840
Chairman Jang?
Why would he call you?

24
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,720
I don't know. He says he wants to see me
immediately, but I don't know why.

25
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,000
Because of Gyoon.

26
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,570
What about Gyoon?
What did Gyoon do?

27
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,750
Brace yourself for this, Chohee.
The truth is, Gyoon...

28
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,800
Gyoon is Robin Hood.

29
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,670
He acknowledged it.

30
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:33,720
All right. Let's assume
that he is Robin Hood.

31
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,870
So Chairman Jang wants to see me
because Gyoon stole his things?

32
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,850
I don't think that's the whole of it.
According to Gyoon...

33
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,690
According to Gyoon, Chairman Jang
played a hand in your father's death.

34
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,790
What?
Say that one more time.

35
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,760
Say it one more time.

36
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,850
Chairman Jang had something to do
with my dad's death?

37
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:23,580
Are you saying that his death
might have been Chairman Jang's doing?

38
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,570
That's what Gyoon said,
but nothing's certain. So -

39
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,580
Since when did you know all this?

40
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:36,620
That Gyoon was Robin Hood,
that my dad might have been murdered.

41
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,000
When did you find out?

42
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,010
For a while now.

43
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:49,550
Do both Chief Kang and
Chief Noh know? Do they?

44
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:54,630
I told Chief Kang, and
I'm assuming Chief Noh knows by now.

45
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,910
How could you do that?
How could you!

46
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,580
How can you keep me in the dark
while all of you knew?

47
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,770
Don't go. You can't go alone when
you don't know what's waiting for you.

48
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:17,880
Let's evaluate the situation first -

49
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,680
No. I'm going on my own.
I'm going to listen to what he has to say.

50
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,920
Why was this found here?

51
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,720
It might have been left there on purpose,
so let's check thoroughly for fingerprints.

52
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,600
Yes, sir.

53
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,560
If we find nothing, doesn't that just mean
he was behind the museum break-in?

54
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,840
Huh? Bumsang!

55
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,980
- Jinguk, let's go.
- Yeah.

56
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,950
Why are you here alone?
Where's Chohee?

57
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,820
I had something urgent to tell you.

58
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,670
What is it?
Did Chohee...?

59
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,640
Yes, she found out that
Gyoon was Robin Hood.

60
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,940
Where is she right now?

61
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,970
Were you surprised
that I wanted to see you?

62
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,550
What is it you want to say to me?

63
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,830
I heard this Robin Hood character
has been creating quite a buzz.

64
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,830
Did the regulations team
figure out his identity?

65
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:43,010
I heard it was your brother,
Gyoon Heo. Am I right?

66
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,550
What is it you wish to say?

67
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,660
Your father is the famous
art thief Taesoo Heo.

68
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,870
Your brother is Robin Hood, who steals
from people to donate to the museum.

69
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,860
Things must be rough for you.

70
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:07,670
Sir, I'm sure you didn't
call me here to tell me that.

71
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,820
I'll cut to the chase.

72
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,570
Chief Kang came to see me.

73
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,780
He implied that I did
something to your father.

74
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,730
I don't even know your father.

75
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,940
The more I think about it,
the more offended I am.

76
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:35,630
So I did a little investigating myself
on how your father died.

77
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,850
And I found out
something very interesting.

78
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,690
What do you think
Chairman Jang is up to?

79
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,760
I'm not sure. Maybe he was feeling
pressured because I visited him?

80
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,790
He's nervous and wants to find out
how much information we actually have?

81
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:01,930
I'll be relieved if that's the case.
Chairman Jang is a terrifying man.

82
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,810
I'm on pins and needles because
I have no idea what he intends to do.

83
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,810
What is this interesting thing
you found out?

84
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:21,820
It's not the fact that you were involved
with my father's death, is it?

85
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:29,600
Your words are full of accusation.
So you also think I was involved?

86
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,690
Weren't you?

87
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:34,790
I don't really care what you insist I did.

88
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:41,910
But I think you'd understand
what it feels like to be falsely accused.

89
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:49,940
I hear your brother is the main suspect
for the museum break-in.

90
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:56,650
Imagine he is being falsely accused.
Wouldn't you feel upset?

91
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,800
That's how I feel.

92
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,820
I'm offended that I'm being accused
of killing a man I didn't even know.

93
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:15,000
If you called me here to tell me you're
being falsely accused, then we're done.

94
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,900
I'll be leaving then.

95
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,650
You're very impatient.

96
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,610
Interesting information should be told
with dramatic pauses to build the effect.

97
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:35,860
By the way, who's the current chief of the
regulations team? Is it still Jeongpil Noh?

98
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,900
Why do you ask?

99
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:46,710
I wonder what he was up to around
the time your father disappeared.

100
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:54,020
That is the interesting information
I found out. Do you find it interesting?

101
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,010
So what you're saying is...

102
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:06,590
Chief Noh had something to do
with my father's death -

103
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,670
That's for you to find out, isn't it?

104
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:21,040
[Seoul District Police Department
Fingerprint search system]

105
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,810
Hold on. I think we've got
a match on one of the fingerprints.

106
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,630

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,590
Let's search again,
focusing on the ex-cons.

109
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,770
Chief.

110
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,870
Yes?

111
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,790
Um, Chohee is waiting
for you in the office.

112
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,620
Is she? Call me as soon as
the fingerprint results come out.

113
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,800
Um, Chief?

114
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:04,010
If we get some unfortunate results,
we have to arrest Chohee's brother, right?

115
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,600
Yes, that would be our only choice.

116
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,860
Why don't we pass
this case onto another team?

117
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,940
The intelligence team has so little work
they're totally bumming around.

118
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:25,740
I understand how you feel.
I hope we don't have to arrest Gyoon.

119
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,860
Bumsang told me everything.

120
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,930
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about the investigation earlier.

121
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,000
I wanted to tell you
when things became more definite.

122
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,800
What's gonna happen to Gyoon now?

123
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,810
His Robin Hood acts can be dealt with
leniently due to mitigating circumstances.

124
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,640
But the museum break-in...

125
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,670
Everyone thinks that Gyoon was framed
for the museum break-in.

126
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:11,020
I'll do my best to collect evidence,
so try not to worry.

127
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,940
So why did Chairman Jang
want to see you today?

128
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,780
Chief, how much of what
Chairman Jang says is credible?

129
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,940
What do you mean?

130
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,820
I don't know if what he said was true.

131
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,910
But the truth is, he said Chief Noh -

132
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,890
Chohee. I heard you went to Chairman
Jang's house? Did anything happen?

133
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,020
I gave him a call. I thought
you should tell both of us at once.

134
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:51,830
Thank goodness if nothing happened.
Did Chairman Jang say anything strange?

135
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,020
Nothing happened.

136
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,730
Thank god nothing happened.

137
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,950
Chairman Jang isn't your usual
shrewd man, so be careful around him.

138
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,860
Chohee.

139
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,830
Yes?

140
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,720
Are you really okay?

141
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,990
I'm trying to be, for Gyoon's sake.
I have to be okay.

142
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:31,770
Yeah. Go home and get some rest.

143
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,650
Um, Chief?
I mean, Uncle.

144
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,680
Yeah?

145
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,710
I...

146
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,780
What is it?

147
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,720
I trust in you.

148
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:55,770
That's the only way I'll endure.
I trust in you.

149
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,730
I'll be going then.

150
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,610
Chohee.

151
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,870
‘Brace yourself for this, Chohee.'

152
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,740
The truth is, Gyoon...

153
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,890
Gyoon is Robin Hood.

154
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:31,030
Everyone thinks that Gyoon was framed
for the museum break-in.

155
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:39,810
According to Gyoon, Chairman Jang
played a hand in your father's death.

156
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,980
I wonder what he was up to around
the time your father disappeared.

157
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,870
Hey, Chohee!

158
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,600
What happened to you?
I couldn't reach you at all.

159
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,890
Have you been talking with
Chairman Jang all this time?

160
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:33,800
This is bad.
We should get you to a hospital.

161
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,860
No, I'm fine.

162
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,910
Hey, you're burning up right now.

163
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,650
It's okay. I've been pushing myself
too hard. I'll be fine after a little rest.

164
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,960
Um... sorry for getting
mad at you earlier.

165
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:58,750
I know why you did what you did,
that you were just worried about me.

166
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,810
No, I was at fault.
Why are you apologizing?

167
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,850
Why did Gyoon do this?

168
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,750
Because of me?

169
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,810
Or because he found out
Dad was murdered?

170
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:27,940
Was my dad really murdered?
Did Chairman Jang really kill him?

171
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,600
And how did Gyoon find out?

172
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,830
Where is he?
What is he doing?

173
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:45,020
What is he thinking?
I don't understand any of it.

174
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,750
Don't worry.
Gyoon will be fine.

175
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,890
He'll be back without any problems.

176
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,720
Understood.

177
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:40,680
I didn't add the celadon bought
for Iwazaki to the inventory list.

178
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,630
Copy only the expenditure breakdown
of the latest deals and erase the rest.

179
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,670
Yes, sir.

180
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,620
What? The expenditure information
is gone? What was everyone doing?

181
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,630
You know what will happen
if that gets into the wrong hands.

182
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,810
I'm sorry, sir.

183
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,970
I ordered it to be erased,
but before it could be -

184
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:40,730
Someone must've stolen it.
It didn't just disappear on its own!

185
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,760
Who is it?
Who would come into my house...

186
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,560
Robin Hood.

187
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,760
Robin Hood?

188
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,680
Mr. Kim said that
Gyoon Heo got away, right?

189
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,550
Yeah, it's definitely him.
It has to be him!

190
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:04,730
Would he?
He already broke in once before.

191
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:11,840
He can because he already did before.
Go out and find him at once!

192
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,760
Yes, sir.

193
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,590
That slippery weasel.

194
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:31,600
Man, we have meeting after meeting
because of that Robin Hood jerk.

195
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,910
And the meetings are ridiculous.
Things get repeated over and over again.

196
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:40,690
They all sound like broken records.

197
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,580
At times like these, it's such a hassle
being higher up on the ladder.

198
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,940
Then quit.
I'll take your place.

199
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,710
What? You, too, now?

200
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,630
Sangho, it's fine that you take always
Joohyun's side, but don't become like her.

201
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,810
I have enough problems with Joohyun
cutting me down all the time.

202
00:19:58,810 --> 00:19:59,910
Mr. Nah!

203
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:06,740
I'm not a petty person who cuts people
down. I just speak the honest truth.

204
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,920
You do always speak the truth.

205
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,040
You little -

206
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,010
Never mind, I give up.
When I'm chief, the both of you are -

207
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:17,900
Good morning, Chohee.

208
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,900
Where's Chief Noh?

209
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,710
Chief Noh? He got a phone call as soon
as he got here, and he left soon after.

210
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,810
Did he say where he was going?

211
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,980
No, he didn't. He didn't, right?

212
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:38,030
See what I mean, Chohee? I told you so.
Our chief is turning so lazy these days.

213
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,690
It's too early for this.

214
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,920
You know you like it.

215
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,760
Gyoon!

216
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,910
Did you wait long?

217
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,860
What is this?

218
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,880
I got it from Chairman Jang's
house last night.

219
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,670
Inside you'll find all the details
of his illegal deals of stolen goods.

220
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,720
How did you...

221
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:23,650
I should give it to my sister,
but she thinks I'm traveling right now.

222
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,010
She knows everything.

223
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,690
What?

224
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,960
She knows that you're Robin Hood.

225
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,790
What are you going to do?

226
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:45,730
What else?
I haven't changed my mind.

227
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,000
Gyoon.

228
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,630
Please take care of the investigation.
I know that it won't be easy.

229
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,990
But I can't do nothing when I know
that Chairman Jang had Dad killed.

230
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,760
Who says he had your father killed?

231
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:08,020
I overheard it. When I was kidnapped,
I overheard the guys talking.

232
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,550
Didn't you know about the relationship
between Dad and Chairman Jang?

233
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,840
You wanna know what kind of
relationship Chief Noh and your dad had?

234
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,830
Yes.

235
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,640
Why are you asking out of the blue?

236
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,610
I was just curious.

237
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:33,650
Isn't the relationship between a thief
and a regulations team member obvious?

238
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,970
The chaser and the chased. They grew
close out of hatred for each other.

239
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:44,820
Chief Noh went through a lot of trouble
because of Taesoo and me.

240
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,610
Though they did hit
a rough spot near the end.

241
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:55,780
But seeing how he took you guys in,
he really is a good person.

242
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,820
Um, Uncle. What rough spot?
What happened between them?

243
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:09,770
I'm not sure. It's stranger for them to be
on good terms, not the other way around.

244
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,580
By the way, is Gyoon
back from traveling yet?

245
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,750
How did you know he went traveling?

246
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:26,980
He came to borrow money from me.
So I just gave it to him as allowance.

247
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,710
When?
When did you see him, Uncle?

248
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:35,670
A few days ago.
Why? Is something wrong?

249
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,880
No, it's just that -

250
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,700
One moment, Uncle.

251
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,790
Yeah, what is it?

252
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,810
Okay. I'll be right there. Yeah.

253
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,610
Uncle, I'm sorry but I have to leave.

254
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,980
Yeah, go on, go on.

255
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,900
Oh, and Uncle? If you meet Gyoon or
get a call from him, please tell me. Okay?

256
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,560
Yeah, sure.

257
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,680
By the way, Chohee.
Hey, Chohee?

258
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:11,940
How strange.
Did something happen?

259
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,570
Chohee!

260
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,830
Hey.

261
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,720
Ms. Heo, this way.

262
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,660
Yeah, bye.

263
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,920
Mister Kim? He came by
the day before yesterday, I think.

264
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,790
He wanted to look at some digital safes,
so I told him to go ahead.

265
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:39,630
He had a cup of coffee
and we chatted some. The he left.

266
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:43,710
He didn't say where he was headed?

267
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,040
No, he didn't mention that.

268
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,870
I told him to stay longer,
but he said he was busy.

269
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,760
Which safe did he look at?

270
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,750
He was looking for
a special fireproof safe.

271
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:59,890
But we didn't have that model
so I showed him something similar.

272
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:03,600
That one over there.
The bigger one.

273
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,660
Chief!

274
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,710
Chief Kang. Chief!

275
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,610
Hey, Joohyun.

276
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:27,760
How could you just ignore me
when I kept calling your name?

277
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,660
Are you going deaf?

278
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,950
Did I do that?
I guess I was thinking too hard.

279
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,780
Where are you coming from?

280
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,750
I picked up some pictures.

281
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,800
Pictures?

282
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,850
Hold on.

283
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,000
Where did they go?

284
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,890
Here you go.

285
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,700
Wait, when did you take this?

286
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,650
When we were in Chinatown.

287
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,910
What do you think?
They came out well, didn't they?

288
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,880
Yeah, they did.

289
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:05,930
Did you know that sometimes when
you're alone, you're very expressionless?

290
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,980
I am?

291
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,950
Yes. Look at this picture. If you're not
talking to anyone, you look like this.

292
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,030
When you're in your investigative mode,
you frown like this.

293
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,760
You should smile more.
And take more pictures.

294
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,970
You naturally smile more
when you take pictures.

295
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:25,910
Cheese. Click.

296
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,000
See. You look so much better
when you're smiling.

297
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:39,860
Upon a closer look, you actually
look decent when you're smiling.

298
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,740
Then I'll be going.

299
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,730
‘To Chief Shiwan Kang.'

300
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:04,780
‘I don't do the honor of signing things
for just anyone. Be grateful.'

301
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,010
Chief!

302
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,750
Oh, hey.

303
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,960
What are you looking at?

304
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,690
Oh, it's nothing.

305
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:32,990
What's up?

306
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,840
I wanted to give you
a progress report while I was here.

307
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,920
Oh, what happened to identifying
the prints from Chohee's house?

308
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,810
I thought we'd salvage at least
a few prints, but it was clean.

309
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,900
The only outsider we got was Bumsang.

310
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:54,030
So it turned into unfavorable
evidence for Gyoon.

311
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:55,950
Yeah, so far.

312
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:59,840
What's that?

313
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,750
Oh, this?
Just something.

314
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:07,620
I'm just copying some files.

315
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,610
Chief Kang, you want a cup of coffee?

316
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,700
Stay here. I'll get it.

317
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:08,920
Dad...

318
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,720
Sis, I'm sorry.

319
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:33,920
We got off work early today.
Get some rest.

320
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,840
I will.

321
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,970
What are you thinking about?

322
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,600
Gyoon?

323
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:45,750
Not just that...

324
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:49,800
You have something else
troubling you? What is it?

325
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:56,660
The truth is, Chairman Jang
told me something when we met.

326
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:03,760
He asked me if I knew what Chief Noh
had been doing when my father died.

327
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:11,610
Was he implying that Chief Noh had
something to do with your father's death?

328
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,890
I dunno. I don't want to doubt Chief Noh
because of what Chairman Jang said.

329
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,560
But I can't help thinking about it.

330
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,610
Did you ask Chief Noh?

331
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,760
How can I?

332
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,750
I doubt it.

333
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:34,580
I haven't known him as long as you,
but he's not that type of person.

334
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:37,020
Trust in him.
That's the right thing to do.

335
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,580
And if you're really curious,
just ask him directly.

336
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,900
It's better to feel bad once
instead of festering doubt in your heart.

337
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,020
Yeah, I think you're right.

338
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,000
Did I ever say anything
that wasn't right?

339
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,570
Yeah.

340
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,580
Bye.

341
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:57,910
See ya.

342
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,030
Don't get out.

343
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,770
No way...

344
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:45,030
Gyoon. Gyoon!

345
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:54,890
Gyoon, where are you going?
Where are you going?

346
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,570
How could you do this to me?

347
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,920
Gyoon, you can't do this to me.

348
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,930
How am I supposed
to live if you do this!

349
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:04,920
Sis.

350
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,570
Turn yourself in, okay?

351
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,810
I can't watch you do this anymore.
Do you realize what you're doing?

352
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,960
Turn yourself in.
You can't continue this, Gyoon.

353
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:21,760
No, I can't do that right now.

354
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,600
Why? Why can't you?

355
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:32,010
Chief Kang said that mitigating
circumstances will be considered.

356
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:38,940
And I'll do whatever it takes to clear
the false charge of the museum break-in.

357
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:46,900
I'll clear you for sure, so turn yourself in.
You can't do this. You can't, Gyoon.

358
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,810
Sis, I know that
I'm not doing the right thing.

359
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:56,550
But Sis, even if I'm wrong,
I don't want to regret things now.

360
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:02,870
I'll regret it later
when I'm paying for my actions.

361
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:06,930
Why are you being like this?
Why, Gyoon?

362
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:11,010
Do you want to see me die?
Do you?

363
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,010
How am I supposed
to live if you do this?

364
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,020
Turn yourself in, Gyoon. Please?

365
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,910
Sorry, Sis.
I have something I need to do.

366
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:28,900
When I'm done,
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

367
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,950
Gyoon.

368
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,570
Turn yourself in!

369
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:38,710
I'll be back. When I'm done with
what I have to do, I'll come back.

370
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,790
Sorry, Sis.

371
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,630
Gyoon! Gyoon!

372
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:50,970
Gyoon, Gyoon!

373
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:06,760
Hey, Chohee.

374
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,820
Chief.

375
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:10,870
What's wrong?

376
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,990
I met Gyoon.

377
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,870
Bumsang, did you wait long?

378
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:22,700
No, are you getting off work now?

379
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,960
Think I have an easygoing job like yours?
I'm working late tonight, too.

380
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,640
Easygoing, my butt.
You have something to ask me?

381
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,840
I wanted your opinion on this.

382
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:42,590
Should we restore it or not?

383
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,910
This is a slave contract
from the Joseon era.

384
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:49,840
Yeah. A collector from Andong
donated it a few days ago.

385
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,830
In the third year of King Seonjo.

386
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:59,010
A ten-year-old girl was sold as a slave
to repay her father's debts.

387
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:04,910
It's so sad. When I first read it,
my heart hurt a bit.

388
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,810
What a filial daughter.

389
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:15,000
The daughter repays the father's debt.
Times haven't changed, then or now.

390
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,730
What do you mean?

391
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:20,940
Hey, are families
supposed to be like this?

392
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,710
I don't know much about families.

393
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:28,560
Parents give up
their lives for their children.

394
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,810
Children sacrifice
their lives for their parents.

395
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:32,990
Is that how it is?

396
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,850
Weird. Never thought
I'd hear you talk about families.

397
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:40,550
Maybe it's time for you
to get married, Bumsang.

398
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,900
No way.
Anyway, don't restore it.

399
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,840
Yeah?

400
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:49,810
Though old and damaged,
restoration isn't always the best choice.

401
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,750
It's not the right time yet.

402
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,740
All right. You're the expert.

403
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,560
Are you headed home?

404
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,030
I wish. I have to
stop by the CHA first.

405
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,710
Hey, isn't that
Chairman Jang's secretary?

406
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,890
Why is he at the museum?

407
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:17,650
Not sure.
Oh, right! You don't know, do you?

408
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:22,880
He's going to be the chief director of the
Monuments Fund. That's probably why.

409
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,560
Chief director of the Monuments Fund?

410
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:33,670
Well, he certainly qualifies with his wealth
and good eye for art. Don't you think so?

411
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:38,780
Someone who truly loves cultural assets
qualifies, not a man like that.

412
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,010
Anyway, go back to work.
I'll be leaving.

413
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,810
Yeah, bye.

414
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,960
You waited long.
Please get in.

415
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:37,620
The truth is, Chairman Jang told me
something when we met.

416
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:44,650
He asked me if I knew what Chief Noh
had been doing when my father died.

417
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,030
I think I did the wrong thing.

418
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:26,900
Instead of talking to him, I should've
grabbed onto him and called you.

419
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,030
Did you tell him about
the mitigating circumstances defense?

420
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:34,690
I did. But Chief?

421
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:39,890
I don't think he's hiding because
he's afraid of being investigated.

422
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,950
Then?

423
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:46,810
He said he has something to do.
That he'll come back when he's done.

424
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:52,940
But I have no idea
what it is he feels he needs to do.

425
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,000
Well, what could it be?

426
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:11,750
I printed just a few pages.
Check if they match with your records.

427
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,830
You should know better than anyone
that you can't do me in with this.

428
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:39,020
But it's certainly enough
to cause you major discomfort.

429
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,840
It's still a weakness, isn't it?

430
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,670
What is it you want?

431
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:50,620
I don't expect much. Just enough
to set me up after my retirement.

432
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,580
You've changed over the years.

433
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:58,830
Time can change
both mountains and men.

434
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,680
So you want to line your pockets
with this opportunity?

435
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,940
An explanation is unnecessary
since you know so well already.

436
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,030
Fine, how much do you want?

437
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,920
I don't need money.

438
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,890
From what I know,
you have a lot of valuable items.

439
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,920
Can I tell you what I want?

440
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,780
What do you want?

441
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,880
Something that Gyoon has to do.

442
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,870
Maybe he wants
to complete Robin Hood?

443
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:37,940
What do you mean,
complete Robin Hood?

444
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,820
The seven national treasures
your father stole.

445
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,590
Maybe he wants to return
all of them to the museum.

446
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,690
That's possible.

447
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:52,000
Then the two remaining
national treasures are...

448
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,920
The “Geumdongdae” incense burner
and Duryang Kim's “Sansu” painting?

449
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,020
Is it impossible?

450
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:02,010
Chief Noh, you're greedier than
I assumed. Not just one, but two.

451
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,740
And you know how valuable both are!

452
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:09,750
I need at least that much
to enjoy life a little after retirement.

453
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,970
I think the files are worth
those two items. Do you refuse?

454
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:21,550
I couldn't.
Fine, I'll give them to you.

455
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,640
Quick to decide, as expected.

456
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:33,560
But keep this in mind.
You'll regret touching my items someday.

457
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,010
Your items?

458
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:42,900
Cultural assets belong to the country, no?
Moreover, these are national treasures.

459
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,650
Now you sound like
the regulations team chief.

460
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:53,980
National treasures or stolen goods, I paid
good money for them. They belong to me.

461
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,040
That's your logic.

462
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:32,790
Thank you for the ride, Chief.

463
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,960
No problem.

464
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:38,810
By the way,
I had some men stationed here.

465
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:44,760
They'll patrol the area at night
so you'll be safe. And...

466
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:49,710
Don't worry about Gyoon.
We'll find him first, for sure.

467
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,830
Thank you.
I'm always burdening you.

468
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,820
When did you ever burden me?

469
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:05,740
Just, you know, this and that.
I trouble you all the time.

470
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:10,890
Chohee, are you still
uncomfortable around me?

471
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:11,950
What?

472
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:16,610
You said before that you were
always uncomfortable around me.

473
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,840
Are you still?

474
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:23,600
No. Now I'm not.

475
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:29,000
I'm not sure when, but I've grown
comfortable with you, Chief.

476
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:38,640
In the past, I felt nervous talking to you
and was uneasy eating with you.

477
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:43,860
Hearing that you feel comfortable now
is somehow upsetting.

478
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,730
Why? Isn't it a good thing?

479
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:49,780
No, I don't think it is.

480
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:57,880
I liked it better when I was
an uncomfortable person to you.

481
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:04,930
Uncomfortable because just looking
at that person sends the heart racing.

482
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:12,590
Because you're that kind
of person for me now.

483
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,940
Chief.

484
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:18,620
It's true, I like you.

485
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,690
Um, Chief.

486
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:39,940
I'm sorry, but I don't have the leisure to
think of things other than Gyoon and Dad.

487
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,820
And there's also Bumsang.

488
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,800
I know I'm a bit late.

489
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:58,780
But I just wanted to tell you, that when
things are difficult, you can lean on me.

490
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:09,580
So we're even now, aren't we?

491
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:19,610
I'll try my best to be comfortable with you,
so don't feel pressured by what I said.

492
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,760
Bye.

493
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,690
Hey.

494
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:58,610
When did you get here?

495
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:05,860
Just now. I didn't mean to overhear.
It just happened.

496
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:07,960
Bye.

497
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,800
You can't just leave like this.

498
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,940
The thing is...

499
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:27,590
Chief Kang was totally cool.

500
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:33,960
He knows how to confess his feelings.
Much better than an inept boyfriend.

501
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,860
But he always does things
a little awkwardly.

502
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:43,860
I mean, that was bad timing.

503
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:50,730
I'll confess my feelings at a totally
fancy place, okay? That I like you.

504
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,030
That I sincerely like you.

505
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,740
Then again, maybe
you don't like fancy things.

506
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,710
I don't know. Go in. Bye.

507
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,630
I like you.

508
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,830
Chief, is something wrong?

509
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,620
Hello.

510
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:37,670
What's with the heavy sigh?

511
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:41,670
What? Ah, it's nothing.

512
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:45,920
It doesn't look like nothing.

513
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:50,630
By the way, Chief Noh
wanted you to call him.

514
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:51,630
Chief Noh?

515
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:52,600
Yes.

516
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:53,880
Okay, I'll do that.

517
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:58,700
Yeah, I'll leave it to you.

518
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:00,790
Yeah, okay.

519
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:15,870
Chief Noh!
How could you do this to me?

520
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,730
[Chairman Jang]

521
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:26,860
Did you prepare the items
like I instructed?

522
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:31,770
I did, but what do you plan to do?

523
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,590
What else?
We have to strike a deal.

524
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:37,970
If a merchant doesn't make deals,
how will he make a profit?

525
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,860
But this deal is a little...

526
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:45,830
We won't find out if we made
a profit in this deal until it's done.

527
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:47,710
Just do as I instructed.

528
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,740
Yes, sir.

529
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:54,000
And I almost forgot.
Call Mr. Kim and tell him to come.

530
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,640
Yes, sir.

531
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,660
Chohee!

532
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:11,600
Hey, Joohyun.

533
00:50:16,870 --> 00:50:18,740
Going somewhere?

534
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:20,940
To the general manager's office
to give him a report.

535
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:26,710
The general manager? How unlucky.
What a bad way to start the day.

536
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:28,550
Good l uck.

537
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:29,890
Thanks.

538
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,920
Did you fight with Chohee again?

539
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,910
What?

540
00:50:42,910 --> 00:50:45,970
It's just that there was
a weird tension between you two.

541
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:50,770
We didn't fight.
But I did do something wrong.

542
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:52,710
What did you do?

543
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:00,660
Chief! You're wearing ties
more and more these days.

544
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:02,660
Does it look bad?

545
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:07,930
Not at all.
Looks great with the necktie clip.

546
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:12,960
I have an appointment right now, so push
back today's meeting to the evening.

547
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:13,950
Okay.

548
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:15,830
Bumsang, I'll see you in the evening.

549
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:16,890
Goodbye.

550
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:24,660
Our chief is acting weird these days.

551
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,760
I think he's having an affair.

552
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,980
An affair?

553
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:35,690
He keeps leaving the office
to meet someone. It's suspicious.

554
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:21,650
Let's check the items first.

555
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:24,900
Why are you here when it was
Chairman Jang I talked to on the phone?

556
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,560
Did you really think
he'd come out to a place like this?

557
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,720
Of course not.

558
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:35,650
I just asked because I wondered
if maybe he had health problems.

559
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,640
Why are you stalling?

560
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,720
Jeez, you're impatient.

561
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,740
Is there a reason you're stalling?

562
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,040
Not at all.

563
00:55:06,550 --> 00:55:07,640
Guys.

564
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,670
Yes, Boss?

565
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:13,800
Let's take this opportunity
to salvage our hurt pride.

566
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,620
Yes, Boss!

567
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,730
It seems to be in order.

568
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:26,810
Then I should check my items, too.

569
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:28,780
Go ahead.

570
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:38,650
About the hard drive. I didn't make
a copy so there's no need to worry.

571
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:41,630
Doesn't matter if you made a copy.

572
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,800
You'll never get to see it again.

573
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:46,930
What do you mean?

574
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:47,950
Uncle!

575
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:49,830
You're -

576
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:51,850
We have to run!

577
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:56,780
What are you doing?
Go after them!

578
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,560
Let's go!

579
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,660
Uncle, why isn't Chief Kang here yet?

580
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:21,810
I don't know. He said he would be here.
I don't know what happened.

581
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:25,810
I don't kow if we should run with these.

582
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:28,810
Uncle!

583
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:31,590
What the -

584
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:41,610
It seems Chairman Jang
saw right through our plan.

585
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,020
What do we do?

586
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:56,840
Let's get out of here first.

587
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:22,960
Yo, Chief Noh.
Of all the places to run into you.

588
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:29,710
Hey! It's that weasel!
I was wondering where you had gone.

589
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:34,810
It seems I can catch
two birds with one stone today.

590
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:40,780
I don't understand how this happened
but thanks for traveling in a set.

591
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:41,790
Guys!

592
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:42,830
Yes?

593
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:49,780
It's hot. Why don't we take these guys
for a little swim with the fishes?

594
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:52,030
Crush ‘em!

595
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:10,670
What's going on?

596
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:11,990
Bumsang?

597
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:13,620
Move it!

598
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:25,870
Don't you guys have any basic manners?
All of you ganging up on two guys!

599
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,020
Bastard!

600
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,030
Bro!

601
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,010
You're -

602
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:34,980
Mr. Kim! Long time no see.

603
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:39,000
When are we going to
get cleared for mobilization?

604
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,560
I told you to wait.
Why are you badgering me?

605
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,860
It's been two hours already.
We're in a state of emergency right now!

606
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:49,670
Why can't we at least take some guys
from the criminal investigations team?

607
00:58:49,670 --> 00:58:54,760
I don't know! How am I supposed
to let you go when the superiors say no?

608
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:57,730
I'll try again, so wait a bit more.

609
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,730
Sir!

610
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:12,840
The last time we met, did I fail to mention
I was close with the police commissioner?

611
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:19,560
You think you'll be safe
after this insolent behavior?

612
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:22,860
Chief, what happened?

613
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,990
We won't get approved.
Let's go on our own.

614
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:28,750
Just us?

615
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:37,750
Gyoon. I'll clear a path for you.
Take Chief Noh and go.

616
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:38,900
What are you talking about?

617
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,810
Call Chief Kang.
I'll try to hold on as long as I can.

618
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:42,960
Bro!

619
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:44,020
You want to all die together?

620
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:45,810
Bro...

621
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:49,730
Look at those two.
Are you two dating?

622
00:59:50,010 --> 00:59:53,640
Why are you conversing so intimately
in the middle of a fight?

623
00:59:54,770 --> 01:00:00,680
We were discussing how you are
a disgrace to the surname Kim.

624
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,670
You little!

625
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:12,910
You mean Gyoon is
with Chief Noh right now?

626
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:16,810
Yes. I don't know the details
so let's head over there.

627
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:21,870
This is the regulations team.

628
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:24,880
Yes.

629
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:30,610
What? Okay, okay.
Yes, I understand.

630
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:35,850
What do we do? Bad news!
Chief Noh was taken to the hospital.

631
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:36,860
What?

632
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:41,700
What about Gyoon?
Is Gyoon okay?

633
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:47,630
Gyoon called the hospital himself
so he's fine. The problem is Bumsang.

634
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:49,690
Bumsang?
Bumsang was there with them?

635
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:50,830
Why was he there?

636
01:00:50,830 --> 01:00:54,890
Seems he fought with Mr. Kim and
his men to save Chief Noh and Gyoon.

637
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:56,670
The investigations team
went to save him, but -

638
01:00:56,670 --> 01:00:59,570
Joohyun, what did you just say?

639
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:03,780
What happened to Bumsang?

640
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:53,790

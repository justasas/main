1
00:00:40,956 --> 00:00:43,700
<i>Since before recorded time</i>

2
00:00:43,709 --> 00:00:48,705
<i>it had swung through the universe
in an elliptical orbit so large</i>

3
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:54,677
<i>that its very existence remained
a secret of time and space.</i>

4
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:58,968
<i>But now, in the last few years
of the 20th century,</i>

5
00:00:58,972 --> 00:01:02,137
<i>the visitor was returning.</i>

6
00:01:10,148 --> 00:01:14,189
<i>The citizens of Earth would get
an extra Christmas present this year,</i>

7
00:01:14,194 --> 00:01:17,314
<i>as their planet orbited
through the tail of the comet.</i>

8
00:01:17,322 --> 00:01:20,532
<i>Scientists predicted a light show
of stellar proportions,</i>

9
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:25,117
<i>something not seen on Earth
for 65 million years.</i>

10
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,287
<i>Indeed, not since the time
that the dinosaurs disappeared,</i>

11
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:31,079
<i>virtually overnight.</i>

12
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,588
<i>There were a few who saw this
as more than just a coincidence.</i>

13
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:43,510
<i>But most didn't.</i>

14
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:18,618
I'm showing you
the top of the line here.

15
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:22,121
This is the best we have.
This is $9.50.

16
00:02:22,463 --> 00:02:24,251
- $9.50?
- But wait a minute.

17
00:02:24,256 --> 00:02:27,466
This is $8.00, okay?
This is $7.50.

18
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:28,835
This lady over here,
she's wearing the $7.50.

19
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:30,711
- Yeah, I like it.
- Let me tell you about this thing.

20
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,237
Blow on it there.

21
00:02:55,618 --> 00:02:57,361
See?
See how nice that is?

22
00:02:57,369 --> 00:02:58,952
Isn't that great?

23
00:02:58,953 --> 00:03:01,071
I know you got $9.50.

24
00:03:12,006 --> 00:03:14,546
- Will it work?
- Oh, yeah.

25
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,134
I know it will.

26
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:17,379
This spring, look at it.

27
00:03:17,387 --> 00:03:18,924
Isn't that nice.

28
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,719
And the other side.
Look at it.

29
00:03:20,723 --> 00:03:22,181
Isn't that great?
$9.50.

30
00:03:23,643 --> 00:03:24,885
<i>Enjoy the movie.</i>

31
00:03:26,144 --> 00:03:27,604
Excuse me,
where's the men's room?

32
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:29,563
- One minute.
- Do you work here or not?

33
00:03:29,564 --> 00:03:30,681
Hey, Regina.

34
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,977
Regina, give that thing
a rest, will ya?

35
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:33,099
In a minute, Mel.

36
00:03:33,108 --> 00:03:36,353
<i>Look, I don't pay you to do
that kind of stuff around here.</i>

37
00:03:36,362 --> 00:03:38,697
<i>Regina, I want you
to clean everything up</i>

38
00:03:38,697 --> 00:03:41,237
<i>so we can get out of here
in time to watch the comet.</i>

39
00:03:41,241 --> 00:03:42,483
Everything's cleaned up.

40
00:03:43,618 --> 00:03:44,701
Damn!

41
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:48,163
I want you to take this flashlight
and walk the house.

42
00:03:48,164 --> 00:03:50,203
Aw, Mel,
they throw things at me.

43
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,791
Who cares?

44
00:03:51,792 --> 00:03:53,410
Walk the house.

45
00:03:53,418 --> 00:03:55,456
Have you ever been hit
with Dots, Mel?

46
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:57,831
Milk Duds?
Those things hurt.

47
00:03:57,839 --> 00:04:00,002
I-- I don--

48
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,251
Oh, how are you, sir?

49
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:03,251
The refreshments
are right over there.

50
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,924
Thank you.
Thank you.

51
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:08,094
I don't want those weirdos cutting up
the seats, you understand?

52
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:10,641
Okay, okay, okay.

53
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,311
Replacing Reg in third place

54
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:18,899
is Reg, third place.

55
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:24,066
Wait a minute.

56
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,818
<i>Somebody named DMK
in sixth place.</i>

57
00:04:26,823 --> 00:04:27,986
<i>When did this happen?</i>

58
00:04:27,991 --> 00:04:29,404
<i>Look, don't be an overachiever,</i>

59
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:31,573
you'll fit in better
with your age group, okay?

60
00:04:32,411 --> 00:04:34,451
This is really annoying.

61
00:04:34,455 --> 00:04:36,573
<i>Regina, Regina,
look this way.</i>

62
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:38,449
<i>Regina!
Look at me!</i>

63
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,950
Read my lips.

64
00:04:41,003 --> 00:04:42,995
<i>Flashlight.</i>

65
00:04:43,004 --> 00:04:46,875
Walk house now, hm?

66
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:48,170
Okay, Mel.

67
00:04:49,884 --> 00:04:51,092
Let me take this for you.

68
00:04:51,094 --> 00:04:53,634
Uh, uh, that, that's great,
they go to profits.

69
00:04:53,638 --> 00:04:55,757
And listen, stay out
of the projection booth.

70
00:04:55,765 --> 00:04:56,928
And stay away from Dupree!

71
00:04:56,933 --> 00:04:59,017
I'm gonna fire that guy
some day.

72
00:04:59,018 --> 00:05:00,886
He's been doing to me what
he's been doing to her in the booth.

73
00:05:00,894 --> 00:05:04,890
<i>David, that was a scream.</i>

74
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:06,983
<i>You're right,
I'm gonna check it out.</i>

75
00:05:06,984 --> 00:05:08,318
<i>You stay here.</i>

76
00:05:08,318 --> 00:05:10,527
<i>I'm talkin'
about a mint condition print</i>

77
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:11,816
of It Came from Outer Space.

78
00:05:12,738 --> 00:05:14,858
In 3D, man.

79
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:17,701
Yeah, right,
Tres Dimensiones.

80
00:05:17,702 --> 00:05:20,115
Look, you know as well as I do,
you got film freaks

81
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,205
who'd go down on you
for a bootleg print of that.

82
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,158
Oh, a hundred bucks?

83
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:27,250
Hundred bucks, right.

84
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:28,916
Something wrong
with the phone here

85
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,503
or did I hear you say
a hundred dollars?

86
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,589
Look, a hundred dollars
isn't going to get it this time.

87
00:05:33,673 --> 00:05:35,417
Because I'm gonna have
to spend the night in here

88
00:05:35,426 --> 00:05:37,339
waiting for you
to bring the print back.

89
00:05:37,343 --> 00:05:40,178
Think I'm gonna miss this comet thing
for a lousy hundred dollars?

90
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:44,223
Okay, $110's
a little better, yeah.

91
00:05:45,184 --> 00:05:46,768
Hey, Reggie, here's the deal.

92
00:05:46,769 --> 00:05:48,433
You leave,
I let you in the back door.

93
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:50,977
Okay, I leave, you let me back in.
Mel thinks everybody's gone.

94
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:53,065
Larry, do you know anybody
named DMK?

95
00:05:53,066 --> 00:05:54,274
No, ow!

96
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:56,859
No, you gotta have the print back
by 6:00 in the morning.

97
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,980
You know, if we spend the night
in here, we're gonna miss the comet.

98
00:05:59,988 --> 00:06:02,859
It's not like you can't see it
on television, you know.

99
00:06:02,867 --> 00:06:04,700
All right, hey,
get your guy here in an hour.

100
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:07,695
Yeah, well, maybe I want
to see it for real, okay?

101
00:06:07,703 --> 00:06:10,117
Hey, television's real.
Television's very real.

102
00:06:11,582 --> 00:06:13,667
<i>So, what do you say?
I'll give you $15.</i>

103
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:16,669
Are you kidding?

104
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,333
We spend the night in here
and we end up making it.

105
00:06:18,338 --> 00:06:19,627
And you give me 15 bucks?

106
00:06:19,632 --> 00:06:21,044
Do you know what
that makes me look like?

107
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:23,839
Reggie, I'm not giving you 15 bucks
for making it with me.

108
00:06:25,637 --> 00:06:27,880
Okay, well, just so we have
that straight, okay?

109
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:29,597
Yeah, for sure.

110
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:32,183
I mean, you'd be worth
a lot more than 15 bucks.

111
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:33,677
<i>Everybody knows that.</i>

112
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:39,978
<i>The first earthlings to see the effects
will be in Newfundland.</i>

113
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,192
<i>Or Newfoundland.</i>

114
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,942
<i>This is expected
to begin at-- at 2:04.</i>

115
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,985
- That's Pacific Standard Time.
- Hey, Sammy, Sammy, Sammy.

116
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:52,736
<i>Uh, interesting, uh, sidebar
to this story is the fact that</i>

117
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:55,534
<i>all telecommunications
seem to be out</i>

118
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:57,076
<i>in that part of the world.</i>

119
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:58,915
<i>Uh, this could have--</i>

120
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,248
Hello.

121
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:10,172
Samantha, you sound pissed.

122
00:07:10,884 --> 00:07:14,095
I just had it out with Doris
once and for all again.

123
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,890
She wants me to like,
haul chips and dips around

124
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:20,260
for her little comet party.

125
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:23,012
Yeah, well, speaking of Doris,
look, I need your help.

126
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,015
Tell her that, uh, you know
all about this field trip

127
00:07:26,023 --> 00:07:28,186
that I'm gonna take, okay,
with my science class?

128
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:30,402
We're gonna go to the observatory
to watch the comet.

129
00:07:30,403 --> 00:07:32,020
She won't go for it.

130
00:07:32,028 --> 00:07:34,113
<i>She'll go for it.
Just tell her, okay?</i>

131
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:35,481
Okay.

132
00:07:40,953 --> 00:07:42,787
Doris.

133
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:44,451
Reggie's on the phone.

134
00:07:45,415 --> 00:07:47,455
She's not having car trouble?

135
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:48,917
She's gonna be out all night

136
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:51,128
with her science class
at the observatory.

137
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:53,835
I know all about it.

138
00:07:55,465 --> 00:07:56,833
<i>We gotta get outta here.</i>

139
00:07:56,842 --> 00:07:58,085
Yeah, hi, Doris.

140
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:00,178
<i>What's this about a science
class, Regina?</i>

141
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,047
Well, you want me to do better
in science, don't you?

142
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,054
I want you home in five minutes
after you finish work.

143
00:08:06,058 --> 00:08:08,392
If you want to watch the comet,
you can do it here.

144
00:08:08,393 --> 00:08:11,513
Look, Doris, like, I'm 18, okay?

145
00:08:11,521 --> 00:08:13,936
And I can watch the comet
wherever I want to watch the comet.

146
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,151
Here, Samantha.

147
00:08:17,152 --> 00:08:18,985
You and your sister share
a lot of secrets.

148
00:08:18,986 --> 00:08:20,480
I want you to share
this one with her.

149
00:08:20,488 --> 00:08:24,575
<i>If it were up to me,
I couldn't care less what she did.</i>

150
00:08:24,576 --> 00:08:26,989
But if your father
makes it back home

151
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:29,828
without some Sandinista
blowing his brains out,

152
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:31,414
<i>he's gonna hold me responsible</i>

153
00:08:31,415 --> 00:08:33,453
<i>for any kind of trouble
you two girls get into.</i>

154
00:08:34,293 --> 00:08:37,127
What we have here is
a chain of command.

155
00:08:37,128 --> 00:08:39,587
The Major jumps on me,
I jump on you.

156
00:08:40,422 --> 00:08:41,540
Did you get that?

157
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:44,213
Okay.

158
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:47,550
Now, are you going
to join the party?

159
00:08:47,554 --> 00:08:49,717
Join the party for what, Doris?

160
00:08:49,722 --> 00:08:51,636
So I can watch Chuck
from across the street

161
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:54,101
stick his hands
down your pants?

162
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,889
I think that's something
Daddy should know.

163
00:08:56,687 --> 00:08:58,600
Chuck's a nice guy.

164
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,940
He's certainly nice to be with
while Daddy's down in Banana Land.

165
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:05,233
You were born with an asshole, Doris,
you don't need Chuck.

166
00:09:14,202 --> 00:09:18,165
<i>Looks like a-- a-- a real nice crowd
we have out here tonight.</i>

167
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:30,925
Sarah, Chucky.

168
00:09:30,926 --> 00:09:32,259
Hey, where have you been?
You're gonna miss everything.

169
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,049
- It's gonna start.
- Oh, kids.

170
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:36,388
I'll never marry
another man with kids.

171
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:39,553
In 1910,
Halley's Comet returned.

172
00:09:39,557 --> 00:09:41,643
Everybody thought
they were going to die then.

173
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:49,391
What was that?

174
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,517
Look!

175
00:09:58,742 --> 00:10:00,985
You want to know
what bugs me about all this?

176
00:10:00,994 --> 00:10:02,158
What?

177
00:10:03,538 --> 00:10:07,408
Well, I'm always afraid someone's
gonna see us, you know?

178
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:08,499
See us how?

179
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,960
There's no windows.
They can't see through walls.

180
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:13,997
Well, Superman
can see through walls.

181
00:10:14,798 --> 00:10:17,086
Not these walls,
they're made out of steel.

182
00:10:17,091 --> 00:10:18,550
Used to be a fire law.

183
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:20,423
Uh!

184
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:23,388
Superman can see through steel.

185
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:26,599
Nope, it's the one thing
he cannot see through.

186
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:28,592
That's lead, you nerd.

187
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:31,396
- Lead?
- Yeah.

188
00:10:31,396 --> 00:10:34,230
I mean, Superman can see through steel
like it wasn't there even.

189
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:35,349
Huh.

190
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:37,563
Larry!

191
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:39,152
<i>Well, I guess I'm the only
one who's not outside</i>

192
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:40,269
<i>watching the meteor shower.</i>

193
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:41,441
<i>I just might put
the radio station</i>

194
00:10:41,446 --> 00:10:43,360
<i>on autopilot
and sneak out myself.</i>

195
00:13:19,753 --> 00:13:21,791
<i>This is the big K in Los Angeles.</i>

196
00:13:21,796 --> 00:13:23,789
<i>A great looking morning
in Southern California.</i>

197
00:13:23,798 --> 00:13:27,384
<i>Fifty thousand watts of coiled steel
and passion FM in the AM.</i>

198
00:13:27,385 --> 00:13:28,877
<i>It's wake up time
in the city of angels.</i>

199
00:13:29,094 --> 00:13:31,088
<i>And I'm Steve LaBeau.</i>

200
00:13:31,097 --> 00:13:32,555
<i>God damn it!</i>

201
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,804
What? What?

202
00:13:36,142 --> 00:13:38,307
I've been waiting by that door
for the last 30 minutes

203
00:13:38,312 --> 00:13:40,054
and that pinhead hasn't brought
the film back yet!

204
00:13:40,062 --> 00:13:41,681
Oh, give the guy a break.

205
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,899
I mean, people are late
sometimes.

206
00:13:44,859 --> 00:13:47,318
No, something's wrong.

207
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:49,984
If he screwed that film up,
we could all be in a lot of trouble.

208
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:54,280
I'm gonna go over there
on the bike.

209
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:56,697
Aw, jeez, don't I get
an Egg McMuffin or anything?

210
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,574
You could do me a favor.

211
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:00,531
I did you a favor last night.

212
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,873
That guy calls,

213
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:05,035
you tell him
I'm on my way over

214
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,786
and I'm very, very, very,
very pissed!

215
00:14:07,504 --> 00:14:09,462
Hey what about my 15 bucks?

216
00:14:09,463 --> 00:14:11,128
Tell him you're pissed too.

217
00:14:31,191 --> 00:14:32,809
DMK.

218
00:14:37,864 --> 00:14:40,903
You trust people you get
screwed over every God damn time.

219
00:14:43,911 --> 00:14:45,995
Oh, is that you?

220
00:14:45,995 --> 00:14:47,580
Yeah, it's about friggin time.

221
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:55,792
Uh!

222
00:15:14,771 --> 00:15:16,105
Yeah!

223
00:15:26,573 --> 00:15:28,988
End of you, DMK.

224
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:30,827
You're history.

225
00:16:32,798 --> 00:16:35,292
God, bad smog.

226
00:16:36,678 --> 00:16:38,011
Shit!

227
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:40,838
Shit.

228
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:43,766
Oh, damn it!

229
00:16:45,185 --> 00:16:46,473
Just great!

230
00:16:48,855 --> 00:16:49,847
Uh!

231
00:16:50,398 --> 00:16:52,106
Places closed everywhere.

232
00:16:56,403 --> 00:16:58,441
I hate days that
start like this!

233
00:17:07,788 --> 00:17:09,623
Okay.

234
00:17:09,624 --> 00:17:12,709
Oh, damn it, damn it!

235
00:17:25,637 --> 00:17:27,426
Uh, gross.

236
00:17:34,312 --> 00:17:35,474
<i>Larry?</i>

237
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:21,644
Whoa, what is this,
trick or treat?

238
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:23,688
Come here!

239
00:18:23,689 --> 00:18:24,806
What?

240
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:27,650
Come here!

241
00:18:27,651 --> 00:18:29,143
Come here, your ass.

242
00:18:33,823 --> 00:18:36,783
Uh, look, I don't know
what your scene is,

243
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,902
but don't do
anything stupid, okay?

244
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,072
No, no, you don't seem
to understand.

245
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,870
<i>I've been trained
to take care of myself.</i>

246
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,664
You know what I'm saying?

247
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,081
I don't want to hurt you.

248
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:53,793
Oh, shit.

249
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,802
No, let go!

250
00:19:05,392 --> 00:19:07,135
Let go of me!

251
00:19:07,895 --> 00:19:09,137
No!

252
00:19:19,404 --> 00:19:21,148
Come on, come on, come on!

253
00:22:12,682 --> 00:22:14,017
Samantha?

254
00:22:16,144 --> 00:22:17,308
Doris?

255
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,008
- Samantha?
- What?

256
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,770
God, what are trying to do,
give me a heart attack?

257
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:06,354
I thought you were Doris.

258
00:23:06,355 --> 00:23:07,849
You know she decked
me last night?

259
00:23:07,857 --> 00:23:09,269
Knocked one
of my teeth loose even.

260
00:23:09,274 --> 00:23:11,394
<i>Wait till Daddy hears
about that.</i>

261
00:23:11,403 --> 00:23:13,737
<i>You know how he's always telling me
to be careful with my mouth</i>

262
00:23:13,737 --> 00:23:16,856
on account of the dental plan
doesn't cover anything cosmetic.

263
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:18,653
Ooh, anyway, get this--

264
00:23:18,658 --> 00:23:21,573
I think Chuck and Doris spent
the night together last night.

265
00:23:21,577 --> 00:23:23,570
<i>Wait till Daddy hears
about that.</i>

266
00:23:23,579 --> 00:23:25,947
I mean, even if he isn't pissed off
about my mouth,

267
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:27,790
which I can't imagine.

268
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,585
What's happening?

269
00:23:30,585 --> 00:23:32,703
Oh yeah, I guess you are
a little confused.

270
00:23:34,464 --> 00:23:35,831
God, you look terrible.

271
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,425
I ran away last night
after she slugged me.

272
00:23:38,426 --> 00:23:39,838
Left a note and everything.

273
00:23:39,843 --> 00:23:41,087
I didn't have
any place to go,

274
00:23:41,095 --> 00:23:43,964
so I spent the night
in a lawn storage shed.

275
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:46,933
Pretty gross with the Synerol
and everything.

276
00:23:46,933 --> 00:23:49,551
God, look at this kitchen.

277
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:52,263
I'm not cleaning this up.

278
00:23:52,938 --> 00:23:56,354
So anyway, since I was still here
this morning I thought,

279
00:23:56,358 --> 00:23:59,943
"Hey, I'll go to pep squad practice
and split after."

280
00:23:59,944 --> 00:24:02,905
Except for I don't know
if pep squad practice is on or not.

281
00:24:02,905 --> 00:24:04,273
I can't get anybody
on the phone.

282
00:24:04,282 --> 00:24:09,120
Sammy, you can't get anybody
on the phone because everybody's gone.

283
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,989
What?
Would you grab the milk please?

284
00:24:11,997 --> 00:24:13,365
I swear to God!

285
00:24:13,373 --> 00:24:14,957
You made me swallow my gum.

286
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,498
There's nobody!
I mean, there's nobody!

287
00:24:18,503 --> 00:24:21,872
Oh, right, nobody.
I'm sure.

288
00:24:21,881 --> 00:24:23,123
- Come here.
- Hey!

289
00:24:24,592 --> 00:24:26,085
Hey, back off!

290
00:24:26,093 --> 00:24:27,710
This sweater cost 80 bucks.

291
00:24:32,348 --> 00:24:33,510
Buffy?

292
00:24:36,435 --> 00:24:37,848
Stupid dog.

293
00:24:38,687 --> 00:24:40,806
Look.
Look at this!

294
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:43,979
At what?

295
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,897
Doris isn't at Chuck's.

296
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:47,361
I'll show you Doris.

297
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,648
Here's Doris.

298
00:24:50,656 --> 00:24:52,945
This is all that's left of her.
This and dust.

299
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,235
Look.

300
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,655
Here's Chuck.

301
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:06,873
Where are the kids?

302
00:25:10,215 --> 00:25:13,927
<i>It's Saturday morning.
Where are the God damn kids?</i>

303
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,028
They're around.

304
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:42,902
They're not around.

305
00:25:44,203 --> 00:25:47,744
Look, if you're trying to scare me,
you're doing it, okay?

306
00:25:47,748 --> 00:25:49,912
I'm not trying to scare you.

307
00:25:49,917 --> 00:25:51,079
Then stop it.

308
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:52,953
I'm not doing it!

309
00:25:52,962 --> 00:25:54,454
You try calling someone.

310
00:25:54,462 --> 00:25:56,752
Not just your pep squad--
anyone.

311
00:25:56,757 --> 00:25:58,715
Nobody's home!

312
00:25:58,716 --> 00:25:59,799
<i>Unbelievable,</i>

313
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:01,839
<i>that's song number sixteen
on the survey this week.</i>

314
00:26:01,844 --> 00:26:04,884
<i>Don't forget, we preview
the top 20 every Friday night.</i>

315
00:26:04,888 --> 00:26:07,553
<i>A great way to start a super weekend
here in the Southland.</i>

316
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:08,892
<i>Get down.</i>

317
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,664
Are you sure this is
the radio station?

318
00:26:35,665 --> 00:26:38,330
- Yeah, just go on in.
- Well, don't push.

319
00:26:51,014 --> 00:26:53,257
Do you think whatever happened
happened everywhere?

320
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:55,428
Like in Burbank
and places like that?

321
00:26:58,186 --> 00:27:00,521
We'll ask the DJ.
He does the news, doesn't he?

322
00:27:00,521 --> 00:27:03,265
Search me, I always change the channel
when the news comes on.

323
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:09,524
<i>There's something in here.</i>

324
00:27:16,118 --> 00:27:17,577
So, where is he?

325
00:27:23,291 --> 00:27:25,910
I mean, somebody has
to run this stuff, don't they?

326
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:26,957
<i>We Got Trouble, Not Us--</i>

327
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:28,124
<i>that's the name of the song.</i>

328
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:30,121
<i>And I'm Steve LaBeau
trapped inside your radio.</i>

329
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:32,089
<i>The guy who really cares
about you.</i>

330
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:34,049
<i>I mean, who else would sit
in this little box every day</i>

331
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:35,259
<i>just to play music for you.</i>

332
00:27:36,303 --> 00:27:38,591
<i>Well, it? time to reach
into the old mailbag here.</i>

333
00:27:38,596 --> 00:27:40,589
<i>- I got a letter from--
- Beam me up, Scotty.</i>

334
00:27:41,683 --> 00:27:43,971
Okay, girls,
hold it right there.

335
00:27:43,976 --> 00:27:45,560
You, the blonde,
get into the light.

336
00:27:46,437 --> 00:27:47,554
Wait.

337
00:27:48,439 --> 00:27:50,523
Why don't you just
let my sister go

338
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:52,390
and maybe you and I can
work something out.

339
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,608
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Shut up!

340
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:55,853
You got the wrong idea.
You, into the light.

341
00:27:55,861 --> 00:27:59,902
I'll give you to five.
One, two-- no?

342
00:28:00,824 --> 00:28:02,737
All right, let's try it this way.

343
00:28:02,742 --> 00:28:06,033
- Five, four, three--
- Okay, okay.

344
00:28:07,248 --> 00:28:08,785
Do you get a lot
of dates this way?

345
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:11,916
Open your eyes.

346
00:28:18,758 --> 00:28:20,091
Okay.

347
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,753
Hey, I know what
you're thinkin' but--

348
00:28:24,762 --> 00:28:26,096
<i>That you're a cretin?</i>

349
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:28,216
Sweetheart.

350
00:28:29,267 --> 00:28:32,182
You haven't seen those freaked-out
zombies runnin' around here?

351
00:28:32,186 --> 00:28:33,894
Yeah, I was jumped by one.

352
00:28:34,604 --> 00:28:36,187
Well, you got off lucky.

353
00:28:37,524 --> 00:28:39,482
Me and this girl pulled
into town this morning.

354
00:28:39,483 --> 00:28:40,476
You don't work here?

355
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,232
No, I drive a truck.

356
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:46,488
I was headin' to San Diego
with this girl I picked up.

357
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,737
We were lookin'
for a gas station.

358
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:53,829
<i>That's when we spotted
one of those--</i>

359
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,948
Whatever they are.

360
00:28:58,376 --> 00:28:59,538
Looked like it was eating--

361
00:29:00,794 --> 00:29:02,459
Looked like it was eating a cat.

362
00:29:02,463 --> 00:29:04,080
A dead cat?

363
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:06,586
Semi dead.

364
00:29:07,091 --> 00:29:09,551
<i>Who'd want to eat a live cat?</i>

365
00:29:09,552 --> 00:29:11,170
<i>Beats the shit out of me.</i>

366
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,264
This girl freaked out.

367
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:16,591
Took off running.

368
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:20,478
I spotted her about...

369
00:29:22,063 --> 00:29:23,680
twenty minutes later.

370
00:29:24,482 --> 00:29:27,396
<i>Looked like one
of those things had...</i>

371
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:28,484
What?

372
00:29:32,364 --> 00:29:34,072
Torn her apart.

373
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,448
Oh, God.

374
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:42,452
Larry.

375
00:29:42,457 --> 00:29:43,869
Oh, shit.

376
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,327
What's with her?

377
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:49,788
I think she's gonna be
sick or something.

378
00:29:50,796 --> 00:29:51,913
This guy she knew--

379
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:54,833
<i>Same thing might have happened.</i>

380
00:29:59,138 --> 00:30:01,051
Is it safe around here,
do you think?

381
00:30:01,556 --> 00:30:03,514
Yeah.

382
00:30:03,515 --> 00:30:04,850
I checked it out.

383
00:30:09,522 --> 00:30:10,980
Swell.

384
00:30:17,653 --> 00:30:19,272
Are you all right?

385
00:30:24,034 --> 00:30:25,277
My name's Hector.

386
00:30:26,454 --> 00:30:27,741
<i>What's yours?</i>

387
00:30:27,746 --> 00:30:30,116
Just leave me alone, okay?

388
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,288
Look, I..

389
00:30:34,502 --> 00:30:36,086
I know we got off
on the wrong foot.

390
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:40,298
<i>But considering what
the alternative is,</i>

391
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:43,009
<i>I think we should try to get along,
what do you say?</i>

392
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,136
Listen, this is no time
for an attitude problem.

393
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,680
Your little sister seems to be
taking this a lot better than you.

394
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:55,224
That's 'cause she doesn't know
what's goin' on.

395
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:56,563
And you do, I suppose?

396
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,683
Whatever's going on
isn't just here, it's everywhere.

397
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,683
She thinks we're
gonna be rescued.

398
00:31:01,692 --> 00:31:03,652
That her dad's gonna
come back from Honduras

399
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:05,567
with the God damn
Green Berets.

400
00:31:05,571 --> 00:31:07,030
She could be right.

401
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:10,489
Give us a break, Hector.

402
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:16,702
Where'd you spend the night
last night?

403
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:26,377
I spent the night in the back
of my truck with the girl I picked up.

404
00:31:28,466 --> 00:31:29,674
What else do you want to know?

405
00:31:29,676 --> 00:31:30,884
Skip it.

406
00:31:32,387 --> 00:31:34,346
Steel's gotta be the answer.

407
00:31:34,347 --> 00:31:36,761
If Sam spent the night
in a lawn storage shed--

408
00:31:39,351 --> 00:31:40,514
What?

409
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:41,852
<i>Again, I'm an employee. I can't--</i>

410
00:31:41,853 --> 00:31:44,519
<i>Just our way of saying Merry Christmas
to you from all--</i>

411
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,160
Testing.

412
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:06,534
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

413
00:32:13,756 --> 00:32:16,421
This is Samantha Belmont,
one-third owner

414
00:32:16,426 --> 00:32:19,842
<i>of the Greater
Los Angeles basin speaking.</i>

415
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,214
<i>You guys?</i>

416
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:25,341
<i>Hey, is anybody there?</i>

417
00:32:28,478 --> 00:32:30,221
Where'd you get this,
a dime store?

418
00:32:31,523 --> 00:32:32,765
Beats me.

419
00:32:32,773 --> 00:32:33,890
It was given to me.

420
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:37,352
Yeah, well, it might be all right
for date night in the barrio,

421
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,524
but if we run into any more
of those guys outside,

422
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:41,319
we're gonna need
a little more stopping power.

423
00:32:46,952 --> 00:32:48,490
Date night in the barrio?

424
00:32:58,254 --> 00:33:00,623
And here's some other changes.

425
00:33:00,632 --> 00:33:02,966
Most of you guys
had finals this week.

426
00:33:02,966 --> 00:33:06,552
Huh, later. They're history.
They're canceled.

427
00:33:06,553 --> 00:33:10,173
The legal drinking age is now ten,
but you will need ID.

428
00:33:10,181 --> 00:33:11,390
Let's be real.

429
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:14,261
I'll be taking requests from all you
teenage comet zombies

430
00:33:14,269 --> 00:33:16,728
on the hit line.

431
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:21,817
That's 5-5-5-4-4-8-7.

432
00:33:21,817 --> 00:33:25,312
Get it?
5-5-5-hits.

433
00:33:33,202 --> 00:33:35,161
Do you know where the Armed
Forces Reserve Center is

434
00:33:35,162 --> 00:33:36,780
at Los Alamitos?

435
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:38,453
Yeah.

436
00:33:38,457 --> 00:33:40,916
My dad used to take us there
for target practice.

437
00:33:42,168 --> 00:33:44,002
They store automatic
weapons there.

438
00:33:45,213 --> 00:33:46,329
You know how to use 'em?

439
00:33:47,215 --> 00:33:49,129
Come on, Hector.

440
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:50,545
The MAC-10
submachine gun

441
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:53,010
was practically designed
for housewives.

442
00:33:55,639 --> 00:33:57,427
I got a call.

443
00:33:57,431 --> 00:33:59,346
It came in on the hit line.

444
00:33:59,892 --> 00:34:00,975
Hello?

445
00:34:02,353 --> 00:34:04,311
- Hello.
- It went dead.

446
00:34:04,312 --> 00:34:06,022
- Did they say they were okay?
- I don't know.

447
00:34:06,023 --> 00:34:07,686
<i>They said
they were in the desert.</i>

448
00:34:07,691 --> 00:34:09,230
<i>The desert.
What desert was it?</i>

449
00:34:09,235 --> 00:34:11,319
<i>- I don't know.
- Shit! Think!</i>

450
00:34:11,319 --> 00:34:12,778
<i>Why don't you just
pull your gun on her?</i>

451
00:34:12,779 --> 00:34:14,021
<i>Maybe you can scare it
out of her.</i>

452
00:34:15,072 --> 00:34:17,236
<i>They said they were like,
part of a think tank,</i>

453
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:18,654
<i>a research group
or something.</i>

454
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:19,993
<i>Where, was it in this State?</i>

455
00:34:21,495 --> 00:34:22,658
<i>I forget.</i>

456
00:34:22,663 --> 00:34:24,496
<i>Okay, let's take it real slow.</i>

457
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:26,411
<i>Did they mention a town?</i>

458
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:30,502
<i>Uh, someplace they were near,
like maybe Blythe, Bishop?</i>

459
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,496
<i>Uh, what about
Edwards Air Force Base?</i>

460
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:35,624
<i>If I knew, I'd tell you.
I didn't expect the call, you know.</i>

461
00:34:35,632 --> 00:34:37,249
<i>I didn't take notes
or something.</i>

462
00:34:37,258 --> 00:34:39,252
<i>Just try and remember.</i>

463
00:34:39,261 --> 00:34:41,253
<i>You think I'm not telling you
something on purpose?</i>

464
00:34:41,262 --> 00:34:43,676
Well, if they'll stay put,
we can get them.

465
00:34:43,681 --> 00:34:45,299
From a psychological standpoint,

466
00:34:45,308 --> 00:34:47,517
the radio station represents
a link to normalcy.

467
00:34:47,517 --> 00:34:49,557
I don't think they'll wander far
as long as it's operating.

468
00:34:50,395 --> 00:34:54,857
Dr. Carter, I'd just like to say
up front, I'm opposed to this.

469
00:34:54,858 --> 00:34:57,818
<i>There's no reason for us
to bring those people</i>

470
00:34:57,818 --> 00:35:00,062
or any other survivors
back here.

471
00:35:01,238 --> 00:35:03,357
What about
the disintegration factor?

472
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:05,279
You just want
to let that happen?

473
00:35:05,284 --> 00:35:08,073
We don't know that the condition
is progressive.

474
00:35:08,077 --> 00:35:10,070
<i>I think we've
established that, Audrey.</i>

475
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,199
<i>Partial protection seems to result
in a slowing of the overall effect.</i>

476
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:15,621
But progression is steady
in any case.

477
00:35:15,627 --> 00:35:18,496
- Drying of the body fluids--
- Oh, get to the point, Oscar!

478
00:35:18,503 --> 00:35:21,622
We've heard this a thousand times.
What about the dust?

479
00:35:21,631 --> 00:35:24,876
Ultimately, there is nothing left
but calcium dust.

480
00:35:24,884 --> 00:35:27,549
Right, so there isn't even
enough hope

481
00:35:27,553 --> 00:35:29,922
to warrant bringing
anybody back here.

482
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:33,179
So, what you're saying is,
we shouldn't even try.

483
00:35:35,352 --> 00:35:36,390
Right.

484
00:35:38,772 --> 00:35:40,640
We don't want to be caught
in the city after dark.

485
00:35:40,649 --> 00:35:41,731
We'll leave tomorrow.

486
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:46,353
We've had an indication
of some survivors

487
00:35:46,362 --> 00:35:49,232
in San Bernardino, as well--
four, maybe five.

488
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:51,774
<i>Wait, girls, just shut up!</i>

489
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:56,780
<i>Samantha, did they say
anything else? Anything?</i>

490
00:35:59,165 --> 00:36:03,126
<i>Yeah. They said
be careful on the street.</i>

491
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:06,750
<i>Because some people were exposed
to the comet a little bit.</i>

492
00:36:08,297 --> 00:36:10,508
<i>What happened to Doris
is happening to them.</i>

493
00:36:11,467 --> 00:36:12,801
<i>Only slower.</i>

494
00:36:14,469 --> 00:36:18,465
<i>And like... they're dangerous.</i>

495
00:36:20,475 --> 00:36:21,809
<i>Like what happened to Larry.</i>

496
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:00,168
You're not gonna blame me
because the phone went dead.

497
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,169
I'm not the phone company.

498
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,890
Nobody's the phone company
anymore.

499
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:20,777
What?

500
00:37:22,195 --> 00:37:23,484
Cops?

501
00:37:24,907 --> 00:37:26,866
Where were you guys earlier?

502
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:38,286
Oh, shit.
My license.

503
00:37:39,754 --> 00:37:41,418
Oh, shit!

504
00:37:49,387 --> 00:37:51,631
I know you guys are probably going
to give me a ticket or something,

505
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:54,758
but I am really glad to see--

506
00:38:11,824 --> 00:38:13,236
<i>It's the weekend comet sale.</i>

507
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:14,233
<i>Everything must go.</i>

508
00:38:14,242 --> 00:38:16,655
<i>Big savings on tuners,
turntables, car stereos.</i>

509
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,199
<i>Also demos
and crate damaged items.</i>

510
00:38:18,205 --> 00:38:20,493
<i>This weekend only.
Henry's Stereo Warehouse.</i>

511
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:22,242
<i>Fourth and Alameda.
Free coffee for the adults.</i>

512
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,537
<i>Free balloons for the kids.</i>

513
00:38:26,377 --> 00:38:28,291
<i>Number one.</i>

514
00:39:48,994 --> 00:39:51,453
This is from your stepmom,
you punk.

515
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:56,829
They're here, they're here!

516
00:39:56,834 --> 00:39:59,293
- What's wrong?
- It's okay, I got it.

517
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:01,879
- You've got her?
- Yeah, I got her!

518
00:40:08,969 --> 00:40:10,803
Sammy, Sam, it's only a dream.

519
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,802
I know.

520
00:40:16,642 --> 00:40:17,884
I know.

521
00:40:20,646 --> 00:40:22,139
Is there anything I can do?

522
00:40:24,025 --> 00:40:25,232
I'm fine.

523
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,984
<i>Interstate Technologies
is an equal opportunity employer.</i>

524
00:40:27,985 --> 00:40:31,150
<i>Looks like the weather
is shaping up for a great weekend.</i>

525
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:32,272
<i>You know, it's hard to believe
that there's</i>

526
00:40:32,281 --> 00:40:34,946
<i>only 11 more shopping days
till Christmas.</i>

527
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,534
<i>Good luck finding
a parking space</i>

528
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:38,027
<i>within hitchhiking distance
of a mall.</i>

529
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:39,654
<i>You know how jammed
it can get.</i>

530
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:49,871
She Okay?

531
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:53,341
Yeah.
I guess so.

532
00:40:56,178 --> 00:40:57,591
Come on in, have a seat.

533
00:41:03,601 --> 00:41:04,888
Listen.

534
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,763
I have to go
to San Diego tomorrow.

535
00:41:08,855 --> 00:41:09,972
Why?

536
00:41:11,149 --> 00:41:12,482
My mom.

537
00:41:13,985 --> 00:41:16,398
Some friends, my sister.

538
00:41:16,403 --> 00:41:18,613
But you know they're gone.

539
00:41:18,614 --> 00:41:20,073
I know, but...

540
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:22,612
I still have to find out.

541
00:41:22,617 --> 00:41:24,703
I mean, you guys know for sure,
but I don't know.

542
00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:29,874
Did you have like,
a close family?

543
00:41:32,668 --> 00:41:33,831
Yeah.

544
00:41:34,962 --> 00:41:36,580
Pretty close.

545
00:41:38,422 --> 00:41:40,087
You?

546
00:41:40,092 --> 00:41:42,301
No, not really.

547
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:45,295
My real mom hung around
till my dad came back from Viet Nam

548
00:41:45,303 --> 00:41:46,763
and then she split.

549
00:41:46,764 --> 00:41:49,177
So, it's been mostly
me and Sam.

550
00:41:49,182 --> 00:41:53,178
And Dad
and Third Special Forces.

551
00:41:53,186 --> 00:41:54,599
Smoke Bomb Hill.

552
00:41:55,688 --> 00:41:57,023
Fort Bragg.

553
00:42:02,903 --> 00:42:06,067
But, then around
about sixth or seventh grade,

554
00:42:06,072 --> 00:42:08,112
it became real obvious
that we weren't boys

555
00:42:08,117 --> 00:42:10,201
<i>and we were never gonna go
to ranger school.</i>

556
00:42:12,286 --> 00:42:16,622
So, I guess Dad figured
there was nothing more to offer us.

557
00:42:16,623 --> 00:42:18,082
So, he found us a new mom.

558
00:42:19,126 --> 00:42:20,790
Went off looking for a war.

559
00:42:26,048 --> 00:42:27,791
What about the um...

560
00:42:30,386 --> 00:42:31,720
the guy?

561
00:42:32,762 --> 00:42:33,971
Larry?

562
00:42:33,973 --> 00:42:37,593
Oh, he and I weren't going steady
or anything like that.

563
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,325
Look, don't go
to San Diego, okay?

564
00:42:56,325 --> 00:42:57,693
I have to.

565
00:42:59,162 --> 00:43:00,620
But I'll be back.

566
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:05,492
Please, okay?

567
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,548
What'll you give me
if I come back?

568
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:22,344
Texas.

569
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:26,259
<i>I'll give you Florida.</i>

570
00:43:26,268 --> 00:43:28,058
<i>Florida and Texas.</i>

571
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:30,431
<i>Florida, Texas, and Hawaii.</i>

572
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:32,978
<i>Hawaii?</i>

573
00:43:32,982 --> 00:43:35,021
<i>I wanted Hawaii.</i>

574
00:43:35,986 --> 00:43:37,068
<i>When I come back...</i>

575
00:43:39,281 --> 00:43:40,648
<i>I'll take you to dinner.</i>

576
00:43:43,076 --> 00:43:45,239
<i>Your choice.</i>

577
00:43:59,673 --> 00:44:00,755
Here.

578
00:44:16,854 --> 00:44:18,062
Great.

579
00:44:26,447 --> 00:44:28,815
See, this is the problem
with these things.

580
00:44:28,824 --> 00:44:30,533
Daddy would have
gotten us Uzis.

581
00:44:33,036 --> 00:44:34,529
The car didn't know
the difference.

582
00:44:44,379 --> 00:44:46,044
So, did you make it
with him last night?

583
00:44:47,049 --> 00:44:48,211
Who?

584
00:44:48,216 --> 00:44:50,209
The good humor man,
who do you think'?

585
00:44:52,178 --> 00:44:53,637
Jeez, is that
what's buggin' you'?

586
00:44:53,638 --> 00:44:55,175
That's no answer, man?

587
00:44:56,141 --> 00:44:59,226
No, I didn't make it with him
last night.

588
00:44:59,226 --> 00:45:00,639
Why are you so
weirded out?

589
00:45:00,644 --> 00:45:02,636
Oh, right, Reg,
why should I be weirded out?

590
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:05,230
My sister, who swiped every guy
I ever had my eye on,

591
00:45:05,231 --> 00:45:08,396
has now swiped the last guy
in the whole freaked-out world.

592
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:52,143
Mom!

593
00:45:57,987 --> 00:45:59,320
<i>Mother.</i>

594
00:46:01,948 --> 00:46:03,111
Ma?

595
00:47:27,983 --> 00:47:30,727
I don't know who you are
out there, but I have a gun.

596
00:47:31,653 --> 00:47:34,522
So, if I were you,
I'd split while I had a chance.

597
00:47:36,489 --> 00:47:37,824
Okay?

598
00:47:48,918 --> 00:47:51,127
Look kid, just stay away,
we don't want any!

599
00:47:55,549 --> 00:47:56,665
Shit!

600
00:47:58,552 --> 00:48:00,215
Get outta here,
you little creep.

601
00:48:09,394 --> 00:48:11,183
<i>Lucky for you I like kids.</i>

602
00:48:19,777 --> 00:48:22,192
Jesus!
There goes the neighborhood.

603
00:48:39,046 --> 00:48:40,333
Shit.

604
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:48,254
Audrey, what's the code?

605
00:48:51,514 --> 00:48:52,552
<i>Mm.</i>

606
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:11,273
We found survivors.

607
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:13,949
How long will
the blood tests take?

608
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:18,952
Not long.

609
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:23,042
I've talked with some of the others
and we decided that it would be

610
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:26,003
more beneficial to conduct
the blood tests in the field.

611
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,256
So, I want you to go to L.A.
with the rest of the group.

612
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,588
Whatever the majority wants.

613
00:49:37,722 --> 00:49:41,308
<i>You don't seem to hold majority rule
in very high regard.</i>

614
00:49:41,726 --> 00:49:43,685
<i>If something's wrong, it's wrong.</i>

615
00:49:43,686 --> 00:49:45,849
<i>Majority rule doesn't have
anything to do with it.</i>

616
00:49:46,855 --> 00:49:49,440
But it goes straight
to the core purpose of our group,

617
00:49:49,441 --> 00:49:51,183
which is to survive.

618
00:49:51,192 --> 00:49:53,186
You'll grant me that?

619
00:49:53,195 --> 00:49:57,065
The core purpose never included
bringing outsiders to the facility.

620
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:04,252
It's about the twelfth can
you've downed this morning.

621
00:51:04,549 --> 00:51:05,587
Thirsty.

622
00:51:05,592 --> 00:51:08,302
Yeah, well, what are you going to do
when your complexion freaks out?

623
00:51:08,303 --> 00:51:10,638
Dermatologist is dead,
you know.

624
00:51:10,638 --> 00:51:13,131
I know, and I'm getting a rash
or something too.

625
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,474
Oh, God, you and your rashes.

626
00:51:15,475 --> 00:51:17,890
Hey, I'm sorry if the end of the world
makes me a little nervous.

627
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:26,688
So, do you like him?

628
00:51:28,737 --> 00:51:30,572
Come on, Sam.

629
00:51:30,573 --> 00:51:32,736
I'm just interested.

630
00:51:35,118 --> 00:51:37,611
Yeah, well, I guess so.

631
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,830
I mean, he's nice.

632
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:44,914
There was this new guy
at school, Paul Morgan.

633
00:51:45,211 --> 00:51:48,296
He transferred from Taft.
Junior.

634
00:51:48,296 --> 00:51:50,255
Oh, I don't hang around
with juniors much.

635
00:51:53,801 --> 00:51:55,419
I liked him.

636
00:51:55,428 --> 00:51:56,510
<i>Mm.</i>

637
00:51:56,512 --> 00:52:00,599
I mean,
he was from Taft, but...

638
00:52:02,808 --> 00:52:04,302
he was nice.

639
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,775
Kathy said he was probably
going to ask me out.

640
00:52:15,655 --> 00:52:17,147
Kathy.

641
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:20,903
She was flunking algebra
and she was trying to figure out

642
00:52:20,908 --> 00:52:23,197
some way to keep
her parents from finding out.

643
00:52:26,372 --> 00:52:28,457
This was a really
lucky break for her.

644
00:52:35,755 --> 00:52:36,918
No wonder
I'm breaking out.

645
00:52:36,923 --> 00:52:39,008
Think we could
go home and change?

646
00:52:39,008 --> 00:52:40,170
Look.

647
00:52:41,218 --> 00:52:43,507
Why don't we get
a little creative?

648
00:52:43,512 --> 00:52:44,925
What?

649
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:47,765
Do you have your, uh--
Do you have your MasterCard on ya?

650
00:52:47,766 --> 00:52:49,179
No.

651
00:52:49,184 --> 00:52:51,427
Good, 'cause you don't need it.

652
00:52:51,435 --> 00:52:54,475
The stores are open!

653
00:54:03,374 --> 00:54:05,663
Hey, Reg, which do
you like better?

654
00:54:05,668 --> 00:54:09,253
This or this.

655
00:54:09,254 --> 00:54:12,545
Um, the second one.
Yeah, definitely.

656
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:15,840
- How come?
- 'Cause it'll stay in style longer.

657
00:54:16,595 --> 00:54:18,007
<i>Come on.</i>

658
00:54:18,012 --> 00:54:19,220
<i>I guess you're right, actually.</i>

659
00:54:19,221 --> 00:54:21,213
<i>Yeah, we gotta think
of these things, you know?</i>

660
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:44,781
All right, let's do it.

661
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:51,912
<i>You know,
I've been thinking.</i>

662
00:54:51,917 --> 00:54:54,206
Don't set any dangerous
precedents.

663
00:54:54,211 --> 00:54:56,671
What if Hector's got
the same problem we have?

664
00:54:56,672 --> 00:54:58,209
Such as?

665
00:54:58,214 --> 00:55:00,334
Such as no guys.

666
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:02,758
What?

667
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,003
Really.

668
00:55:05,095 --> 00:55:06,760
I mean, what if Hector's gay?

669
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,592
I'm sure.

670
00:55:11,601 --> 00:55:14,471
Think it over. You said he didn't
come on to you last night.

671
00:55:14,479 --> 00:55:15,641
<i>So?</i>

672
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,515
So, that means
that the last guy on Earth

673
00:55:17,524 --> 00:55:19,812
is either a gentleman
or a fag.

674
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:22,152
I mean, what are the odds.
In L.A.?

675
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,446
<i>Things could be very interesting
around here, Regina.</i>

676
00:55:40,711 --> 00:55:43,330
Attention shoppers.

677
00:55:43,338 --> 00:55:47,424
<i>I trust you've got credit cards
to pay for all that stuff.</i>

678
00:56:15,575 --> 00:56:18,536
<i>What's the matter?
Lost something?</i>

679
00:56:18,536 --> 00:56:21,780
<i>Check with lost and found
on the second floor.</i>

680
00:56:22,789 --> 00:56:24,282
<i>Didn't find this one.</i>

681
00:56:33,131 --> 00:56:35,966
You dirty rat.

682
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,587
<i>Get her, boys.</i>

683
00:57:33,477 --> 00:57:34,640
Whoa!

684
00:57:41,692 --> 00:57:42,855
Bummer.

685
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:07,127
Mommy.

686
00:58:07,131 --> 00:58:08,465
<i>Take it easy.</i>

687
00:58:12,428 --> 00:58:15,092
Well, I think it's time
to take the high ground.

688
00:58:21,352 --> 00:58:23,266
Listen, you guys.

689
00:58:23,271 --> 00:58:26,186
We're expecting
some friends here any minute.

690
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:28,024
Look, you just split now, okay?

691
00:58:28,025 --> 00:58:29,518
And we'll tell them
not to hurt you.

692
00:58:29,527 --> 00:58:30,769
Yeeah!

693
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,107
No imagination.

694
00:58:59,219 --> 00:59:01,759
- Look, over there.
- Sitting duck.

695
00:59:09,562 --> 00:59:10,724
<i>Hey!</i>

696
00:59:11,647 --> 00:59:12,890
<i>Hey!</i>

697
00:59:13,608 --> 00:59:16,147
Eat glass, creeps.

698
00:59:17,693 --> 00:59:19,687
<i>How'd you like that?</i>

699
00:59:23,867 --> 00:59:25,700
You guys are a bunch of wimps.

700
00:59:25,701 --> 00:59:27,114
You can't hit anything.

701
00:59:27,702 --> 00:59:30,368
Hi.

702
00:59:30,372 --> 00:59:31,329
Uh!

703
00:59:33,208 --> 00:59:34,291
♪ Da-da. ♪

704
00:59:39,546 --> 00:59:40,881
<i>Get her.</i>

705
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,308
Knock that shit off.

706
01:00:07,739 --> 01:00:10,858
Hello out there
in television land.

707
01:00:11,783 --> 01:00:14,823
All right, here's the deal.

708
01:00:14,827 --> 01:00:18,994
If bachelorette number one
isn't out here in half a tick,

709
01:00:18,998 --> 01:00:22,288
I'm gonna ice
bachelorette number two.

710
01:00:22,292 --> 01:00:23,751
Got it?

711
01:00:39,517 --> 01:00:40,634
Come on.

712
01:00:45,604 --> 01:00:46,563
Let her go!

713
01:00:47,232 --> 01:00:51,820
I'm sorry, miss, I can't have you
holding one of my people hostage.

714
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,939
Even if you pull the trigger,
I can still take him out.

715
01:00:54,947 --> 01:00:55,984
And you.

716
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:57,733
Come on, Willy, she means it.

717
01:00:57,741 --> 01:01:00,325
Miss, you're not
getting the point.

718
01:01:00,326 --> 01:01:03,446
I can't have you holding
one of my people hostage.

719
01:01:09,042 --> 01:01:10,580
You're crazy!

720
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:13,830
I'm not crazy,
I just don't give a fuck!

721
01:01:14,381 --> 01:01:16,373
<i>What do you think,
20, 30 minutes?</i>

722
01:01:16,382 --> 01:01:17,420
<i>No more.</i>

723
01:01:17,425 --> 01:01:19,544
They could be anywhere by now.

724
01:01:19,552 --> 01:01:20,715
Let's go back.

725
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,588
Let's apply a little
deductive reasoning.

726
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:23,884
Deductive reasoning?

727
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:28,350
Where would adolescents
with nothing to do go?

728
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:39,230
<i>See, we worked really had
to get ahead in this business, girls.</i>

729
01:01:39,235 --> 01:01:41,946
<i>And we don't get shit for it!</i>

730
01:01:43,031 --> 01:01:45,492
But we do it
because we know

731
01:01:45,492 --> 01:01:47,610
we can work our way up
through the system.

732
01:01:47,618 --> 01:01:48,986
And the system works.

733
01:01:48,995 --> 01:01:54,037
Why, just a few days ago,
we were only stock boys.

734
01:01:54,041 --> 01:01:56,126
Now we own the store.

735
01:01:56,126 --> 01:01:58,211
The American way.

736
01:01:58,211 --> 01:02:00,374
And then this happens.

737
01:02:01,881 --> 01:02:04,125
What are you talking about?

738
01:02:04,133 --> 01:02:06,627
Well, I'm talking about you.

739
01:02:06,635 --> 01:02:08,845
Coming in here
and ripping us off!

740
01:02:08,846 --> 01:02:10,133
What do you want?

741
01:02:10,138 --> 01:02:11,756
You want us to pay for it, what?

742
01:02:15,435 --> 01:02:18,396
You wouldn't believe
what we want from you.

743
01:02:19,272 --> 01:02:24,017
In your worst nightmare,
you wouldn't believe.

744
01:02:26,778 --> 01:02:28,522
Let's play a game!

745
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:31,239
It's called scary noises.

746
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,784
<i>This is the closest shopping arcade.</i>

747
01:02:34,785 --> 01:02:38,246
But the whole area is an absolute
monument to consumerism.

748
01:02:38,246 --> 01:02:40,239
All we can do is hope.

749
01:02:40,248 --> 01:02:42,287
Check all the floors
including the basement.

750
01:02:49,507 --> 01:02:52,843
<i>Isn't that a scary noise?</i>

751
01:02:52,843 --> 01:02:55,302
Wanna hear it again?

752
01:02:55,303 --> 01:02:57,968
<i>Gosh, the suspense
is killing me.</i>

753
01:03:00,058 --> 01:03:01,551
Let's do it again.

754
01:03:04,019 --> 01:03:06,308
<i>An E-ticket attraction.</i>

755
01:03:06,313 --> 01:03:07,896
Let's do it again.

756
01:03:11,317 --> 01:03:12,982
<i>Now, wait a minute.</i>

757
01:03:12,986 --> 01:03:16,947
I don't think there's really
a bullet in here.

758
01:03:16,947 --> 01:03:20,863
No, now see there, it's loaded.

759
01:03:20,867 --> 01:03:24,078
I just needed to be
a little more patient.

760
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:27,243
I think this is it, girls.
I really do.

761
01:03:51,477 --> 01:03:54,972
Uh... we're not with these guys.

762
01:03:54,981 --> 01:03:57,351
<i>Really, like,
we just met 'em an hour ago.</i>

763
01:03:58,526 --> 01:04:01,770
I mean,
look at this stuff that we have.

764
01:04:01,778 --> 01:04:03,146
Look at this skirt...

765
01:04:03,155 --> 01:04:04,523
<i>It's ironic.</i>

766
01:04:04,531 --> 01:04:07,696
<i>Of all the great minds of the world,
all the great intellects,</i>

767
01:04:07,701 --> 01:04:09,444
<i>who should survive?</i>

768
01:04:09,452 --> 01:04:11,115
<i>Or almost survive.</i>

769
01:04:12,538 --> 01:04:14,952
<i>I don't have to see the result
of the blood test.</i>

770
01:04:15,791 --> 01:04:17,749
I can guess what they say
about that one.

771
01:04:21,629 --> 01:04:22,837
You're right.

772
01:04:23,965 --> 01:04:25,799
It would be senseless
to take her back.

773
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,168
<i>Look, I'll stay
and take care of it.</i>

774
01:04:28,177 --> 01:04:31,547
Then if this Hector person shows up,
I can run tests on him too.

775
01:04:32,306 --> 01:04:34,970
Of course, uh, it would be
out of the question

776
01:04:34,974 --> 01:04:36,889
to let you remain
by yourself.

777
01:04:37,853 --> 01:04:39,311
I'll stay here with you.

778
01:04:59,955 --> 01:05:03,291
<i>Listen, thanks
for suggesting that I wait for Hector.</i>

779
01:05:03,292 --> 01:05:05,125
<i>I mean, I know Reggie'll
probably get him,</i>

780
01:05:05,126 --> 01:05:06,915
<i>but I'd like to have
a shot at it.</i>

781
01:05:07,545 --> 01:05:09,538
<i>Samantha,
I need you to lie down.</i>

782
01:05:10,423 --> 01:05:12,507
Hector's not exactly
a fox, but...

783
01:05:13,468 --> 01:05:16,803
considering what's left,
he's not bad.

784
01:05:16,803 --> 01:05:18,716
He sounds cute.

785
01:05:18,721 --> 01:05:19,884
Is he coming back?

786
01:05:19,889 --> 01:05:21,007
Yeah.

787
01:05:21,475 --> 01:05:24,060
<i>But we should wait for him
at the radio station.</i>

788
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:26,887
<i>That's where he'll go.</i>

789
01:05:26,896 --> 01:05:28,059
<i>What's that?</i>

790
01:05:29,189 --> 01:05:31,434
Um, I'm gonna give
you something.

791
01:05:31,442 --> 01:05:33,309
For what?

792
01:05:33,318 --> 01:05:37,689
Well, your skin's been
a little irritated.

793
01:05:37,697 --> 01:05:39,280
Yeah, a rash.

794
01:05:39,281 --> 01:05:43,368
It could be a rash, but it could also
be something else.

795
01:05:43,369 --> 01:05:44,907
It's one of the main
symptoms of--

796
01:05:44,912 --> 01:05:46,120
The comet, no.

797
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:50,958
See, I always get rashes like,
when I have a fight with Doris

798
01:05:50,959 --> 01:05:52,918
or I break up with a boyfriend.

799
01:05:52,919 --> 01:05:54,082
It's nerves, and you know,

800
01:05:54,087 --> 01:05:56,421
the way things have been going
around here lately,

801
01:05:56,421 --> 01:05:58,881
I'm surprised I don't look
like strawberry Jell-O.

802
01:06:00,926 --> 01:06:05,468
But if I do have that stuff,
this'll get rid of it, right?

803
01:06:07,265 --> 01:06:09,679
- Yeah.
- God, you had me worried.

804
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,722
Don't worry.

805
01:06:13,645 --> 01:06:15,105
Just a pinch, now.

806
01:06:15,981 --> 01:06:17,144
Ow!

807
01:06:21,903 --> 01:06:24,863
So you guys are like,
geniuses, right?

808
01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:29,280
Yeah, I thought so.

809
01:06:36,581 --> 01:06:39,416
We have a couple
of geniuses at my school.

810
01:06:39,418 --> 01:06:41,208
Yeah?

811
01:06:41,212 --> 01:06:44,957
Yeah, they're both wimps.

812
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:03,018
Is, uh...

813
01:07:04,774 --> 01:07:06,062
Is that it?

814
01:07:08,277 --> 01:07:10,691
What did you want me
to do, Oscar?

815
01:07:10,696 --> 01:07:12,735
Take her out back
and shoot her in the head?

816
01:07:14,366 --> 01:07:18,532
I simply meant
I was glad it was... painless.

817
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:22,081
I don't think
we have to stay around.

818
01:07:23,582 --> 01:07:25,201
She didn't think
that he was coming back.

819
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,665
I feel we can wait.

820
01:07:29,588 --> 01:07:30,955
But, uh...

821
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:36,302
I-- I feel the radio station is
the more logical place.

822
01:07:39,138 --> 01:07:44,726
Listen, Oscar, you were right about
the condition being progressive.

823
01:07:44,726 --> 01:07:49,348
But it is also accelerating,
apparently.

824
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:51,565
We don't have weeks.

825
01:07:51,565 --> 01:07:53,058
We have maybe hours.

826
01:07:53,067 --> 01:07:54,435
<i>I don't know.</i>

827
01:07:54,443 --> 01:07:55,686
We have a commitment.

828
01:07:55,694 --> 01:07:58,313
But I do know, I don't have
enough to debate the issue.

829
01:07:58,322 --> 01:08:02,658
I am not going to be a party
to taking anybody else back.

830
01:08:02,658 --> 01:08:04,195
You have to live up to it.

831
01:08:05,995 --> 01:08:08,489
What do you expect
me to do, Oscar?

832
01:08:08,498 --> 01:08:10,207
Go for my gun?

833
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:12,541
Of course not.

834
01:08:52,620 --> 01:08:54,783
<i>Hey, it's 450 FM in the PM.</i>

835
01:08:54,788 --> 01:08:57,998
<i>I'm Steve LaBeau, and you're listening
to 50,000 watts of rock and roll</i>

836
01:08:57,998 --> 01:09:00,618
<i>at tower of power
over the City of Angels.</i>

837
01:09:20,727 --> 01:09:22,720
Reggie?

838
01:09:22,729 --> 01:09:24,222
Merry Christmas.

839
01:09:28,734 --> 01:09:29,977
Reggie?

840
01:09:36,659 --> 01:09:37,867
Samantha?

841
01:09:43,665 --> 01:09:46,078
- Hi.
- Hm.

842
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:47,247
Hi.

843
01:09:50,337 --> 01:09:53,752
Did you happen to see
two girls runnin' around here?

844
01:09:53,756 --> 01:09:55,294
One's a cheerleader.

845
01:09:56,384 --> 01:09:59,345
I'm not thinking straight.

846
01:09:59,345 --> 01:10:02,464
I wrote everything down, but...

847
01:10:02,473 --> 01:10:03,886
I think I misspelled it.

848
01:10:03,891 --> 01:10:05,429
That pad on the table.

849
01:10:08,103 --> 01:10:09,687
You need this?

850
01:10:09,688 --> 01:10:11,352
No, thanks, I have one.

851
01:10:13,733 --> 01:10:16,068
Seems to be the perfect
Christmas gift this year.

852
01:10:18,404 --> 01:10:19,897
I'm gonna miss Christmas.

853
01:10:21,407 --> 01:10:22,774
Permanently.

854
01:10:25,409 --> 01:10:30,156
<i>I want you to know that I thought
they were talking hypothetically.</i>

855
01:10:30,164 --> 01:10:32,453
Until they found
the first survivors.

856
01:10:32,458 --> 01:10:33,917
Then they really did it.

857
01:10:36,836 --> 01:10:38,921
Some of those survivors
were just kids.

858
01:10:38,922 --> 01:10:41,633
Hey, wait a minute.
What's all this about blood?

859
01:10:45,136 --> 01:10:47,094
They think they can
generate a serum.

860
01:10:48,305 --> 01:10:49,513
A serum?

861
01:10:49,515 --> 01:10:53,477
<i>We were exposed.
Not a lot. Just enough.</i>

862
01:10:54,561 --> 01:10:57,225
They left the ventilating
ducts wide open.

863
01:10:57,230 --> 01:10:59,064
The fans going.

864
01:10:59,065 --> 01:11:01,309
Very scientific.

865
01:11:01,317 --> 01:11:02,934
Very stupid.

866
01:11:05,321 --> 01:11:07,234
In 36 hours

867
01:11:08,782 --> 01:11:12,868
you will be able to vacuum up
the last of them up from the carpet.

868
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:18,073
<i>Hey, you know what?</i>

869
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:22,793
She was right.

870
01:11:22,794 --> 01:11:24,253
You are cute.

871
01:11:25,965 --> 01:11:27,753
Santa Claus.

872
01:11:40,268 --> 01:11:41,431
Hey.

873
01:11:59,868 --> 01:12:01,577
<i>Have you ever had hepatitis?</i>

874
01:12:01,579 --> 01:12:03,321
Darn tags.

875
01:12:03,329 --> 01:12:04,742
Do you have a pair of scissors?

876
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,162
No.

877
01:12:07,166 --> 01:12:08,409
Have you ever had hepatitis?

878
01:12:11,713 --> 01:12:13,047
Cute kids.

879
01:12:13,797 --> 01:12:15,040
<i>They a part of you guys?</i>

880
01:12:15,799 --> 01:12:16,882
<i>No.</i>

881
01:12:17,759 --> 01:12:20,378
They're survivors
just like you are.

882
01:12:20,387 --> 01:12:21,630
Neat girl, huh?

883
01:12:21,638 --> 01:12:23,926
If you like the type.

884
01:12:23,931 --> 01:12:25,640
Come on, kids,
come with me.

885
01:12:28,311 --> 01:12:29,804
<i>Have you ever had hepatitis?</i>

886
01:12:33,482 --> 01:12:36,225
No, I had mono once, though.

887
01:12:36,234 --> 01:12:38,603
Caught if from this guy
named Randy Sharp.

888
01:12:39,529 --> 01:12:40,566
Anemia?

889
01:12:40,988 --> 01:12:42,402
No.

890
01:12:42,407 --> 01:12:44,320
<i>- Are you pregnant?
- Nope.</i>

891
01:12:44,325 --> 01:12:45,659
Thought I was once, though.

892
01:12:47,577 --> 01:12:48,820
That's not important.

893
01:12:48,828 --> 01:12:51,072
That's what you think.

894
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:53,245
That was the longest
three weeks of my life.

895
01:12:59,046 --> 01:13:00,460
You know I can't remember.

896
01:13:00,465 --> 01:13:03,299
How much blood were we expected
to get from these people?

897
01:13:03,842 --> 01:13:08,508
- Uh, 300 ccs, yes, that's it.
- That can't be right.

898
01:13:08,512 --> 01:13:11,848
If we draw 300 ccs a day,
they'll expire altogether.

899
01:13:11,849 --> 01:13:15,595
<i>No, I don't think so, now that
we've terminated brain functions.</i>

900
01:13:15,603 --> 01:13:17,346
I mean, they're brain dead.

901
01:13:17,355 --> 01:13:20,098
All they can do now
is manufacture blood.

902
01:13:21,607 --> 01:13:23,351
Well, maybe.

903
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:28,651
Well, we aren't going to get anything
like 300 ccs out of those children.

904
01:13:28,656 --> 01:13:30,570
<i>No, but we will
out of that teenager.</i>

905
01:13:30,574 --> 01:13:32,692
I hope she's just
as healthy as she looks.

906
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,944
Boy, did you see her hair?

907
01:13:34,952 --> 01:13:37,322
What I've give
to have hair like that.

908
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,283
What is this place?

909
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:43,998
Do you have diabetes?

910
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:46,041
I mean, is this
some sort of, I don't know,

911
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:47,630
underground hospital,
or what?

912
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,759
You're a very strong willed
young lady.

913
01:13:54,095 --> 01:13:55,383
Cancer.

914
01:13:56,305 --> 01:13:57,888
You have cancer?

915
01:13:57,889 --> 01:14:00,259
No, I am a Cancer.

916
01:14:00,267 --> 01:14:03,636
I just want to know where I am
and what I'm doing here.

917
01:14:16,155 --> 01:14:18,319
<i>Oops.</i>

918
01:14:18,324 --> 01:14:20,785
Oh, gosh, uh, could you hand me
that arterial--

919
01:14:20,786 --> 01:14:21,743
Got it.

920
01:14:29,334 --> 01:14:32,750
Well, it's up
to the respirators now.

921
01:14:32,754 --> 01:14:34,292
Why don't we prep
the children?

922
01:14:34,297 --> 01:14:37,541
When we're finished with them,
we can start on that girl.

923
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:39,168
They're so cute.

924
01:14:39,176 --> 01:14:40,384
I love working with kids.

925
01:14:41,053 --> 01:14:44,093
<i>Yeah.
Oh, don't forget the lights.</i>

926
01:14:48,726 --> 01:14:50,595
Are you taking any medication?

927
01:14:56,775 --> 01:15:00,440
Have you had any medication
within the last 24 hours?

928
01:15:02,739 --> 01:15:04,357
Where's my sister?

929
01:15:08,494 --> 01:15:10,703
Dr. Carter,
may I see you a moment?

930
01:15:12,497 --> 01:15:13,580
All right.

931
01:15:13,999 --> 01:15:16,334
<i>I mean, she should be here
by now, shouldn't she?</i>

932
01:15:16,334 --> 01:15:17,998
<i>Even if Hector didn't show up?</i>

933
01:15:18,003 --> 01:15:19,415
Your sister's dead.

934
01:15:22,505 --> 01:15:24,841
What?

935
01:15:24,842 --> 01:15:27,962
I realize this comes
as a shock,

936
01:15:27,970 --> 01:15:29,428
<i>but she had been exposed,</i>

937
01:15:29,429 --> 01:15:32,264
<i>and in 48 hours
she would have died anyway.</i>

938
01:15:32,265 --> 01:15:35,305
It was quite painless
I can assure you.

939
01:15:42,982 --> 01:15:45,477
My, you both have nice,
strong hearts.

940
01:15:45,486 --> 01:15:46,853
Are we gonna get shots?

941
01:15:47,153 --> 01:15:50,444
No, no shots, I promise.

942
01:15:51,491 --> 01:15:53,529
- Audrey?
- Not back yet.

943
01:15:53,533 --> 01:15:55,903
Listen, we may have a situation
on our hands here.

944
01:15:55,911 --> 01:15:58,451
I can't locate Rogers
anyplace in the compound.

945
01:15:58,455 --> 01:16:00,494
<i>Shi...</i>

946
01:16:00,499 --> 01:16:02,242
I can't rule out the possibility

947
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:04,459
that he may already
have gone into transition.

948
01:16:07,713 --> 01:16:10,001
We can't wait for Audrey.

949
01:16:10,006 --> 01:16:12,592
You're gonna have to start with
the children and that one in there.

950
01:16:12,593 --> 01:16:14,460
We need blood
to develop the serum.

951
01:16:15,428 --> 01:16:17,261
We don't have enough
for everyone.

952
01:16:19,556 --> 01:16:21,391
We're not robots, Doctor.

953
01:16:21,392 --> 01:16:23,760
We're not all gonna fall over
at one time.

954
01:16:23,769 --> 01:16:26,013
Some of us
will last a little longer

955
01:16:26,021 --> 01:16:29,107
while others of us
have more immediate need.

956
01:16:29,107 --> 01:16:31,850
You're smart.
You can figure that out.

957
01:16:31,859 --> 01:16:35,480
<i>Psychology? not an exact
science, but my God, man,</i>

958
01:16:35,488 --> 01:16:37,651
<i>anybody can add two and two!</i>

959
01:16:41,827 --> 01:16:44,071
<i>I'm very sorry
about your sister.</i>

960
01:16:44,079 --> 01:16:46,198
It's a tragedy.

961
01:16:46,206 --> 01:16:48,665
It, uh, it truly is.

962
01:16:55,673 --> 01:17:00,008
And I can understand your hostility,
but no matter how upset you are,

963
01:17:00,008 --> 01:17:03,469
breaking an expensive piece
of equipment won't solve anything.

964
01:17:03,470 --> 01:17:06,636
I mean,
striking out at inanimate objects

965
01:17:06,641 --> 01:17:08,599
<i>is really quite childish.</i>

966
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,934
Even you should be able
to realize that.

967
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:15,223
Jerk.

968
01:17:43,798 --> 01:17:46,258
Howdy, partner.
How you doin'?

969
01:17:47,593 --> 01:17:50,179
- Who are you?
- My names Hec.

970
01:17:51,179 --> 01:17:52,638
Hec Gomez.

971
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:57,101
Hey, them's real fine duds
you got there.

972
01:17:57,102 --> 01:17:59,436
<i>You a Maytag repairman?</i>

973
01:17:59,437 --> 01:18:00,850
How'd you find this place?

974
01:18:02,231 --> 01:18:05,646
Well, uh, this lady
back in L.A. sent me.

975
01:18:05,650 --> 01:18:08,110
Hey, you been to L.A. lately?

976
01:18:08,111 --> 01:18:09,900
It's cleaned out, man,
I'm tellin' ya.

977
01:18:09,905 --> 01:18:12,319
Hey, come here,
I wanna show you somethin'.

978
01:18:12,324 --> 01:18:13,282
Come on.

979
01:18:15,576 --> 01:18:19,197
Hey, you know how the Harbor Freeway's
always bumper to bumper?

980
01:18:19,204 --> 01:18:21,617
Well, you can go 150 miles
an hour if you want to.

981
01:18:22,166 --> 01:18:24,205
Me and this baby.

982
01:18:24,209 --> 01:18:27,328
We go through them freeways
like turkey crap through a tin horn.

983
01:18:33,134 --> 01:18:34,251
Hey, uh...

984
01:18:37,596 --> 01:18:38,929
You like girls?

985
01:18:40,724 --> 01:18:41,886
Look in here.

986
01:18:47,563 --> 01:18:50,102
- She's dead.
- She ain't dead.

987
01:18:50,106 --> 01:18:52,566
See, this lady shot her up
with sodium pentothal

988
01:18:52,567 --> 01:18:54,356
and make this fella think
she was dead.

989
01:18:54,653 --> 01:18:55,770
Uh!

990
01:18:58,072 --> 01:19:01,487
So you wouldn't suck
her blood out, you asshole.

991
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:06,658
Son of a bitch!

992
01:19:09,624 --> 01:19:10,787
Shit!

993
01:19:21,093 --> 01:19:23,006
<i>Excuse me, everyone.</i>

994
01:19:23,010 --> 01:19:25,095
<i>I'm afraid our adolescent
guest has escaped.</i>

995
01:19:25,972 --> 01:19:28,012
She's quite hostile.

996
01:19:28,016 --> 01:19:30,429
She may have already
gone topside, so please,

997
01:19:30,434 --> 01:19:32,643
<i>take a moment
to look around you.</i>

998
01:19:55,956 --> 01:19:57,621
Check those rooms
and I'll check this one.

999
01:21:56,271 --> 01:21:57,559
Let's go.

1000
01:22:05,113 --> 01:22:07,231
Everything's under control.

1001
01:22:07,239 --> 01:22:08,402
Good.

1002
01:22:37,891 --> 01:22:39,759
You said no shots.

1003
01:22:39,768 --> 01:22:41,351
This isn't a shot, sweetheart.

1004
01:22:41,352 --> 01:22:43,392
It'll just--

1005
01:22:43,397 --> 01:22:47,109
You'll just giggle and then
you'll feel a little sleepy.

1006
01:22:47,109 --> 01:22:48,442
That's right.

1007
01:22:48,442 --> 01:22:50,935
And when you wake up,
do you know where you'll be?

1008
01:22:50,944 --> 01:22:54,360
- Where?
- With Santa Claus at the North Pole.

1009
01:22:54,364 --> 01:22:58,531
In fact, you'll live with Santa Claus
for the rest of your life.

1010
01:22:58,535 --> 01:23:01,074
Hey, there's no such thing
as Santa Claus.

1011
01:23:01,078 --> 01:23:02,412
<i>What?</i>

1012
01:23:03,331 --> 01:23:05,119
You don't believe in Santa?

1013
01:23:24,349 --> 01:23:26,342
Life support systems.

1014
01:23:28,019 --> 01:23:29,388
Wilson, come with me.

1015
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:32,064
- Keep an eye on her.
- Right.

1016
01:23:32,064 --> 01:23:34,399
<i>Now, Wilson!</i>

1017
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,940
<i>Forget the door!
Turn off the alarm!</i>

1018
01:23:40,907 --> 01:23:41,989
Uh!

1019
01:23:52,416 --> 01:23:54,330
<i>I don't know.</i>

1020
01:23:54,335 --> 01:23:57,829
<i>My parents told me never
to breathe anything from strangers.</i>

1021
01:23:57,837 --> 01:23:58,920
Hey!

1022
01:24:00,924 --> 01:24:02,041
Get your hands up.

1023
01:24:08,846 --> 01:24:10,090
What are you guys doing?

1024
01:24:10,098 --> 01:24:11,682
They said if we breathe this,

1025
01:24:11,683 --> 01:24:15,473
we could go to the North Pole
and see Santa Claus.

1026
01:24:15,478 --> 01:24:17,267
That's so sick.

1027
01:24:17,271 --> 01:24:18,309
Hey!

1028
01:24:18,314 --> 01:24:19,806
Holy shit!

1029
01:24:19,814 --> 01:24:21,183
- Whoa.
- Sam?

1030
01:24:21,192 --> 01:24:22,434
I give, I give.

1031
01:24:22,984 --> 01:24:24,569
They said you were dead.

1032
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:27,655
They were exaggerating totally.

1033
01:24:27,656 --> 01:24:30,115
- Hey, that's a great outfit.
- Thanks.

1034
01:24:30,115 --> 01:24:31,609
<i>Is that guy
in the hallway dead?</i>

1035
01:24:33,118 --> 01:24:34,452
Don't.

1036
01:24:45,630 --> 01:24:46,793
Well?

1037
01:24:51,176 --> 01:24:54,046
You can give up
if you want to, Wilson.

1038
01:24:57,266 --> 01:24:59,930
But we still have
the two children and that girl.

1039
01:25:02,019 --> 01:25:03,181
I forgot my football.

1040
01:25:03,186 --> 01:25:04,304
We'll get you another football.

1041
01:25:04,313 --> 01:25:05,805
We'll get you a stadium.

1042
01:25:08,693 --> 01:25:09,809
Now.

1043
01:25:22,162 --> 01:25:24,325
Get everybody topside.
Now!

1044
01:25:24,330 --> 01:25:25,288
What about them?

1045
01:25:26,082 --> 01:25:27,700
Screw them.

1046
01:25:34,006 --> 01:25:36,921
<i>Okay, kids, going up.</i>

1047
01:25:36,925 --> 01:25:38,964
Put your hands down, kids.

1048
01:25:39,428 --> 01:25:41,342
God, don't be so stupid.

1049
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:56,150
- Come on, kids!
- Who are the kids?

1050
01:25:56,151 --> 01:25:57,609
- I'm Brian.
- I'm Sarah.

1051
01:25:57,609 --> 01:25:59,819
Yeah, and I'm Aunt Reg
and that's Aunt Sam

1052
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:01,313
and that's Uncle Hector.

1053
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:02,486
Can I have my bunny?

1054
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:05,154
In a minute.
Beat feet, Uncle Hector.

1055
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:06,446
Uncle Hector?

1056
01:26:06,451 --> 01:26:08,410
<i>Hey, it's my bunny, you know?</i>

1057
01:26:16,752 --> 01:26:17,790
Where have you been?

1058
01:26:17,794 --> 01:26:19,037
<i>Can we change this?</i>

1059
01:26:19,046 --> 01:26:20,710
Arranging a hotfoot
for your friends.

1060
01:26:20,714 --> 01:26:22,378
I really hate this music.

1061
01:26:22,382 --> 01:26:23,749
Give me a break!

1062
01:26:26,470 --> 01:26:27,507
What are you doing?

1063
01:26:27,511 --> 01:26:31,256
I'm not kidding,
I get car sick without my bunny.

1064
01:26:31,264 --> 01:26:33,599
Come on, Reg,
give the kid the bunny.

1065
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,515
We've stopped,
why have we stopped?

1066
01:26:35,519 --> 01:26:38,558
- Son of a--
- Don't shoot them, you idiot.

1067
01:26:38,563 --> 01:26:41,352
Okay, kids, cover your eyes
for Uncle Hector.

1068
01:26:44,401 --> 01:26:46,190
Hey!

1069
01:26:46,195 --> 01:26:47,529
Think tank, huh?

1070
01:26:47,529 --> 01:26:50,273
Uh, look, couldn't
we just like, leave?

1071
01:26:50,282 --> 01:26:51,398
Think over this!

1072
01:26:53,159 --> 01:26:54,652
We can get them.

1073
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:57,700
<i>- Hey, we'll be taking off now.
- We have to get them.</i>

1074
01:26:57,705 --> 01:27:00,699
Look us up at Chasen's.
Uh, we'll party down, huh?

1075
01:27:00,707 --> 01:27:02,496
- Come on.
- Come on, come on, this is fun.

1076
01:27:04,126 --> 01:27:06,587
The kids would like to say good-bye,
it's been fun.

1077
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:08,456
Hope to see you around
real soon.

1078
01:27:11,217 --> 01:27:12,710
Is that gasoline I smell?

1079
01:27:17,764 --> 01:27:19,098
<i>Wait, wait, don't, don't!</i>

1080
01:27:43,454 --> 01:27:45,071
Wow.

1081
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:46,288
All right, Hector.

1082
01:28:01,761 --> 01:28:03,380
Let go of her!
Leave her alone!

1083
01:28:06,516 --> 01:28:07,804
Hector!

1084
01:28:12,729 --> 01:28:15,394
<i>- Reggie.
- It's all right.</i>

1085
01:28:15,399 --> 01:28:18,313
<i>It's all right. It's okay.</i>

1086
01:28:19,485 --> 01:28:20,853
<i>I got you.</i>

1087
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:22,355
<i>It's all right.</i>

1088
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:24,027
<i>It's okay.</i>

1089
01:28:24,031 --> 01:28:25,365
<i>I got you.</i>

1090
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:26,984
Shhh.

1091
01:29:08,946 --> 01:29:11,065
<i>Okay, kids, smile, come on.</i>

1092
01:29:13,325 --> 01:29:16,320
Oh, don't-- God, you're so cute!
You're just so cute-- wait.

1093
01:29:17,370 --> 01:29:19,454
Mr. Bunny needs to be
in this picture too.

1094
01:29:19,455 --> 01:29:21,074
So, okay, that's great.

1095
01:29:21,082 --> 01:29:22,369
Can I take this jacket off?

1096
01:29:22,374 --> 01:29:23,867
- It itches.
- No, you can't.

1097
01:29:23,876 --> 01:29:25,743
I just want to take
another picture, all right?

1098
01:29:25,752 --> 01:29:26,995
- Please?
- No.

1099
01:29:27,004 --> 01:29:28,292
Now,
you just hold on to that.

1100
01:29:28,297 --> 01:29:29,789
- Stay there. Okay, perfect.
- Oh, brother.

1101
01:29:29,797 --> 01:29:31,883
<i>There's still
a few zombies around.</i>

1102
01:29:31,884 --> 01:29:34,673
<i>Don't slouch.
And Sarah--</i>

1103
01:29:34,677 --> 01:29:35,793
Hold that.

1104
01:29:37,554 --> 01:29:38,923
Smile.

1105
01:29:41,099 --> 01:29:42,308
<i>Did the flash go off?</i>

1106
01:29:42,310 --> 01:29:44,268
<i>Can't tell on these things.</i>

1107
01:29:44,269 --> 01:29:46,557
Hey, if you're gonna throw
those guns away,

1108
01:29:46,562 --> 01:29:47,850
<i>can I have one?</i>

1109
01:29:51,567 --> 01:29:52,775
Don't look at me.

1110
01:29:52,777 --> 01:29:54,441
I mean, I don't know
where she gets that stuff.

1111
01:29:58,532 --> 01:30:00,446
<i>Smile, Hec.</i>

1112
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:04,369
Handsome.

1113
01:30:06,247 --> 01:30:08,411
Maybe I could be
a nun or something.

1114
01:30:09,166 --> 01:30:11,376
Ooh,
I just love these pictures.

1115
01:30:11,669 --> 01:30:13,627
You've only taken
about 30 of 'em.

1116
01:30:13,628 --> 01:30:14,917
You know, we're going to need
some more film soon.

1117
01:30:14,922 --> 01:30:16,005
- Let me straighten your tie.
- Okay.

1118
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:19,549
God, they look
like the Brady Bunch.

1119
01:30:21,134 --> 01:30:22,843
What are you waiting for?

1120
01:30:23,387 --> 01:30:24,846
Can I see 'em?

1121
01:30:24,846 --> 01:30:26,680
We're waiting
for the light to change.

1122
01:30:26,682 --> 01:30:28,266
We do not cross
against the light.

1123
01:30:32,103 --> 01:30:34,392
Are you nuts,
Auntie Regina?

1124
01:30:35,147 --> 01:30:38,938
You may as well
face the facts, Samantha.

1125
01:30:38,943 --> 01:30:42,858
The whole burden of civilization
has fallen upon us.

1126
01:30:45,282 --> 01:30:46,899
What's that supposed to mean?

1127
01:30:48,827 --> 01:30:51,912
It means we do not cross
against the light.

1128
01:30:54,038 --> 01:30:56,203
That's totally stupid!

1129
01:30:56,208 --> 01:30:57,700
There's nobody here!

1130
01:30:57,709 --> 01:31:00,954
See, we're talking ghost town!

1131
01:31:09,387 --> 01:31:10,469
See what happens.

1132
01:31:16,559 --> 01:31:20,179
God, I'm sorry, but you shouldn't cross
against the light like that.

1133
01:31:23,107 --> 01:31:25,350
Hey, you guys are
survivors too, huh?

1134
01:31:28,528 --> 01:31:31,067
- What?
- Nothin'.

1135
01:31:31,071 --> 01:31:32,030
Great car.

1136
01:31:32,574 --> 01:31:34,987
Thanks, I have 23 of them.
You want to go for a ride?

1137
01:31:34,992 --> 01:31:37,030
More than you know.

1138
01:31:40,705 --> 01:31:42,244
We don't know anything
about this guy.

1139
01:31:43,292 --> 01:31:44,499
Where's he from?

1140
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:45,788
What's his name?

1141
01:31:45,793 --> 01:31:48,002
- What's your name.
- Danny Mason Keener.

1142
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:50,584
<i>Danny Mason Keener, okay?</i>

1143
01:31:52,507 --> 01:31:55,968
Yeah, all right, well, just be back
by midnight, okay?

1144
01:31:55,969 --> 01:31:57,506
Midnight?

1145
01:31:57,511 --> 01:32:00,598
The burden of civilization
is on us, okay?

1146
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:02,307
Oh, yeah.

1147
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:03,846
Bitchin', isn't it?

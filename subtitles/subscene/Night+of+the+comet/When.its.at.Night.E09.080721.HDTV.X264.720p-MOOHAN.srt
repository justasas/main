associations with this drama.

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,440
So the restoration will finish
in a couple of days?

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,490
Yes, sir.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:24,310
You don't watch
much television, do you?

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:26,420
Excuse me?

[National treasure no. 238,
the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook...

stolen in 2001 has returned to
the museum after seven long years.]

[An anonymous donor
has returned it to the people...]

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,280
Why isn't he picking up?

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,110
Where are you?
Did you see the news?

12
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,190
Yeah.

13
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,400
I'm driving right now let's talk later.
I'll drop by later or something.

14
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,370
Bumsang! Hey, hey!

00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,420
<i> Episode 9

16
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,530
A day like today should
be declared a national holiday.

17
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,120
There's nothing better than a stolen
national treasure returning on its own.

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,480
The good news is one thing, but do you think we'll have to work late tonight?

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,210
How did such a man lacking patriotism
become a government employee?

20
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:29,160
Hey, jerk, be honest for once.
I heard you muttering to yourself earlier.

21
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,560
Why are you full of patriotism
only when you have an audience?

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,100
What did you say?

23
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,590
This is a happy day, remember?

24
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,540
I wonder who
the anonymous donor is?

25
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:49,110
Based on my fifteen years of experience,
it's the thief who first stole it in 2001.

26
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,580
Why? The “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook is
just too weighty to handle in our country.

27
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,400
He was asking me.
Why are you butting in?

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:02,290
My opinion is that
one of the rich men donated it.

29
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,340
I'm surprised you can say that
with a straight face.

30
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,410
What crazy rich guy would do that?

31
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,230
Maybe he's a kind, rich guy.
A nice guy.

32
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:16,450
Anyway, whoever it is, the person greatly
served the country and the people.

33
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,590
Definitely.

34
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,360
Kind, rich guy.

35
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,420
Officer Park! Did you get
the employee's witness statement?

36
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,280
Um...

37
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,570
Hey, isn't that Bumsang?

38
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,140
Bumsang, what brings you here?

39
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,440
I was wondering if i could take a look
at the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook.

40
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,130
Of course. I was
just about to contact you.

41
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:42,310
Please follow me.

42
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,320
Why is he here after
betraying us this morning?

43
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,200
There's something
about him that irks me.

44
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,370
Jinx! I was thinking
the same thing in my head.

45
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,410
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

46
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,220
No. It's authentic all right.

47
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,450
That's a relief.
I thought something was wrong.

48
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,590
Bumsang, have you ever seen
the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook before?

49
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,170
What?

50
00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:02,400
It's just that you verified it so quickly.
As if you've seen it before.

51
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:08,320
No, it's just such a famous piece.
Thanks for the coffee.

52
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,360
You're welcome.

53
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,300
Bumsang!

54
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,460
What happened?

55
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,140
My friend. Excuse me.

56
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,260
Sure.

57
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:31,220
Chief! We're done here.
Should we head back to the office?

58
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,540
Go ahead without me. I'm going to
stop by the hospital first to visit Chohee.

59
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,330
Our poor chief.

60
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,490
I know, right? It's not easy
looking after someone else's woman.

61
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,160
Right.

62
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,160
And he can't ignore her
‘cause she got hurt saving him.

63
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,260
Right.

64
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:02,590
Chohee won't seek revenge or anything
because we didn't visit her, will she?

65
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,390
Why isn't he calling me?

66
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,100
Bumsang?

67
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,170
You were waiting for Bumsang?

68
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,210
Chief...

69
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,450
I felt weird coming empty-handed.

70
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,400
Have a seat.

71
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,540
Sure.

72
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,550
I saw Bumsang at the museum,
and he met up with a friend.

73
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,140
Ah, I see...

74
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,110
Would you like something to drink?

75
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,290
Let me.

76
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,480
Are you okay, Chohee?

77
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,250
I'm fine.

78
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,360
Are you investigating who sent in
the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook?

79
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,480
Yes. We're looking
into the delivery service.

80
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,160
Our guess is it originated
from a rich man's house.

81
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,300
A rich man?

82
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,320
We don't know
who the last owner was.

83
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,400
But since it's a stolen good
and a national treasure...

84
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,110
it won't be taken away with the
good faith excuse like Congressman Lee.

85
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,500
I should get going.

86
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,360
Chohee, where's your brother?

87
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,380
He went to meet a friend.

88
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,570
Did he? Won't it be
inconvenient being here alone?

89
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,420
I'll be fine with
my boyfriend here with me.

90
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,410
It's the least he can do.

91
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,450
Ah, right.

92
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,460
Are you headed home?

93
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,420
No, I have to go back to the office.

94
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,550
I see...

95
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,150
Bumsang, goodbye.

96
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,120
Goodbye.

97
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,270
No, no. Don't come out.

98
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,500
What do you mean, your boyfriend?

99
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,320
Shouldn't you explain things to him
before he misunderstands even more?

100
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,200
I just want him to feel comfortable.

101
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,210
What?

102
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,100
I told him I liked him.
And I got hurt while protecting him.

103
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,280
From his perspective,
I must be quite the burden.

104
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,310
I was hoping he'd feel less pressured
if he thought we were really dating.

105
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,280
What am I, chopped liver?

106
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,300
What?

107
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,460
You used me to lessen
the pressure on the person you like.

108
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,100
At first you were against the idea,
but now you're behaving just like me.

109
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,400
What do you mean I'm behaving
just like you? What an insult...

110
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:38,140
Anyway, what happened
with Chairman Jang?

111
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,210
What?

112
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:44,120
He must've seen the news.
Did he contact you?

113
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,230
Yeah, he called me, but he didn't
say anything in particular.

114
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,130
Yeah? No threats or anything?

115
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,320
Nope.

116
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:57,120
As a well-known man, he wouldn't
heckle me when it's a lost cause.

117
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,120
It's already in the museum.

118
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:06,360
That's true. He can't even report it to the
police though he must be really upset.

119
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,560
So who did it?

120
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,520
How'd he know that
the scrapbook was at your place?

121
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,420
And why'd he send it to the museum?

122
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,200
So many unanswered questions.

123
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,350
But thank goodness
things ended quietly.

124
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:35,110
Did you steal it? Then again, if you did,
you wouldn't turn it over to a museum.

125
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,570
No matter who stole it,
the fact that doesn't change is...

126
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:42,160
that the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook
can never return to me.

127
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:49,350
And the person who lost it is you.
That fact will also never change.

128
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:57,590
You should brace yourself.
You will pay dearly for this.

129
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:18,330
Oh, right!
I forgot to thank him.

130
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,450
Bumsang, I feel sorry for you...

131
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:29,590
but I'm glad the “Sowonhwagae”
scrapbook is safe.

132
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:37,190
You're going through a hard time,
so I'm sorry for being happy.

133
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,330
Joohyun, what brings you here?

134
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:58,300
As your co-worker and as the woman
who loved the same man as you...

135
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,190
I came to have
a heart-to-heart with you.

136
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:12,360
The last time we went drinking,
you said you weren't interested in him.

137
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,490
About that...
Joohyun, the truth is...

138
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:18,200
Um, I...

139
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,410
Blocked it.

140
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,140
There's no need to
come up with an excuse.

141
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,150
I'll forgive everything.

142
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:38,430
I'll give up Bumsang.

143
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:46,290
Joohyun, thanks, I guess. But maybe
you shouldn't give up so easily.

144
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:52,400
We could break up
in the near future.

145
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,480
No...

146
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,110
Chohee, that's not how
you comfort someone.

147
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:05,190
You just have to say that
you'll make him happy.

148
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,210
If he's happy, I'll be happy.

149
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,210
Joohyun, your love is
a very considerate kind of love.

150
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,540
What do you mean?

151
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:29,590
It just occurred to me that Bumsang
should be grateful for your love.

152
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,350
I'm envious.

153
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:41,560
What did you say? A change in MCs?
What in the world are you talking about?

154
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:46,190
The thing is...
We just found out about it today.

155
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:52,290
Sir, you begged me to stay on for
another season. How could you do this?

156
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:58,310
I don't want to change MCs. But with the
pressure from above, my hands are tied.

157
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,340
From above?
An order from above...

158
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,540
You should brace yourself.
You will pay dearly for this.

159
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:15,340
I'm really sorry, Bumsang. Don't
hate me for being powerless, okay?

160
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,310
Then when's my last day? Do I continue
until you find my replacement?

161
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:25,230
We already found your replacement.

162
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,220
Already? Who...

163
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,400
We record at three.

164
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,110
Three o'clock?

165
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,540
Long time, Bumsang.

166
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,510
So it is. Didn't expect
to run into you like this.

167
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,330
I feel bad about you being cut,
but what can be done?

168
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,550
I can't help it
if the people want me.

169
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,490
I don't know about that, but okay.

170
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:03,440
At least this time you used someone
else's influence and not your father's.

171
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,440
Nonsense. I got this job
entirely due to my skill and effort!

172
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,250
Again, I don't know
about that, but okay.

173
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,230
You've adopted a very unique sense
of style since I saw you last.

174
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,240
I got a full makeover
at Cheongdam-dong.

175
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,510
Why? Do I look
too intellectual now?

176
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:29,220
Sure, why not?
Anyway, congratulations.

177
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:34,470
Bumsang, did you piss off
the president of the university?

178
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,150
Piss him off?
What are you talking about?

179
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:42,380
I heard all your lectures for next
semester were given to someone else?

180
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,210
What?

181
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:48,260
I heard they were going to tell you today.
I guess you haven't received the call yet.

182
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,580
Oh, and you're no longer a researcher
at the school's preservation lab.

183
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:57,350
What in the world did you do?

184
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,150
Anyway, I'll be taking charge of
“Discovering Cultural Assets.”

185
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:08,220
And it'll be the discovery
of a new Yongcheol Gong.

186
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,430
Chairman Jang,
what a force to be reckoned with.

187
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,160
Yes, Mr. Son?

188
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,380
You guys are here early.

189
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:50,270
We'll work our butts off, interviewing
witnesses and checking security tapes.

190
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:57,220
The regulations team will try our best
to uncover the identity of the donor.

191
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:04,140
Okay. I'm off to talk to someone at the
preservation lab. We'll meet up later.

192
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,230
See you later.

193
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,140
The one form of patriotism we can
perform for the people is...

194
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,450
Sabotage.

195
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,170
Do you have to say shirking our
responsibilities in such a hard way?

196
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,170
If you're uneducated,
at least attempt to study.

197
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:29,210
Anyway, a case like this
shouldn't be investigated too seriously.

198
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:34,320
Of course not. We should be grateful
for the donation to the museum.

199
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,540
So we have no choice
but to pretend to work.

200
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,510
Let's all take it easy.

201
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:43,300
Shall we start shirking our duties
by getting some iced coffee?

202
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,350
You buy!

203
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,530
Seeing how the paper is not very flat,
it seems to have been restored recently.

204
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,450
Recently?

205
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:59,240
Yes. Only natural dyes
and paper were used.

206
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:03,170
I think a professional
restoration expert did it.

207
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,290
Restoration expert?

208
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:10,490
It was probably very damaged before,
but it was done extremely well by hand.

209
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,160
It has the touch
of someone of great skill.

210
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,390
This may sound strange,
but let me ask you something.

211
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,480
Are there many people in our country
with this level of skill in restoration?

212
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,210
There are so few you can
count them on one hand.

213
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,170
Then a person of
Bumsang Kim's caliber -

214
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:40,310
Would have absolutely no problem.
He's the best there is in book restoration.

215
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,400
What's up?
Did you find out who stole the book?

216
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,540
That's not it. Have a seat first. You must
be going through a hell of a time.

217
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:58,560
With the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook
being donated. How'd that happen?

218
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,380
Is this why you called me here?

219
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,340
No. Did the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook
belong to Chairman Jang?

220
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:10,180
News travels fast.
How'd you hear?

221
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,360
Chairman Jang's men
dropped by earlier.

222
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:21,470
Jeez, he shouldn't be like that.
It's not like you lost it on purpose.

223
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:30,490
Anyway, be careful. He looks refined
on the outside, but he's a scary man.

224
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:36,200
There are rumors that he once
buried a middleman alive.

225
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:42,170
Oh, and is Chohee
still in the hospital?

226
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,250
Why do you ask?

227
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,230
I don't know why
but he asked about her.

228
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:53,130
I answered truthfully but then it occurred
to me that maybe I shouldn't have.

229
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,540
Pick up, come on...

230
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,430
[Your call has been transferred...]

231
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,390
Why aren't you picking up?

232
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,380
Yes, Chief. I'm a little busy
right now so let's talk later.

233
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,370
Did something happen?

234
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,170
Hey!

235
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,100
Excuse me.

236
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,230
What brings you here -

237
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:20,270
What are you doing here?
I looked for you everywhere!

238
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,280
Why were you looking for me?
I was just seeing Joohyun off.

239
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,590
At least carry your phone around. Why
would you see her off when you're hurt?

240
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,370
What's up with you?

241
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,350
Let's go in.

242
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,210
What?
Hey! Hey!

243
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,210
Hey. Hey!

244
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,190
When you're alone, don't leave
the room unless absolutely necessary.

245
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,270
And if you don't recognize the number,
don't pick up your phone.

246
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,530
Seriously, what's going on?

247
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:54,100
No matter.
Just do I as I tell you, okay?

248
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,560
What the? What's with him?

249
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,460
I set an appointment tomorrow with the
head administrative official of the CHA.

250
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,390
We'll recommend Professor Yongcheol
Gong for the advisory member position.

251
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,440
About the young lady...

252
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,130
You can't go in, sir.

253
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,330
Give us a moment.

254
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,520
What brings you here?

255
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,230
Sir, why are you doing this?

256
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,510
What are you talking about?

257
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:26,460
I distinctly remember you telling me I'd
have to pay. But that's on my shoulders.

258
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:31,230
Chohee Heo has nothing to do with
what happened. So why in the world...

259
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,210
Who do you think you're talking to?

260
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,100
You come in uninvited, and worse yet,
you raise your voice against me?

261
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,360
And all because of a woman.

262
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:48,420
Punish me, sir. She's not involved with
what happened. She did nothing wrong.

263
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:55,270
You're losing your head
over a woman. How interesting.

264
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,340
Is she the woman you like?

265
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:04,360
You may be right in that
she's not involved in the matter.

266
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,210
But from the brash way
she spoke to me...

267
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,480
isn't it possible that
she's behind the whole thing?

268
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,230
Sir...

269
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:17,500
Even if she's not, she annoys me.

270
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,230
No matter what you say, I'm gonna keep
doing things my way until I feel better.

271
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,410
So save your breath and leave.

272
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,210
Sir!

273
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,210
Didn't you hear me
telling you to leave?

274
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:32,440
The cornered mouse
will attack the cat.

275
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,290
What did you say?

276
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,580
Continue doing what you want.

277
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:42,230
But if you touch a hair on Chohee's
head, I won't just stand back and take it.

278
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,450
Cancel pushing Professor Gong
for the advisory position.

279
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,530
And hands off of Bumsang.

280
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:04,240
Shouldn't you show him who's boss
after the rude way he just acted?

281
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,100
No. It won't hurt him if we hit him
when he has nothing to lose.

282
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,150
He'll really feel the pain if we hit him
when he has something to protect.

283
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,400
I have a good idea.

284
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,330
According to the
preservation lab employee...

285
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:29,500
the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook was
handled by someone of great expertise.

286
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,140
Do you have any suspects?

287
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:40,520
I'm not sure yet. I wonder who possessed
the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook before?

288
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,360
About that.

289
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:48,290
There's talk that it belonged to
Chairman Jang of Ohseong Group.

290
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,400
Chairman Jang?

291
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,440
Yeah. It hasn't been confirmed
but it's almost certain.

292
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:03,290
Oh? Chief Kang!

293
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,400
Hi, Joohyun.

294
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:08,130
Guess where I'm coming from.

295
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,500
Where?

296
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,460
I just visited Chohee at the hospital.

297
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,100
You did?

298
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,490
As you well know, I've been
suffering a lot these days.

299
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:24,180
It can't be helped. To alleve the tension
in the office and to build character...

300
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,260
someone had to set out
and put an end to this love triangle.

301
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,320
So you ended it?

302
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,470
Bingo.

303
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,100
I told her to make Bumsang happy.

304
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:42,360
The strange thing is
she said she was envious of me.

305
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,250
Why?

306
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:50,100
I'm not sure if she was
envious of me or of Bumsang.

307
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:54,220
I didn't really catch her drift.
Anyway, it's all over and done.

308
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:57,590
I see. You did well.

309
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:04,260
Chief, are you worried about something?
You don't look too well.

310
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,590
Huh? No, no worries.

311
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:12,270
Jeez, I just told you that
you can stop worrying about me.

312
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:17,370
I'm back to being the cute
and lively Joohyun I was before.

313
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,120
That's great.
I have to get going.

314
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,350
Where are you going?

315
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,370
To visit Chohee.

316
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,530
It's raining.
Do you have an umbrella?

317
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,450
Nope. It's okay.

318
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,240
But it's pouring outside.

319
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,530
Oh, Sis?

320
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,520
Yeah?

321
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,170
Do you need anything tomorrow
when you leave the hospital?

322
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:52,530
Nope, nothing. And I'm going
to go straight to work so don't come.

323
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,290
Why? Rest some more at home.

324
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,430
It's okay.

325
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:02,160
My body and my arm hurt a bit, but
I can't keep troubling the people at work.

326
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,220
I guess if you've already
decided I can't stop you.

327
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,570
But don't overdo yourself, okay?

328
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,400
All right.

329
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,420
Then I'm off.

330
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,150
Oh, and Sis?

331
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,130
What?

332
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:24,310
Dad stole the “Sowonhwagae”
scrapbook, just like the “Bihaedangjib?”

333
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,540
Yeah, you're right.

334
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:32,160
Then it coming back to the museum
is a good thing, right?

335
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:36,380
Of course. It's a good thing.

336
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,320
Then why don't you look happier?

337
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,170
You were so happy when
you found the “Bihaedangjib.”

338
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,330
Ah... that is...

339
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:57,410
Stop worrying about useless things
and do me a favor.

340
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:00,170
What is it? Tell me.

341
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:05,460
Please stop wasting your time here
and go win a scholarship or something.

342
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,140
Sheesh, Sis.

343
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:11,430
Your brother works
a part-time job every day...

344
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,250
and gets his scholarship through labor.
What more do you want?

345
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,210
I'm really leaving.

346
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,350
Go on then!

347
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:29,510
Where'd he run off to,
worrying me like this?

348
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,270
Chairman Jang is going too far.

349
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:44,210
It's not like you lost it intentionally. It was
bad luck. How could he do this to you?

350
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:47,310
Wouldn't you do the same
if you were him?

351
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,200
It wasn't just any book.

352
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,590
You're in deep trouble.

353
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,490
What if you're blackballed
from this world?

354
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,190
It might happen.

355
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,390
You're talking like
it's not your business.

356
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,350
What are you going to do?

357
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,400
You were awfully reckless. How could
you confront him knowing his temper?

358
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,120
You have your reasons, right?

359
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,240
[Chohee Heo]

360
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,260
Let's leave, I'll grab the check.

361
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,480
Hi.

362
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,420
I'm having a drink with Jonggyu.

363
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,520
No, I'll stop by real quick.

364
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,120
Okay, then let's talk
when you get here. Okay.

365
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,310
He's being so strange today.

366
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,560
Yeah?

367
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,210
Where are you?
Still far away?

368
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,490
Yeah. Still have
a long way to go.

369
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,320
How much longer?

370
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,340
About thirty minutes.

371
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:19,170
What? Thirty minutes?
Darn, I came out too early.

372
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:21,360
I'm waiting so get here
as quickly as you can.

373
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,320
Are you outside again?
I told you to stay in your room.

374
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:31,230
The room was really stuffy. It's pouring.
You don't have an umbrella, do you?

375
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:34,510
A little rain won't hurt me.

376
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,510
You said you can't stand to see
a woman get wet by the rain.

377
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,340
Well, I can't stand seeing
a guy get wet by the rain.

378
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,370
Is that so?

379
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:53,100
Um, about earlier. Why were you acting
like that? Did something happen?

380
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,570
No, nothing happened.

381
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:02,440
Liar. Then why did
you get so angry earlier?

382
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,420
Hello? Hello!

383
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,500
What happened?

384
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,200
Bumsang!

385
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:31,560
What's wrong? Hey, let go.

386
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,200
Don't wanna.

387
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,410
I told you to let go.

388
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,590
No. I'm not going to let you go.

389
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:22,110
What do you think you're doing?

390
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:27,290
Why are you so flustered by
a simple hug from your boyfriend?

391
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,250
Did you know you're acting
really strangely today?

392
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,530
I know I am.

393
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,520
It's not because
something happened.

394
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,570
You know I haven't been feeling
so well these days. Try to understand.

395
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:54,590
And I'm quite touched by you
waiting for me with an umbrella.

396
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,320
But just this much. Bye.

397
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,160
Hey! Take the umbrella!

398
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,570
Shouldn't this and this go
to the financial department?

399
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,420
Yeah.

400
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,170
- Check them for me.
- Mr. Nah? Sangho?

401
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,150
Mr. Nah, please write up
the Hahman case report for me.

402
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,110
Sangho, please organize the
briefing material for the Yeoju case.

403
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,310
You want us to do this work for you?

404
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,370
But you always did in the past.

405
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:49,410
Joohyun, can't you see all this?
We're swamped, too.

406
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:59,520
So you're saying
you can't do them for me, right?

407
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:04,590
The thing is...
It's not that...

408
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:08,500
No one in the regulations
team cares about me.

409
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,400
Bumsang left me,
and now you two, too.

410
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:19,160
Fine. I'll do it myself.
I'll take care of it.

411
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:25,300
Joohyun! Joohyun, give it here.
I'll do it for you. Come on.

412
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,300
Finish them by two, please.

413
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:39,540
When is she going to
get over her broken heart?

414
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,240
When is Chohee getting
discharged from the hospital?

415
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,340
Oh, Chohee!

416
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,580
Hello.

417
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:49,410
- Chohee!
- Chohee! Are you feeling okay?

418
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,270
Yeah, nothing I can't handle.

419
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:58,180
Oh, the Hahman case report,
I already turned it in last week.

420
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,520
- You did?
- Yeah.

421
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,430
Let's see.

422
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:07,300
And I uploaded the briefing material
for the Yeoju case onto our server.

423
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,420
Check it out later.

424
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,120
Okay.

425
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,480
Did you have some coffee already?

426
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,570
I'll buy to celebrate my discharge.
How does morning coffee sound?

427
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,330
Okay.

428
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,390
Chohee, Chohee!

429
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,450
Chohee, congratulations on
being released from the hospital.

430
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,190
Is your hurt shoulder okay?

431
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,280
How's Gyoon doing?

432
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,410
Gyoon's fine.
And the arm is still...

433
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:57,490
There's something
we're really curious about.

434
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,390
What is it?

435
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,380
Why did Bumsang quit
“Discovering Cultural Assets?”

436
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,440
What are you talking about?

437
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:23,100
You're full of energy today.
Can't believe you came straight to work.

438
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:25,300
You were cut from your TV gig?

439
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,400
How'd you find out so quickly?

440
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,440
Was it Chairman Jang?
It was, wasn't it?

441
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,380
What about your other work?
What about the school?

442
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,200
You're not going to be cut from
the advisory position here, are you?

443
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,510
If I'm told to quit, I'll quit.
I came prepared.

444
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,170
That's absolute nonsense.

445
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:52,210
Don't worry. If I can't avoid
the storm, I'll have to wait it out.

446
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,380
You should have told me all of this
was happening. Why didn't you?

447
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,540
Was that why you were acting
so strangely yesterday? Was it?

448
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,160
It wasn't?

449
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:10,390
Well, it was, though that
wasn't the whole of it.

450
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:14,430
What else is there?
Is there more?

451
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,520
Just some things.

452
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,390
Bumsang!

453
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:21,370
Director, how are you?

454
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,100
Good thing I ran into you.

455
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:28,400
I have something to discuss with you.
Let's go to my room.

456
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,140
Yes, sir.

457
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,230
I'll see you later.

458
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,400
What's this?

459
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,540
It's my letter of resignation.

460
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,150
Your letter of resignation?

461
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:54,180
I already know what it is
you want to discuss with me.

462
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:59,530
Rather than causing you discomfort,
I thought I should bring it up first.

463
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,230
Thank you for all the care
you've shown me.

464
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,330
Bumsang.

465
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,430
Yes, I'm listening, sir.

466
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:14,470
What in the world
are you talking about?

467
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,460
What?

468
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:23,310
The reason I wanted to see you
was to ask you to take a look at this.

469
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,140
What?

470
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,260
Were you displeased with
your treatment here at the CHA?

471
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,240
No, that's not it.

472
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,240
I didn't think I had done
anything to upset you.

473
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,480
I see you were feeling differently.

474
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:47,390
I guess it's true that you can never
really know what someone is thinking.

475
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:51,300
I never imagined
you were feeling like this.

476
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:56,420
Sir, how could I possibly?

477
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:01,430
Ifailed to recognize your great care
and attention. Please forgive me.

478
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:09,500
Did you really write this yourself?

479
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,530
Yes, I did.

480
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,480
That's weird. What's going on?

481
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:46,160
I'm so honored that
you called on me again, sir.

482
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,520
You must've been devastated about
losing the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook.

483
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,540
I'm saddened because
I can still remember...

484
00:39:55,540 --> 00:40:02,210
your happy expression when I first
placed it in your hands seven years ago.

485
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:05,260
Then and now,
you're still as talkative as ever.

486
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,480
Ah, well...

487
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:14,140
I won't beat around the bush.
Can you guess why I called for you?

488
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,470
Probably because you need me
to do something for you.

489
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:25,270
You're right.
Do you know Bumsang Kim?

490
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:30,490
Bumsang Kim?
Of course I do.

491
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:34,210
I need you to teach him a lesson.

492
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,150
Excuse me?

493
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,350
A penny for your thoughts.

494
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:58,280
Ah, hello. Have a seat.

495
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:00,460
Where is everyone?

496
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,410
Ever since the “Sowonhwagae”
scrapbook came back...

497
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,510
everyone's busy pretending to work.

498
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:07,310
Pretending to work?

499
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:12,560
No one's really motivated to catch
the anonymous donor here.

500
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:17,250
Since the person gave it to the museum
instead of lining his own pockets.

501
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:22,110
That's understandable.
Secretly I felt happy, too.

502
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:26,340
By the way, did you
find out who restored it?

503
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:34,180
Yes, well, I have a suspect
so I'm in the middle of investigating him.

504
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:40,520
Bumsang should know a lot about
that area. You should ask for his help.

505
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:45,160
Yes, I was planning
to go see him now.

506
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,360
Then as soon as you get
some results, give me a call, okay?

507
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,180
I will.

508
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:57,270
Why do you think Chairman Jang
left you only your advisory position?

509
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:01,320
Maybe because a public institution
is harder to influence?

510
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,370
No, that can't be it.
Anyway, it's very strange.

511
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,460
Whatever the reason, it's a relief.
That you kept the advisory position.

512
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:14,260
It's a relief?

513
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,110
Yeah.

514
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,480
Wow, Chohee, you've changed a lot.

515
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:23,530
Seems like yesterday you were trying
to kick me out with that recording.

516
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:27,300
You think you haven't changed?

517
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,250
How did I change?

518
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:34,370
You, um, you...

519
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,320
Then again,
you haven't changed much.

520
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,210
I wonder who turned
the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook in?

521
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,560
Aren't you curious?

522
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:56,540
I'm more than curious.
If I get my hands on him, he's dead.

523
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,470
I take being able to keep this job
as a sign from God to go catch him.

524
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:06,480
Watch and see.
I'm going to catch him myself.

525
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,570
Hey, isn't that Chief Kang?

526
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:14,490
Chief.

527
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,310
Chohee, you're back.
How are you feeling?

528
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:27,320
Just, you know...
What brings you here?

529
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:33,230
I wanted to talk to Bumsang.
Do you have a moment?

530
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,210
Sure.

531
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,300
Have a seat.

532
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,240
Okay.

533
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:52,120
So, what's up?

534
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,540
I wanted to ask you something
about the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook.

535
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:02,290
I heard something
interesting at the museum.

536
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,350
Apparently it was recently restored.
What's your take on this?

537
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:16,150
You saw it up close, too.

538
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:19,220
It was more of a passing glance.

539
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:26,130
According to the lab employee,
someone of great skill restored it.

540
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:31,430
Can you think of any suspects?

541
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:40,320
Is there anyone you know
who could have restored the scrapbook?

542
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,350
Is there a reason
you're asking me this?

543
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,420
It seems to me
you already have a suspect.

544
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:56,570
Sometimes questions
aren't asked for the answers.

545
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,130
Do you suspect me?

546
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,410
I won't deny it.

547
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,270
Do you have any evidence?

548
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:10,140
All investigations begin with a hunch.

549
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:12,160
A hunch...

550
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:18,550
When appraising, sometimes one's
intuition rather than evidence is correct.

551
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:20,500
Or it could be wrong.

552
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:27,250
It seems your line of work and
my line of work aren't very different.

553
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:33,360
Let's cut to the chase. Did you restore
the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook?

554
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,350
I remember telling you before that a
cultural asset is simply a cultural asset.

555
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:48,320
If a doctor refuses to treat a dying
patient, he doesn't deserve to be one.

556
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:53,150
Can I take that to mean
you did do the restoration?

557
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:58,450
You said some questions
weren't asked for the answers?

558
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,540
Finding the answer to your question
isn't my job. It's yours.

559
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:15,430
What are they talking about?

560
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,480
I'm sorry I couldn't be
of any service to you.

561
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,220
Not at all.
You've helped me quite a bit.

562
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,410
That's good to hear.

563
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,540
Bumsang, before I leave
I want to make one thing clear.

564
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,390
I believe you're a good person.

565
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,360
I sincerely hope
this belief doesn't change.

566
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,380
Chohee!

567
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,150
Chief.

568
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:10,330
Are you guys done talking?
What did you talk about?

569
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:16,320
It was nothing important.

570
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,270
I'll be going then. Goodbye.

571
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:34,140
Chief! Thank goodness you're here.

572
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,360
What is it?

573
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,400
Another item was
delivered to the museum.

574
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,350
Please move out of the way.

575
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,190
There you are, sir.
Please come this way.

576
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,330
Is it this painting?

577
00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:02,280
Yes.

578
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:04,520
Who received it?

579
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:09,400
I signed for the delivery but there was
no sender's name or address on it.

580
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:14,150
Sir, please take a look at it.

581
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:01,590
Looking at the composition
and the brushstrokes...

582
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:06,510
it appears to be Shin Saimdang's
“Chochung” paintings. I'm sure of it.

583
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:12,100
“Chochung” paintings...

584
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:18,400
Shin Saimdang's “Chochung” paintings?
Let me see. I can't seem to recall.

585
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:25,270
Uncle, think about it carefully.
Dad stole a lot of paintings, too.

586
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:29,380
Were the “Chochung” paintings
really not stolen by him?

587
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,210
With so many
“Chochung” paintings around...

588
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:39,470
If it's Shin Saimdang's,
it should be a collection.

589
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:42,130
Yes, with eight pictures.

590
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:45,130
[A collection? A collection...]

591
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:46,270
A collection...

592
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,370
I don't think it was one of his.

593
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,350
Is that so?

594
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:55,430
Why are you suddenly asking
about the “Chochung” paintings?

595
00:49:56,190 --> 00:50:00,450
I have my reasons.
Okay, thank you, Uncle. Goodbye.

596
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,440
Oh my!

597
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:16,570
Why so startled?

598
00:50:19,170 --> 00:50:21,580
Who did you talk with
to end up with such a long face?

599
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:27,410
Just someone I know.
Are you done confirming the piece?

600
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:28,510
More or less.

601
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:34,580
You know what? The more I think about
it, the more I can't understand this thief.

602
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:40,140
The “Chochung” collection
was definitely stolen, too.

603
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,350
So why send it to the museum?

604
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,560
I simply don't get it.

605
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:50,460
How in the world am I supposed
to catch him if I don't understand him?

606
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:57,470
Do you really want him to be caught?

607
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:01,330
You're asking that knowing
all that happened to me?

608
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,130
I'm planning to join the
investigations team tomorrow.

609
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:09,470
I'll check out the investigation and
nag them to hurry up and catch him.

610
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:16,310
Still the long face.
Did something happen?

611
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:20,400
No, nothing.
I have to get going.

612
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,310
Hold on a sec.
I'll give you a ride.

613
00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:24,360
No, I'm just going to take the buss.

614
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,160
Hey!

615
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,500
Shouldn't she be
the happiest person right now?

616
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:39,220
Did she think it was another one
of her father's stolen items?

617
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:56,220
So, in other words, you want
to help us out with the investigation.

618
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,200
Is that what you're saying?

619
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:01,260
Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.

620
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:07,490
Bumsang, I still remember clearly
how last time you offered to help us...

621
00:52:07,490 --> 00:52:12,270
and instead snuck away like a fox
that robbed the hen house.

622
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:17,340
And I remember how you
went back on your word.

623
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:23,180
I'm sincerely sorry about last time.
I had something urgent come up.

624
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:29,390
But today I will do my best to help you
and familiarize myself with on-site work.

625
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:32,280
In that case...

626
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,130
Thank you.

627
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:35,350
Then shall we go?

628
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:39,570
Where?
We have office duty today.

629
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:41,220
Excuse me?

630
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:46,210
Gosh, darnit.
Something just came up.

631
00:52:46,210 --> 00:52:48,130
Bumsang!

632
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:51,500
What are you doing?
You're supposed to help us on-site.

633
00:52:57,430 --> 00:53:00,100
These are the past year's
records of natives...

634
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,530
who entered and exited the country...

635
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:04,370
through the Busan and
Incheon ports. Go through these.

636
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:09,270
Check when Mr. Kim, Gyucheol, Yonggu
or Yongpal came in and went out.

637
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:15,460
Officers, aren't you investigating
the anonymous donor today?

638
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:20,120
The anonymous donor?
Why would we want to catch him?

639
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,260
He deserves a medal.

640
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,490
But you still have to investigate -

641
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:28,310
No, no.

642
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:34,530
We're tools of the people, so why would
we want to go against the people?

643
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:41,150
Rightly said. Not that
we're not going to investigate.

644
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:43,160
We'll do it later.

645
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:46,200
Take our time.

646
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:48,450
Work hard.

647
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:52,240
How do you expect me
to do this all by myself?

648
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:59,510
Bumsang, we need to catch Mr. Kim
so that you can sleep peacefully at night.

649
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:02,390
Right? Then...

650
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,280
Thank you!

651
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,170
Jeez...

652
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:19,280
Chohee, who do you think
Robin Hood is?

653
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,260
Who?

654
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:26,270
The anonymous donor. People
nicknamed him after Robin Hood.

655
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:31,170
Robin Hood?
Who do you think it is?

656
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:33,260
Let me see...

657
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:36,580
Did you hear?

658
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,430
Hear what?

659
00:54:37,430 --> 00:54:43,240
The office ladies all think
that Bumsang is Robin Hood.

660
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:48,330
Bumsang?
Why would they think that?

661
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:51,120
‘Cause he's the national hero who brought back a national treasure.

662
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:53,250
No way.

663
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:58,200
So how are things
going with Bumsang?

664
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:00,270
What?

665
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:03,100
Are you two really dating?

666
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:07,120
No, not exactly.

667
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:10,580
But I'm planning
to keep up the act for a while.

668
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,150
What are you talking about?

669
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:18,100
It's complicated. Weren't you
on your way to eat? Hurry up. Go!

670
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,300
Bumsang is Robin Hood?

671
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,470
What?

672
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:29,340
People think I'm Robin Hood?

673
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:34,490
So now I'm suspected
of being that thief?

674
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:39,290
Dear Lord...
Who started that rumor?

675
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:41,200
How would I know?

676
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:45,410
Anyway, how's the Robin Hood
investigation going?

677
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:49,220
Don't get me started. I've been working
for five hours straight without food.

678
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,370
Working on what?

679
00:55:51,410 --> 00:55:52,510
Don't ask.

680
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,500
Shouldn't you at least eat?

681
00:55:56,430 --> 00:55:58,430
You wanna go eat then?

682
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:01,260
Right now?

683
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,400
Yeah, right now.

684
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,460
Sure. Let's go eat.

685
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,530
Okay, then I'll head over there.
Wait for me at that bench, okay?

686
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,500
Yeah, I did as much as I could.

[Taesoo Heo]

688
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,380
[Taesoo Heo]

689
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:41,400
Why in the world is he so late?

690
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:48,440
Hey! Bumsang!

691
00:57:55,310 --> 00:57:57,460
Why are you so late?

692
00:58:01,180 --> 00:58:04,260
What's wrong?
Did something happen?

693
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:08,590
Chohee, listen to me carefully.

694
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,140
Don't be too shocked
and listen carefully.

695
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:16,340
What is it?

696
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,520
Your father...

697
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,250
He's alive.

698
00:58:24,510 --> 00:58:28,290
What are you talking about?

699
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,170
Your father isn't dead. He's alive.

<i> Episode 14

4
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,950
Boss!

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,800
There's not even an ant in sight.
Are you sure we weren't scammed?

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,920
For sure. What if it was
just a waste of money?

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,190
Do you wanna jump into
the Han River and sleep with the fishes?

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,020
Shut your traps!

9
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,120
Over there.

10
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,260
The package?

11
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:19,030
You're sure of its capability?

12
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,960
Within a hundred-meter radius, yes.

13
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:28,270
But it'll only last ten minutes
so a surprise attack is the best bet.

14
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,830
A surprise attack.

15
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,930
Thanks for the unexpected strategic tip
from a learned man like yourself.

16
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,830
Yonggu, give the man what we prepared.

17
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,170
Thank you. Then...

18
00:01:55,910 --> 00:02:03,930
Guys, our fate will change for the better.
Say goodbye to the cold and hungry days.

19
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,150
Boss, what is this?

20
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:16,870
You wouldn't understand even if I
explained. I'll show you what it is soon.

21
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,930
Let's go!

22
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,160
This is the “Gimainmul” double goblets
Robin Hood sent today.

23
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,010
Can we use the X-ray room right now?

24
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,280
Is there a problem?

25
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,290
I don't think it's authentic.

26
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,850
No way.

27
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:43,050
I'm sorry, but you need to leave
because of the training exercise.

28
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,950
You can't leave once the exercise begins.

29
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,110
Sure.

30
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,880
What should we do, sir?

31
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:51,000
We have no choice. Let's take
a look at it tomorrow. Good work.

32
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,010
A fake Robin Hood.

33
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,940
Why are you so serious?

34
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,130
No, it's nothing.

35
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,970
I can go home early thanks to the training
exercise. C'mon. I'll buy you a beer.

36
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,920
Sure.

37
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,990
Okay then, the twenty-third security
training exercise will begin now.

38
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,010
Start!

39
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,070
Yes, sir!

40
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,820
Excuse me?

41
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,270
Chohee, why are you lagging behind?

42
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,220
Why? Did you see something suspicious?

43
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,240
No.

44
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,230
The exercise began
precisely at 2100 hours.

45
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:18,050
As you can see on the screen, we've sent
in the defensive and the offensive teams.

46
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,290
This is the last day I'm playing the thief,
and then I'm calling it quits.

47
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:51,140
Me, too. Not like the museum will reward
us for our efforts. This is too much work!

48
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,270
Can we make a pit stop at the restroom?

49
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,810
Idiot!

50
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,950
It's an emergency.

51
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,810
Me, too. I'm about to explode after eating
the watermelon Joohyun gave us earlier.

52
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,160
Hurry up. Hurry.

53
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,230
Where's the storage room?
Are we there yet?

54
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:49,040
Hold on. When I scouted
the area earlier, it was definitely...

55
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,030
Wait, is it a floor below?

56
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,930
My tingling senses tell me that the scent
of money is wafting down from above.

57
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,090
Stop confusing me and give it
to me straight. Above or below?

58
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:11,250
Imbeciles. How can you
screw up every step of the way?

59
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,200
I don't know why
I work with you guys. Honestly.

60
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,070
Boss, this is the storage room.

61
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:47,110
Good job getting all the way here.

62
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:54,140
Shall we get this party started?

63
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,250
Huh?

64
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,180
- The lights are out.
- What happened?

65
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,850
This time they're really going full out.

66
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:47,040
I know. I don't remember
the last exercise being so dark.

67
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:53,190
This is just a frantic attempt to look good
in front of the superiors. Showing off.

68
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,820
Exactly. And we worker bees
have to work our butts off.

69
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,240
Something's not right.
Officer Cho, try radioing in.

70
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,880
Why is it dead?

71
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,290
This is Eagle, Eagle!

72
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,130
Huh? This is dead, too.

73
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,830
Hold on. Neither the walkie-talkie
nor the cell phone is working.

74
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,960
What if something happened?

75
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,820
What if this isn't part of the exercise?
What if this is a real situation?

76
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,020
What?

77
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,050
Boss. Is this all ours?

78
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,910
Wow, this is amazing.
Am I dreaming?

79
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:55,130
Move along.
We don't have much time left.

80
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,970
What in the world happened?
Manager Kim, explain things.

81
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,170
The thing is... It's probably
just a temporary power outage.

82
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,210
The independent power system will
kick in soon, so the power will return.

83
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:17,830
How it is possible that all the security
systems are down with a blackout?

84
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,010
First, we have to analyze
the situation precisely.

85
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:23,140
I'll start by checking
the first exhibition room.

86
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,060
Chief, should I come with you?

87
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,150
No, please go to the electrical power room and find out what's going on.

88
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,100
Yes, sir!

89
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,140
Today's exercise is certainly
refreshing. Completely innovative.

90
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,140
This is a power outage.

91
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,950
Right. There was a power outage
when we raided the Iwazaki meeting.

92
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,860
I'm getting bad vibes.

93
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,920
The storage room.

94
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,130
What? Did you say the storage room?

95
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:53,900
It's possible. Everyone's in
the museum's interior for the exercise.

96
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,030
Gosh, you know the level of security down
there. What reckless fool would rob it?

97
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:03,890
No, it's possible the security system there
is also down during the power outage.

98
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,210
Shouldn't we go check, just in case?

99
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,060
Yeah. We'll head over
to the storage room.

100
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,230
You guys go to
the nearest exhitibion room.

101
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,180
Okay!

102
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,060
Chohee, Jinguk, let's go.

103
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,810
They're talking nonsense. Wait, what if a thief really does rob the storage room?

104
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,210
Wait, what if a thief really
does rob the storage room?

105
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,860
If this is a real situation,
we're all dead meat.

106
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:44,870
Boss, I've never seen so many treasures
in one place before in my life.

107
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:47,050
Hey, idiot, how are you
going to escape with that thing?

108
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,170
The “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook,
the “Chochung” collection,

109
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,900
and the “Maejukmun” vase.
First find Chairman Jang's items.

110
00:10:54,850 --> 00:11:00,150
Then we sort through the expensive and
light treasures and wrap them up. Move!

111
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,800
Moving.

112
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,220
Oh, and try to find
the “Bihaedangjib,” too.

113
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,100
I need some of you to come with me
to the first exhibition room.

114
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,860
I'll leave the exhibition room
in planning to you.

115
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,830
Let's hurry!

116
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,930
What are you doing?
Why isn't the electricity on yet?

117
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,080
It takes some time to get
the emergency power running.

118
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,120
What? What are you going to do
if a thief takes this chance to come in?

119
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,030
Do you want to see
the museum get robbed?

120
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,020
Manager, sir, that
couldn't possibly happen.

121
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,800
How much longer
until the power is back?

122
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,970
Approximately a minute and a half.

123
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:07,060
[Accessing the security system.]

124
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,160
[Do you want to start
the back-up system?]

125
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,970
[Accessing the back-up system.]

126
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,970
What the?

127
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,270
Boss! What's happening?

128
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:33,830
Didn't you say the systems
would be down for ten minutes?

129
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,030
I thought so, too.

130
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,010
What happened?

131
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,910
Let's get out of here.

132
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,860
Hey, which department
are you guys from?

133
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:06,990
Run!

134
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,110
It's no use for you to run,
so turn yourselves in.

135
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,910
Chohee, are you okay?

136
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,170
I'm fine. Please report
things to the briefing room.

137
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,110
Hurry!

138
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,080
This is Eagle.

139
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,260
[This is real. Five intruders.
This is a real situation!]

140
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:28,190
All exits are to be barricaded,
including the front and rear exits,

141
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,010
and exits leading out of the parking lot.

142
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,130
What happened to the special task force?

143
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,800
They're almost here.

144
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,950
Boss, how will we get out of here?

145
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,090
Boss, let's turn ourselves in.

146
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,150
Shut your traps!

147
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,850
Stop talking nonsense.

148
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:14,110
I'm sorry for showing you
such a disgraceful image.

149
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:20,140
It's okay. Nothing will happen,
so don't worry too much.

150
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:25,150
We'll take care of matters here,
so you can go home.

151
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,230
Okay. Then I'll be going.

152
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,100
Hello, Director Kang.

153
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,280
Who are you?

154
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:03,210
The front exit is all clear.
What about the rear exit?

155
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,070
We're inspecting things now,
but everything seems fine.

156
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,070
And the east exit?

157
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,900
The exit has been completely sealed off.
Not even an ant will be able to pass.

158
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:16,060
There are supposed to be five men.
Then are they still hiding in the museum?

159
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,260
I'm not sure, but there's
nothing to report on our side.

160
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,910
Other than the director of the CHA,
not a single car has left the grounds.

161
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,290
Hold on. The director's car left?

162
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,940
Intruders in the museum.

163
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,020
I really can't believe it.
How could such a thing happen?

164
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:46,830
Yes, how could that happen?

165
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,820
How strange.

166
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:58,150
Which department are you guys from?
The regulations team, did you say?

167
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:03,900
Is that so important when we're all
serving the country and the people?

168
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,810
We'll guarantee your safety,
so please do not worry.

169
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,030
Ah, okay. Thanks.

170
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,170
Thank you, but we should've
brought along the secretaries -

171
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:28,130
Then again, the secretaries
aren't very important.

172
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,110
They'll be fine going home on their own.

173
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,200
Chief Lee!

174
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,830
What? Ah, yes? Understood.

175
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,230
Sir, we should take you home,
but we're in a bit of a hurry...

176
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,040
No, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.

177
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,100
Then, take care.

178
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,130
How could this happen?

179
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,220
Both teams running around like headless
chicken and letting them get away.

180
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,910
Thank goodness the security office
was efficient in handling the matter.

181
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,180
What would we have done
if something bad had happened?

182
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:38,810
Manager Kim, it's not like
we stood by doing nothing.

183
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,950
We'll devote everything
to catching the thieves.

184
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:47,010
You two should thank your lucky stars.

185
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,110
This is a real blow to our pride.

186
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:59,020
Who would dare sneak in
during our training exercise?

187
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:07,260
Let's get some rest today and discuss a
countermove tomorrow. I'm going home.

188
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,190
Okay, goodbye.

189
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,220
Chief, you should go home, too.

190
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,860
I will.

191
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,120
Chief, take this.

192
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,250
What is it?

193
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:27,040
There was a bit of a scuffle with the
thieves. Chohee managed to grab this.

194
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,280
Chohee? Is she okay?

195
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,040
Yes, she's fine and she went back
to the office to wrap things up.

196
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,980
Here.

197
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,260
Is there anything that
could identify the thieves?

198
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,270
No. Nothing of that sort.

199
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,150
I thought so. The thieves wouldn't
carry around incriminating things.

200
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,950
Let's go.

201
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,080
Okay.

202
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,090
[Gyoon Heo.]

203
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,890
Bumsang, sorry for calling you so early
in the morning. I have a favor to ask.

204
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:42,110
What is it?

205
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:46,050
Please reappraise the items
that Robin Hood sent in.

206
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,880
Reappraise them?

207
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,980
Yes, I'll explain things in detail later.
Please reappraise them first.

208
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,230
No, there's no need
to look at them all.

209
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,860
What is this?

210
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,070
Isn't it some kind of chip?

211
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,850
This seems to be the cause behind
the crash of the security system.

212
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:09,940
If this chip came from Robin Hood's item,
that means Robin Hood is the culprit?

213
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,050
No way.

214
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:17,290
What do you mean Robin Hood is
the culprit? What are you talking about?

215
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:23,070
Some real thieves invaded the museum
yesterday during the training exercise.

216
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:30,900
Thank goodness the theft failed. The
power was out and it was totally chaotic.

217
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,160
I was wondering who was behind it,
and it turns out to be Robin Hood.

218
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,040
There's no way Robin Hood
would do such a thing.

219
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,900
Jeez, Bumsang.

220
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,070
How could you defend him
with the evidence against him?

221
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,800
Robin Hood, you bastard.
I thought you were a good thief.

222
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,080
But you're a sly thief.

223
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,120
That's even worse than
simpleminded thieves.

224
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,140
Officer Park, please find out this chip's
capability with the security team.

225
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,230
Officer Cho, please look into
where it could have been purchased.

226
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,970
I'm sorry, but I'll have
to excuse myself first.

227
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:12,140
Hello? Yes, Grandma. What took you
so long in answering the phone?

228
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,920
Yes, yes. I'm fine.
Let me talk to Gyoon.

229
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,240
No, the guy I sent there yesterday.
Named Gyoon.

230
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:24,080
What? He never arrived?

231
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:36,210
Boss, it may be
presumptuous of me to say this,

232
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,910
but this failure is entirely your fault.

233
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:42,880
What?

234
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,870
Why didn't you fill me in on
the whole picture beforehand?

235
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:52,970
If you had clued me in, I would
have prepared a more precise plan -

236
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,000
Are you pouring salt on the wound?

237
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,260
No, I just...

238
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,860
Boss, take a deep breath.

239
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,040
What are you doing?
His glass is empty.

240
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:16,070
I'm so frustrated.

241
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:20,980
We made it in and didn't get away
with even a cheap porcelain piece.

242
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:25,810
Shouldn't we be glad
we made it out safely?

243
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,830
And everyone will think
he's the culprit.

244
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:36,060
You're glad with that?
Chairman Jang is going to murder us all.

245
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:43,010
What am I going to do? I totally
boasted to him about a great plan.

246
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:49,200
See? You've repeatedly fallen out of
grace since the retaliation on Taesoo Heo.

247
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:53,150
You're in big trouble, Boss.

248
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,160
You know I took care of things by sending
in my boys. Why bring it up again?

249
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:03,200
Anyway! That was the incident that
put Boss on Chairman Jang's bad side.

250
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:12,110
Both of you shut up! You guys
don't know when to keep your traps shut.

251
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:32,830
[Your call has been transferred to
an automated voice message system...]

252
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:38,860
Why does he have his phone off?
He's worrying me to death.

253
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,860
Chohee!

254
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,200
Chief, you're here early.

255
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,840
Yeah. I need to check something.
Are you headed to the conference room?

256
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,120
Yes.

257
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,160
Let's go!

258
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:50,000
So how's Gyoon doing these days?

259
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,290
Gyoon? He went traveling.

260
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,960
Traveling? Where did he go?

261
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:02,150
He wouldn't tell me. He said he'd call
when he got there but nothing so far.

262
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:08,230
Chief! Did you find any clues
in the bag from yesterday?

263
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,810
No, nothing significant.

264
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:17,270
Is that so? Does that mean
yesterday's attack will remain a mystery?

265
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,940
No, I do have a suspect.

266
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,930
Really?

267
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:32,280
We suspect that Robin Hood
was behind the attack on the museum.

268
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:41,070
Robin Hood! The guys from yesterday
were Robin Hood's crew, were they?

269
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:47,290
It's bad enough they broke into the
museum, but they dared to kidnap me?

270
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,920
When I get my hands on him -

271
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,840
Chief Noh! Chief Kang!

272
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,270
Yes, sir?

273
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,070
Even if you have to mobilize everyone
in the CHA and the investigations team

274
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,900
I want you to catch those thieves.

275
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,180
Yes, sir.

276
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,080
Man...

277
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:22,800
He's just a thief, not a good thief.
He has accomplices and isn't a solo act.

278
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:25,810
The Robin Hood case is headed
in an unexpected direction.

279
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:30,940
I'm a bit disappointed.
I thought Robin Hood was quite cool.

280
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:36,800
I'm going to catch him myself.

281
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,900
Why are you exaggerating?

282
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,970
He sold our team's name
to the director! That bastard!

283
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:45,080
You're not even the chief...

284
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,820
You jerk!

285
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,030
Be the bigger person.

286
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,900
Chief Kang.

287
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,260
Chief Kang!

288
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,250
Yes? I'm sorry.

289
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,080
Why are you in a foul mood?

290
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:19,010
How could you tell? Were you staring
at me during the entire meeting?

291
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,990
Jeez, you twist everything around.

292
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,230
It seems I hit the bull's eye.

293
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:33,230
Anyway, was it really
Robin Hood yesterday?

294
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,000
Dunno.

295
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:42,950
Because he sent in Dad's items,
I thought he knew Dad.

296
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,240
So I don't feel comfortable
catching him myself.

297
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,250
What do you mean
you're catching him yourself?

298
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:53,150
I'm going to join
the Robin Hood investigation.

299
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,120
We should catch him
quickly to find out who he is.

300
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,100
Why are you doing unnecessary things?

301
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,250
What?

302
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,150
I mean it's not your job
to catch Robin Hood.

303
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:06,990
Why are you getting involved?
That's just being meddlesome.

304
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,280
Meddlesome?
That's harsh, don't you think?

305
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,090
I mean, anyway, you -

306
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,120
Bumsang.

307
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,960
There was something I didn't tell you
in the morning. Can I have a moment?

308
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,250
Sure.

309
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,240
Excuse us.

310
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,200
Yeah.

311
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,140
What is it?

312
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,230
Let me ask you point blank.

313
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:47,030
The Robin Hood you saw in front of
Minister Gong's house was Gyoon, right?

314
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,290
This was at the museum yesterday.

315
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,260
No. Gyoon did not sneak
into the museum yesterday.

316
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:10,920
So you knew that Gyoon was Robin Hood.

317
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,190
Yes, I knew.

318
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:18,910
It was Gyoon who returned
the three previous items.

319
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:21,930
But not the “Gimainmul” double goblets.
That definitely wasn't him.

320
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,080
Do you know where he is right now?

321
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:30,830
I heard he's traveling. Do you know where
he is now and where he was last night?

322
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,140
I sincerely hope Gyoon isn't the culprit.

323
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,180
But just like no one imagined
Gyoon was Robin Hood,

324
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:46,080
no one can guarantee
that it wasn't Gyoon last night.

325
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,210
Chief Kang.

326
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,240
Please contact me
as soon as he contacts you.

327
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:55,140
Do you really think I'll do that?

328
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:05,230
I can't dissuade you from chasing him,
but I'll tell you now that I won't help you.

329
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,200
Bumsang.

330
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,970
I understand you don't want
to see Chohee get hurt.

331
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,240
I feel the same way.

332
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,260
I, too, am sincere about her.

333
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,940
Is it really necessary to catch Gyoon?

334
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:33,950
If he was framed for yesterday's events,
then it's the only way to protect him.

335
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:52,290
Joohyun!
Where are you going?

336
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:58,050
To report our meeting to the head
of the security. Man, he scares me.

337
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,170
Why didn't you ask
one of the guys to go instead?

338
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:07,270
I wanted to, but the guys are out
with the investigations team

339
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,010
And Chief Noh left early.

340
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,290
He left early?
Is something wrong?

341
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,890
No, I don't think it's anything like that.

342
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,960
Did you notice he's
really different these days?

343
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,130
Since the Robin Hood case began, he's
always missing and leaves at six sharp.

344
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,060
Is that so?

345
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:36,290
I understand his retirement is soon,
but please advise him not to do that.

346
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,800
I will.

347
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,890
Then, bye.

348
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:52,850
Your brilliant idea
was to rob the museum?

349
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,160
I completely screwed up, sir.
I deserve to die.

350
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:05,990
Your life is already in my hands. But how
could you do something so reckless?

351
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,150
Ah, I wanted...

352
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:12,820
But you don't have
to worry about a thing.

353
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,940
It was perfectly set up
so Robin Hood would be blamed.

354
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:20,810
We even left his ID card there,
so everything will be fine.

355
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:26,930
Are you out of your mind? What if
Gyoon Heo is caught and spills all?

356
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:32,820
Just in case, we kidnapped him,
so there's nothing to worry about.

357
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:35,020
What do you plan to do with him?

358
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,200
Well, I'm in a bit of a pinch
thinking about it.

359
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,190
I kidnapped him because I thought
I had to, but now I'm not sure what to do.

360
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:49,800
Should I let him sleep with the fishes?

361
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:53,820
Why are you asking me that?

362
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,060
What? Ah, yes...

363
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:03,060
I don't know what you did in the past
and what you will do in the future.

364
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:07,160
Of course! That's a given.

365
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,830
Leave me. And don't be seen
anywhere near until I contact you.

366
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,940
Yes, sir.

367
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,980
Boss, what's gonna happen to us now?

368
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:42,040
What else? We have to lay low
until Chairman Jang's wrath subsides.

369
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,100
How did this happen?
This was supposed to be our big hit.

370
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:54,030
We got off easy because
we have Chohee Heo's brother.

371
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:57,960
If we didn't have him,
today would've been our funeral.

372
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,260
What happened?

373
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,280
Where did he go?

374
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,840
‘But just like no one imagined
Gyoon was Robin Hood,

375
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:14,800
no one can guarantee
that it wasn't Gyoon last night.'

376
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,940
Why did you suddenly
want to eat here of all places?

377
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:33,830
It's time to eat so let's just eat.

378
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:36,290
I always wanted to come here
but want to come alone.

379
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:42,920
Be honest. You feel bad
for snapping at me earlier, right?

380
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:47,210
When did I snap at you?
I never did that.

381
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,950
Besides, you're buying today.

382
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:50,970
Why should I?

383
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,930
Fine, I will. I'll buy.

384
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,110
Really? You always say that
and never buy.

385
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,140
Don't even.
I bought at least one meal.

386
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,930
Are you ready to order?

387
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,160
What's your most delicious dish?

388
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,100
How's this option?

389
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:14,210
It includes an appetizer, the main course
and dessert. And drinks are included.

390
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,100
Okay, we'll have two orders of this.

391
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,890
Hey! Why are you ordering for me?

392
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,200
Just eat it.

393
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,800
It's the cheapest thing
on the menu, isn't it?

394
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,990
You wanna pay?

395
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:38,020
Did you talk to Gyoon today?

396
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:45,060
Gyoon? No, I couldn't get in contact
with him all day. Where is he?

397
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,910
He must be at a place
with bad reception. Don't worry.

398
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,930
But it's strange.

399
00:36:54,290 --> 00:37:00,990
Why are so many people interested in
Gyoon today? Both you and Chief Kang.

400
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,220
Is that so?

401
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,240
Hello?

402
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,110
Gyoon!

403
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,150
Why haven't you been
picking up your phone?

404
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:25,060
Oh, I ran out of battery.

405
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,070
Where are you?

406
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:29,210
Here? I'm at Sokcho.

407
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,860
Sokcho?

408
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,900
Jeez, you went far.

409
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,170
Gyoon, did you eat?
Did you sleep well?

410
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:44,230
Sis, I'm fine, so don't worry
if we lose contact for a while.

411
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:47,130
I'm perfectly fine. Okay?

412
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:49,950
Call me at least once a day.

413
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:52,190
Hey, let me talk to him.

414
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,900
Gyoon, Bumsang wants to talk to you.

415
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:02,130
Not right now, Sis. I have to get on
the bus now so tell him I'll call him later.

416
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,160
Bye.

417
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,820
Hello? Gyoon! Gyoon!

418
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,160
He hung up?

419
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,860
Yeah, he hung up.

420
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,040
Thank you very much.

421
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,080
Are you really going to
be fine on your own?

422
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:56,860
You think I'm a little kid? If anything
happens, I'll call you first. Satisfied?

423
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,940
Yeah, go on in.
I'll leave after you go in.

424
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,280
Okay. See you tomorrow.

425
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,960
Bumsang!

426
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,850
Who could it be?
What's going on?

427
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,910
We have no choice. Come with me.

428
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:43,960
What?

429
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:48,190
Hey, hey.
What are you doing?

430
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,280
Let's go to my house.

431
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,150
What?

432
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,810
Then do you want to stay here?
Come with me.

433
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,280
- Hey!
- Come on.

434
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,200
Look, isn't that Bumsang?

435
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:10,870
I'll have to teach him another lesson.

436
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,840
Where are they going together?

437
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:19,170
Hey! Why are you curious
about such useless things?

438
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:24,830
Where in the world
did that bastard go?

439
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,900
Hurry and tell Boss
we couldn't find him.

440
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,240
Aw man, he's gonna beat on us again.

441
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,940
Drink some of this, okay?
You all right?

442
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,090
Yeah, I'm fine.

443
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:46,120
Hey, is it really okay
for me to be here?

444
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:52,010
It turned out for the better. I was
uneasy about you being home alone.

445
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,800
I mean, I did promise Gyoon
that I'd take care of you.

446
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,110
There's nothing to be
uncomfortable about so relax.

447
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:06,040
Fine, then.
I'll trouble you for one night.

448
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,220
Sure.

449
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:15,800
I wonder who it was
that wrecked my house like that?

450
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,230
Maybe it was Robin Hood?

451
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:30,230
If it was, that means
he's no friend of my family.

452
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,830
I really don't get it.

453
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,270
Think about that later and get some rest.
You must've been shocked.

454
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,170
Yeah.

455
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:54,940
What? So you're telling us
that Chohee's brother is Robin Hood?

456
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,040
Oh my god.

457
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:00,140
Didn't I tell you the darkest place
is under the candlestick?

458
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,970
I guessed it would be someone related
to Heo, but who knew it would be him?

459
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:15,990
I'm certain Gyoon is Robin Hood but not
if he was behind the museum intrusion.

460
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:19,840
Though frankly things
aren't looking good for him.

461
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,170
Chohee will have a heart attack
if she finds out.

462
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:31,210
So what I want to say is that
we have to find him as soon as we can.

463
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,850
Unofficially, of course.

464
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:41,190
So you want to keep this
a secret from Chohee, right?

465
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,100
Won't that be for the best?

466
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,040
Yes, sir.

467
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,040
Hello?

468
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,050
[Bro!]

469
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,060
Gyoon! Where are you?

470
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:38,860
Bro, listen to me first.

471
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,840
I was kidnapped by Mr. Kim
on my way to your grandfather's place.

472
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,910
What? Are you serious?

473
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:51,060
Yes. I managed to escape,
so don't worry.

474
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,820
That's it. I'll go to you right now.
Where are you?

475
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:00,020
No, I found out a secret
behind my father's death.

476
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:04,870
Chairman Jang and Mr. Kim
collaborated to kill my father.

477
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,040
I'm not going to do nothing about it.

478
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,100
Hey, you're not thinking of
doing anything foolish, are you?

479
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:22,010
Gyoon, you can't do this by yourself. Let's
discuss this in person. Where are you?

480
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:23,960
Please take care of my sister.

481
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,040
Gyoon!

482
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:39,830
Is this enough?

483
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:45,010
Thank you, Uncle.
I'll pay you back for sure.

484
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,130
What are you saying? You punk.

485
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:51,800
Why would I lend money to you?
This is allowance I'm giving to you.

486
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,850
Thank you.

487
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,180
So what do you need this money for?

488
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,220
Things are really complicated in my head.

489
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:03,820
I wanted to go traveling
but I didn't want to ask Sis for money.

490
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:04,860
Traveling?

491
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,110
Uncle, I have to get going.

492
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:10,800
You're leaving now?
At this late hour?

493
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:14,170
Hey, kid. Where are you headed looking
like that? Sleep over at my house tonight.

494
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:17,030
It's okay. I already have a ticket
so I have to get going.

495
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,920
Oh, and Uncle? Please look after
my sister while I'm gone.

496
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,890
I will.

497
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:37,090
Uncle! I'm depending on you.

498
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,840
He's acting a little weird today.

499
00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:54,150
‘No, I found out a secret
behind my father's death.'

500
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:58,260
‘Chairman Jang and Mr. Kim
collaborated to kill my father.'

501
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,870
Chief Kang!

502
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:22,910
So where is Gyoon right now?

503
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:29,960
He wouldn't say. I'm worried that he'll do
something reckless at his young age.

504
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:35,240
I did consider the possibility Chairman
Jang played a hand in Heo's death.

505
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,250
But I couldn't pursue that approach
because there was no evidence.

506
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:42,120
And there's another thing
you should know.

507
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:46,100
Today Chohee's house was ransacked.

508
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,270
What do you mean?

509
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,960
Someone broke in.

510
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,180
I assume it was Mr. Kim?

511
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:56,070
It seems they were
trying to recapture Gyoon.

512
00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:00,190
And Chohee? Where is she now?

513
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:04,000
She's at my house.

514
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:09,110
I took her to my place. I didn't think
I should leave her alone at her house.

515
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,960
Yes. That was
the right move on your part.

516
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,980
I know you don't feel comfortable
hearing about this from me.

517
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,940
I know that we both
want to stay by her side.

518
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:30,960
Anyway, I will do everything I can to find
Gyoon. Thank you for contacting me.

519
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:37,060
Please find Gyoon. Please.

520
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,090
I will.

521
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:21,880
Is this the man who got into a huge fight
with Taesoo Heo seven years ago?

522
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,240
It's a recent picture
so he might look different now.

523
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:30,210
Don't pay attention to things like
the hair color and just look at his face.

524
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:32,970
That's him. That's the man.

525
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:34,130
Are you sure?

526
00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:38,260
Yes! Those eyes, that mouth.
I'm sure it's him.

527
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:42,070
If we bring him in,
can you testify against him?

528
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:43,930
Sure.

529
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,120
Thank you for your cooperation.

530
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,220
- I'll see you soon.
- Bye.

531
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,850
- Chief, we're back.
- We're back.

532
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,250
Officer Cho, Officer Park.

533
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:08,880
Drop what you're doing
and focus on finding Mr. Kim.

534
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,030
Did that man just
confirm that it was Kim?

535
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:17,260
Yes, it's almost certain that Mr. Kim
was Chairman Jang's middleman.

536
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:20,830
So now our priority is to gather
evidence and find more witnesses.

537
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:21,920
Officer Park.

538
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,070
Yes, Chief.

539
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:28,190
Try to locate Mr. Kim through the
ex-middlemen. He's somewhere in Seoul.

540
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:31,210
Officer Cho, come with me.

541
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:33,050
Where are we...

542
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:38,970
See you later.

543
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:56,210
Are you up? Go wash up
so we can have breakfast.

544
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Okay.

545
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:05,280
Tada!

546
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:09,940
Man, I haven't eaten at home in ages.

547
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:11,130
Help yourself.

548
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,010
You look like you live here.

549
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:21,100
I wish I could live in a place like this.

550
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,080
So, is there anywhere you want to go?

551
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,060
Why?

552
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,990
It's Saturday.
We should go clear our heads.

553
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:37,040
I'm fine. I just want to go home.

554
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,140
What?

555
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:44,910
Thanks for your concern,
but I'm not comfortable being here.

556
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,000
Then I'll sleep over at Jonggyu's place,
so you stay here.

557
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,110
Where did that come from?

558
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:53,890
Then do you want to stay
in a motel room by yourself?

559
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:55,850
Why would I go somewhere
other than my house?

560
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:59,290
You can't stay there on your own.

561
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:03,970
What are you going to do
if someone breaks in like yesterday?

562
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:06,180
I'll worry about it then.

563
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,000
You're not serious, are you?

564
00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:15,860
Gyoon could come home at anytime,
and nothing's resolved by my staying out.

565
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:18,250
I want to go home,
get changed and stuff.

566
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:31,220
Chief, what if you get into trouble
for dropping in unannounced like this?

567
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,980
It's not so hard
living off a reduced salary.

568
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:40,900
Who is it?

569
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,940
This is Chief Shiwan Kang
of the investigations team.

570
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,800
This isn't our first meeting, is it?

571
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,880
You remember.
It's been a while.

572
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,810
What brings you to my house?

573
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:03,290
As expected, you don't beat around
the bush. Then I won't mince my words.

574
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:08,940
Do you know a man named Taesoo Heo?

575
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,090
Taesoo Heo?

576
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:16,960
Hmm, I don't think
I've ever heard of him.

577
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:23,290
Are you saying a well-known art collector
like yourself doesn't know Taesoo Heo?

578
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:27,820
Is there a reason I should know him?

579
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:33,230
He's such a famous art thief,
I assumed you had at least heard of him.

580
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:39,960
Or maybe you'll recognize
the name “General Shovel?”

581
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:46,110
Why are you asking me
about an insignificant art thief?

582
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:50,940
I was wondering if you knew
where I could find General Shovel.

583
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:56,850
He disappeared seven years ago,
and we have no idea where he is.

584
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,940
We have to arrest him, so I was
wondering if you had any information.

585
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:06,840
I want to repeat my question
as to why you're here asking me this.

586
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:10,000
This is how investigations are.

587
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,170
We examine those
who are indirectly related

588
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:15,230
and we look for contradictions
in the testimonies.

589
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:18,180
Like fitting together puzzle pieces.

590
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,150
If you're from
the investigations team,

591
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:24,900
you should be under
the Seoul district jurisdiction.

592
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,080
Yes, I am.

593
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:35,960
The last time we met, did I fail to mention
I was close with the police commissioner?

594
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:45,010
You think you'll be safe
after this insolent behavior?

595
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,080
There's a saying that fits this situation.

596
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,900
It's not over until the fat lady sings.

597
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,150
What?

598
00:53:53,910 --> 00:53:57,020
Thank you for your cooperation.
I'll be seeing you soon.

599
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:08,900
Dear lord, Chief!

600
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,020
Did you wait long?

601
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:13,930
I was on the brink of
a heart attack the whole time.

602
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:17,070
What did Chairman Jang say?
Did he admit to knowing Taesoo Heo?

603
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,850
You think he would?
He denied everything.

604
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:25,010
Then why did you come here
when it's so obvious he would do that?

605
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:26,200
To test the waters.

606
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:27,820
What?

607
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:32,020
He'll know that
we've picked up on his scent.

608
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:35,230
He'll definitely take action
to cover his tracks.

609
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,950
And we need that
in order to catch him redhanded.

610
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:39,160
I see...

611
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,000
Is Officer Park at Chohee's house?

612
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,030
Yes, he should be dusting
for fingerprints with the forensics team.

613
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:44,980
Let's head over there.

614
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:49,920
Okay. Chief, what if Chohee
comes home while we're there?

615
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,860
We have to search her brother's room.

616
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:54,940
If something Robin Hood
related appears -

617
00:54:56,270 --> 00:55:01,030
I've already explained things.
She won't come home until we're done.

618
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:02,290
Who did you tell?

619
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:05,100
Chohee?

620
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,190
Let's go.

621
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:13,090
Why are you stopping me
from going home?

622
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:17,000
Who says I'm stopping you?
Come with me somewhere first.

623
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,080
Where? Where are we going?

624
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,930
You talk too much!

625
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:24,050
I'll let you go homeso stop
complaining and come with me.

626
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,280
Where are we going?

627
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:38,010
Feel cooler?

628
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,840
Try and grab it!

629
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:10,000
Show it to me next time.

630
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:21,820
Hey, look at this. Doesn't it look
just like the one you gave me? Right?

631
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:25,890
It's similar.
But this one's fake.

632
00:56:26,130 --> 00:56:28,180
What? But it looks the same.

633
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:32,130
It's fake, I tell you.
A Chinese dude made this one.

634
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:37,120
You say everything's fake.
How can it look so similar?

635
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:41,250
Did you use the set I gave you yet?

636
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:42,970
No.

637
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:46,860
Why? Couldn't bear to use it
since it's real Goryeo celadon?

638
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:53,070
No, I was waiting to use it
when my father came home.

639
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:00,000
That's why you bought three cups.

640
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,850
Making me feel bad.

641
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:10,100
Don't be. I'll use it next time with Gyoon.
You want to come over then?

642
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,100
You're going to invite me?

643
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:18,830
We have an extra cup. Let's use them
when Gyoon comes back from his trip.

644
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:40,910
Chief?

645
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:51,060
This was found in Gyoon's room. I think
he used it for his Robin Hood activities.

646
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:58,230
We have no choice.
Take it in as evidence.

647
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:00,040
And -

648
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:02,040
What else?

649
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:06,210
We found these, too.

650
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:13,070
What? Are you serious?

651
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:16,220
Why would those at Chohee's place -

652
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,100
Okay, Chief. I understand. Yes.

653
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:22,210
Who was that?

654
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,880
Chief Kang?

655
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,800
Yeah.

656
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:30,010
What's up?
Did something happen?

657
00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:33,050
He wants to see me tomorrow
about the Robin Hood case.

658
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:40,850
Man, I'm hungry. Let's eat.
What would you like?

659
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:44,280
You're hiding something
from me, aren't you?

660
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,880
What are you talking about?

661
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,960
I overheard your call
with Chief Kang just now.

662
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:55,000
What are they doing at my house?

663
00:58:56,870 --> 00:59:00,950
And why is it necessary
for you to keep me away?

664
00:59:01,930 --> 00:59:05,240
They're dusting for the fingerprints
of the guys who broke in yesterday.

665
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,000
And why wouldn't you tell me that?

666
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,240
I'm telling you now.
I thought you'd feel better not knowing.

667
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,080
You think I'm stupid?

668
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,900
You're hiding something, aren't you?

669
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:20,030
I'm not.
Why do you keep asking that?

670
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:21,890
Look at me!

671
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,830
Look me in the face and tell me.

672
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:27,870
What are you hiding?

673
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,260
What is it you're unable to tell me?

674
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:49,940
Hello, who is this?

675
00:59:50,130 --> 00:59:52,000
[This is Ohseong Jang.]

676
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:55,090
Who did you say you are?

677

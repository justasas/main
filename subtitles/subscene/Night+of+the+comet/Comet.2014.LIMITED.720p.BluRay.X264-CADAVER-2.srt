1
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,900
This is not a dream.

2
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:28,028
This is not a dream.

3
00:00:29,238 --> 00:00:32,082
OK. OK.

4
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,683
This is not a dream.

5
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,973
This is
not a dream.

6
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,342
This is not a dream.
This is not a dream.

7
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,074
How did I get here?
I don't know.

8
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,782
Some...somebody
just transferred me here.

9
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,038
I don't want to give you
my information again.

10
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,039
I just told someone
five times.

11
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,826
Can one of you behave
like a real person, please?

12
00:01:57,993 --> 00:02:00,166
I'm calling about...

13
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,253
Right, yes. I'm her son.

14
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,427
What kind of cancer
are we talking about?

15
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:10,009
Well, what are her options?

16
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:12,675
What about a liver transplant?

17
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,809
Why not?

18
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:18,188
Ask about her Child-Pugh score.
Trust me.

19
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:20,850
What's her Child-Pugh score?

20
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,269
AB. Uh...

21
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,358
What about
her bilirubin levels?

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,773
If they're low enough,
they might consider yttrium-90.

23
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,033
Hold on. You know,
you have really bad social skills.

24
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:32,365
Can you at least pretend to
not listen to my conversation?

25
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,871
Nobody likes that guy.
Don't be that guy. Eyes on the prize.

26
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,873
Yeah.

27
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,909
What about yttrium-90?

28
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:41,420
Her bilirubin levels
are too high?

29
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,751
OK. Listen. I'm gonna
get on a flight in the morning.

30
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,882
So I should be at the hospital
by 3:00.

31
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,385
Butjust have her call me tonight,
so I know I'm wanted.

32
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,760
Thanks.

33
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,140
- Fuck!
-This is about your mom?

34
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,300
Yeah.

35
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:58,346
- How long are they giving her?
-I don't know. A few years.

36
00:02:58,512 --> 00:03:01,140
-L'm so sorry.
-Yeah.

37
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,102
What are you doing?

38
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,566
I got to roll a joint before
the meteor shower starts.

39
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,778
- Why?
-What kind of question is that?

40
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,444
We're about to watch
a fucking meteor shower. "Why?"

41
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:17,076
Oh, here.

42
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,412
It's for when you apply to college
in a few years.

43
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,668
USG me 8S a TGfGFGHCG.

44
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:25,206
You're a postdoctoral scientist
at Tristana Pharmaceuticals.

45
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,545
- Yep.
-So you already...

46
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,006
Oh, that cancer-y stuff.
Yeah, I did.

47
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,387
Anyway, uh,
I should be able to help you

48
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,799
get into top 10 pre-med
in a few years.

49
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,260
What makes you think
I want to go pre-med?

50
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:41,146
Well, other than the fact
that you knew what yttrium-90 is

51
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,478
when most of your peers
are still...battling to crack

52
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,564
the mysteries of
parallel parking?

53
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,650
That's just because my mom...

54
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,689
Your mom died of liver cancer.
Yeah. I know.

55
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,824
Your book bag
has a cancer ribbon pinned to it.

56
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,985
It can only be
a picture of your mom.

57
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,371
Fits the age range.
You guys have the same nose bridge.

58
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,157
Makes sense you want to
become a doctor that saves people.

59
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,122
Right? Make up for the doctor
that couldn't save your mom.

60
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,083
You know, in time,
those good intentions will fade

61
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,124
and become about the money,
it always does,

62
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,169
and you become bitter,
like everyone always becomes.

63
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,463
And then you die,
probably from cancer.

64
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,678
You know, 'cause that's ironic.

65
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,593
--ls something wrong with you?

66
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,307
Probably, yeah.

67
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,188
Don't worry.
I'm working on it.

68
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,348
I just fired my therapist.

69
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,267
She was such an idiot, though.

70
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,061
She diagnosed me with

71
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,945
narcissistic personality disorder.

72
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,323
Said I'm under
the grand delusion

73
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,701
that I'm the smartest person
in the world.

74
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:41,206
To which I responded,
"What if I really am?"

75
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:45,289
- You know?
-Hey. Over here.

76
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,243
Watch out!

77
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,703
You OK?

78
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,967
You alright?

79
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,800
This...this doesn't feel real.

80
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,931
What?

81
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,518
I feel like my life
just flashed before my eyes.

82
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,270
You know, like in a movie

83
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:29,477
where the main character dies
in the beginning

84
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,518
but he keeps going,
not realising he's dead.

85
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,607
Like, what's that movie
I'm talking about?

86
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,487
You know what I mean.
It's like...

87
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,865
- What is it'? lt...it's...
-Oh, uh, sure. Uh...

88
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,402
Yeah, like Bruce Willis
in 'The Sixth Sense'.

89
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,447
Exactly, yeah. Wait, no.
You know what? I never saw that.

90
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:47,287
Shit. That's the twist
that everyone was talking about?

91
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,702
Bruce Willis dies
in the beginning of that? That sucks!

92
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:52,371
Oh, I really wanted to see that.
Fuck!

93
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,921
Sorry. I guess I just thought
everyone had seen it.

94
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,087
Oh, don't worry.
No, I'm not that mad. No.

95
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,722
I mean, I am,
but I'll get over it. Sorry.

96
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,883
That's a lie. I'll...

97
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,223
I'll probably harbour this
for a few more months at least.

98
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,855
And then...you know,
we'll see...see what happens.

99
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,392
That's cute.
You have an eating problem?

100
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,565
No. Not like... I'm... Sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

101
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,108
Dude. Come on.

102
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,992
You do realise my date
isn't the one

103
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,370
with the eating problem,
right?

104
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,749
On.

105
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:34,129
What? Uh-oh.
Kimberly's annoyed.

106
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,851
Kimberly?

107
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,319
Kimberly?

108
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,151
Hey.

109
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:10,870
- How do you do that?
-What?

110
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,535
I haven't seen you
in a year when...

111
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,454
I was literally
just thinking about you.

112
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,840
- Gosh. Really?
-Yeah, because of that song.

113
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,468
I was listening to it
as I was walking here,

114
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,720
and it reminded me
of the hotel.

115
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,012
The one we stayed at
for my friend's wedding in Paris.

116
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,552
Yeah, yeah. Paris.
The City of Lights.

117
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,938
And pretension, as I recall.

118
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,064
We had one of
our biggest fights.

119
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,726
And that was your friend's wedding
from Wisconsin, right?

120
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,520
What was her name?
Lenora or Leonora?

121
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,486
- Sarah? Right.
-Right. I remember that wedding.

122
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,616
I remember that was the one
where the DJ

123
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,698
played that Montell Jordan song
twice.

124
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,704
Remember, the first time,
we thought it was ironic,

125
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,616
and then we realised
he just liked the song.

126
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,205
Definitely our biggest fight.

127
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,915
The beginning of the end,
really.

128
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,501
Yeah. Yeah.

129
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,667
Look, it's like
the Beatles, right?

130
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,132
I mean, I liked them
when lwas five.

131
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,093
But at a certain point,
you just want something

132
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,178
with a little more nuance,
you know?

133
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,559
Don't get me wrong -
I could handle them a little better

134
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,220
when they had Pete Best
to ground them,

135
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,356
but past that, I don't know -
they just got so...pedestrian.

136
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,358
- Do you come here a lot?
-Do I come to the cemetery?

137
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,237
I like cemeteries, you know.

138
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,774
They're romantic.
Especially this one.

139
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,988
Soccer is by far
the most elegant sport.

140
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,324
It's gonna overtake football in America
in the next two years.

141
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,285
Oh, God. Really? Two years?

142
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,949
A friend of mine
described it perfectly.

143
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,492
Clock's ticking.

144
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,035
He blogs, "Soccer's...

145
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,045
-"Soccer's chess on the field."
-Oh.

146
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,753
Do you have any vomit bags
in there?

147
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,794
I guess we could just throw...
I'd hate to throw up at a grave.

148
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,132
Why didn't you just go to
the Griffith Park Observatory, then,

149
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,717
to watch the meteor shower?

150
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,382
Well, they have assholes there too.
Trust me.

151
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,266
And there are assholes
all over this city,

152
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,769
but rarely do you get to be
next to one so spectacular.

153
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,272
Only knock on him, I have to say,
he's from New York.

154
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,183
I can't stand that place.
Seriously. It's so overrated.

155
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,102
Why, because of all the bridges
and the culture

156
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,895
and the history they have?

157
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,939
Who needs it?
I'll take Orlando any day.

158
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,824
They got so many more
TGI Fridays.

159
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,155
That's why I love L.A.
Los Angeles is just more...

160
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,161
- Oh, no.
-Modern.

161
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,493
There's a relevancy about it.
New York doesn't have any...

162
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,079
Kimberly, I was wondering
if I could have your number.

163
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,745
- What?
-Your phone number.

164
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,460
Dude.

165
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,000
She's with me.

166
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,042
No.

167
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,678
Uh, yeah. She is.

168
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,635
No, she's not.
Not yet anyway.

169
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,299
At best,
this is a first date,

170
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,388
and I'm shocked that
that even happened.

171
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,929
I have nothing against you.
You might not be a bad guy.

172
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,348
Most likely, but maybe not.
You're incredibly handsome.

173
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,733
You were probably very handsome
when you were a kid too.

174
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,814
I think that explains your lack
of substance and personality.

175
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,945
Only because nobody's ever
really challenged you before.

176
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,653
So now as an adult,
you think everything you say

177
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,692
means something,
but it means nothing, actually.

178
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,078
You don't know what you're
talking about, it's upsetting,

179
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,079
and I think she probably
sees through that.

180
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,115
You're very pretty,
but you're shallow beyond belief.

181
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,587
Anyway, can I have
your number?

182
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,873
- OK. OK.
-What are you doing?

183
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,258
You just said all that shit.

184
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,419
Yeah, but it was
just an observation.

185
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,299
And you ask my girl out
in front of me?

186
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,141
Shit. Sorry. My mistake.
I see that now.

187
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,181
I shouldn't have done that.
She's way too beautiful.

188
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,896
- What?
-I should be more of a realist.

189
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,481
I should know I'm a C,
maybe a C+ in winter,

190
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,567
when I can cover up
my body more.

191
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,198
Even though you're a douchebag,
you're incredibly attractive,

192
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,824
so maybe it's only fair
you two pair.

193
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,741
What? It rhymed.

194
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,032
She's right. It rhymed.
Alright. Let's...

195
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,246
Can you just put me down?
This is...

196
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,910
This is embarrassing now
for everyone.

197
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,374
OK. Come on, Josh.
The line's moving. Let's just go.

198
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,917
- Come on.
- Wanna get a good seat.

199
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:55,098
The only thing wrong with you
is you're a chickenshit.

200
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,384
- That's all.
-lt's not the only problem.

201
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,770
- Let's go. Excuse me. Excuse me.
-lt's one of many.

202
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,273
- You OK?
-Yeah. I shouldn't talk.

203
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,275
That's when
I get into trouble.

204
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,358
I'm sorry I made fun of
your sandwich bag.

205
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,443
I didn't mean to.
That's not true. I did.

206
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,201
Sorry. I'm really nervous.

207
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,364
It's OK.
Well, I'm sorry he bothered you.

208
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,657
Oh. I'm not nervous
because of him.

209
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,796
<i>OK. 'Bye.</i>

210
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,256
She is so...

211
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,139
...beautiful.

212
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,184
Kim, come on.
The Wedding's in an hour.

213
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,225
- You got to get ready.

214
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:50,146
So...have you ever
dreamt about me'?

215
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,985
- Dreamt about you?
-Yeah.

216
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,650
You know, in the 700+ days
we've dated.

217
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,616
You ever dreamt about me?

218
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,827
So...
Yeah, of course.

219
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,618
Oh, yeah? Like, uh...
like, sex dreams?

220
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,004
At first, but then we had sex
and that went away.

221
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,961
Ha. ls that how you
really want to say that?

222
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,752
I was all hot to trot for you,
or whatever, in the beginning,

223
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,671
and now, you know,
reality set in.

224
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,216
That's not what I meant.
I meant, like...

225
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,476
- I got it.
-A dream, like...

226
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,682
Ambiguous depictions
of what we are,

227
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,598
or were, or could be,
stuff like that.

228
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,516
Will you stop it already?
I got it.

229
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,357
- Why, I oughta...
-Hey! Whoa.

230
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,521
Put that down.
You're not yourself.

231
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,066
- What are you doing with that?
-l'm gonna give you what-for.

232
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,609
Oh, yeah?

233
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,028
Yeah.

234
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,946
We good?

235
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,667
OK.

236
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,249
OK. That was fun.

237
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,710
Does it bother you
that you don't make me happy?

238
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,001
- Always with the jokes.
-l'm serious.

239
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,261
Seriously, you went from sex dreams
to not being happy.

240
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,467
False. I wasn't talking about sex dreams.
You were.

241
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,597
And, secondly, I'm a girl,
so, yes, we're non sequitur.

242
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,306
- Ah, that's a little clich?d.
-I want a baby.

243
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,767
- Point taken.
-Seriously.

244
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,023
Don't you want a baby?

245
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:12,277
Some day, sure.

246
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,564
But let's...let's burn that bridge
when we get to it, OK?

247
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,483
See? Not making me happy.

248
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,153
How do you do that?
How do you do that?

249
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,963
Oh, my God, she's beautiful.
She's beyond beautiful.

250
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,259
She's real.
And she seems funny too.

251
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,887
And just have a hint of crazy.
I can feel it.

252
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:43,550
Beautiful, crazy and funny.

253
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,434
Jesus Christ, she's perfect.

254
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,971
It's really annoying.
Really...

255
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,945
That's...two near collisions for you now
in a row.

256
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,657
At least this one's not fatal.

257
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,370
OK.

258
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,908
- OK?
-OK.

259
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,124
-'Bye.
-Yeah.

260
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,881
What the fuck was that?

261
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,654
<i>Comets were observed before
in ancient times by many...</i>

262
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:49,324
Wait. Wait.

263
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,495
What are we doing?

264
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,716
Are we into chasing now?
What are we doing'?

265
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:03,297
Hey. Just stop for a second.

266
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:06,808
I saw...
I thought I saw somebody,

267
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,061
a friend of mine, behind you,
coming over, so...

268
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,187
Well, that's why
I turned around and waited.

269
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,189
So, what's the big deal?

270
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,726
Wasn't because
you were watching me?

271
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,987
It looked like you were
kind of watching me.

272
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,568
No. It was because of a friend
that was behind you.

273
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:24,655
Well, so they're...so they're
not there now, obviously.

274
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,287
Besides, you were being weird.
You were talking to yourself.

275
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,750
- What were you saying anyway?
-You know, you say 'so' a lot.

276
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,207
-It's really annoying.
-So, do...

277
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,996
Are you trying
to make this awkward now?

278
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:39,211
- It feels awkward now.
-Awkward feels good to me.

279
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,421
And awkward
feels awkward to me.

280
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,552
That's a little on the nose,
don't you think?

281
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,427
I'm not trying to fuck you.

282
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,218
If that's what you're worried about.
I mean...

283
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,183
I'm not gonna ask you out,
because I don't believe in love.

284
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,394
I think all relationships
deteriorate

285
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:57,558
into hate, indifference or...

286
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:59,602
Well, yeah, those two things.

287
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,612
My parents have been together
for 32 years.

288
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,489
- And they are happily in love.
-No, they're not.

289
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,776
- Yes, they are.
-No, they're not.

290
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,910
If they haven't divorced by now,
probably means they've just

291
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:10,037
surrendered to the fact
that being apart is much better

292
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,324
than being together -
you know, the lesser of two evils.

293
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,039
It's like an emotional holocaust
between your parents right now.

294
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,329
They probably have
lukewarm feelings about you too.

295
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:19,998
-L'm Dell, by the way.
-So...

296
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:23,964
No offence, but I have a...
a thing about shaking hands.

297
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,426
Oh, my God.
You ARE a little crazy.

298
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,558
- That's great.
-You're not impressing me.

299
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,309
- I disagree.
-You know...

300
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,641
You should stop trying to sound so smart
all the time.

301
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,431
You just wind up
sounding really dumb.

302
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,099
I realised
why you date guys like that.

303
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:40,485
You have terrible taste in men
'cause you're superficial.

304
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,065
You're fooling yourself
in the hopes

305
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,605
of finding
something redeemable.

306
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,444
It's 'cause of love.
That's your blind spot.

307
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,153
You gotta give up on that.

308
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,037
<i>Wow. OK.</i>

309
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,324
Well, I thank you
for your insight, stranger,

310
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,994
but...l actually believe
love is real.

311
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,878
-L'm gonna go now.
-Wait.

312
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,046
Can I still get your number?

313
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,634
- Hello, boyfriend.
-Hey.

314
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,144
Hey. Listen, uh...Roxette's on
and the good part's coming up.

315
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,522
- Can I call you back?
-Wait, wait, wait.

316
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,808
I have to tell you something
more important really quick.

317
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,102
That book I'm reading,
'The Selfish Gene', Richard Dawkins.

318
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:27,490
J' Leave the winter
on the ground... J'

319
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,650
There was this fascinating part
I just read about memes.

320
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,740
He basically says
that ideas are like genes

321
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,575
that self-replicate and mutate

322
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,866
like a...like a...cultural form
of evolution.

323
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,251
J' Touch me now

324
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,662
J' I close my eyes... J'

325
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,580
I was thinking about
how that applies to us,

326
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,124
you know, the idea of us,

327
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,792
how we've...we've really
mutated and evolved.

328
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,336
J' And it's a hard

329
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,846
<i>J' Winter's day... J'</i>

330
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,382
Because if you think about it,

331
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,471
we were just dumb young kids
when we first met,

332
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,887
then we broke up, got back together,
blah, blah, blah,

333
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,306
and now, now we're this
really mature, loving couple

334
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,725
who's grown respect
and admiration for each other -

335
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,518
you know what I mean?

336
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,695
Kimberly?

337
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,191
You hung up on me,
didn't you?

338
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,736
J' But it's over now

339
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:18,625
J' From the moment we touched
until the time has run out

340
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:23,163
- J' Yeah, it must have been love
J' Yeah... J'

341
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,056
Well, maybe you could.

342
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:39,520
Well, because I'd like her to be
at the best place.

343
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,523
Well, then, maybe you could
introduce me to the head guy

344
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,434
at the cancer
and immunology lab.

345
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,944
Because I've taken an interest.
That's all.

346
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,822
Yes, Mom, I meditated.
Yeah, I meditate before every date.

347
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,153
But it didn't help.
Face facts.

348
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,193
No-one thinks I'm special
but you.

349
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,739
Well,
I'm still technically on it,

350
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,033
but it's not working out,
trust me.

351
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:05,126
He...called himself
a Bob Dylan song

352
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,961
and then proceeded to call me
a Britney Spears song.

353
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,968
I don't know what that means either,
but it sounds insulting.

354
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:14,882
No, not him.
The one with glasses, moustache.

355
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,596
Looks like a child trafficker.

356
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,807
Yeah. Yeah. That's the one.

357
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,893
Well, if I...

358
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,646
I got to go. I got to go.

359
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,817
Can I ask you
a serious question?

360
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,742
Do you think I have
terrible taste in men?

361
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,378
OK. I'm back.

362
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,509
Uh-huh.

363
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:57,098
- Well, I'm at...
-I have to talk to you.

364
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,224
-L'm on the phone.
-No... It's really important.

365
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,932
- Really important.
-l'm on the frickin' phone.

366
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,472
Have you ever cried at one of
these things? I was wondering.

367
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,983
Morn, I have to go.
Something weird is happening.

368
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,396
- One of what things?
-These meteor shower things.

369
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,439
- Cried?
-Yeah.

370
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,529
You know, like, tears ofjoy,
that kind of thing.

371
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,535
No. I've never cried
at one of these things.

372
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,163
Yeah, no.
Either have I, ever, ever.

373
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,165
In fact, I don't understand
people that do it.

374
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,826
It's kind of bullshit,
happy crying, isn't it?

375
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,744
What are you...what are
your thoughts on that?

376
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:30,256
So...l was on the phone.

377
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,293
So, yeah,
you were on the phone.

378
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,086
Sorry. Was it important?

379
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,720
More important
than your question?

380
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,381
- Yes.
-Yes.

381
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,720
My mistake. Sorry.

382
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,306
-L'll never interrupt you again.
-Thank you.

383
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,392
- OK.
-Well...

384
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,976
- I should get back to my date.
-I want to keep talking to you.

385
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,815
- What?
-For multiple reasons.

386
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,820
You're beautiful, but it's more
than that, I promise.

387
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,027
Well, that's very nice,
but I should go.

388
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,864
Maybe I'll see you
in the winter, when you're a C+.

389
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,654
Oh. See? I knew it.
I knew you were superficial. I told you.

390
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,244
The only reason you're talking to me
is you think I'm hot.

391
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,750
The only reason why you won't
is because you think I'm not.

392
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,707
Fine. Give me a reason
why I should.

393
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,879
I was saying,
"Don't miss her."

394
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,135
When you saw me talking
to myself, "Don't miss her."

395
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,671
I'm always afraid I'm gonna miss
the important things in life,

396
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,091
and something about you has given me
a heightened curiosity

397
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,430
to know you better, and that is
a near-impossible feat

398
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,970
when it comes to me,
'cause I hate getting to know people.

399
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,979
But I can tell
you're not like the others.

400
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,856
- What others?
-People.

401
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,767
People? You can tell
I'm not a person?

402
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,902
Yeah.
You're not phoney like them.

403
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,189
I didn't say you were hot.
I said you're beautiful.

404
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,280
When is this dumb thing
gonna happen?

405
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,206
It's a beautiful night, though.

406
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,000
What?

407
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,510
I never know that means,
people saying it's a beautiful night.

408
00:22:58,669 --> 00:22:59,795
What does that mean?

409
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,141
So... Well, to me...

410
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,271
It means it's...
it's comfortable, familiar.

411
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,432
Yet deeply moving.

412
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,398
Right. No, I feel you.
Like, um...

413
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,279
Like I'm stoned
and listen to Steely Dan.

414
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,440
No. Nothing at all like that.

415
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,076
Not like... No. I know.
More like an... Yeah.

416
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,738
Like...floating down
a serene lake in a rowboat

417
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,033
when the sun is setting

418
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,326
or like when the sun is...
being a part of nature.

419
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,914
_StQp speaking.
-Yep.

420
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:36,127
It's beautiful when
the weather's not hot or cold.

421
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,420
Kind of like you don't notice it,
kind of like it's perfect

422
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,213
'cause everything's
so balanced.

423
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,381
You don't even feel it.

424
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,176
And while you're feeling
that non-feeling...

425
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,479
...you look up in the sky

426
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,606
and you almost think,

427
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,563
"That's why,"

428
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,069
because how everything is
right now,

429
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,650
all the stars
and planets

430
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:04,068
and us and the ground
and the cells and molecules...

431
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,111
Right now...

432
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,531
...is exactly the reason.

433
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,247
Right now is comfortable.

434
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,786
You're a now person.

435
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,330
- True.
-Yeah.

436
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,123
See, I'm a five-minutes-from-now
person,

437
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,666
because five minutes from now,

438
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,460
a gust of wind could come
and blow H1 N1 in everyone's eyes.

439
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,722
Right.
Except that's highly unlikely.

440
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,099
Or five minutes from now,
an earthquake could erupt

441
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,134
and swallow us all whole.

442
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,599
Right. Except that... Shit.
That could actually happen.

443
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,639
Yeah - the point is
I'm way too anxious about

444
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,104
what could happen five minutes
from now to be content with now.

445
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,563
Can't do it.

446
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,478
What if something good happens

447
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,022
five minutes from now?

448
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,407
- Can't that happen?
-No.

449
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,363
What did you think
was gonna happen

450
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,494
five minutes
before you met me?

451
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,415
Just really paranoid
I'm gonna miss it.

452
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,580
I miss things a lot.

453
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,800
I don't care ifl miss it
because...

454
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,961
You're a now person. Got it.

455
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,174
So, another weird thing -

456
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,560
I don't mind your pessimism

457
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,813
as much as I usually mind pessimism.

458
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,690
That's great. I hate people
who think I'm too negative.

459
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,861
Also, I like your hat.

460
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,569
Yeah, I'm probably gonna
fall in love with you.

461
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:34,116
Wow.

462
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,541
That's it?

463
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,547
What were you hoping for?

464
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,253
"I'm going to
fall in love with you too?"

465
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,793
<i>No, but...</i>

466
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,257
Well, yeah.

467
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,172
So all that stuff about
not believing in relationships...

468
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,715
That's just
a pick-up line.

469
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,056
Do we have a deal, then?

470
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,312
'Cause you said you believe in love.
I don't.

471
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,099
So let's put it to the test-
date each other, me and you,

472
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,188
in a relationship.

473
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,352
Let's do it.

474
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,954
Why the hell
am I shaking your hand?

475
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,414
I should be scared to death
of who you are as a person.

476
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,005
Instead, I'm scared to death
of weddings - death, literally.

477
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,044
I'd probably have a coronary

478
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:28,963
right <i>as</i> I was
walking up the aisle.

479
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,927
Oh, God.
Please invite me to your wedding.

480
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,263
I'd love to see that.

481
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,346
Well, that's morbid and telling.

482
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,436
Yeah, well, if snuff films
were readily available,

483
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,475
I'd probably watch 'em -
not gonna lie.

484
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,986
- Is that a deal-breaker for you?
-No.

485
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,818
Because for some reason,
I still happen to be in love with you.

486
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,357
No, it's because
you didn't think

487
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:49,946
you'd be the one
marrying me.

488
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,486
Wait. You don't smoke weed.

489
00:26:51,652 --> 00:26:53,120
What are you doing?
Don't do that.

490
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,655
- So do you still love me?

491
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,665
I tell you all the time.

492
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:59,452
If you died right now,
I'd visit your grave every single day.

493
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,630
Not every day. It's crazy.

494
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,257
That doesn't
answer the question.

495
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,961
Of course I love you.

496
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,351
It never sounds real
when you say it.

497
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,307
Like it doesn't exist.

498
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:52,922
So, what are you doing here?

499
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,886
I'm going up north.

500
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,471
- Why would you do that?
-I don't know.

501
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,513
- You don't know?
-|... Of course. I'm kidding.

502
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,558
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna meet someone.

503
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:08,821
So... Right. OK.

504
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,700
- How's your mom doing?
-Uh, she's actually fine.

505
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,907
I can't believe I haven't
talked to you this long.

506
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,788
Her doctors were huge idiots,
so I took matters in my own hands.

507
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,291
I figured out a way to dose her
with that experimental drug

508
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,827
we were developing
in the lab.

509
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:25,212
Wait. Are you allowed
to do that?

510
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,168
No.

511
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,460
Wasn't that...
extremely dangerous?

512
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,674
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
-Well, she's fine now?

513
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,965
Yeah, completely.
She's in remission. So...

514
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,008
- Dell, that's great.
-Yeah.

515
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,098
I mean, other than
the totally unethical

516
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,013
recklessly risking your mom's life part,
that's...that's...

517
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,774
- You...you saved her.
-Yeah, I guess.

518
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,981
We should probably keep that
between us, by the way,

519
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,770
just because
there's a good chance

520
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,156
<i>what</i> I <i>did was illegal...ish.</i>

521
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,282
Right.

522
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,660
--Oh.

523
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,196
- All aboard!
-Right.

524
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,115
- Uh...
-We should probably...

525
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,534
OK, right.

526
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,543
Well, still. Wow.

527
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,454
Can't believe
you're curing cancer now.

528
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,168
Does that mean
you've stopped hating people?

529
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,878
Not at all.

530
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,420
Kill Zelda Fitzgerald.

531
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,844
Right?

532
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,974
- Who is that?
-Really?

533
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,635
I don't know who that is.

534
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,806
F. Scott Fitzgerald's
annoying...wife.

535
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,895
- Oh, really?
-Yeah.

536
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,526
I'd definitely marry
Rita Hayworth.

537
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:33,235
- Great hair.
-Hair, right.

538
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,241
Guys love her hair.

539
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,071
I definitely have to
shit out of this one.

540
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:43,161
- Olga Kordenstitch? Who is that?
-I don't know.

541
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,291
I've just always
wanted to fuck an Olga.

542
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,794
I would definitely
marry Tupac.

543
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,001
Kimberly Shakur.

544
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,632
It's got a good ring to it.

545
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,920
I would definitely eff
Edward R. Murrow.

546
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,555
I picture him
starting up sex with,

547
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,638
"Goodnight and good luck."

548
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,602
I'd probably laugh so much
that I'd have an orgasm

549
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,486
right then and there.

550
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,991
From the laughter, you know?

551
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,619
I lied about
not seeing 'The Sixth Sense'.

552
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,905
- You saw it?
-Of course I saw it.

553
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,573
Everybody saw it.
It's amazing.

554
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,708
Who didn't see
'The Sixth Sense'?

555
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,086
Why would you lie
about that?

556
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:33,670
I read in a woman's magazine
that every relationship,

557
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,209
whether it be short-term
or long-term,

558
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,753
there's usually one big lie
relative to that relationship,

559
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,718
and Ijust...l wanted to
get mine over with, I guess.

560
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,725
Why would you want to
get a jump start on the lying?

561
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,306
Because of...

562
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:46,846
Oh, because of
five minutes from now.

563
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,060
Well, yeah.

564
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,817
You're assuming that we're in
a relationship, or going to be,

565
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,695
when I'm still technically
on a date with someone else,

566
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,027
which I should probably
be getting back to, by the way.

567
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,409
What about the handshake?
We shook hands. You can't do that.

568
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,821
- I was leading you on.
-That's really fucked up.

569
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,578
- That's the business.
-Well, what about a friendship?

570
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,334
Actually,
what am I talking about?

571
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,461
I definitely don't
want to be friends with you.

572
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,092
I was raped, in high school,

573
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,380
by the quarterback
of the football team.

574
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,049
Jesus!

575
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,139
I know.

576
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,224
That is a terrible lie.

577
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,310
Hey. How do you know
that's a lie?

578
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,190
You were raped in high school

579
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,851
by the quarterback
of the football team?

580
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,815
I don't think after-school
specials are that clich?.

581
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,524
You couldn't have gone with,
like, a cornerback

582
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,655
or a defensive end
or something?

583
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:41,988
Well, lwas just trying
to get mine over with.

584
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,948
- Your what over who?
-My lie to you.

585
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,113
- You can't.
-Why can't?

586
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,452
Because I saw it coming,
'cause we just talked about it.

587
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,913
You're very good at this.

588
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,249
You got to wait until I'm in
a completely vulnerable position

589
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,085
where I'd really
fall for it.

590
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,624
- Sounds really dangerous.
-Oh, yeah.

591
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,212
That's the problem
with relationships.

592
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,048
- Danger?
-Or worse.

593
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,178
- Worse?
-You change the other person.

594
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,848
You are a very broken man, Dell.

595
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,101
In theory.

596
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,354
Speaking of broken men,

597
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,981
your goateed philistine
is sashaying toward us.

598
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,529
- Run. Run! Run!
-What? What?

599
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,669
Well, that's settled.

600
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,130
Want a hit?

601
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,795
No way.

602
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,929
It has a weird effect on me.

603
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,433
For some reason, when I'm high,
I think people can't hear me

604
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:51,266
and I start speaking
really loudly.

605
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,024
Do you remember
memorising phone numbers?

606
00:32:56,183 --> 00:33:00,188
I don't remember the last time
I memorised a phone number.

607
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,776
Yeah, I don't either, actually.
Remember...

608
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,816
Remember checking the newspaper
for movie show times?

609
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,530
Can remember that.

610
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,320
Or writing people those notes
in those, like,

611
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,080
folded-up triangles

612
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,036
and then...putting them
in their lockers?

613
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,540
Do you think
kids still do that,

614
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,704
as opposed to
just emails or texts?

615
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,999
No way. It's all about
emails and texts.

616
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,418
Those goddamn hugs and kisses.

617
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,552
Oh, I hate those things.

618
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,429
Whenever anybody emails me
hugs and kisses,

619
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,761
I want to just email them back
oral and penetration.

620
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,265
Are we old?

621
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,896
Are we talking
like old people?

622
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,730
Are we on the verge ofjoining
the sweatpants culture?

623
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,653
Was I just saying something?

624
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,364
- What? What'd I say?
-Give me that.

625
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:55,284
- Why?
-Give me that. OK.

626
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,872
That's it for you. Mmm.

627
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,584
I think you should, uh...

628
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,874
You should start drinking
some coffee.

629
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,044
- OK?
-That's why I hate time.

630
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,226
I believe
I want to have sex with you.

631
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,726
Oh, I share in that belief.

632
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:27,092
Hey. Hey. OK.

633
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,594
- What?
-Yeah. We got to get ready.

634
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,755
- Come on.
-What the eff?

635
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,423
I thought we were
gonna make it.

636
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,217
I know,
but we got to go, Kim.

637
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,351
Really.

638
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,891
What's that?

639
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,937
What is that?

640
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,658
You ordered Chinese food?

641
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,323
Who orders Chinese food
in Paris?

642
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,618
Kim, they're gonna have dinner
at the wedding, you know,

643
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:03,162
the wedding that we're supposed
to go to in half an hour.

644
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,296
And you just ate lunch.
You're not full?

645
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,753
What does that
have to do with anything?

646
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,089
Jesus. This is the pot talking.
You shouldn't have smoked.

647
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,346
I knew it. You got to get ready.
What are you doing?

648
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,099
You made me promise to get you
there on time, no matter what.

649
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:20,979
- You warned me you'd do this.
-See? This is why I hate time.

650
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:24,437
I can't enjoy my sesame chicken
because of that.

651
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,976
Kim.

652
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,315
I wish I could just...
stop it or something.

653
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:31,448
Or at least just make it pause
when needed, like now.

654
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,530
Really, I'd just
get rid of it altogether.

655
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,162
You want to get rid of time?
How would you do that?

656
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,788
You know how there's
time-based art?

657
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,541
Movies, music, plays -
it's all time-based art.

658
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,419
There's a beginning
and a middle and an end.

659
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,251
And you have to see it
from beginning to end.

660
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:49,667
You're restrained
to that time line,

661
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,881
that way of experiencing it.

662
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:57,470
But then there's paintings -
no beginning, no middle, no end.

663
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,852
You see what you want to see
when you want to see it.

664
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,265
No restrictions.
It's just there.

665
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:08,436
OK. So you want life
to be a painting.

666
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,353
Great.

667
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,119
Come on.

668
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,540
Thanks.

669
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,754
So do you know
you really love me?

670
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,055
So, what's in your pocket?

671
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,219
My wallet.

672
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,104
It's stuffed with
our saved movie ticket stubs

673
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,765
'cause I'm a romantic
like that.

674
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,558
- Can you please get ready?
-Shh!

675
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:51,148
Can't you see
I'm trying to touch my toes?

676
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,655
I don't want to be that couple
that's always late for things.

677
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,066
Can we please not be
that couple?

678
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,360
At least for the tenure
of our relationship. Please?

679
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,117
You did it again.

680
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,409
What? What? I'm just saying
I want us to respect time.

681
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:09,000
- Not that.
-OK. What, then?

682
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,756
What did I do that I did
twice now and still not know?

683
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,792
You said
"the tenure of our relationship".

684
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,960
You keep speaking about
our relationship as if it's ending.

685
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,755
OK. You see how this relates to
the time thing?

686
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,765
Why don't you take
your own advice

687
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,847
and instead of seeing
a beginning, middle and an end,

688
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,011
just see it as a painting.

689
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,101
--Kimberly, what are you doing?

690
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,607
We're gonna be late! And I'm
gonna somehow get blamed for it.

691
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:30,767
I know it.

692
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,828
What...what are you reading?

693
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,114
Roald Dahl short stories.

694
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,580
So is it about a girl-
you're going up north, new girlfriend,

695
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,999
you're not telling me
'cause you think it'll make it awkward?

696
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,382
Right.

697
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,173
Yeah.

698
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:02,883
So, right? OK.

699
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,973
- A girl.
-I love Roald Dahl.

700
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,137
It's the best.
Which one are you reading?

701
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,102
And are you sleeping
with anyone?

702
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,858
The one about Hitler. And yes.

703
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,895
Shit.

704
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,938
I didn't know
he wrote one about Hitler.

705
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,324
Well, kind of.

706
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,530
Well, it's about this doctor
that saves this woman's life.

707
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,946
She's on the verge of death
through the whole delivery.

708
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:27,116
And this doctor is so determined
to save this woman's life

709
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,034
and the life
of her unborn child, right?

710
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,329
But...it turns out...
the child's Hitler.

711
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,624
OK. Did you just
give away the ending?

712
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,292
How can I tell you
what it's about

713
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,835
without giving away
the ending?

714
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,379
What are you talking about?

715
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,889
Just say it's a story about
a doctor who saves a woman

716
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,640
from a potentially fatal pregnancy.

717
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,392
- That's what the story's about?
-It is.

718
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,519
False, birdbrain.
That is not what the story's about.

719
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,976
It's about the...irony
that the baby's Hitler.

720
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,982
- OK. You're mad.
-l'm not mad.

721
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,235
- You're mad 'cause of the girl.
-l'm seeing a guy - Jack.

722
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:59,273
- You're seeing a Jack?
-He's an executive at MTV.

723
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:01,157
Looks like a cross
between Salvador Dali

724
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,785
and Dwayne Wayne
from 'A Different World', which is hot.

725
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,205
That's a weird combination.

726
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,336
I got to go to the bathroom
really quick.

727
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:27,142
Oh, that...fucking hurt.

728
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,974
- What?
-You hung up on me.

729
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,763
- What happened?
-Because.

730
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,059
OK, you realise that's not
an answer to my question, right?

731
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,942
What is it
I can help you with, sir?

732
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,069
Have I told you
how much New York reminds me

733
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,775
of why I hate L.A.
so much?

734
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,067
No, please do, because
the New Yorker who opines

735
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,327
the inferiorities of Los Angeles
is bursting with originality.

736
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,784
I'm serious, Kimberly.
We gotta move here.

737
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,917
It is the fucking best.
It's enough already with L.A.

738
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,578
It's like a mix of
moral nihilism and Disneyland.

739
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,712
- So are you.
-Hey. Uh...

740
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,044
Did I tell you
the proof of concept on our drug

741
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,005
passed with flying colours?

742
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,386
There's actually a bidding war
between a few pharmas right now.

743
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,138
Looks like we could be licensing it
for close to 25 million.

744
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,138
- Money for soul seems like...
- An even swap.

745
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,302
Yes. It's not like
I'm not happy for you.

746
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,688
But you did already tell me this
all this morning, remember?

747
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,894
- Did <i>l</i> really?
- Uh-huh.

748
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,651
Oh, shit.
Short-term memory must be shot.

749
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,653
What with the smoking pot
and whatnot.

750
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,110
I'm your new
second-term girlfriend, man.

751
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,149
Aren't you supposed to be,
like, impressing me still?

752
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,535
Your second-term boyfriend
just told you he made his bosses

753
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,321
close to $25 million today.

754
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,993
-L'm not materialistic.
-Yeah, I know that.

755
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,456
But $25 million sort of...

756
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,871
...l don't know,
makes that sound retarded.

757
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,290
OK, seeing as there's
no new information in this call,

758
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,379
I am gonna go -
I'm almost at the gun range.

759
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,091
Hey - don't you think it's cute
that you own a gun card

760
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,005
and I own a pot card?

761
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,173
Now you sound retarded.

762
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,842
Listen, we should probably
stop saying 'retarded'.

763
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,386
L'm starting to feel
like an asshole.

764
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,054
Oh, is that
just now starting?

765
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:00,185
What's going on?
You sound off.

766
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,945
- You're off.
-No, no, no. I'm serious.

767
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,357
Cadence is all over the place.

768
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,946
You sound a little like
Ms Teschmacher

769
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,827
when she betrayed
Lex Luthor.

770
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,613
Something's wrong.
I can tell.

771
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,747
What's going on?

772
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,171
God, this is gonna blow.

773
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,798
- What's going on'?

774
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,755
Oh, shit.
This is bad, isn't it?

775
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,092
This is, like,
infidelity bad.

776
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,893
I definitely heard a silence
just now.

777
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,771
- What is going on?

778
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,187
- You OK?
-Yeah. You OK?

779
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,447
<i>So...</i>

780
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:49,405
-lt's been a while.
-Yep.

781
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,950
- Glad you're finally here.
-Yeah. Me too.

782
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,129
Been trying to get a hold of you
for a long time now.

783
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,504
Do you want a tour
of the place?

784
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,761
- No.
-Oh. OK.

785
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,757
- Seriously?
-Oh, yeah.

786
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,552
You know I don't care about
stupid shit like that.

787
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,223
Right.
J' It must have been love... J'

788
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,187
Sorry. I have adjusted to
normal people.

789
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,897
So your presence
is gonna take some realignment.

790
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,313
- Are you moving?
-Uh...

791
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:29,653
No. Kind of. Uh...

792
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,695
Do you want anything,
by the way, like, uh...

793
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,407
I want to talk.

794
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,089
What?

795
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,388
Nothing. For a second, I...

796
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,723
I forgot
what you looked like.

797
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,477
For the record, I've never
forgotten what you look like.

798
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,068
OK. Chill out, OK?
I didn't sleep with anyone.

799
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:13,280
OK. Did you see and/or touch
another man's penis in any way?

800
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:17,037
Really? Out of all the things you want to know,
this is what you want to ask most?

801
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,573
What kind of question's that?

802
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,707
Of course that's what
I want to know the most.

803
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,494
No. Penises
were not involved.

804
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,287
Were your boobs
and/or vagina?

805
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,627
No! It was...texts.

806
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,292
That's all it was.

807
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,677
Damn! I should never have
gone against my own advice.

808
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,089
I should always be the better-looking one
in the relationship.

809
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,007
I just sort of
hit an impasse on that.

810
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,767
Honestly! Gosh.
Dell, do you really think...

811
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,927
Who was it?

812
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:49,779
It was my...in-between ex, Jack.

813
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,282
Jack? The MTV exec?
Are you fucking serious?

814
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,364
I thought you hated MTV.

815
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,200
- Isn't he short?
-He's not tall.

816
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,286
Are you seriously defending him?
You can't call him short?

817
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:04,544
You have to go with "not tall"?
Jesus, you like him.

818
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,955
Why the fuck are you being
so sangfroid over this shit?

819
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:09,340
You're being way too easy
on yourself.

820
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,461
You should know
I'm standing in the middle

821
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,426
of a monsoon right now.

822
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:18,137
Well, so...
Maybe I should let you go, then?

823
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,472
Why? Because I'm standing
in the middle of a monsoon?

824
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,512
No, because you... Yes!

825
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,521
'Cause you're standing
in the middle of a monsoon.

826
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,607
Um...

827
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,069
Are you OK?
What are you staring at?

828
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,874
Oh! My thesis.

829
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:52,216
That reminds rne. I've been
keeping articles about you.

830
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:55,629
They said that your drug
led to major breakthroughs

831
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:58,014
in cancer treatment.

832
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,847
That's amazing, Dell.
Your mom especially must be proud.

833
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,099
- That's me and...
-Jack.

834
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:12,069
How long you guys
been engaged?

835
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,857
So... What are you
talking about?

836
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,526
Well, you boxed up a lot of
old kitchen appliances over there.

837
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,286
You've either declared a fatwa
on General Electric

838
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,946
or you're wedding-registering
the fuck

839
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:23,911
out of your friends
and family.

840
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,666
You've been fidgeting
with your ring finger nonstop.

841
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:27,998
You're also
giving me that look

842
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,128
like you're trying
to think of a lie real quick.

843
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:34,425
I might beat the shit
out of you.

844
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,879
Wedding's in a few weeks.

845
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,844
Question is, where's the ring?

846
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:44,352
- Getting sized.
-Huh.

847
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,104
Question number two -
why didn't you tell me?

848
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:50,107
I was gonna tell you, before you did
your whole annoying MacGyver thing.

849
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,769
Yeah, I don't think that's the reference
you're looking for.

850
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:54,858
- Does Jack even know I'm here?

851
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:57,615
- Trust me. He knows you're here.
-What does that mean?

852
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,743
- Why'd you scoff?
-What scoff? I didn't scoff.

853
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,699
You scoffed.

854
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:05,748
You guys fought
about me coming.

855
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,785
I'm actually kind of flattered.

856
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,420
Didn't know yours truly
could threaten

857
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,047
the evil prince
of the MTV generation.

858
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,128
First of all,
Jack's leaving MTV.

859
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:17,214
His article in 'Esquire'
was optioned by George Clooney.

860
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,378
Yeah, well, I won my fantasy
baseball league last year.

861
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,922
Let's not talk
about Jack, OK?

862
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,465
I'm happy
to not talk about Jack.

863
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,133
What's the smoking rule
in here?

864
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,394
Is he making a face?
ls that a...?

865
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,554
That's just how he looks.

866
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:34,819
So, l...l had a very vivid dream
the other night about us.

867
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:37,105
A vivid dream?

868
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:40,400
What was it about,
this vivid dream?

869
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,910
It was a dream
of memories,

870
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:45,822
conversations that we've had.

871
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,286
I saved your life.

872
00:47:48,449 --> 00:47:52,079
You owe the person
that saved you, don't you think?

873
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:55,839
You had a dream
that was really a series

874
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,966
of memories of conversations
we've had?

875
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,469
Yeah, don't hurt yourself.
It's not that complicated.

876
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,505
Well, 'cause to the brain,
there's no difference

877
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,514
between reality and dreams.

878
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,926
They were just memories of us
over the years.

879
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:11,765
What if I don't subscribe to
a culture of indentured servitude?

880
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,808
You can't unsubscribe.

881
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:17,399
It's a thing of nature.
It's here to stay.

882
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,359
But they weaved in and out
of each other

883
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:21,240
like those...
those M.C. Escher drawings,

884
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,901
so one second,
I'd be on the train

885
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,115
that time
that we got back together,

886
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,496
after our first break-up.

887
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:30,499
Another second,
I was on the phone in New York...

888
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:35,459
...the last time
we ever talked to each other.

889
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:39,087
But they...they blended together
like a...

890
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,627
Painting?

891
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,921
I saved your life.

892
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:46,182
If it weren't for me, you would
have been run over by that car.

893
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,684
You would have been splat,

894
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:51,847
just like my
timeless life painting thing.

895
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:55,483
And they were all real,

896
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,860
but there was one moment
in the dream that was...

897
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:03,529
Well, it was one we never had.
It was...it was the only one.

898
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:06,991
What was it about,
this made-up moment?

899
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:09,906
It's gonna sound weird -
it was...us talking,

900
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,949
after not having talked
for however long.

901
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:17,205
- Wait. I'm confused. It was...
-This moment. Yeah.

902
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,169
This moment
that we're having right now,

903
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,924
so me coming over,
seeing your apartment,

904
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,677
your life with Jack,
and reconnecting.

905
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:34,223
Oh, God, I feel sick.
I blame L.A. for this.

906
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,766
This is what happens when
you fall in love in Los Angeles.

907
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,775
Fuck.

908
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:41,062
So... What is this?

909
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,606
- Are you breaking up with me'?
-I don't want to, no.

910
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,321
But...you like
this Jack guy, right?

911
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,486
You realise Jack Tripper
was one of my favourite characters

912
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,120
in all of fiction?

913
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:51,656
You've forever ruined
his good name.

914
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,415
Shit. Can I... Oh, shit.

915
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,326
I can't even order
a Jack and Coke anymore.

916
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,541
A vodka soda. Vodka soda.

917
00:49:57,703 --> 00:50:00,502
- My life is ruined.
-OK.

918
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,792
We should just get off the phone, OK?
You're mad.

919
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,928
And any words we exchange now
are gonna be bleak at best.

920
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,054
You used to never want
to get off the phone.

921
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:10,967
I used to want to get off the phone.
I just used to not.

922
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,056
And now you can't wait
to get off the phone.

923
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:15,438
I don't know even know what
we're fighting about anymore.

924
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,974
If you want to yell about Jack,
fine, but I'm too tired

925
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,562
for another one
of your meta arguments.

926
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,648
There's no way I deserve
to be treated like this.

927
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:23,778
I thought you were supposed
to be my indentured servant.

928
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:25,906
- Whatever happened to that, huh?
-So...

929
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,942
What are you talking about
right now?

930
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,281
I'm talking about that
prescription-to-life thing.

931
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:33,448
Right, except it's
subscription to nature.

932
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,867
- Whatever.
-You've got this backwards, kid.

933
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,661
- I saved your life.
-But then I saved your life.

934
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,250
On the train. We ran into each together.
We got back together.

935
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,586
You mean when you stalked
and followed me onto the train?

936
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,218
You got off at Chico.
You weren't supposed to get off.

937
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,596
You were supposed to go to Portland,
but because of me,

938
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,428
you got off at Chico and weren't
on the train when it derailed.

939
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,638
- You could have died.
-No-one died, Dell.

940
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,554
- The point remains.
-No, that is not the same. OK?

941
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,848
You would absolutely have died
had I not saved you.

942
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,688
Plus, I saw that car coming.
I knew it was gonna hit you.

943
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:05,024
- And I knowingly saved you.
-Yeah, well...

944
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,110
That's starting to feel
like a minus, not a plus.

945
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:09,617
Be that as it may,
you didn't know you were saving me.

946
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,777
You were just trying
to get back in my pants.

947
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,038
No! lwas trying
to get you back.

948
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,994
Which just happens to include
getting in your pants.

949
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:19,035
So yours was a sinister doing.
Mine was pure altruism.

950
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:21,329
But I knowingly saved you too.

951
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,543
We just went over this,
pothead.

952
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,959
You were supposed to get off
at Portland to meet Jack,

953
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:27,718
but I knowingly
saved you from him.

954
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,889
Except I didn't, did I?

955
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,277
Fuck.

956
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,905
I should have told you I loved you more,
when we were together.

957
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,826
I mean...
I was also such a dick to you.

958
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,960
I just thought you'd find it endearing
for some reason,

959
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,919
like the way people feel about
Don Rickles or Mussolini.

960
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:08,209
It's not an excuse.
It's just...just a reason.

961
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,174
Anyway, I'm sorry, OK?

962
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:22,018
I need a drink, in a bad way.

963
00:52:22,181 --> 00:52:24,024
There's a bar car here,
and they sell drinks.

964
00:52:24,183 --> 00:52:26,527
- Let's go.
-Does that mean we have to...

965
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,403
We have to walk
in between the cars while...

966
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,155
I can't do that
while the train's moving.

967
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:32,112
- Oh, don't be such a pussy.
-Said the dick?

968
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,651
The world's at war right now,

969
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:35,569
so I think we should
take every little opportunity

970
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:37,113
to put ourselves in harm's way,

971
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,747
alleviate some of the guilt,
you know?

972
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:42,126
No, no. There's all the scary
noises that the train makes.

973
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,082
And...what if I fell?

974
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,791
I don't have the best relationship
with gravity.

975
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,422
Put your iPod on.
Play something calming.

976
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,083
That'll drown out the sound.

977
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,172
And I'll hold your hand
so you don't fall.

978
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,383
Come on.

979
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:57,387
Come on.

980
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,399
I won't let you go. I promise.

981
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:50,152
J' Tied to my bed

982
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:54,156
J' I was younger then

983
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:57,488
J' I had nothing to spend

984
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:03,454
J' But time on you

985
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,788
J' But it made me love

986
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,498
J' It made me love

987
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:15,341
J' It made me love more

988
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,827
J' Do what you said

989
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:44,707
J' The words she said left out

990
00:54:44,865 --> 00:54:47,994
J' Over unto the sky

991
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,835
J' Where I'll soon fly

992
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:57,345
J' And she took the time

993
00:54:57,503 --> 00:55:01,007
J' To believe in,
to believe in... J'

994
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:03,346
You ever tried asking someone,
"Where's my fucking money?"

995
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:07,139
- Have you ever done that?
-You mean, like, at random?

996
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,102
Or when I'm actually owed money?

997
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:10,732
- No, at random, obviously.
-Right.

998
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:12,689
I don't know
what I was thinking.

999
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,774
It's fun.
You should try it. Ask me.

1000
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:17,065
--Hm?

1001
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:19,984
Ask me. Ask me,
"Where's my fucking money?"

1002
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:26,331
- Where's my fucking money?
-Where's MY fucking money?

1003
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:29,790
Oh, no, motherfucker.
Where's my fucking money?

1004
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:33,047
If I don't get my fucking money
right fucking now...

1005
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:36,584
Where is my goddamn money,
you motherfucker?!

1006
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,626
If you...

1007
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:40,592
What the fuck?

1008
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:46,344
Jesus!

1009
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:49,309
That was really fun.

1010
00:55:54,852 --> 00:55:58,231
Wait. It's just that...
Well, say what you were gonna say.

1011
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:00,445
And then...after you say it,
maybe we should, like,

1012
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,201
not talk for a minute -
you know, let a whole minute pass by

1013
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,987
without saying something.

1014
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:08,202
Say what you were gonna say.
We can start right after that.

1015
00:56:10,659 --> 00:56:12,912
I'm really gonna
miss you tomorrow.

1016
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:48,539
So, wait - you're saying
you dreamt this conversation,

1017
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:51,291
a conversation that didn't
take place until now?

1018
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,043
I'm saying I dreamt
a bunch of conversations,

1019
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,999
including this one,
which led me to come here,

1020
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:59,838
because it made me think...
about how much I regretted...

1021
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,007
You regret meeting me, Dell?

1022
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:08,434
- No. Of course not.
-l'm glad we dated.

1023
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:09,969
I needed to date you.

1024
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:13,264
Before you, I only dated guys
that looked good on paper.

1025
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:15,603
Yeah.

1026
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:17,768
Wait, what?

1027
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:22,691
You were really, really smart,
but also...selfish, crass.

1028
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,029
Not always in
an entertaining way, mind you.

1029
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,911
You hated yourjob
and your life,

1030
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:30,698
and you were completely
comfortable being miserable.

1031
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,866
You're horrible on paper.

1032
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:35,286
And I loved you.

1033
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:38,088
And being with you
made me realise

1034
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:42,626
it doesn't have to look good on paper
to feel good.

1035
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,352
- What kind of sandwich...?
- PB&J.

1036
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:58,233
Of course.

1037
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,567
What's your favourite word?

1038
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,982
- 'Comet'.
- 'Comet'?

1039
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,695
Right.

1040
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:13,120
Not, like,
'proliferate', 'ensconce'?

1041
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,831
'Kerfuffle'? 'Serendipity?

1042
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:18,871
'Comet'? Like...

1043
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,593
'Comet'.

1044
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,254
Yeah. Exactly like that.

1045
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,640
What about
your least favourite word?

1046
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:34,144
Oh... I don't strongly dislike
any word, I don't think.

1047
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:36,555
I sort of have
a love-hate relationship

1048
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:38,269
with the word 'finger-fuck',

1049
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:39,809
but that's technically
two words,

1050
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:42,103
and I like each one
separately.

1051
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,318
Hm.

1052
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,489
So...do you ever wish
you could, like,

1053
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,701
control society
for a couple minutes?

1054
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:56,367
Like make them all hate MTV
or something?

1055
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,161
I don't think MTV is as important
as you think it is.

1056
00:59:01,413 --> 00:59:04,587
You're so wrong.
MTV is so manipulative.

1057
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,754
It's like a drug
that you get hooked on at age 12

1058
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:11,014
that you can't wake up from
until you're probably, like, 30,

1059
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:13,517
when you finally realise
how awful it really was.

1060
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:16,474
But by then, it's too late.
It's, like, won.

1061
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,434
You've watched
all their commercials

1062
00:59:18,597 --> 00:59:20,520
during their week sweep.

1063
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:24,232
I believe it's sweeps week.
Sweeps week.

1064
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:27,947
You don't deserve me.
I can tell.

1065
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,029
That's perfect.
I want someone I don't deserve.

1066
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:35,289
You think you've won me.

1067
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:38,872
I can't believe you think
you've won me already.

1068
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:40,832
Are you...are you kidding?

1069
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:43,247
You ditched a much prettier man
to stay with me.

1070
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,461
I've definitely won you.

1071
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:50,133
You are so wrong, my friend.

1072
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:12,443
Holy shit.

1073
01:00:13,485 --> 01:00:15,988
You are so easily amused.

1074
01:00:16,154 --> 01:00:17,952
Because of the boots, huh?

1075
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:20,117
Sarah's stupid idea.

1076
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:23,287
Louis L'Amour is her favourite novelist,
so here we are.

1077
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,541
You know, I just realised.
I don't even know why we're here.

1078
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,426
I don't even like Sarah. Fire?

1079
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:34,181
Just let me have this
and then we'll go.

1080
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,482
What are you doing?

1081
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:59,456
This feels like a dream.

1082
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:18,429
I love it
when you look out windows.

1083
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:26,104
Sir.

1084
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:28,439
Did you damage the bathroom
about 30 minutes ago?

1085
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,523
Well, I'm obviously
gonna tell you that I didn't.

1086
01:01:37,903 --> 01:01:39,780
- Sir?
-What?

1087
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:42,540
I'm gonna have to ask you
to get off at the next stop.

1088
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,043
Don't let me find you on here
after Chico.

1089
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,296
- OK. Sorry.
-You got me?

1090
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:49,456
Yes, sir. Thank you. Sorry.

1091
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,261
I don't even want to ask.

1092
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,343
Looks like our little tryst
is about to end.

1093
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:58,882
Get off at Chico with me.
Please.

1094
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,801
We can have
an hour- to two-hour talk.

1095
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,719
If you want, get you
another ticket to Portland.

1096
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:05,059
An hour- to two-hour talk?
That's a long time, Dell.

1097
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:08,146
Well, I'm not meeting anyone,
so...

1098
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:09,901
Wait, what?

1099
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:14,031
There's no...girl.

1100
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,734
So, what...what was this?

1101
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,869
Just another one of
your stupid mind games, Dell?

1102
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:23,202
Why did you lie'?
And what happened to your hand?

1103
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:26,414
You're always hiding things.
I'm sitting somewhere else.

1104
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,204
Listen. Wait. No, no.
Stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm sorry.

1105
01:02:29,371 --> 01:02:31,373
I lied because I thought
it'd make it easier, OK?

1106
01:02:31,539 --> 01:02:33,041
- Thought it'd make it easier?
-Yeah.

1107
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:35,210
You thought it'd make
what easier exactly?

1108
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:37,129
- Talking to you.
-Why would it make it easier?

1109
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,013
Because I don't think
you'd talk to me

1110
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,140
if you knew I was trying
to get you back.

1111
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,802
So, what was this?
ls this a plan to win me back?

1112
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:46,848
Yeah, it was. It was a whim
that turned into a plan.

1113
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:49,266
How did you even know
I was on this train?

1114
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,275
Because I f...l...l stalked you.

1115
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,281
You could have called, Dell.

1116
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,283
You haven't talked to me
in a long time.

1117
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,035
- I know.
-You have my phone number.

1118
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,288
You have my email.
But you haven't contacted me once.

1119
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,540
- Not once in months.
-Just... Look.

1120
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:08,168
I know a great public library
in Chico where we can talk.

1121
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:09,748
We can talk about
all of this.

1122
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:11,834
You want to go to
a public library to talk?

1123
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:13,749
- That seems counterintuitive.
-They have a talking area.

1124
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,168
You happen to know
of a public library in Chico

1125
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:17,711
with a talking area?

1126
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,595
Yeah.

1127
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:25,344
First, answer my question.
How come you never proposed?

1128
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,604
Come on, Kimberly.
You broke up with me.

1129
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,139
How come
you didn't fight for me?

1130
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:31,229
It felt like the end of days
when you left.

1131
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:33,564
I ate ramen for months.
I had a huge sodium imbalance.

1132
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,855
Barely got through it.
Didn't think I could do it again.

1133
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:37,739
Felt like my...fucking world
was gonna blow up.

1134
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:40,116
So me leaving you constitutes
your world blowing up?

1135
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:42,403
<i>- Yes. It does, actually.
- Next stop, Chico.</i>

1136
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:45,368
Listen. Come on.

1137
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:48,204
I want you to do this.

1138
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:57,175
Why wouldn't you
want this forever?

1139
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,837
I'd like for once
to understand

1140
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:03,348
why you wouldn't
want this always.

1141
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:09,514
'Cause 'always' is scary.
There's a finality to it.

1142
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:15,769
Just don't ever want you
to feel like a limitation.

1143
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:20,820
OK. Let me go
a different way with it.

1144
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:23,110
Why are girls so scared
of cockroaches, huh?

1145
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,653
It's 'cause you think
they'll hurt you,

1146
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,196
even though they can't,

1147
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:27,865
just like I'm afraid 'always'
will hurt me.

1148
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,624
- They're both irrational.
-False on so many fronts.

1149
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,456
Well, why?

1150
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,086
Girls are afraid of cockroaches

1151
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:35,212
because they're gross
and they carry disease,

1152
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,591
proven by the fact that they're
one of the biblical plagues.

1153
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:40,377
Also, they love to lay eggs
in your vagina.

1154
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,511
Secondly,
it's not irrational to think

1155
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:46,015
that commitment can hurt you,
'cause it can.

1156
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,936
Know that when you
steal a girl's 20s,

1157
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:00,731
it's dangerous business,
buster.

1158
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:09,323
You're officially on notice,
Mr Pink Lighter.

1159
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:12,830
Duly noted, Mrs Pink Lighter.

1160
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,211
No. You can't call rne that.

1161
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,418
You don't want to marry me,
remember?

1162
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,958
I didn't say that.

1163
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,093
Where's my phone?

1164
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:26,223
Where's my phone?
Where's my fucking phone?

1165
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:42,147
Hey, w-w-why don't I call it?

1166
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:44,486
Why are you acting like that?

1167
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:47,118
- Like what?
Uncomfortable.

1168
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:49,200
In the two years
we've known each other,

1169
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:50,784
I have rarely seen you
uncomfortable.

1170
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,699
L'm...l'm not.

1171
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:54,868
You are.

1172
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,877
You're hiding something
from me.

1173
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,209
Oh, God. You just got
too stoned, Kimberly.

1174
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:01,340
And I thought we were going
after your last cigarette.

1175
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,172
- What are you doing?
-What are you hiding?

1176
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,132
- You know something.
-There's no something.

1177
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:07,013
You just got too high.

1178
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:08,549
You best motherfucking believe
there's a something.

1179
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:10,183
There is
always a something, OK?

1180
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:12,264
This is not the first time
I have felt that.

1181
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:13,804
- Felt what?
-You.

1182
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,472
Saying something
like you've slipped.

1183
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,015
I didn't slip.

1184
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:18,980
Like a cartoon character
on a banana peel.

1185
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:21,065
You know what?
You're actually starting to freak me out.

1186
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,446
- There's nothing going on.
-lt's about time you're freaked.

1187
01:06:23,605 --> 01:06:25,778
OK, I hate always feeling like the freak
in this relationship.

1188
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,988
Why are you doing this?

1189
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:30,279
Because there's something
you're not telling me.

1190
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:32,698
OK, I know you, and I know
when you get uncomfortable.

1191
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:34,491
And it's so rare
that I have formed

1192
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,534
an acute discomfort detector
on you.

1193
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,203
Are you gonna tell me
what it is,

1194
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:41,293
or are you gonna force me to be late
to my own annoying friend's

1195
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:43,754
Louis L'Amour
goddamn Western-themed wedding?

1196
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:54,227
Kimberly, let's not do this.
This is paranoia.

1197
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:08,449
Hey.

1198
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:10,485
Kim.

1199
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,072
Look at me.

1200
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:17,038
Keep looking.

1201
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:26,676
You're right. You're right.

1202
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:28,632
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1203
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,478
In the dream, I told you
I wanted to be with you,

1204
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:39,935
you to leave Jack
and walk out the door with me.

1205
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:45,020
--Wow.

1206
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,942
Do you feel that?

1207
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:53,077
What?

1208
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:55,739
OK. Calm down.

1209
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,454
Maybe you just need some air.
Let's go up to the rooftop.

1210
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:02,337
So, what else happens
in this dream? Do I...

1211
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:05,795
Do I go with you,
all happily ever after and the like?

1212
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:08,631
Or do I slap you
and tell you, "Begone"?

1213
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:11,592
I don't know, actually.
We were looking at each other.

1214
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,756
And I went to kiss you,

1215
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,426
and before our lips touched,
I woke up.

1216
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:19,938
- What?

1217
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:25,477
Maybe I never saved you
that night we met.

1218
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:28,271
Maybe you did die
hit by that car

1219
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:31,442
and this...is just
some afterlife fantasy

1220
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:32,985
playing out in your head.

1221
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:36,451
- What?
- Something feels weird.

1222
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:41,869
Remember how you
used to love flipping the pillow over

1223
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,833
to feel the cool side?

1224
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:45,622
Yeah.

1225
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:50,088
That's what our relationship
felt like.

1226
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,549
Constant tossing and turning,

1227
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:54,589
looking for
that perfect balance.

1228
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:58,386
Sometimes it was there.
And other times...

1229
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:01,100
I know. I know.

1230
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:06,852
You always expected us to break up.
Why was that?

1231
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:10,022
Is that 'cause of your dumb
five-minutes-from-now rule?

1232
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:12,816
After we stopped talking,

1233
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,359
the five-minute rule
started shrinking.

1234
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:17,529
Went...went to four minutes,
then three...

1235
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,823
...then two, then one.

1236
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,458
Let's go up to the rooftop.

1237
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:25,040
Come on!

1238
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:28,715
I thought my unconscious
was trying to tell me something -

1239
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,046
you know, by dreaming that dream
a few nights ago,

1240
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:33,382
coming here
and talking to you,

1241
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:37,924
I might close the gap
that...that last minute.

1242
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,595
<i>Or...</i>

1243
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:44,685
Or none of this
is really happening.

1244
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:49,811
This could still be your dream.

1245
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:52,230
Dun-dun-dun!

1246
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:58,616
- Oh, crap!
-What? What happened?

1247
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:01,907
Fucking bird carcass
on my windshield.

1248
01:10:02,073 --> 01:10:05,327
What? OK. Slow down.
Tell me what's going on.

1249
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:07,666
I'm saying a fucking bird
just committed suicide

1250
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:09,706
on my windshield.

1251
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:12,751
What? In the middle
of our conversation?

1252
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,137
What does our conversation
have to do with anything?

1253
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:19,390
It must mean something.
It must mean that...that...that...

1254
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:21,768
Maybe the bird was commenting
on our situation.

1255
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:23,599
Commenting?

1256
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:26,355
- You think this is commentary?
-Definitely! I mean...

1257
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:29,893
Something - the universe,
cosmos, all that, via the bird -

1258
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,982
sent us a signal, yeah.

1259
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:34,113
OK.

1260
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:36,775
I want you to listen to me
very, very carefully, OK?

1261
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:38,989
OK. You're gonna be mean,
aren't you?

1262
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,745
On this already horrible call,

1263
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,655
you're gonna be mean
on top of it.

1264
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:45,371
You are very, very, very...

1265
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,752
You know what,
I can't even say 'very' enough.

1266
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,129
So just imagine an
infinite number of 'very's. OK?

1267
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:52,791
Well, I don't have
that kind of imagination.

1268
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:54,630
I can barely picture
odd-numbered things.

1269
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,760
Well, freaking try, OK?

1270
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,923
'Cause that number of 'very's
precedes sick, sick.

1271
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,966
S-I-C-K.

1272
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:04,386
Told you you were gonna be mean,
and condescending,

1273
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,600
as if I didn't already know
how to spell 'sick'.

1274
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:09,141
You are not being
a nice person right now!

1275
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:27,000
So...l'm at the gun range.

1276
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:31,003
This is a nightmare.

1277
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:33,164
Sartre was right.

1278
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:37,006
- Hell is other people.
- I should go.

1279
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:38,670
I've got my goggles on.

1280
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:40,804
You did this on purpose,
didn't you?

1281
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:43,557
You wanted me to find out
when I was 3,000 miles away.

1282
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,764
You were telegraphing
all the signs

1283
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:47,429
like you were
Samuel-fucking-Morse.

1284
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:49,393
You wanted me to know.

1285
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:51,228
That's the part
that hurts the most.

1286
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,108
Why would I want that?

1287
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,816
'Cause maybe your feelings for him
are real.

1288
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:01,784
How long
has it been going on?

1289
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,706
- About a month.
-A month?! Oh, shit.

1290
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:09,913
I'm so sorry for interrupting
the honeymoon period.

1291
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:12,124
Hear those are the best parts
of a relationship.

1292
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:15,039
I'm gonna go, OK?
I've got my goggles on.

1293
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:16,753
Yes, I fucking heard you!

1294
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:18,418
Enough with the goggles already!
Jesus Christ!

1295
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,052
How are you gonna
get off the phone

1296
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:21,929
and just go about your day
after this, huh?

1297
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:23,681
'Cause I don't think
all of our conversations

1298
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,513
need to necessarily
feel good!

1299
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:27,302
They should feel bad, then?

1300
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:29,345
They should be whatever
the conversation should...

1301
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:32,061
I don't know! Why are you
analysing this so much?

1302
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:33,850
Oh, I'm not analysing it yet.

1303
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:35,859
I'm just giving you
my initial gut reaction.

1304
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:39,568
Can I please get off the phone with you
and not feel like shit?

1305
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:41,107
You hurt me!

1306
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:48,281
You really hurt me this time,
Kimberly.

1307
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:58,799
I want to break up with you.

1308
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,835
I don't love you.

1309
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:04,427
No. That's not
what you want to say.

1310
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,927
That is what I want to say,
actually.

1311
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:11,721
I don't...
I don't love you, Kimberly.

1312
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:14,812
Honestly, I don't know
if I ever really did.

1313
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:17,686
You definitely didn't.

1314
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:19,695
If you're capable
of making choices

1315
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:21,777
that knowingly hurts the other person,
that's not love.

1316
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:26,820
OK. You're mad.
You're mad. You...

1317
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:29,955
How can you say that?

1318
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:32,037
Reality is I could have met
any number of girls

1319
01:13:32,199 --> 01:13:33,872
to be with
for a few years.

1320
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:38,832
That was your lie. Alright?

1321
01:13:38,998 --> 01:13:42,002
Texting Jack behind my back.
It came when I least expected it.

1322
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:44,512
And I fell for it
hook, line and sinker.

1323
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:48,049
And it fucking hurts.
That was your lie.

1324
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:50,718
- Bravo.
-OK! Fine.

1325
01:13:50,885 --> 01:13:53,138
You want to hurt me?
You want to be right? Fine.

1326
01:13:53,304 --> 01:13:54,726
Go ahead. Be right.

1327
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:56,732
All I ever wanted
was the truth.

1328
01:13:56,891 --> 01:13:58,768
No. No.
You want to be right.

1329
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:01,438
Truth is not what you're after,
because if you wanted the truth,

1330
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:03,902
then you would have to accept
the fact that I do...

1331
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:20,627
Who is this?

1332
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,417
I'm sorry.
ls this Dell?

1333
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:24,961
- Who's this?
-Yes. Hi. This is Nancy.

1334
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,050
I'm your mother's nurse.

1335
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,591
- We met a few times.
-Yeah.

1336
01:14:29,757 --> 01:14:32,476
I'm really sorry
to have to tell you this.

1337
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,563
Your mother passed away.

1338
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:40,643
What? It's impossible.
She's been OK for years now.

1339
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:42,858
Her cancer's been in remission.

1340
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,897
She had a heart attack.

1341
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:46,987
Heart attack?

1342
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,151
Why?

1343
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:52,037
Sometimes these things
just happen.

1344
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,414
This feels strange.

1345
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:05,551
Not what I expected my train ride
to feel like at all.

1346
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:11,424
What were you expecting?

1347
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:15,895
I was expecting to read
that short story.

1348
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:20,354
The...the Roald Dahl one?
You...you already read it.

1349
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:23,811
You know the ending.

1350
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:28,574
Sometimes it's not about
knowing the ending.

1351
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:40,127
It can't be the same
like it was last time.

1352
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:42,880
It has to be different or we'll
wind up right where we started.

1353
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:44,507
I know. I know.

1354
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:47,384
I promise you I'll change.

1355
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:50,046
I promise, OK?

1356
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:57,595
You know I'm falling out of love
with you, right?

1357
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:00,185
Just shut up for a second,
please.

1358
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:04,519
What do you want to
tell me, Dell?

1359
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:06,403
Kimberly...

1360
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:11,367
I used to find it
really annoying

1361
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:13,152
that you said 'so'
all the time.

1362
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:15,572
Bugged the shit out of me.

1363
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,495
And l...l love it.

1364
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,251
I love it now.

1365
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,629
After we have sex
and you shrug your shoulders

1366
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:25,506
and you say,
"l'm here all week,"

1367
01:16:25,664 --> 01:16:27,632
love that.

1368
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:29,544
I love that
a single strand of your hair

1369
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:31,587
can fall so perfectly
to the side

1370
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:33,472
and you don't even know.

1371
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:37,681
I love the little blue veins
behind your eyes.

1372
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,471
--I love your eyes.

1373
01:16:40,638 --> 01:16:43,016
Knowing you goes down
as easily the best thing

1374
01:16:43,182 --> 01:16:44,855
that's ever happened to me.

1375
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:46,735
Easily.

1376
01:16:46,894 --> 01:16:50,524
If I were a restaurant,
you'd be my special,

1377
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:52,066
but nobody could order you,

1378
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:53,780
'cause I'd just want you
to be mine,

1379
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:55,786
just all mine.

1380
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:58,915
Not in, like,
a biblical slavery-owning sense

1381
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:03,169
or a pimp-prostitute dynamic of
"You be mine, bitch,"

1382
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:07,753
but...butjust in that...
you're my love.

1383
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:11,135
- You're my love.

1384
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,921
But my favourite thing of all...

1385
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:17,554
...l like you
'cause you like me.

1386
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:21,979
I don't know -
I think that says a lot

1387
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:24,266
about how great you are
as a person.

1388
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:34,574
So, um...

1389
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:39,030
Dell.

1390
01:17:45,578 --> 01:17:47,501
Believe me.

1391
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:50,382
Believe me when I say...

1392
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:53,549
...you almost had me.

1393
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:25,117
Isn't it weird to imagine
that one day,

1394
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:27,378
this'll all be old to us?

1395
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:33,918
This walk, us meeting.

1396
01:18:34,084 --> 01:18:36,553
Just be an old memory.

1397
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:40,515
This sounds...

1398
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,849
...sad.

1399
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:11,084
Hey. I gotta...l gotta ask you
a really big question.

1400
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:14,501
I don't know if you can handle it
since it...it's really big.

1401
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:19,714
What?

1402
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:29,140
- Forget it. It's stupid.
-What?

1403
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:31,650
Forget it. Stupid joke.
You can probably even figure it by now.

1404
01:19:31,809 --> 01:19:33,982
- Why would I know the joke?
-Because I've already said it.

1405
01:19:34,144 --> 01:19:35,646
- When?
-Earlier in the conversation.

1406
01:19:35,813 --> 01:19:38,066
When? Hey. Come on.
I'm so confused.

1407
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:39,905
Sometimes I want to
stop people in the streets.

1408
01:19:40,067 --> 01:19:41,614
- Who?
-Anybody, all walks of life.

1409
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:43,700
On the way to work,
to the gym, to school.

1410
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,535
- Grab them, like you right now.
-Right now?

1411
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:47,166
Right now -
look right into their eyes

1412
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:49,918
and I want to ask them
one simple question.

1413
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:54,840
"Where's my fucking money?"

1414
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:19,903
I think I'm gonna
fall in love with you too.

1415
01:20:20,065 --> 01:20:22,284
- Are you crying?
-Shut up.

1416
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,219
There's still my theory,

1417
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:52,390
that this is just...
part of that strange dream.

1418
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:56,277
And so...even if we do kiss,

1419
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:58,858
you'll just wake up
and it'll all be over.

1420
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:03,696
- This can't be a dream.
- What if it is?

1421
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:14,874
What are you doing?

1422
01:21:15,037 --> 01:21:16,880
Something's wrong.

1423
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,462
I know it, Kimberly.
I know you.

1424
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,923
You have circles
under your eyes.

1425
01:21:22,086 --> 01:21:24,384
You were the type of girl
that could sleep through wars.

1426
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,890
In spite that, you're still
looking so beautiful -

1427
01:21:27,049 --> 01:21:28,676
more beautiful than ever,
in fact.

1428
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:30,219
It's usually a sign

1429
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:32,559
you want to remind the world
that you're a sexual being,

1430
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:34,223
'cause your man's
not picking up the signal.

1431
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:36,939
You've checked out of this relationship,
haven't you?

1432
01:21:37,101 --> 01:21:38,819
You're not happy.

1433
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:40,854
Also, you're listening
to Roxette,

1434
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:42,944
and I know that means
the beginning of the end.

1435
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:45,280
And let's get real for a second
about the ring, alright?

1436
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:46,819
You're not having it sized.

1437
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:48,362
I'm sure you had your ring size

1438
01:21:48,529 --> 01:21:49,906
burned into Jack's memory years ago.

1439
01:21:50,072 --> 01:21:51,915
Fuck, I still remember it.
4.5.

1440
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:54,668
You don't wear the ring
'cause you didn't want me to see it.

1441
01:21:54,827 --> 01:21:57,751
Don't marry him, OK?
I want you back.

1442
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,507
And I know you want me back too.
That's why I'm here.

1443
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:03,135
That's what you've been wanting
to say to me this whole time.

1444
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:05,045
- Dell?
-What?

1445
01:22:08,841 --> 01:22:10,388
I'm pregnant.

1446
01:22:13,846 --> 01:22:15,314
What?

1447
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:17,349
The morning sickness
has been keeping me up.

1448
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:20,395
I just really love Roxette.

1449
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:25,733
And I dress this way not to announce
to the world anything.

1450
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:29,620
It was you.
I wanted to look good for you.

1451
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,203
'Cause no matter
how bad our relationship got,

1452
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:36,164
I wanted to say thank you from
the bottom of my heart for it.

1453
01:22:36,326 --> 01:22:39,205
Because I needed it.

1454
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:43,675
I needed you in this life.

1455
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:47,717
That's what I wanted to say.

1456
01:22:52,259 --> 01:22:55,763
I gotta...l gotta sit down.

1457
01:23:04,855 --> 01:23:06,732
I'm sorry.

1458
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:11,153
I'm not leaving Jack.

1459
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:14,073
I love him.

1460
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:22,210
Wow. You're pregnant.

1461
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:26,634
I didn't see that coming.

1462
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:30,093
Do you know what it is yet?

1463
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:31,848
Not yet.

1464
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:34,681
Hoping it's a girl.

1465
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,854
Uh...l almost proposed to you,
you know.

1466
01:23:48,482 --> 01:23:50,735
When we were
in that hotel room in Paris.

1467
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:54,371
I even picked out the ring.
I had it with me.

1468
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,077
I was about to
give it to you.

1469
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,742
I took it, and...

1470
01:23:57,908 --> 01:24:00,206
I flushed it down the toilet.

1471
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:03,248
I keep replaying that moment

1472
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:04,790
over and over again
in my head.

1473
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,675
L...

1474
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:11,300
Why are you crying?

1475
01:24:14,841 --> 01:24:17,435
I'm just happy to see you.

1476
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:21,060
Ancl it's such a beautiful night.

1477
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:29,656
I feel like
I'm in the wrong world.

1478
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:32,867
'Cause I don't...
I don't belong in a world

1479
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:35,154
where we don't end up together,
I don't.

1480
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,415
There are parallel universes out there
where this didn't happen.

1481
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:41,202
Where I was with you
and you were with me.

1482
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:42,745
And whatever universe that is,

1483
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,834
that's the one
that my heart lives in.

1484
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,173
I wanted so badly
to go back into that dream

1485
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:51,712
I had the other night.

1486
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:56,975
L...tried so hard
to go back to sleep.

1487
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:05,601
You know, I never thought
love was real. I didn't.

1488
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:08,771
And now I think life isn't real
without it.

1489
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:12,566
And that sounds like
a really bad greeting card.

1490
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:14,280
Don't.

1491
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,161
Don't make it a joke.

1492
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,618
Truth?

1493
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:26,038
I think you always
believed in love.

1494
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:28,832
This is so stupid.

1495
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:32,003
So irrational.

1496
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:34,342
Why am I so hell-bent
on getting you back?

1497
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:36,506
You fucking hate Pixar movies,
for crying out loud.

1498
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:38,471
You still have an AOL account.

1499
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:40,853
I don't want to be with
a person like that.

1500
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:47,438
Why does it feel so impossible
to let you go?

1501
01:25:51,605 --> 01:25:53,653
It's an addiction, you know?
That's all it is.

1502
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:56,739
It's a biochemical addiction.
It's so stupid.

1503
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:58,575
If you think about it,

1504
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:00,205
relationships
are all totally narcissistic,

1505
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:02,082
'cause basically,
you're just looking for someone

1506
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,163
who will love you <i>as</i> much
as you love yourself.

1507
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:05,703
- That's all it is.
-No, it's not!

1508
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:07,416
- Yes, it is.
-No, it's not.

1509
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:13,961
No, it's not.

1510
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:18,473
I don't know anything anymore.

1511
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:22,052
But I know I do love you.

1512
01:26:29,476 --> 01:26:32,696
- Dell?
-Just...give me a minute, OK?

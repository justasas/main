1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,260
<i> Cultural assets and individuals in this
program have been altered fictionally.</i>

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,340
<i> They have no real-life
associations with this drama.</i>

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,170
Joohyun, can you
look through these for me?

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,290
You're leaving now?

5
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:26,210
You begged to be on the guest list
and you're going to be tardy?

6
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,040
Bad news, bad news.
The “Bihaedangjib.”

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,170
Congressman Lee is here
to take it away.

8
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:35,080
What are you talking about?
How can he take it away?

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,250
He's claiming a good faith purchase.
A good faith purchase.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,130
So what exactly
is a good faith purchase?

11
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,320
And you call yourself
a CHA employee?

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,160
For items bought without prior knowledge of it being a stolen item...

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,270
the sale is considered valid.

14
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:56,410
But why is he allowed to take it?
He didn't even report it stolen.

15
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,260
Congressman, please
reconsider what you're doing.

16
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,220
Let's go.

17
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,300
Yes, sir.

18
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,050
Chief. Is he really taking it?

19
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,050
Please hold on.

20
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:27,390
Please give back the “Bihaedangjib.”
You can't take it.

21
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,320
What did you say?

22
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,370
You don't deserve to take it back.

23
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,280
What in the world are you saying?

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,150
It was mine in the first place,
so who are you to tell what I deserve?

25
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:41,420
You bought it knowing
it was an illegal book.

26
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,460
Isn't that the reason you didn't
report it when it was stolen?

27
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,080
What? How dare you,
you impudent woman!

28
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,110
Sir, please just leave.

29
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:56,120
Let go.
Do you know who I am?

30
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,330
Of course I do.
You're Congressman Junpil Lee.

31
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:05,490
As a congressman chosen by the people, do you realize what you're doing?

32
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,440
Enough of your cheek,
and go mind your own business.

33
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,400
Of all the bad luck,
I have people like you attacking me.

34
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,450
If you step out of line one more time,
I won't just let it go. Understand?

35
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,300
And you call yourself
a congressman?

36
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,110
What did you say?

37
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,000
You should be embarrassed.
You should be ashamed.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,480
You little...
I won't stand here and take this!

39
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:36,100
Congressman Lee,
I suggest you leave quietly.

40
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,110
How dare you!

41
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:43,460
Your conscience isn't clear either. We'll let you go, so take good care of the book.

42
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:46,180
Chief Oh.

43
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:50,250
I'll remember this.

44
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,470
I'll take care to remember
today's events as well.

45
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,470
This isn't right, Chief.
This isn't why we found the book.

46
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,260
I understand how you feel.

47
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,310
But what can we do?
You know our hands are tied.

48
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,350
No. I don't know.
I don't know any of that, Chief.

49
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,190
He can't do this, Chief.

50
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,240
Chohee.

51
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,220
I'm sorry, sir.

52
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,420
<i> If it's a person
you have to forget...</i>

53
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,240
Wait, why is this song
stuck in my head? Jeez...

54
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,050
Chohee!
Hey, Chohee!

55
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,350
Did he really take it away?

56
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,290
The “Bihaedangjib”...

57
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,190
Bumsang, bad news,
major bad news!

58
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,260
Joohyun, what happened?

59
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,290
Congressman Lee came by and
took the “Bihaedangjib” with him.

60
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,260
What?

61
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,430
What are we going to do? You went through so much trouble to get it.

62
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,380
What about Chohee?

63
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,030
What? I'm not sure.

64
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,450
I heard she went against Congressman Lee, but I'm not sure where she is.

65
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,280
Help me find the “Bihaedangjib.”

66
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,000
I found Mr. Kim for you. And the “Bihaedangjib.” And I saved your life.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,030
How are you gonna
repay me for all this?

68
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:04,220
It'll take your entire life...

69
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,330
Why are you crying?

70
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:50,370
You didn't do anything wrong,
so stop being a fool.

71
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,420
It's none of your business.
Butt out!

72
00:05:54,140 --> 00:06:02,180
I'm going to get it back.
No matter what, I'll get it back.

73
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,050
How are you going to do that?
What's your plan?

74
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:08,020
Gonna steal it, like those scum?

75
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,050
Yeah. Whatever it takes,
I'll get it back.

76
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,230
Stop it already! Just stop!

77
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:28,220
You already did enough, so stop it, okay? It can't be helped, so just give up.

78
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,010
Bumsang, you don't
understand how I feel.

79
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:40,050
You don't know why I'm acting like this,
and what that book means to me.

80
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,320
You'll never understand.

81
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,260
I do, I understand!

82
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,260
Your father is “General Shovel.”

83
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,460
Taesoo Heo.

84
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:14,200
How do you know that?

85
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,410
I understand that you want to return
the items he stole to their rightful places.

86
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:26,090
But if I were your father,
I wouldn't want you living like this.

87
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:31,170
That was your father's life,
and your life is your own.

88
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,440
You did the best you could.

89
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:09,380
Does he think he's a untouchable?
He dares to claim a good faith purchase!

90
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:17,180
How dare they rip the book into two like mere tissue? It was so hard finding it.

91
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:23,180
We can't let him get away with this, for the sake of the country and our future.

92
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:29,460
What region voted that bastard into office? I'll set them on fire, I will!

93
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,270
He was elected by
proportional representation.

94
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,050
What...

95
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,350
a total bastard.

96
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:38,180
We should be grateful
he's keeping it safe in the country.

97
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,120
At least he didn't take it abroad.

98
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,310
But this is just too much.
I've lost all motivation to work.

99
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,180
This isn't the first time
this happened, so let it go.

100
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,420
Chief, are you leaving?

101
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,440
Yeah, don't drink too much
and go home early.

102
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,060
Yes, sir. Goodbye!

103
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,420
Darnit...

104
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,240
Chief! Will you be okay?
You drank a lot.

105
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,040
I must be getting old.
I'm not even angry.

106
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,060
I know that you're
the most upset out of all of us.

107
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:25,160
No, that would be Chohee.

108
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,300
She's probably very depressed.

109
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,340
You seem to take a special interest
in Chohee and her matters.

110
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,050
I told you.
I have a bit of a debt.

111
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,140
Go on in.

112
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:11,010
Sangho, go get some water.

113
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,160
Get it yourself.

114
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,490
Punk, I'm your senior...
Ow, my head.

115
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,090
Ugh, I drank way too much.
Ow, my head is spinning.

116
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:29,030
I really hate the defeatist
attitude in this office!

117
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:38,190
While you were drinking and whining last night, I made an important decision.

118
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,250
A decision?

119
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,200
I will have my revenge against Congressman Lee.

120
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,220
Revenge?

121
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:56,010
For the sake of the lost bonus,
the lost extra vacation time...

122
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:01,030
and Bumsang's trampled honor.

123
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:05,330
I absolutely must do something.
I will avenge everyone.

124
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,170
- Joohyun.
- What?

125
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,350
Your necklce is beautiful.

126
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,320
So is the bracelet.

127
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:21,200
You guys have good taste.

128
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,070
This and this,
they're part of a set.

129
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:28,160
Oh my, I don't have
time to waste time here.

130
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,060
I have to get the investigations team's
consent. Then, I'll be on my way...

131
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,090
A set, she says.

132
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:43,300
The bigger problem is that
we're part of a set with her.

133
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,200
General Shovel?
He went missing seven years ago.

134
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:00,120
Some say he stowed away to China or that he was buried alive while digging.

135
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,310
Everyone has his own opinion.
But he's most likely dead and gone.

136
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,460
Bumsang!

137
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,160
Hey, Joohyun.

138
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:17,010
Are you okay? I was so upset that
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

139
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,470
You couldn't?
By the way, is Chohee in yet?

140
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:22,350
Ah, Chohee...

141
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:33,060
Wait, why do you ask?

142
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,300
What?

143
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:41,100
Why do you keep asking about her,
both yesterday and today?

144
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,380
Did I?

145
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,290
By any chance...

146
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,240
No, no.

147
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:57,390
She's in charge of the “Bihaedangjib” case. I'm just worried as a colleague.

148
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,340
A colleague?

149
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,110
That's it, right?

150
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,390
I forgot about your strong sense
of camaraderie and philanthropy.

151
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,480
Chohee took a leave
of absence today.

152
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,420
A leave of absence?

153
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,020
Yes.

154
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:20,120
She's a bit disloyal for taking time off while everyone's under so much duress.

155
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,050
But what can you do?

156
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,020
Wow, wow!

157
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,390
Sis, what's all this?
Is today a special day?

158
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:38,350
No, it's not. I just woke up early and decided to do a little cooking. Try it.

159
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:43,260
You're acting strangely.
Did something happen?

160
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,360
Nothing happened.

161
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,030
Then what's up?

162
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:53,000
You take a day off though you usually never do, and then you cook a feast.

163
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,330
You don't want to eat?
You want me to clear the table?

164
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:58,300
No, who said
I didn't want to eat?

165
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:01,150
Thank you for the meal.

166
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,370
Is it good?

167
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:13,440
By the way, Sis, did the ceremony for
the “Bihaedangjib” go well yesterday?

168
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:19,100
Yeah, of course it went well.

169
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:24,230
Then it'll be exhibited at the museum soon? I'm going to go see it then.

170
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,230
Hey, didn't you say you had
a morning class? Hurry up and eat.

171
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,240
I'm so full.

172
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,130
Who could it be?

173
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,170
Who is it?

174
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,490
Bumsang!

175
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,260
As expected you live in squalor.

176
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,290
Hey, what brings you here?

177
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:28,030
You think you have the time
to take a day off and bum around?

178
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,360
What?

179
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,150
A big case happens and you're
stuffed up in your house. C'mon, hurry!

180
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,460
What case?

181
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,030
Ah, you talk too much.
Hurry up and come out.

182
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,380
Hey, hey.

183
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,350
Come on out first.

184
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,050
Goodness!

185
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,220
Tell me what case it is!

186
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,040
Gosh, you're noisy.
Just come with me.

187
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,490
Hey, Bumsang!

188
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,110
Jeez, pipe down, will you?
Get in the car.

189
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,150
Get it, come on.

190
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,440
- You...
- Get in already.

191
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,330
- You're really not going to tell...
- Quiet, please.

192
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Hey!

193
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,490
I'm not in the mood for your jokes today. Why did you bring me here?

194
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,340
To get some fresh air.

195
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,320
What?

196
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,280
What good is being stuffed up in the house? It's better to get a little sun.

197
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,150
Well, I never...

198
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:47,160
Hey, I brought you here for some fresh air, so don't get any other ideas.

199
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:01,340
Huh? Chief Kang!

200
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,440
Oh, hey!

201
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,170
What brings you here?

202
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,200
I heard Chohee took a leave of absence, but I couldn't get in contact with her.

203
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,410
That's strange. She's not home?

204
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,210
She went out without
even clearing the table?

205
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,420
She left her phone, too.

206
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,100
This is so strange. Sis!

207
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:41,230
Man, she's really
acting strangely today.

208
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,290
She was really upset, wasn't she?

209
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,060
Excuse me?

210
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,180
She would be.
I knew she'd be upset.

211
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:55,170
Did something happen to my sister?

212
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,120
What is it?

213
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:06,020
Your sister went through a lot to find
something called the “Bihaedangjib”...

214
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,000
but someone took it away, claiming
it to be a good faith purchase.

215
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,190
She must be going through a hard time, both yesterday and today.

216
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,280
So that's what happened.
That's why she was acting strangely.

217
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,400
Have you been well, sir?

218
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,100
Thanks to you.

219
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,150
There are a lot
of priests here today.

220
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,250
Sir, I'll be right back.

221
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,310
<i> World Peace. I hope
everyone's wishes come true.</i>

222
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:47,390
<i> Please help me hit the jackpot.</i>

223
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,000
<i> Daddy, please stay healthy...</i>

224
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,160
<i> Daddy, please stay healthy...</i>

225
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,440
Did you say this was
the Bomun Shrine? It's a great place.

226
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,020
Do you come here often?

227
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,320
Once in a while.
When I've got a lot on my mind.

228
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:29,140
Since when did you know
about my father?

229
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,000
Ah, remember the day
you wore that rented black dress?

230
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,450
The day of the party?

231
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,230
No wonder. I was curious as to
why you decided to show up.

232
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,380
Hey, Chohee?

233
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,320
Yeah?

234
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:47,120
Aren't you curious
as to why I brought you here?

235
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,070
I guess.

236
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:54,290
Look over there. I brought you here
for some extreme training.

237
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:59,260
You want me to climb those stairs? What's at the top?

238
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,210
Buddha.

239
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,160
A very benevolent
looking Buddha is there.

240
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,100
He'll grant you one wish
for climbing the stairs.

241
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,240
What's your wish?

242
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,120
A wish?

243
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,370
I don't know.
I don't have any.

244
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,180
Everyone has at least one wish.

245
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,010
Did you ever go up there?

246
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,240
Of course.

247
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,170
Did your wish come true?

248
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,250
No. He apparently
discriminates against people.

249
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,330
Maybe because I'm Catholic?

250
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,350
What was your wish?

251
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:41,230
My wish?

252
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,250
My wish was...

253
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,030
The unification of the Koreas.

254
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,220
Uh huh...

255
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,210
If you choose to ascend the stairs, I will contribute a bottle of water to the cause.

256
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:03,210
Here. I must go have a meaningful
talk with with the head priest.

257
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,210
Oh, and when you reach the top,
you'll see the surprise I prepared for you.

258
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,390
Look forward to it. It's big.
You know how generous I am.

259
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,420
You need to go greet your parents.

260
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,040
Yes.

261
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,020
Let's go.

262
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:19,450
I understand that you want to return
the items he stole to their rightful places.

263
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:24,470
But if I were your father,
I wouldn't want you living like this.

264
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,210
Don't look for Dad anymore.

265
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:37,260
I know you joined the regulations team to find your father, but stop that now.

266
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:42,010
No news from him in seven years means he's no longer a man of this world.

267
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,430
- Chohee.
- What is all this?

268
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:50,120
Give them back.
Give them back to their owners!

269
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:55,080
Chohee, this is
the last time. Really.

270
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,360
So forgive me
just this once, okay?

271
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,450
You always say that it's the last time. You always want me to forgive you.

272
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:04,440
I won't forgive you. Go plead
forgiveness to my dead mother.

273
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,210
And put everything you stole back in their rightful places. Take it all back!

274
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:13,420
Or I'll never see your face again.
Never, I tell you!

275
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:22,460
You think you'll find traces of your father while looking for the “Bihaedangjib?”

276
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,410
Is that why you're trying to find it?

277
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,300
You're barking up
the wrong tree, Uncle.

278
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:35,390
I don't want to find him at all.
I don't care if he's dead or alive.

279
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:45,380
Daddy, don't leave!
Daddy, don't leave. Daddy!

280
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,290
Chohee, don't worry.
I'll come back home.

281
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:57,230
I promise to come back.

282
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,170
Daddy, don't leave.

283
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,200
‘I have a wish that
I cannot speak aloud to anyone.'

284
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,450
‘It's okay if he never
comes back to see us.'

285
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:51,440
‘Please, just let him be alive.'

286
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,310
What? Congressman Lee
took back the “Bihaedangjib?”

287
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,150
Those CHA jerks must
be pissed out of their minds.

288
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,400
I can practically hear
their unhappy cries from here.

289
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,330
Ah, sir, didn't you say that Bumsang Kim's leg was snapped into two?

290
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:25,290
I did.

291
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:31,450
That's strange. He was on TV yesterday and he was walking around just fine.

292
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,080
What?

293
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,020
What happened?

294
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,300
See, the thing is...

295
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,000
That Bumsang Kim is
one hell of a lucky guy.

296
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:52,310
I was about to really give it to him
when that Chohee Heo appeared.

297
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:55,420
So I gave him a double
nosebleed, like bam!

298
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,340
Why did I expect
any better from you?

299
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:07,180
Aw, man. How can I have my revenge
on Bumsang Kim and Chohee Heo?

300
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:12,250
If I ever run into them again,
I'll make mashed potatoes out of them.

301
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:19,060
By the way, Dongpal, did you
prepare what I asked for?

302
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:24,110
Of course. This is me you're talking to.
Dongpal Kim does things right.

303
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:33,390
I'm so sorry, sir.
Money doesn't exactly grow on trees...

304
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,410
I know, I know.

305
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:45,050
I won't forget this.
I won't forget your loyalty.

306
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,190
Yonggu.

307
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,220
Yes, sir?

308
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,270
Let's go.

309
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:01,140
Sir, are you leaving?

310
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:07,350
Sir, please take care.
Goodbye.

311
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,190
You got that much money to spare?
How dare you use that money?

312
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:20,130
It's bad enough I have to pick up
after your sorry butt at my age...

313
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,280
but now I have to help
fund a thief's escape?

314
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,380
Who are you calling a thief?
Do you have a death wish?

315
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:31,300
This is important business. I'm
working on behalf of the entire nation!

316
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,230
You want a medal?

317
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,140
How dare you
call my boss a thief?

318
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:40,370
I'm not going to be home today.
Lock up well, all right?

319
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,190
What?
You want to have revenge?

320
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,100
I can't just stand by
and do nothing.

321
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,340
If we take this opportunity to teach
Congressman Lee a lesson...

322
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,380
it'll be the perfect opportunity to warn
thieves against cultural asset thefts...

323
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,290
as well as stop this
good faith purchase nonsense.

324
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,330
So how do you plan on
going about this revenge?

325
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:04,470
I did some research on some incidents
Congressman Lee was involved in.

326
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,060
The Daegu
hostess bar case of 1999.

327
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,140
The Haeundae Japanese
restaurant lobby case of 2002.

328
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:18,470
The casino rebate case of 2004
and the Landa Kim case of 2007.

329
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:24,030
Do you know what's the
common factor of these cases?

330
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:29,300
In the heart of this decadent power
was a beautiful woman.

331
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:36,250
So the strategy of this plan
is the badger game.

332
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,350
The badger game?

333
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:44,080
So in other words, you will use your beauty to approach Congressman Lee.

334
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,340
Then you'll exact
your revenge somehow, right?

335
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,430
Precisely.

336
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:56,180
Then rather than a traditional Korean dress, you should prepare a gown.

337
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:01,300
I already did. This time it's
an original prêt-a-porter piece!

338
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,180
Pret...a-potty?

339
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,390
You don't know
what prêt-a-porter is?

340
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,060
Anyway, Chief, I'm ready to
dedicate everything to this mission.

341
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,310
Joohyun.

342
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,340
Do you think that plan
makes any sense at all?

343
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,230
Chief...

344
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,470
Stop wasting our time
and go back to your office! Now!

345
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:28,310
Why are you so angry?
You startled me. What did I do?

346
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:35,300
Hello, this is the investigations team. What? You saw Mr. Kim?

347
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,190
We're almost there.

348
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,400
Chief, please okay my plan.

349
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,240
Please!

350
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:50,360
Joohyun, stop following us
around and leave already.

351
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:57,030
If this is about my safety,
Bumsang will save me, so don't worry.

352
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:01,060
Please, let's just try.
Let's have our revenge, okay?

353
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,260
C'mon, Chief!

354
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,300
When did Mr. Kim come?

355
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,210
About an hour ago.

356
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:14,310
I wasn't going to say anything for my husband's sake, but he went too far.

357
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:19,010
Did he mention things like where he was going or whom he was going to meet?

358
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,440
No, I don't think
I heard anything like that.

359
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,440
What did he say?

360
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:27,210
He said he was gonna make
mashed potatoes out of someone.

361
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,040
Mashed potatoes?

362
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:37,060
It was someone Kim, I think?
The name ended with “Sang.”

363
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:40,090
Bumsang Kim?

364
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,410
That's it!
He said Bumsang Kim.

365
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,380
And he mentioned
some woman, too.

366
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,230
Something Heo, maybe?

367
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:51,460
Could it be... Chohee Heo?

368
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:58,300
Yup, that was it! Chohee Heo.
Mr. Kim said he was going to get them.

369
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:09,080
The tolling of the temple bell calls forth
a piety of proud loneliness...

370
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,300
You are so incredibly good-looking.

371
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,300
You look much better in real life
than on television.

372
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,480
And you're so knowledgeable.

373
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,100
You really do look better in real life.

374
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,030
I'm sorry. Please excuse me.

375
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,000
Can I please have a hug?

376
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,320
You're quite popular with
the middle-aged women.

377
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,410
Like that's anything new.
Did you make a wish?

378
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:40,370
I hope you didn't wish
to become my girlfriend.

379
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,200
Are you suffering from heatstroke?

380
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,070
I should say that to you, seeing how you're sweating like a pig. Let's go eat.

381
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,470
You're buying.

382
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,230
Cheapskate.

383
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,100
How could you leave
your wallet at home?

384
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:05,260
Hey, kid, that's your fault. I left my phone, wallet and bag all at home.

385
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,490
Excuses, excuses.

386
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,040
Instead, I'll take care of dessert.

387
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,330
How are you going to do that
when you don't have a penny on you?

388
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:20,270
The restaurant gives out
free ice cream. I'll be right back.

389
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,120
Tch!

390
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:26,270
It's good to see you smile, you kid.

391
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,200
Sweetie!

392
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:40,090
Oh, wow. I can't believe we ran
into each other here, of all places.

393
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,130
What brings you here?

394
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:43,040
Huh?

395
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,120
Oh, I heard you were filming here today. I came to cheer you on, why else?

396
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,300
Oh wow, really?

397
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:55,400
You didn't come
with a woman, did you?

398
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,250
No way, I don't have
a woman I'd bring with me.

399
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,480
What about that woman
who claimed to be pregnant?

400
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,100
Why are you drudging up the past -

401
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,380
Didn't I explain everything to you?
That woman has nothing to do with me.

402
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:13,290
Oh, right.
You said she was a stalker.

403
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:16,040
I did?
I told you she was a stalker?

404
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,310
No wonder. I knew
you wouldn't cheat on me.

405
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:26,180
Anyway, it's so great to meet you
here in the middle of nowhere.

406
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:29,250
Yeah, I knew you'd be happy.

407
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,180
Sweetie, who was that?

408
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,380
Just now?

409
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,050
Don't you get those calls from annoying telecommunicators many times a day?

410
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,420
I should just turn off the phone.

411
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,240
Shall we walk a bit?
We are at the beach, after all.

412
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:52,310
He hung up. He would never
hang up on me. What's going on?

413
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:58,200
Do you think something
happened, Chief?

414
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:03,000
What's this I hear about not being able
to contact either Chohee or Bumsang?

415
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,320
What are we going to do, Chief?
What if Mr. Kim kidnapped them?

416
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,160
What?

417
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,460
Joohyun, how could you
say such a thing?

418
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:16,290
It's called a woman's intuition. What if something happened to my Bumsang?

419
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,390
Chief Kang, what do you think?

420
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:24,030
Chohee left her phone at home,
and Bumsang's was just disconnected.

421
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,220
It's possible that
nothing happened...

422
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,080
but we can't disregard the
possibility that Mr. Kim is involved.

423
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,350
Oh no, Chohee must've been kidnapped.
What are we going to do?

424
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:36,140
Hey, nothing's been confirmed yet.

425
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,370
Anyway, this is entirely the responsibility
of the investigations team!

426
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:46,010
They should've been properly protected
after the “Bihaedangjib” was found!

427
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,360
Why is that our fault?

428
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,370
It's not like we knew
this was going to happen.

429
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:54,180
Look, stop all the pessimistic thinking
and let's be levelheaded about this.

430
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,200
Officer Cho, check if Bumsang has been
to the university or the TV station.

431
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,000
Officer Park, find out if we can
locate him by tracing his cell phone.

432
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,430
Yes, sir.

433
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,330
Joohyun, try calling
Chohee's house one more time.

434
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,050
Yes, sir.

435
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:15,250
Huh?
Where did Bumsang go?

436
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:24,360
Darnit, the ice cream is melting.
Where is he?

437
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:37,080
Yup, that's more like him.

438
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,130
It's all melted. Darn...

439
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,110
Sweetie.

440
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,030
Yeah?

441
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:49,140
I'm sorry, but I still
have a lot left to film.

442
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,410
Don't worry about me.

443
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:56,030
I have to head back soon, too. I'll just look around by myself before leaving.

444
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,410
But then I'll feel bad.

445
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:02,190
There's no need to feel bad.
It's good enough that I got to see you.

446
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,340
Sweetie...

447
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:11,020
That's it. I'm going
to cancel the rest of the shoot.

448
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,050
What?

449
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:17,100
You came all the way here for me.
It's the least I can do.

450
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,140
You can't do that.
Where's your professionalism?

451
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:28,240
And I happen to think that you look the most beautiful when you're working.

452
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:35,290
Really? Then how about I hurry
things up instead of canceling?

453
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:36,400
Hurry?

454
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,470
Hwayoung, we have
to start filming again!

455
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:40,230
Ah, you have to work.
Go on then.

456
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,050
I'll be back.

457
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,160
- Yeah, yeah.
- Wait for me, sweetie.

458
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,360
Okay, but I might leave
so don't pay any attention to me.

459
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,210
I'll hurry back.

460
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,450
Yeah, yeah, but I might leave.

461
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:50,350
Go on. Yeah, yeah. All right.

462
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,320
Why are you empty-handed?
Where's the ice cream?

463
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,090
It all melted
while you were here.

464
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:08,120
Hey, if you were planning on going
on a date, why'd you bring me along?

465
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,310
What are you talking about?
It's not like that.

466
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,410
But I saw everything.

467
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:18,070
Saw what? I was standing over there
when I coincidentally ran into her.

468
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:21,110
And I coincidentally saw you
on the beach with her.

469
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,440
Fine, it was a date.

470
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:29,230
I have no plans of ruining your restored
love life, so have fun on your date.

471
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:32,480
My legs are killing me, thanks to you.
I'll be going home, then.

472
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:38,210
Hey, where are you going? How are you
going to back on your own? Hey, kid!

473
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,320
Why talk big in the first place?

474
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,120
Hey, can you
lend me twenty bucks?

475
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,350
Twenty bucks?

476
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,370
I don't have money
for transportation.

477
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:00,010
And yet you were all ready to leave?
Go on, then. I'm not giving you a penny.

478
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,220
Then how am
I supposed to get back?

479
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:04,370
You were walking away just fine.
Or maybe you can swim back. Whatever.

480
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:07,290
Hey! Lend me twenty bucks.

481
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:09,490
Don't cling to me... Fighting!
Good luck on getting home, all right?

482
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:11,360
C'mon, lend me twenty bucks.

483
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,390
Don't have it.
Stop bothering me.

484
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,060
Then ten bucks.

485
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,230
Don't have ten bucks.

486
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,410
C'mon, lend me twenty bucks!

487
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,080
My dress shoes are ruined.

488
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,460
So what?
Just get them cleaned.

489
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,380
Gosh, darnit!

490
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:55,100
Hey, come here.
Kid. Come here for a sec.

491
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:00,050
This is the famous salted shrimp
from Kanghwa Island.

492
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,100
Lady, this is all you have?

493
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,230
Don't you have it in
a different color in the least?

494
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,370
That's all we have left.

495
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,360
You guys look like a couple.
Why not just dress alike?

496
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,070
- Who?
- What?

497
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:16,290
There's a couple here? Where?

498
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,140
Excuse me, is there a couple here?

499
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,140
What time is it?

500
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,100
This is an expensive shirt, darnit.

501
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,030
Excuse me,
can I make a phone call?

502
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:44,110
Sure.

503
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,300
Thank you.

504
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,210
Is there a way we can find out?

505
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:52,150
Officer Cho,
what did the university say?

506
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,220
He had no classes today.

507
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,140
And the TV station?

508
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,320
No show today, either.

509
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,090
What about
the trace on the phone?

510
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:01,280
Since the phone's off,
it'll take some time.

511
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,300
Sir, my sister will be all right, won't she?
Nothing happened to her, right?

512
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,010
She'll be fine.

513
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,220
Call Bumsang again.

514
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,280
Okay.

515
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,270
Hello?

516
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,340
Sis!

517
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,190
Is that Chohee?
Let me talk to her.

518
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,040
Chohee.

519
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,000
Oh, Chief.

520
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,220
Hello? Joohyun?

521
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:35,260
What? You thought I was
kidnapped along with Bumsang?

522
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,100
Dragged away with Chohee?

523
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:44,250
Everyone was so worried.
Chohee, are you okay?

524
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:45,470
Yes, I'm fine.

525
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,190
Bumsang, you're okay, right?
You're safe, right?

526
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,060
Of course I'm okay.

527
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,030
Where are you?

528
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:52,490
Bumsang, where are you?

529
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:55,300
I had some things to think about...

530
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,070
I came out to get some fresh air...

531
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,060
You're really okay?

532
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,390
Are you really okay?

533
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:01,290
Yes.

534
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:05,240
Of course.
Chief, I'm so sorry.

535
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,190
Please tell my brother
to wait for me at home.

536
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,280
Of course!
There's nothing wrong.

537
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,380
Yes, don't worry. Yes...

538
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:20,130
What do they mean they thought
we were kidnapped by Mr. Kim?

539
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,370
That's what I'm saying.
We should apologize to everyone.

540
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:25,190
Why should we apologize?
They caused this ruckus on their own.

541
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,470
Gyoon must've been so worried.

542
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:30,010
Instead of worrying,
let's just head back.

543
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,490
Ah, what about
that announcer of yours.

544
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:36,360
Why are you worried about that? I'll take
care of it. Mind your own business!

545
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:38,320
And yet you never
take care of anything.

546
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:45,400
Through this event, I finally realized
how important Chohee is to our team.

547
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:50,250
And I need to treat Bumsang better.

548
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:57,290
I was too indifferent to him when he joined the CHA simply to be with me.

549
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:09,200
What doesn't kill us will only make
our team stronger. With that in mind...

550
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,020
Let's go eat.

551
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,300
Yes, let's.

552
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,280
Shall we?

553
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,470
Did they all forget
to take their medicine today?

554
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:27,330
They must've forgotten as a group.

555
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,400
Let's go eat, too.

556
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,450
Yes, sir.

557
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:37,290
My fifteen years of experience
tells me that something ain't right.

558
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:42,260
Are you referring to how we talked to
Bumsang and Chohee simultaneously?

559
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,310
Yeah.

560
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:46,190
Yeah, it didn't sit well
with me either...

561
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:50,000
What if they were together...

562
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:53,240
No way.

563
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:59,010
If they were...
Then they were lying...

564
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:04,210
Then we'll make mashed potatoes
out of them in Mr. Kim's stead.

565
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,070
For sure.

566
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:07,180
Let's go.

567
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,430
Hey, thanks for today.

568
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:32,120
You're welcome. Go on in.

569
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,390
No, you go first.

570
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:39,120
About the announcer from earlier.
That really was a coincide...

571
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,050
What?

572
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,160
Never mind. I'll be going then.

573
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,090
Bye!

574
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,120
Sis!

575
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,110
Gyoon.

576
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:53,230
Where have you been all this time?
Do you know how worried I was?

577
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:01,050
Aren't you Bumsang Kim?

578
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,280
Ah, yes.
Your brother?

579
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,210
Yeah.

580
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:09,160
I am her brother Gyoon Heo.
Nice to meet you.

581
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,220
Gyoon Heo?

582
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:12,400
Author of "The Tales of Honggildong?”

583
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,390
“Chohee Heo” and “Gyoon Heo.”

584
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:17,430
The greatest literary
siblings of the Joseon Era, eh?

585
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:21,010
As expected,
you're very knowledgeable.

586
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,210
But why are
you two here together?

587
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,460
Ah, we met coincidentally
over there. Right?

588
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:33,410
Right. You should get going.

589
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:34,400
Yeah.

590
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:41,090
You can't just leave like that.
Come in for a cup of coffee.

591
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:43,340
He has some coffee already.
Go on then.

592
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:44,430
Okay, see you tomorrow.

593
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,450
- All right, bye.
- See you next time, lil' bro.

594
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,490
Don't look a thing alike.
You're handsome.

595
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:50,250
Go already!

596
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,390
“See you tomorrow?”

597
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:08,040
He definitely has good taste.
He knows that I'm better looking.

598
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:12,120
Punk!
Let's go in, c'mon.

599
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,040
Why didn't you tell me
you work with Bumsang Kim?

600
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,330
Why do I have to tell you that?
I didn't have the chance to tell you.

601
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:29,260
Do you know how
worried everyone was?

602
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,450
I told you, I'm sorry.

603
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:37,230
Where were you?
What did you do all day?

604
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:46,000
I just went out for some fresh air.
I felt so stifled inside the house.

605
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,450
Sis.

606
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:49,420
Yeah?

607
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:55,330
I'm not a little kid anymore.
Why didn't you tell me?

608
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:57,120
About what?

609
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:00,130
About what happened to
the “Bihaedangjib.”

610
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:05,000
You knew?

611
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,490
Fool. Do you know how
foolish you are sometimes?

612
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:14,030
What am I to you? Why can't
you tell me this stuff honestly?

613
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:17,490
You're worried I'll be sad?
That I might worry?

614
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:20,150
Gyoon.

615
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:23,070
Sis, I'm an adult now.

616
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:28,240
Until now, you protected me,
but it's my turn to protect you.

617
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,020
So from now on,
tell me everything.

618
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:36,110
When you're sad or angry,
you can tell me.

619
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:38,110
Understand?

620
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:41,260
Look at you, you're
all grown up, aren't you?

621
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,490
You realize that now?

622
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:51,160
Oh, and since when did
you start dating Bumsang Kim?

623
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:55,400
What? I'm not dating him!

624
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,070
Who are you trying to fool?
You guys were dressed like a couple.

625
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:00,350
Why didn't you say anything?

626
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:07,230
What are you talking about?
Hey, go brush your teeth and get to bed.

627
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:10,220
And stop with all the nonsense.
Go to bed!

628
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,050
Think I'll believe you?

629
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:15,050
Shut up!

630
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:22,280
Such a famous person will become
my brother-in-law. How awesome.

631
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:36,270
Man... Bumsang,
you're one of a kind.

632
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:52,250
Dressing in couple tee shirts, how
unfashionable. Ugh, how unsightly.

633
00:48:56,010 --> 00:48:58,200
Here, Mr. Daegil Nah.

634
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:00,100
Officer Cho.

635
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:03,260
By the way, about our revenge
on Congressman Lee.

636
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:07,090
Are you still talking about that?
Man, you're persistent.

637
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:10,230
Didn't you know that Joohyun
has a very stubborn side to her?

638
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:11,090
Yeah.

639
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:15,110
What is this?
Didn't you all agree with me earlier?

640
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:21,190
And we can't just rest on our laurels. Speaking of which, Chief.

641
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:27,330
Why don't we just watch some TV?

642
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:31,010
I'll turn it on.

643
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:34,320
Mr. Daegil Nah.

644
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:38,490
- Chief, try some of this.
- This is the famous salted shrimp...

645
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:40,370
Oh, look at this. Look.

646
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:43,420
Huh?

647
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,290
Isn't that Chohee and Bumsang?

648
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:49,420
What the!

649
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:53,090
What's going on?

650
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:54,210
Bumsang!

651
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:58,190
You're going to
become mashed potatoes.

652
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,220
Hey, you have to keep
what happened yesterday a secret.

653
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:09,470
Watch your own tongue.

654
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,240
- But...
- What?

655
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,170
Hey, watch the hand.

656
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,380
Isn't this the tee shirt
from yesterday?

657
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,460
Oh, this? Yeah, it is...

658
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:23,070
How could you wear this?
What if I had worn mine?

659
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:27,280
See, something went wrong
with the laundry.

660
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:32,380
That's another matter.
Like you'd ever wear this.

661
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:35,450
That's true, I wouldn't be
caught dead in that...

662
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:39,270
Yeah, so don't ever wear it.
I'm going to keep wearing it.

663
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:41,410
You're going to keep wearing that?

664
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:46,390
We paid good money for it.
Anyway, thanks for the shirt.

665
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,240
Well, it does look good on you.

666
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:05,040
I'm sincerely sorry for making
everyone worry yesterday.

667
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,300
I'm sorry, too.

668
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,100
Why are you two apologizing?
Perhaps for going to Kanghwa Island...

669
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:17,000
eating salted shrimp
and playing around in the mud?

670
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:23,330
No, they're probably apologizing for
lying to us and going on a secret date.

671
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:27,200
If you feel so sorry, you should
have gone somewhere secret...

672
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,280
instead broadcasting yourselves
live across the nation.

673
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,090
That's enough. We should be glad that they're back safe and sound.

674
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:41,400
I'm sorry for going against you, Chief.
But I can't just let it go.

675
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:49,280
I agree. I can't forgive them
for hurting Joohyun and making her cry.

676
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:55,200
Everyone in the CHA knows
that Bumsang was chasing Joohyun!

677
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,440
Wait, chasing?
I was chasing whom?

678
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:04,240
Everyone knows, you jerk.
I can't let this matter slide.

679
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:10,050
Don't do that. I'm really okay.
Please don't be like this.

680
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:11,120
Joohyun.

681
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,440
Bumsang, you're
a total player, aren't you?

682
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:21,400
The one thing I can't forgive is a man
who goes around making women cry!

683
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:26,200
How could you toy with two women of
the same household? At the same time!

684
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,060
Officer Park, what do
you mean, “toy?” This is...

685
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:35,390
Bumsang. You should be clearer in
your actions. If it was all a joke to you...

686
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:38,070
I won't let you get away with this!
You player, you!

687
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:41,000
Should we just
post this on the internet?

688
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:46,220
Let me explain everything.
The truth his...

689
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,490
We're dating.

690
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:52,250
Hey!

691
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:55,380
Chohee, let's not hide it anymore.

692
00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:02,100
I don't care
what you say against me.

693
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:09,160
But Chohee's only sin was loving me.
Please attack only me.

694
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:15,020
I guess Chohee was too embarrassed
to admit everything. You understand.

695
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:17,190
Chief, excuse us for a moment.

696
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:27,220
Look at them.
They really were dating.

697
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:32,110
No wonder they were...
Like, no wonder...

698
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,200
Don't you agree, Chief?

699
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:37,390
Yeah...

700
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:49,420
Are you crazy? Completely off
your rocker? I'm not dating you!

701
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,480
Hey, pipe down.
You think I liked saying all that?

702
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:58,000
Then why did you do it? What would
Chief Kang have thought of me?

703
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,370
Oh, right. Chief Kang.
I totally forgot.

704
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:04,330
Why'd you tell such a lie
and make me into a fool?

705
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:08,470
Even if we insisted we weren't dating,
no one would have believed us.

706
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:12,340
If we can't avoid the tornado,
we should face it straight on.

707
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:19,050
And the damage on my side
is greater than yours.

708
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:22,230
So just do as I tell you.
Let's just date for a month.

709
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:23,440
What?

710
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,250
Oh, that was a slip of the tongue. Pretend to date.

711
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,450
And after a month,
we'll have a public break-up.

712
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:36,280
What should the reason be? Let's just
go with “differences in personality.”

713
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:43,280
All right, let's take this opportunity to
quiet all the rumors about us in the CHA.

714
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,410
Um, okay. Continue.

715
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:46,490
I'm done.

716
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:52,400
By the way, is it safe for me to walk
around when Mr. Kim is after me?

717
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:56,190
Shouldn't the investigations team
put me in protective custody?

718
00:54:56,190 --> 00:55:01,330
Protective custody, my butt.
Hey, get a grip.

719
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:07,250
Can you talk to them for me?
I'm scared. Hey, kid!

720
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,160
Ah, I see.

721
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:20,090
So when will the second volume of
the “Bihaedangjib” go on exhibit?

722
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,080
At the end of this month?

723
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:26,070
It would've been great if we could have
exhibited both volumes. What a pity.

724
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,100
Can you help me?

725
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,060
Sure.

726
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:31,090
How do I get to this art gallery?

727
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:36,100
Ah, you have to go down to the second
floor and turn left. It'll be right there.

728
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,340
Thank you.

729
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,480
Chairman Jang of the Ohsung Group?

730
00:55:51,490 --> 00:55:54,490
What brings you
all the way to the museum, sir?

731
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:58,340
I thought I'd take a look
at the “Bihaedangjib.”

732
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:01,010
But I heard Congressman Lee
took it back.

733
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:03,270
I was just lamenting the loss.

734
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:10,220
What do you think?
About Congressman Lee's actions.

735
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,220
Like you once said, properties
should always be in circulation.

736
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,340
They could be ruined in a single moment
or they could last a thousand years.

737
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:21,270
It's not that important
whose possession they're in.

738
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:28,070
I was worried you had changed
after working for the government.

739
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:30,080
I see my worries were unfounded.

740
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:36,240
I want to give you a second chance.

741
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:41,420
I have an item
I need for you to restore.

742
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:11,030
There was an uproar seven years ago
when General Shovel stole it.

743
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:15,140
National treasure no. 238,
the “Sowonhwagaecheob.”

744
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:20,370
General Shovel... Taesoon Heo.

745
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:29,490
Hey, what brings you
here at this hour?

746
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:35,010
Let's have
a glass of wine together.

747
00:57:36,370 --> 00:58:43,310

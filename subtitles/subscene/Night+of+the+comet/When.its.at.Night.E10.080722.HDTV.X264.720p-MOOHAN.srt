<i> Cultural assets and individuals in this
program have been altered fictionally.

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,640
<i> They have no real-life
associations with this drama.

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,950
Your father...

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,690
He's alive.

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,790
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,670
Your father isn't dead. He's alive.

7
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:33,950
Hey.

8
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,610
You shouldn't make jokes like that.

9
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,700
Here, take a look.

10
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,650
I found this while looking up records
of Mr. Kim at the investigations office.

11
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,730
January 23rd of 2008.

12
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:02,520
Taesoo Heo is on the list of people
who came in from Dandong, China.

13
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,930
Your father's name is here.

14
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:08,980
It could be someone
with the same name.

15
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:15,980
So I looked up the criminal record,
and there was only one match.

16
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,690
This is your father, isn't it?

17
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:43,930
Is this real? Is it?
This is real?

18
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:01,510
No matter what others said,
I always believed my father was alive.

19
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,970
It didn't matter what they said,
I believed he was alive.

20
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,830
And he really is alive.

21
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,560
<i> Episode 10

22
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,750
Where did everyone go?

23
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,910
Hey, Chief.

24
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,580
Officer Cho, about
the documents I asked for...

25
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,960
I submitted them for approval.
Hey, where did Bumsang go?

26
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,700
He's long gone by now.

27
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,850
Bumsang was here?

28
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,820
Yes.

29
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,860
For what reason?

30
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,690
To help with the “Sowonhwagae”
and “Chochung” cases.

31
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,600
You know how he can get
pretty nosy sometimes.

32
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,570
Claiming to want to familiarize
himself with on-site work.

33
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:29,530
I asked him to look over
the records for Mr. Kim's name.

34
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,970
He probably left
after a half-hearted attempt.

35
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:37,900
I think we bought too much food.
Chief, you want some?

36
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,930
I'm fine.

37
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,610
Huh, why is this document open?

38
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,960
The sushi rolls taste good.
It was a good buy.

39
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,930
Are you done crying?

40
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,870
Yeah.

41
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,650
Why are you bawling
over good news?

42
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,590
Seriously, what's wrong with me?

43
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,960
Shouldn't you tell Chief Noh about this?
He'll help you find your father.

44
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,860
You'll want to find him
as soon as possible.

45
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,510
I'm going to find him on my own.

46
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:27,670
I thought Chief Noh knew all about you.
He'd definitely help you out.

47
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,730
That's exactly why.

48
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,710
Dad's statute of limitations
still has two months remaining.

49
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,940
I always felt indebted to Chief Noh.

50
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,900
But turns out he always
felt indebted to me.

51
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:55,520
‘Cause I'd always bawl when
he'd come to take my dad away.

52
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:03,880
So I don't want to make
Chief Noh arrest my dad again.

53
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,850
Then I'll help you look for him.

54
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:15,770
It's okay, I can do it on my own.
Don't worry. Hey, I gotta go.

55
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,800
I'm serious. I'll help you.

56
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,720
Why?

57
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,620
Aren't I your boyfriend? I have to
fulfill my boyfriend duties for a month.

58
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:35,830
And wasn't he famous enough to change
our country's archeological history?

59
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,680
I want to meet him, since we're more
or less in the same professional sphere.

60
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,880
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

61
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,860
Sis! Bro, hi!

62
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,730
Gyoon... Gyoon...

63
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,680
Why are you being weird?

64
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,680
Gyoon.

65
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,990
What is it?

66
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,680
Dad... I think he's alive.

67
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,630
Sis...

68
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,510
I'm serious, Uncle.

69
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,700
So can you collect all the information
you have and give it to me tomorrow?

70
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,620
Yes. Yes...

71
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,970
What did Uncle Hwang say?

72
00:06:56,970 --> 00:07:01,620
Same as you. Asked if I was sure.
Said he couldn't believe it.

73
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,520
Do you think Dad's really alive?

74
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,660
Not sure. I'll look into things
starting tomorrow, so don't you worry.

75
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:21,830
Sis, I'm thrilled that Dad might be alive,
yet at the same time I'm not.

76
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,650
What do you mean?

77
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,840
If he were alive,
why didn't he come to see us?

78
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,600
You and I went through
some really hard times.

79
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,800
Wasn't he worried about us?

80
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,890
I can forgive a dead father.

81
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:51,770
But I dunno if I can forgive a father who
didn't come to see us when he was alive.

82
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:58,960
Your pent-up feelings against Dad
are nothing compared to mine.

83
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:06,580
I resent him a hundred times, no,
a thousand times more than you.

84
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:13,700
I hated how Mom had to die, how
people called me a thief's daughter...

85
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,500
worrying about him getting caught
and not being able to go to college.

86
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,890
I really resent him for it all.

87
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,770
But I still want him to be alive.

88
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,630
I want him to be alive...

89
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:41,660
so I can tell him exactly how much
I hate and can't forgive him.

90
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,840
Sis.

91
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,730
So let's find him this time.

92
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,870
Of the items
returned to the museum...

93
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:13,580
the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook
was stolen from Chairman Jang...

94
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,600
and the “Chochung” collection from Congressman Lee. So we suspect.

95
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,520
Congressman Lee? Serves him right
for what he did with the “Bihaedangjib.”

96
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,560
So who is it that
avenged us in my stead?

97
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,920
That would be Robin Hood.

98
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,700
They must be pissed that they can't
report it since they're national treasures.

99
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,760
Can we convict them for the possession
and harboring of stolen goods?

100
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,520
But all we have is a hunch about them
with no real hard evidence.

101
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,720
So it's impossible to motion
for a subpoena as of yet.

102
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:56,760
So our plan is to focus on arresting
the anonymous donor, said Robin Hood.

103
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,730
What's that?
We're going to arrest Robin Hood?

104
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,900
Why would we do that?
He's a good thief.

105
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:09,530
If we go against the public's wishes,
wouldn't we get hated on?

106
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,970
What better opportunity
for a promotion?

107
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,590
You have to become a sergeant. You
planning on staying an officer forever?

108
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:23,960
Chief, we should work for the public,
but we have to get promoted, too.

109
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:31,610
This is a serial theft case of designated
cultural assets. We have to investigate.

110
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:36,850
You two please cover the legwork for Chairman Jang and Congressman Lee.

111
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:44,590
Sangho and Mr. Nah, please look into
the delivery service Robin Hood used.

112
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,580
Robin Hood...

113
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,650
Bumsang!

114
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,760
Are you really gonna be like this?

115
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,910
Gonna be like what?

116
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,700
Are you going to keep avoiding me?

117
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,960
I wasn't avoiding you.
I was just trying to walk this way.

118
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,880
Don't lie. The look in your eyes
told me you were avoiding me. Right?

119
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,680
I never did that.

120
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:24,540
I know that you feel like
you sinned against me.

121
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,730
But if you keep this up,
you'll only be making me uncomfortable.

122
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,600
Joohyun.

123
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,610
I gave you up completely.
So please treat me with ease.

124
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,570
No, no~

125
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:46,600
I know that you fear that your feelings
will waver when you see me.

126
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,850
But please treat me
the way you used to. Please.

127
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,940
What a guilt trip.
Joohyun.

128
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,900
Joohyun!

129
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,520
Chief, we'll be on our way.

130
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,990
Okay. Where are you going first?

131
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,700
We'll mapquest the two men
and go the closer location first.

132
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:20,840
Congressman Lee, what are you saying?
I sent you the “Chochung” collection.

133
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:27,670
I should be asking you the same thing.
I never even got to see it.

134
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,870
It isn't my problem
that it's in the museum.

135
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:35,660
I did my part so I expect
the promised payment.

136
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,610
Let me make myself clear.
I never received it.

137
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,550
Your driver was the one
who got robbed in front of my house.

138
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,750
I can't be held responsible for that.

139
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:54,830
I advised you on the good faith purchase
matter and even lent you my lawyer.

140
00:12:54,830 --> 00:13:01,980
I think I've done all that I can for you.
So how can you do this to me?

141
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,720
This is a bigger problem for me.

142
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:11,810
I never even got to see the collection
yet the police are already pestering me.

143
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,760
Anyway, I have nothing
to do with the matter.

144
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:25,630
I came to tell you that I won't give you
a penny since I never even got to see it.

145
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,890
A fitting house for a man
like Chairman Jang.

146
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,920
Think they'll open the gate for us?

147
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,750
Based on my fifteen years of experience,
they'll just make us stand in this rain.

148
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,870
That's obvious even with
fifteen days of experience.

149
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,760
- Go on then.
- That's what I'm saying.

150
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,710
Where have I seen him before?

151
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,790
Hey, isn't that Congressman Lee?

152
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,680
Junpil Lee!

153
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,720
But...

154
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,860
Why's he here?

155
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:55,580
Chohee, Bumsang and I agreed
to treat each other comfortably.

156
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,580
That would be
better for you and me...

157
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:03,930
Chohee?

158
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,590
Yeah?

159
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,930
Chohee, you don't look so good.
Did something bad happen?

160
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:16,630
Me? No, no. Only good things
have been happening to me.

161
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:21,610
Good things?
What kinds of good things?

162
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,940
Did Bumsang propose to you?

163
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,780
Dear Lord, no, that's not it.

164
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:34,670
No? Then what could it be?
Good things...

165
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,750
- How strange...
- Excuse me.

166
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,850
Yes, Uncle?

167
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,930
I compiled a list of people
who used to be close with your father.

168
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:51,660
A lot of the numbers have changed. And
there are people who might be dead.

169
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,670
[I'll just send it over.]

170
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,890
Thank you, Uncle.

171
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,990
[No need to thank me, you punk.]

172
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:03,990
Check those people out first.
I'll check out the people still in business.

173
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:10,880
Okay. If anything comes up,
we'll call each other. Yeah. Okay, bye.

174
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,560
So Taesoo is alive, is he?

175
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,830
- Can you fax this for me?
- Sure thing.

176
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,780
Is it really okay for you
to be helping me like this?

177
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:30,560
I said I would, didn't I?
I'm not going back on my word.

178
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,550
Shouldn't you be out looking for
Robin Hood instead of helping me?

179
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,640
Where would I look for him?
At Chairman Jang's house?

180
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,860
Don't ask so many questions
when I'm offering. Where to first?

181
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:49,700
First Sadang-dong.
Let's go there first.

182
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,890
You saw Congressman Lee
in front of Chairman Jang's house?

183
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,850
- Yes!
- It's true, I tell you.

184
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,620
It was pouring and we rang the bell, worried that they wouldn't open up...

185
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:05,920
when the gate opened and
Congressman Lee came striding out.

186
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,980
He was greatly agitated
like a mad bull.

187
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,670
It looked like he had a major
showdown with Chairman Jang.

188
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,830
Definitely. And something
was definitely fishy, right?

189
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:21,730
Those two would never meet
unless something big was going on.

190
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,820
Chief, it seems to me that...

191
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,830
this has something to do
with the “Chochung” collection.

192
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,860
Good work.

193
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,860
- Officer Cho.
- Yes?

194
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:43,970
I need to ask you a favor.

195
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:48,710
Can you look into Bumsang's
surroundings for me?

196
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,670
Is there some kind
of problem with Bumsang?

197
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,570
No, it's not like that.

198
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,770
I'll look into the university.

199
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:02,620
Can you find out if he has
bad relationships with anyone?

200
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,730
Yes, sir.

201
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:08,840
And this is a secret
between you and me.

202
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:12,570
That goes without saying!

203
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:23,990
[Taesoo? It's been a while since
I saw him. More than ten years.]

204
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:28,510
You can't hit a homer
on the first pitch. Where next?

205
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,630
Shillim-dong and then Anyang.

206
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,670
Okay.

207
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,500
Have you seen him recently?

208
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,810
It's been a while
since we lost contact.

209
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,650
Do you know anyone
we could possibly contact?

210
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,840
Well...

211
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,690
It's been a while since I saw him.

212
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,900
Around seven years I'd say.

213
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,520
There are good-luck poles.

214
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,640
So your father's friend is here?

215
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:22,660
Not a friend but someone who shared
a prison cell with him seven years ago.

216
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,860
Hope we pick up some news here.

217
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,830
How can I help you?

218
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,750
So that was...
Hold on, when was that?

219
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:49,890
It was 2000 or 2001. I shared a prison
cell with him for about five months.

220
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,840
I see...

221
00:19:52,620 --> 00:20:00,610
He was so nice and sympathetic that
a lot of people treated him with respect.

222
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:07,820
What is this about
losing contact with him?

223
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,800
Um, the thing is...

224
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,890
He's been missing
for seven years now.

225
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,800
Inadvertently we came across some
records showing that he is still alive.

226
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,970
So now we're trying to
find out what we can.

227
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,800
Did you meet him after
you were released from prison?

228
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,590
No, I didn't meet him.

229
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:34,760
So you haven't
seen him in seven years?

230
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,560
Yes.

231
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:46,800
That's strange. I definitely thought he'd
head straight home after his release.

232
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:59,500
He said he'd return the stolen items and
go to his kids with a clear conscience.

233
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:01,990
Dad said that?

234
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:12,820
Your name's Chohee, isn't it?
He always talked about you and Gyoon.

235
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,860
He missed you and
regretted what he did.

236
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:23,950
Sorry I'm not of much help.
I don't have much information on him.

237
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,710
I'm sorry.

238
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,840
Not at all. You've been
a great help. Thank you.

239
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:39,790
I made this in prison
after learning how from your father.

240
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,850
Truthfully, he made half of it.

241
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:50,690
I'll give it to you in hopes that
he returns to you. Please take it.

242
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,800
Thank you, sir.

243
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,810
Then, take care.

244
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:03,850
You okay?

245
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,900
Of course.

246
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,990
Let's go.

247
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:15,870
All his lectures were cancelled?
Were there problems with his lectures?

248
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:20,830
Not at all. If anything,
his lectures were too popular.

249
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:23,920
I don't understand why this happened.

250
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,980
Where's the book
I asked you to borrow for me?

251
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,900
Here it is.

252
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,570
Professor Yongcheol Gong?

253
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,950
Bumsang?
He had loads of problems.

254
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,820
There was more than one.

255
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:49,780
First, he seduces women and students
with his looks and his silver tongue.

256
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:55,510
Second, he hatches plots to slander me
due to his jealousy of me. And third!

257
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,580
Do you know why
his lectures were cancelled?

258
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,610
Oh, that?

259
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,920
My opinion is that
it's because of Chairman Jang.

260
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,690
Chairman Jang?

261
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:15,550
I don't know about their relationship, but
Bumsang definitely rankled the old man.

262
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,870
The old man had his lectures cancelled
and had him cut from his TV show.

263
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,870
From “Discovering Cultural Assets?”

264
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:25,680
Ah, I'm hosting that now.

265
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,620
I was supposed to get the advisory
member position at the CHA, too.

266
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,700
But that one remained
untouched for some reason.

267
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,990
Anyway, Bumsang probably has
a major grudge against Chairman Jang.

268
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,880
He's probably
already plotting his revenge.

269
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,670
But what can he do?
It's Chairman Jang he's up against.

270
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,570
Revenge...

271
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,600
Joohyun, what's up?

272
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,870
What the hell?
You ruined my car!

273
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,550
Learn how to drive!
Look at my car!

274
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,930
It's because of middle-aged women like
you that there are so many accidents.

275
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,520
Look here.

276
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:30,610
Who are you calling middle-aged?
I'm not middle-aged. How dare...

277
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,720
You look middle-aged so I'm
calling you middle-aged! So what?

278
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,990
Joohyun, what happened?

279
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,650
Chief!

280
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,690
Oh, is this your husband? Good.

281
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,560
What are you going to do about my car? I'm not even done making payments yet!

282
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,880
Look here, sir! Watch what you say.
Do you know who this is?

283
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,530
This person is Chief Shiwan Kang of
the district PD's investigations team!

284
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,750
How dare you raise your voice!
I'm not middle-aged!

285
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,710
Joohyun?

286
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,570
Yes?

287
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,530
Investigations team?
Then you're a cop?

288
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:00,740
Did you call your insurance company?

289
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,660
What?

290
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,840
I'm sure you know that even if you were
rear-ended, you bear part of the blame.

291
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,780
Let's take a look.

292
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,890
Why'd you drive when
you hardly know how to?

293
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,920
I'm supposed to pick up the the Hahman
case items but no one could help me.

294
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,780
I can't bring them all back with a taxi,
so I brought out my dad's car in secret.

295
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,710
So you do work after all.

296
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:30,900
Chief! That's an insult.

297
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:36,980
Can't you see all the liver spots and dark
circles I gained from working so hard?

298
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:46,610
Oh, right. Where are you coming from?
Investigating Robin Hood?

299
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,790
More or less...

300
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,620
Who do you think Robin Hood is?

301
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,910
I'm not sure.
What about you?

302
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,670
I think it's Bum -

303
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,930
I'm not sure either.
Who could it be?

304
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,570
You think it's Bumsang, right?

305
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,530
How'd you guess?

306
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,550
Just a wild guess.

307
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,970
You're practically clairvoyant.

308
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,910
Chief.

309
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:25,820
Chief, why aren't you
brushing me off?

310
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,730
What?

311
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:31,610
“Joohyun, Bumsang
can't be Robin Hood.

312
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:34,570
You think that makes
any sense? Go home!”

313
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,930
Isn't that the normal reaction?

314
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:41,550
I think that maybe
it isn't entirely unlikely.

315
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,750
Really?

316
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:49,930
So you also think that Bumsang is
Robin Hood. Right, right. It could be true.

317
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,720
Why aren't you eating?

318
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,740
What? Oh, right.

319
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,780
Don't be picky with your food and eat
everything. Chief, have some of this, too.

320
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,640
I thought we were going to eat?
Where are we?

321
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:14,580
The place with the
best food for miles. Come on.

322
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:22,670
This isn't a restaurant.

323
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,880
You should've called before coming.

324
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,650
We were in the neighborhood.

325
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,960
You should've at least
told me ahead of time.

326
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,590
We're just eating.
No need to get all worked up.

327
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,650
Much easier said than done.

328
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,930
Grandpa says it's all right.

329
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
Here you go, here's the chicken.

330
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,540
Doesn't it look delicious?

331
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,960
There you go.

332
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,680
Bumsang, have all you want.

333
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,720
You, too.

334
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,790
Thank you.

335
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,780
There you go. Go on.

336
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:38,590
You're so pretty and with nice skin.
So pretty, isn't she?

337
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,590
See, he agrees.

338
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:56,870
You're not too thin. And your hips
look just right for childbearing. Right?

339
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,990
See, he agrees with me.

340
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:10,540
Grandma, we're not dating.
She's just a co-worker of mine.

341
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,880
Yeah, sure, okay.
That's how things are.

342
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:19,590
You start off working together
and eventually live together.

343
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,530
Right?

344
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,910
See, he agrees.

345
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:26,850
Right...

346
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,670
The rest corresponds to
what you found out.

347
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,910
And how should I put this?

348
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:50,800
He seems to have a lot of girl problems.
Chohee's in for some heartache.

349
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,760
Anything else?

350
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:57,720
That's it for information about Bumsang.
Oh, about the “Chochung” collection.

351
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,530
Yes?

352
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:04,650
The regulations team says it belonged to
Chairman Jang not Congressman Lee.

353
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,690
The “Chochung” collection
belonged to Chairman Jang?

354
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:12,620
Yes. The moment Chairman Jang
tried to sell it to Congressman Lee...

355
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,630
Robin Hood came swooping in,
stole it and sent it to the museum.

356
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:23,880
Based on my fifteen years of experience,
we should switch our focus...

357
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:29,800
from grudges against Bumsang
to grudges against Chairman Jang.

358
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,950
Ah, Chief Kang, sorry I'm late.

359
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:32,980
Good work.

360
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,800
Hello, Chief Noh.

361
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,640
So what you're saying is
Bumsang is Robin Hood?

362
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,730
It seems very likely
looking at the circumstances.

363
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,720
How is that possible?
It's just office gossip of the ladies.

364
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,630
But considering the relationship
between Bumsang and Chairman Jang...

365
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,970
he's the most likely suspect.

366
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:59,780
The second possibility is that
this is all an act by Chairman Jang.

367
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,880
An act?

368
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:06,570
In other words, he's just trying
to make things difficult for Bumsang.

369
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,870
Of course, it doesn't
make much sense.

370
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:11,700
Of course.

371
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:16,960
A rich man like Chairman Jang wouldn't
give up his possessions for that reason.

372
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,850
But considering his pride and how he
hates to lose, it isn't completely unlikely.

373
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,870
He's a man who values his pride
above monetary losses.

374
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:36,730
And finally, we can't disregard the
possibility of a third party involvement.

375
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,790
A third party? Who?

376
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,550
Not sure. If I knew that,
I wouldn't be here right now.

377
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:48,680
Jeez, this is difficult.

378
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,720
Should we stick a man on Bumsang?

379
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,630
Isn't the glaze too thick on this one?

380
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,960
Who's the woman?
Is she the woman you like?

381
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:09,830
What do you think about her?

382
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,980
I like the expression in her eyes.

383
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:16,860
So you like her.

384
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,960
But there's also
gloom in her expression.

385
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,870
So you don't like her?

386
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,980
Are you saying you like her or not?

387
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:36,890
This is the first place certificate he got
in a national composition competition.

388
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:43,730
And this is the second place certificate
he got for a sketching competition.

389
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,990
The winner had connections
according to Bumsang.

390
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:55,630
And he got innumerous awards for
perfect attendance and excellence.

391
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,780
You're very proud of him,
aren't you, Grandmother?

392
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:03,640
Of course. He's such a great kid.

393
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:07,730
He never caused me any trouble.

394
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:10,760
And he never showed it when
he was going through a hard time.

395
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
Really?

396
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:19,680
Yeah. He's such a considerate kid.
Bumsang is very considerate.

397
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:25,680
I'm so out of it. It's time for
Grandpa's medicine. Give me a sec.

398
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,620
Sure.

399
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,590
- Look at these while I'm gone.
- Okay.

400
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:39,670
You were one of a kind
since you were young, Bumsang.

401
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,980
Studied much?

402
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:00,620
A pink notebook?
How unconventional.

403
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:13,510
What is this?

404
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,750
'May 12, 1988. Thursday.'

405
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:29,950
'Today, the prettiest girl
in class gave me chocolates.'

406
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,960
'I think she likes me.
She has good taste.'

407
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,920
'August 5, 1988. Friday.
The weather is sunny.'

408
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:51,510
'I went to the Bomun Shrine for the anniversary of Mom and Dad's deaths.'

409
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:57,880
'The priest told me before that if I climb
the stairs, my wish will be granted.'

410
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,610
'So I went up the stairs
again this year.'

411
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:07,570
'It was so hard but I made it
and stood in front of Buddha.'

412
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,740
'But when I tried to make my wish,
I couldn't remember it.'

413
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,780
'Instead, I just kept crying.'

414
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:22,860
'After standing there for a while,
I finally thought of a wish.'

415
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,940
'I didn't make the wish to go
to Mom and Dad like I did last year.'

416
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,750
'I didn't make the wish
to meet Mom and Dad again.'

417
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:41,800
'Will Buddha grant my wish this year?
The wish I made today was...'

418
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:49,910
'Mom, be happy.
Dad, be happy.'

419
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,850
Bumsang?

420
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,660
Hey. I'm almost done. We can
leave after I'm done with these.

421
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:24,830
I finally understand why
you took me to the Bomun Shrine.

422
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,610
What? How would you know that?

423
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,760
That's none of your business.
Wrap things up here then.

424
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,930
Sit, sit.

425
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:48,620
If I knew you were coming, I would
have made the radish kimchi you like.

426
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,520
It's okay, Grandma.
I'm coming back next week, anyway.

427
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,590
You're coming next week?
Are you coming with him?

428
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,750
Oh, no, I'm not coming.

429
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,990
Yeah, you must be busy.

430
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:04,850
Next time, we'll go up to Seoul
so we'll see each other then.

431
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,630
Okay, Grandmother.

432
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,640
It's late. Go on home.

433
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,750
Bye, Grandma.

434
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,840
- Thank you for the meal.
- You're welcome.

435
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,730
No matter how the public feels,
we need to catch Robin Hood.

436
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:25,920
Why suddenly the change in heart?

437
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:30,590
We're continuously working
late hours because of him!

438
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,970
Yeah. We'll have
to catch him, eventually.

439
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,720
Chief.

440
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,610
You two haven't gone home yet?

441
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:44,710
We can't go home when there's
so much work to do for the country.

442
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:47,920
There aren't enough hours in the day for
all the worrying we do about the country.

443
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,750
What brings you here?

444
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,750
What? Ah, I had
something to ask Chohee.

445
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,760
Chohee?

446
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,620
Chohee left early in the morning with
Bumsang. We haven't heard from her.

447
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,560
Ah, is that so?

448
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,760
Why don't you give her a call?

449
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,770
No, I can ask
her tomorrow. Goodbye.

450
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:11,590
Yes, sir.

451
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:20,550
Doesn't it seem like Chief Kang
takes care of Chohee a lot?

452
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,840
He doesn't do nearly
as much as I do for Joohyun.

453
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,900
I miss her, suddenly.

454
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,540
Joohyun...

455
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:36,700
Though they tried not to show it, your
grandparents seemed kind of lonely.

456
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,880
Go visit them more often. After all,
you're the only family they have.

457
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,570
You should go visit them.

458
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:47,760
My grandma seemed to like you
since she thinks you look prolific.

459
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:51,650
You must be the fecund type.

460
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:53,610
You wanna die?

461
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:57,750
Hold that thought.

462
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:03,670
Hey, why are you calling me?
Chief Kang did what?

463
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,580
He asked questions about me?

464
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:15,710
[You know how I can't tell lies.
So I told him the truth about you.]

465
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:23,590
[But I was worried and decided to give
you a call since we are friends, after all.]

466
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,990
Yeah. Thanks.

467
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,720
Chief Kang did something?

468
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,670
No, it's nothing.

469
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:47,630
Did he figure out that you restored
the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook?

470
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,980
Is that it? It is, isn't it?

471
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,530
You shouldn't have restored a stolen
good in the first place. Why'd you do it?

472
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,880
Stop already. Before it was
a stolen good, it was a cultural asset.

473
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,750
It was my fault for being unable
to refuse Chairman Jang's request.

474
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,840
but I've never once regretted restoring
the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook.

475
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:24,780
And I know Chief Kang
is just doing his job...

476
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,960
but it's insulting to hear that
he's checking up on me like that.

477
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,820
He probably wasn't
comfortable doing it either.

478
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,730
It's not like you guys are strangers.

479
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:42,540
It probably took a lot of deliberation
on his part. So don't feel so insulted.

480
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,790
I can't believe you.

481
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,600
What?

482
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:53,960
You understand Chief Kang so well,
but did you ever try to understand me?

483
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,900
But... that's not what I meant...

484
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,720
Enough.
I forgot that you like him.

485
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,900
Look here, Bumsang.

486
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:40,850
Never mind,
let's talk about this later.

487
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,560
Bye.

488
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,530
Hi, Sis.

489
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,540
Hey.

490
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:22,910
Did you find out anything about Dad?

491
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,740
No.

492
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:29,940
Oh, just one. Hold on.

493
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,510
You know what this is?

494
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,670
It's a good-luck pole.

495
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,510
How do you know that?

496
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,630
Of course I do. It was at the entrance
of the village when we lived in Buyeo.

497
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,520
Wow, you remember that?

498
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,780
Of course. I even remember
the day he whittled it.

499
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,680
You have a good memory,
remembering all that.

500
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,900
You think that's all?

501
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,640
I remember the day he set up
the good-luck pole in the village...

502
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,980
the day we played
hide-and-seek under it...

503
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:06,630
and the day you chased after him
crying when he was being arrested.

504
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:08,640
Why remember all that?

505
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,510
Where did you get this?

506
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:18,560
I met someone who shared a prison cell
with him and he gave it to me.

507
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,860
He made it together with Dad.

508
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,760
They made it together?

509
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,530
I see.

510
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,980
Hey, aren't you hungry?

511
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,970
I'm starved.

512
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:34,590
Let's eat.

513
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,720
Come on.

514
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,510
I can't believe you.

515
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:57,920
What?

516
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,730
You understand Chief Kang so well,
but did you ever try to understand me?

517
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,780
Was I being unfair?

518
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,830
Doesn't it seem like Robin Hood
is awfully quiet these days?

519
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:26,600
He must've heard our complaints.

520
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:31,550
I've been continuously thinking
about who Robin Hood could be.

521
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:33,700
There you go again!
Talking about Bumsang.

522
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:38,900
No. At first I really believed
that Bumsang was Robin Hood.

523
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,990
But then it occurred to me
that maybe he's not.

524
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,730
Then who do you
think Robin Hood is?

525
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:46,770
I think that it's...

526
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,930
Chohee.

527
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:53,660
What?

528
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:56,930
You know I'm quite insightful
about the future.

529
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:00,720
The time has come for
the appearance of a female thief.

530
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:05,530
A prepared female thief.
By far, Chohee seems most likely.

531
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,780
Please spread the rumor far and wide
whenever you get the chance.

532
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,840
Why do her conclusions always
end up nonsensical like that?

533
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:27,640
So what? How could you possibly
understand the pain of a broken heart?

534
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:56,650
[Testing, testing. Hey, Bumsang.]

535
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,980
[If you were hurt by my words
yesterday, I'm really sorry.]

536
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:08,730
[But I wasn't trying
to take Chief Kang's side.]

537
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:14,750
[I was just trying to comfort you in my own way. So don't be angry anymore.]

538
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:22,720
[I'm on my way to meet my dad's friend.
Pray for some good news. Okay?]

539
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:35,580
This weekend I'm going to try
going to where we used to live.

540
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,850
Are you sure he's alive?

541
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:40,970
I showed you the records.
You want to see them again?

542
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:47,680
You think he's alive because of a sheet
of paper? After seven years of no news?

543
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,530
Uncle.

544
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:54,740
Gyoon asked me why your father
didn't look for you two if he were alive.

545
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,640
He said he couldn't believe
your father would do that.

546
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,530
Still, I...

547
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:06,890
I agree with Gyoon. If he were alive,
he wouldn't have kept quiet for so long.

548
00:47:07,810 --> 00:47:12,790
He would've done something.
Stolen something. Anything.

549
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:21,530
Think about it. I'm one of the people
who desperately hope he's alive.

550
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:28,530
But no matter how much I think about it, I don't think you're doing the right thing.

551
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:34,750
You're only going to end up
with an even more bruised heart.

552
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,600
It's me.

553
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,980
Come to my room right now.

554
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,980
What?

555
00:47:53,980 --> 00:48:00,670
Apologies should be made in person.
So come to my room.

556
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,620
I'm outside right now.

557
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:07,860
Who said you could go by yourself?
Come back then. I'll be waiting so hurry.

558
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:10,980
Hey.

559
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,980
Who's he to tell me what to do?

560
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,670
Didn't he hear the recording?

561
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,590
[Your call has been transferred...]

562
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:05,590
What in the world? What's going on?
She's taking too long.

563
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:09,690
Did something happen?

564
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,850
[Chohee Heo]

565
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:14,970
Hey! Where are you?

566
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,890
Hey! What are you doing here?

567
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:29,650
Bumsang, you're here!
Come, come, sit down.

568
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:30,770
Chohee!

569
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:35,500
Why are you yelling? Excuse me,
can we get another shot glass?

570
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:36,630
No, don't bring it.

571
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:37,850
What's wrong?

572
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,940
What are you doing?

573
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:44,570
What do you mean?
I'm drinking. Have a drink.

574
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:46,780
Here, here.

575
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:48,520
What's with you?

576
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:53,820
Do you know how worried I was?
You should've called me or something.

577
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:57,830
Ah! I plumb forgot to call you.

578
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,640
You forgot?

579
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:02,730
Jeez...

580
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:05,940
Come on, drink already.

581
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:10,760
You're not gonna drink?
Then I'll drink.

582
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,780
Hey, hey! Get up.

583
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:15,700
What?

584
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,510
Why? I just got here.

585
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:20,800
Get up already!

586
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,940
- What's your problem?
- Come out!

587
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,600
Hey, let go!
What's your problem?

588
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:33,680
I'll forgive you for worrying me,
so just go home. Okay?

589
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:41,990
Who are you to boss me around? Go
home yourself. I'm going to drink. Let go!

590
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,750
Hey. Hey!

591
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:50,600
What's up with the drunk behavior?
This is so unlike you.

592
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:57,830
Did something happen?

593
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:02,570
No, nothing happened.

594
00:51:02,870 --> 00:51:04,670
Stop lying.

595
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,850
What is it? Huh?
Come on, tell me.

596
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:12,820
Really. Nothing happened.

597
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,600
Chohee!

598
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:18,650
I said nothing happened!

599
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:21,740
Why do you keep asking
when I said nothing happened?

600
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,840
Nothing happened, okay?

601
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:35,790
I saw my dad.

602
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,900
I saw him, but...

603
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,620
He wasn't my dad.

604
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:55,620
I really thought it was my dad,
but it wasn't him.

605
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:15,740
[I got angry and you cried.
Let's consider ourselves even.]

606
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:21,790
[Don't cry when you wake up, okay?
It's not like you. You're the fecund type.]

607
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:29,510
[Now that I think about it,
you were kind of cute while drunk.]

608
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,880
[Don't be too hard on yourself. Bye.]

609
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:38,930
What's this?

610
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:46,570
Ugh, my head. I didn't even
wash up before sleeping.

611
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:09,630
What?

612
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:11,560
Buy me something to eat.

613
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,840
What? How more
shameless can you get?

614
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:17,860
Can't you just buy me something?

615
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,670
No. Buy it yourself.

616
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:27,620
Yes, Chief.
Okay, I'll be right in.

617
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:35,630
Another item came to the museum.

618
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:39,880
It was delivered again?

619
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:41,870
It's a vase with a plum tree
and bamboo design.

620
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,540
Bumsang, please take a look at it.

621
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,840
It's...

622
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:53,930
The “Cheongjasamgang
Maejukmun” vase.

623
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:07,670
Yes, Officer Cho.

624
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:15,820
Officer Cho!

625
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:18,700
Chief.

626
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,770
I looked into the matter.

627
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:31,570
The vase that came in was stolen
last night from Chairman Jang's house.

628
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:33,770
Again from Chairman Jang's house?

629
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:35,580
Yes. Last night.

630
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:40,720
News travels so fast that all the
rich men and middlemen already know.

631
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:49,580
This is definitely a plot against Chairman
Jang. What do you think, Chief?

632
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:53,970
Chief!

633
00:55:55,550 --> 00:56:00,790
Uncle, the “Cheongjasamgang
Maejukmun” vase. Dad stole it, right?

634
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:04,960
[The "Maejukmun" vase?
I'm sure your dad stole it.]

635
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:10,840
Why do you ask?
Did it show up at the museum, too?

636
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:13,640
Yes.

637
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:20,550
That's so strange. Why do your dad's
items keep showing up? Three of them!

638
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:26,860
Three? It's two. You said the “Chochung”
collection wasn't one of dad's items.

639
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:29,550
[Oh, didn't I tell you?]

640
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:39,850
I was searching through my records for
you, and I found out he stole it in 2000.

641
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:50,880
[So all three items sent to the museum
were all your dad's stolen items.]

642
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:56,570
[Who in the world is doing this?
I don't understand.]

643
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:05,970
He said he'd return the stolen items and go to his kids with a clear conscience.

644
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,930
Bumsang.

645
00:57:22,570 --> 00:57:24,670
Can I have a private word with you?

646
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,640
What is this regarding?

647
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:35,710
Please excuse me for asking,
but where were you yesterday?

648
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,560
And why do I have to answer that?

649
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:42,900
Because you're in need of an alibi.

650
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:45,700
Why would I need an alibi?

651
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:51,510
Do you know what common factors
connect the items sent to the museum?

652
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:58,540
They're all stolen goods and they were
all in Chairman Jang's possession.

653
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:01,500
So what?

654
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:06,690
Bumsang, are you Robin Hood?

655
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:08,860
What?

656
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,950
If you can't give me an alibi,
I'll have no choice but to investigate you.

657
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:17,830
Where were you last night?

658
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,710
I believe the investigation
has already begun.

659
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:25,730
Please answer my question. Where were
you last night and with whom?

660
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:27,780
He was with me.

661
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:36,910
We were together until about midnight,
and he was probably home after that.

662
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,820
Then you just need to provide
an alibi for after midnight.

663
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:54,600
There's no need for that, Chief.
Bumsang isn't Robin Hood.

664
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:56,980
The real Robin Hood is...

665
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:08,890
General Shovel Taesoo Heo.
My father is Robin Hood.

666
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:39,740

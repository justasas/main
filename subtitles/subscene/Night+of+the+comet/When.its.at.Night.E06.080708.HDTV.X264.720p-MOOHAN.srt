00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,670
<i> Cultural assets and individuals in this
program have been altered fictionally.</i>

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,760
<i> They have no real-life
associations with this drama.</i>

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,890
Let me ask you one thing.

4
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:15,890
What?

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:22,750
You weren't attracted to me
at all up to now? Not even once?

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,550
I've never, not even once,
been attracted to you, so don't worry.

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:29,650
You're telling the truth?

8
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:34,650
Yes, I'm telling the truth.
I swear to God, not even once.

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,780
And never in the future either,
so don't worry.

10
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:39,910
Never in the future either, you say?

11
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,800
Of course.
There, I'm all done. Let's go.

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,980
How about now?
Feel anything towards me now?

13
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,880
What do you
think you're doing?

14
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:12,590
Well, I did expect a slap in return.
So go ahead and hit me.

15
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,690
Take your best shot.
I've already readied myself for it.

16
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,590
Hey! Hey, kid!

17
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,590
What's taking Joohyun
so long? I'm worried.

18
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:38,640
Why are you asking me?
I don't get why I'm stuck here.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,850
Maybe we should
take her to the hospital?

20
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,980
What the...

21
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,770
Joohyun, are you okay?

22
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,600
Are you really done?
Nothing more to push out, right?

23
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,610
Mr. Nah!

24
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:01,920
It's bad manners to say
something like that to a lady.

25
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,980
Let's go.

26
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,980
- Joohyun!
- Oh my god, are you serious?

27
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,610
Joohyun!
What if it's serious?

28
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,510
Darnit...

29
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,630
Where are you going? Hey!

30
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,910
C'mon, let's talk about this.

31
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,730
Did I look that easy to you?

32
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,650
What?

33
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:38,680
Did I look so easy that
you would kiss me as a joke?

34
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:47,770
I don't know what you think of me,
but take your nonsense elsewhere.

35
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,560
Hey, hold on.

36
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:58,990
Don't you dare lay a finger on me
from now on. I won't take it sitting down.

37
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:13,680
Why couldn't she hit me
when I was ready for it?

38
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,530
Hey, isn't that Chohee?
Chohee! Chohee!

39
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,660
That was a total diss.

40
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,520
When I become chief, I'm going to
make sure she learns her manners.

41
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,950
Hey, isn't that Bumsang?

42
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,780
Bumsang! Bumsang!

43
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,890
Another diss.

44
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:47,620
How long is Joohyun planning to take? We'll be here all night, I tell you.

45
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,650
Think about how much pain
she's in. You're so inconsiderate.

46
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,520
[This blue and white porcelain piece was drawn with paints made with cobalt...]

47
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,800
Oh? Sis, you're home.

48
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:05,600
[...covered to create the special
blue design of this porcelain piece.]

49
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,820
[And there's another reason this blue
and white porcelain piece is so valuable.]

50
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,640
That crazy bastard...

51
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,790
Isn't Mr. Kim cool? Even guys think that, so imagine what the ladies must think.

52
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,610
Sis, is he really
that good-looking in real life?

53
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,760
Good-looking, my butt.
Why are you watching that crap?

54
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,990
What are you doing?
I was enjoying the show.

55
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,620
Did something happen?
She's acting weird.

56
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,990
Anyway, he's not as good-looking as me, but he holds his own pretty well.

57
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,950
Crazy bastard. Evil jerk.

58
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,920
She didn't even
bother to listen to me.

59
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,690
Ow, it split open even more.

60
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,840
Dude, why in the world
did you do that?

61
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,970
The weather totally sucks.

62
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,590
Jingook?

63
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:40,980
Yeah?

64
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,900
If I could, I would send
all the art thieves a memo.

65
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,930
Saying what?

66
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:52,920
To take a break from stealing in the second and fourth quarters of each year.

67
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,710
Every time it feels like we can take a breather, they cause trouble again.

68
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,830
Look at the bright side. The more they steal, the more chances for a promotion.

69
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:08,570
What an optimist you are.
So who's coming from the CHA today?

70
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,990
Chohee and Joohyun.

71
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,550
Ms. Joohyun?

72
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:19,610
Coming to keep an eye on Chohee ‘cause Bumsang is coming, eh?

73
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,790
Your deductive reasoning skills
are exceptional.

74
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,810
How long have I been a cop?
Fifteen years.

75
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:33,600
What's he talking about, fifteen years? It's too early in the morning to be lying.

76
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,660
Wait up.

77
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,700
Look what
happened to the shovel.

78
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,610
Looks like they drank alcohol, too.

79
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,580
Hi, Chohee.

80
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,890
You startled me.

81
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,600
When is Bumsang coming?

82
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,920
How would I know?

83
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,960
Why are you snapping at me?

84
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:15,630
Did something happen between you two again? Oh, oh, your expression changed.

85
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:22,620
Didn't you say last time that you gave up on him? So how could you do this?

86
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:24,950
I feel insulted.

87
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,910
Bumsang!

88
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,900
Considering the excavation site
and the Gobe fragments...

89
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,920
it seems likely earthenware from the early Paekche period were excavated.

90
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,660
I have a question.

91
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,680
Shoot.

92
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,930
How'd you get so beat up?

93
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,920
Excuse me?

94
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:07,530
Last night some punks were picking on
a student. I couldn't just do nothing.

95
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:12,560
Oh my, oh my, so in other words you fought seventeen of them by yourself?

96
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:12,940
What?

97
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:19,860
I mean, otherwise there's no way you would've gotten so beaten up, right?

98
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:30,650
Yes, right. It was too dark to count ‘em, but I knew instinctively there were a lot.

99
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,630
You're so amazing.

100
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:41,680
With your crusade for a just society, you'll run the cops here out of a job.

101
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,680
Just accept it.

102
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,780
Can I speak to you
privately for a moment?

103
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,940
Sure, why not?

104
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:04,680
Seventeen? Why didn't you just tell them that Yonggu beat the crap out of you?

105
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,790
Oh right, you don't want them to know that you have history with Yonggu, right?

106
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,890
Hey, aren't you the one who
wanted to put the past behind us?

107
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,720
I did say that, but everything
you do reminds me of the past.

108
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:26,560
Yeah, so what
do you want me to do?

109
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,870
First thing we do at an excavation theft site is dig up the hole the thieves filled.

110
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,660
I already know that.

111
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,510
So start digging.

112
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,940
Say what?

113
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:46,860
Repent while you dig. Repent the atrocity you committed against me.

114
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,780
Here.

115
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:53,750
Work hard.

116
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,890
No, wait...

117
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,650
Where did that woman go?

118
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,970
- Bumsang.
- Bumsang.

119
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,820
Ah, yes?

120
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,980
You offered to dig instead of us?

121
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:27,930
Don't worry about it.

122
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:32,570
And last time you offered to go
through the old books by yourself.

123
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,760
It's no big deal.

124
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,880
You're such an admirable person.

125
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,910
I agree.

126
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,640
Drink this while you work.

127
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:42,710
Thank you!

128
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:57,500
When compared to the crime scene photo, the hole's about the right size.

129
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,800
That means one person
dug it at a time.

130
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,850
Officer Cho, how long
do you think it took?

131
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,740
For how long did Bumsang dig?

132
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,980
Around three hours?

133
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,940
So if we assume he took turns with the lookout, it was done by more or less...

134
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,750
Three men.

135
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,600
Three men.

136
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,910
Three men? At most.

137
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,680
Excellent. Let's go.
Good work.

138
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,910
Good work.

139
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,900
Hey, Bumsang, good job.
Now fill the hole back up.

140
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,810
What?

141
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,800
Don't you understand Korean?
Fill it back up with dirt.

142
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,620
Hey, no way, I can't do it.
I'm climbing out now.

143
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,860
Finish up the job
before coming out.

144
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,720
Hey, my hand... Ease up.

145
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,710
Then I'll let you finish up.

146
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,960
Hey, hey!

147
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,650
What the! Argh!

148
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,910
Bumsang, you must be so tired.
Your clothes are all ruined.

149
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,990
It was hard work, but worthwhile.

150
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:22,700
Bumsang, thank you for
all the shoveling you did today.

151
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,620
Ah, would you like a soda?
Or do you not drink sodas?

152
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,650
I'll take that.

153
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,870
Bumsang!

154
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:43,580
Chohee, why does it break my heart
to watch him walk away?

155
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:48,680
It breaks your heart?
Well, it gives me a headache.

156
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,840
Chohee, you just came in?

157
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,770
And Joohyun, too.

158
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,920
Chief, did you forget that
I asked you not to speak to me?

159
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,720
Why must you
always bother me so?

160
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,830
Chohee, I'm going in first.

161
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,750
Joohyun's under
the impression that I like her.

162
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:26,730
I'm not sure how I should
act around her. What should I do?

163
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,850
Hmm, from what
I know about Joohyun...

164
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:32,520
Yeah?

165
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,660
There's no solution.

166
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,760
What?

167
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,690
Until she runs out of steam, she won't listen to a single word anyone tells her.

168
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,520
Gosh...

169
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,850
Why does she think I like her?
It's so troublesome.

170
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:55,580
By the way, didn't you say
there's someone you like?

171
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:56,920
Excuse me?

172
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,620
Who is it? It can't be Bumsang.
Is it someone I know?

173
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:06,940
Oh, no.
You don't know him at all.

174
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,800
Yeah? What's he like?

175
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,530
What's he like...

176
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:17,970
He's a strong and
very warmhearted person.

177
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:30,660
But he has so much sadness in
his heart that there's no room for me.

178
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,590
I don't know who he is,
but he's a fool.

179
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,790
Not being able to recognize you
for the genuine person you are.

180
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,840
He is a fool. A real fool.

181
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,740
Chief, what are you doing?

182
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,550
Oh, hold on.

183
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,840
I've never won a doll
at this game before.

184
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,800
You've played it a lot, huh?

185
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,870
Yeah... hold on, hold on.

186
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,950
Oh wow.

187
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,570
Here! This is for the dinner
you just bought. Here, take it.

188
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,810
No, it's okay.
Give it to Jiyoon.

189
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,700
My daughter's doll is right there.

190
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,550
The bigger one?

191
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:57,600
Yeah, the brown one.
Jiyoon loves teddy bears. So take it.

192
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,770
Okay.

193
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:03,890
I'm very good at this.

194
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,550
The store in my neighborhood
went bankrupt because of me.

195
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,820
Look. All right!

196
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,960
Ugh, it's freezing...

197
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,640
Jonggyu?

198
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,750
Was the alumni association
gathering today?

199
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,860
Hey, I can't make it. I'm suffering from fatigue after digging all day yesterday.

200
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,850
No, I'm serious.
I really did dig.

201
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:04,620
With a shovel! Don't you know what a shovel is? A shovel, you jerk! Hang up.

202
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:28,700
Aw man, there's nothing to eat.
Except anchovies.

203
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,710
So the donation ceremony for the “Bihaedangjib” is going to be held here?

204
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:47,750
Yes. It'll be exhibited at the museum
as soon as the ceremony's over.

205
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:54,650
All your hard work paid off,
didn't it, Chohee?

206
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,700
I didn't do much...

207
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,650
When you're happy,
it's okay to express it, kid.

208
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:05,770
You're right, I'm thrilled.
I'm heading out then.

209
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:17,800
She looks pretty happy.
She should be, considering her father.

210
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,630
Chohee!

211
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,740
Chohee, is it true that
Bumsang is out sick today?

212
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,750
He didn't make it to work?

213
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,810
He didn't.

214
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:36,710
I heard he's really si...

215
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,530
You didn't know?

216
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,640
Nope, this is news to me.

217
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,900
Thank you.

218
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,850
Hey, how could you come the emergency room for a petty thing like a cold?

219
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,860
I had chills earlier and really
thought I was going to die.

220
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,760
You know me.
Once I'm sick, I really suffer.

221
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,930
I don't know about that, but I do know that no one exaggerates like you do.

222
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,850
Get a shot of nutrients
before you leave.

223
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,820
Hey, go easy on me.

224
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,850
[Chohee Heo]

225
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,510
Chohee?

226
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,880
Hey, you're faking it
right now, aren't you?

227
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,500
Faking it?

228
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:33,790
You can't fool me. Come to work before
I embarrass you in front of everyone.

229
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:39,770
Hey, Chohee,
I'm in the ER right now.

230
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,570
The ER?

231
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:48,640
Yes, and I have to go in for an examination now so I'll talk to you later.

232
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,510
Hello? Hey!

233
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:54,670
Hey!

234
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,560
Hey, if you have some bandages,
wrap up my hand, will you?

235
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,610
Why do you need bandages?

236
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,740
Stop asking questions
and just do it.

237
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:26,920
Whew, what are you up to now?
What a total kid he is.

238
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,710
Chohee, hey.

239
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,590
Bumsang.

240
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:47,500
What's wrong with your hand?

241
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,900
How could you ask when
you're the one who stepped on it?

242
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,550
What?

243
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:00,620
The cold is one thing, but apparently
you fractured my finger.

244
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,810
Fractured your finger?

245
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,780
The hand is vital to a person
who does restoration work.

246
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,600
How will I make a living now?

247
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:14,710
That's strange.
I swear I didn't step on it that hard.

248
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:20,890
A fracture...
I'm really sorry.

249
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,790
What's done is done.

250
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,860
I'm going to go home
and get some rest.

251
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,770
Yeah, hurry home and rest.

252
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,550
But who knows if I can
drive with this hand.

253
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,580
Me?

254
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,880
Can you?

255
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,810
I'm so dizzy, all of a sudden.

256
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,910
Whoa, the room's totally spinning.

257
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,670
Hey, are you okay?

258
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,620
Your fever seems to be gone.

259
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,600
Hey, hey. Why are you
pretending to be nice now?

260
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,950
Did you eat something?

261
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,740
Eat what? I didn't eat
anything since last night.

262
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,650
You have nothing to eat here?
You should eat something.

263
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,500
There's nothing to eat
in a bachelor's pad.

264
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,790
And with this hand...
I'm not hungry.

265
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,770
You need to eat to regain your strength. You want me to order something?

266
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,590
No, doesn't sound very appetizing.

267
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,840
If you really want me to eat,
maybe we should cook something?

268
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,780
Cook?

269
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:12,570
Yeah, maybe some kimchi stew
or something. And make it spicy.

270
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:16,760
Hey, are you saying you want me
to cook kimchi stew for you?

271
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:21,610
I think my appetite
is coming back at the thought.

272
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,550
Fine, I'll cook kimchi stew for you.

273
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:34,800
Hey, hey, there's pork in the freezer.
Put that in and make it spicy.

274
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:41,800
All right, I'll cook.
You get some shut-eye.

275
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,600
Chief Kang, thank you for the meal.

276
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,640
- Thank you for the meal.
- No problem.

277
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,870
The food here at the CHA
is always so good.

278
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,880
Why are you so unproductive
when you eat such delicious food?

279
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,650
Aren't you ashamed?

280
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:07,550
So you let Mr. Kim get away because
you eat bad food at your office?

281
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:07,990
What did you say?

282
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,590
What's up with you two?
You always argue when you meet.

283
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,950
Let's all calm down.

284
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,780
Yeah, stop it, you two.

285
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:19,850
Can you guys head back and write up those reports about the Yeoju case?

286
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,590
I'll head back later.

287
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,580
Okay.

288
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,980
- I'm warning you...
- Whatever...

289
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,520
- Have you had lunch?
- Oh, I'm on a diet.

290
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,890
Oh.

291
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,890
Whew, it's better
not to run into her.

292
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,720
Oh hey, Joohyun.

293
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,630
Why did you ignore me
when you saw me?

294
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,600
Because last time you
told me not to speak to you.

295
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:05,720
I said not to speak to me.
When did I tell you to ignore me?

296
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,830
Are you looking down on me?

297
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:14,530
No. No, why would I do that?
The thing is...

298
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,950
Okay! Fine.

299
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,670
If that's not the case,
then can I ask for a favor?

300
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:24,680
A favor?
What is it?

301
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,910
Hey, why are you snooping around
in someone else's house?

302
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:04,750
I'm just looking around.
Hey, are these your grandparents?

303
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:08,740
Yeah. My grandfather
made all the pottery here.

304
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,910
Oh... your grandfather is a potter?

305
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:17,950
He's a vigorous old man who spent
his entire life immersed in clay.

306
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:25,820
Hey, why did you stuff
this one down here?

307
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,990
It's a fake.

308
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,570
It's a fake?

309
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:35,620
There was an antique store
I frequented when I was in college.

310
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:40,880
The owner's daughter was really pretty. So I bought one to impress her.

311
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,820
I think I paid around
eight hundred dollars for it.

312
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:49,650
Eight hundred dollars? You're crazy.
You were reckless, weren't you?

313
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:55,720
But it turned out that, ha,
she was a married woman.

314
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,770
For real?

315
00:26:56,770 --> 00:27:00,980
Yeah.
And I really liked her, too.

316
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,900
I told you it's a fake.
Why are you putting it up there?

317
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,910
So what if it's a fake?

318
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:14,930
I think that if an item holds a special memory, it's no longer a fake.

319
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,700
Isn't that why you kept it?

320
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,990
Hey, the food's all ready.
Let's go. Let's eat.

321
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,500
Here.

322
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,780
Oh!

323
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,940
There, I cooked and here's
your stew. Can I leave now?

324
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,550
Hey!

325
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:00,720
Where do you think you're going?
I can't eat with this hand. Feed me first.

326
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,670
You can eat with your left hand.

327
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,630
Here!

328
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,810
Tch... Fine.

329
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,910
I'll feed you. Here!
Open your mouth wider. Ah.

330
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,590
Hey!

331
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:17,840
“Ah!”

332
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,620
Fine. It's fine, I tell you.
I'll eat on my own.

333
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,740
Look at you.

334
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,830
Here!

335
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,660
Listen to me as you eat.

336
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:19,880
I admit I was wrong in doing that to your hand. But you did something wrong, too.

337
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:26,840
It isn't right to kiss
someone you don't even like.

338
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:31,610
Hey, are you lecturing me
in my vulnerable state?

339
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,920
I'm being serious here.

340
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:39,520
I wanted to tell you this.

341
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:47,860
I understand what you're trying to say, but I'm not the type to kiss just anyone.

342
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:52,820
Then why did you kiss me?
You don't like me in that way.

343
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,880
Of course I don't.
Think I've lost my marbles?

344
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,730
The reason I kissed you was...

345
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:58,900
Yeah?

346
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,990
- Isn't that Chief Kang and Joohyun?
- What?

347
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,660
Oh no! What's going on?

348
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,950
You think I'd know?
What brings them here?

349
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,680
Chief Kang can't know that I'm here.
He absolutely can't know, okay?

350
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,750
Why “absolutely” can't he know?

351
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,830
Just know that he can't.
Isn't there anywhere to hide? No?

352
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,990
Why isn't he opening the door?

353
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:39,750
Oh no!
Do you think he's unconscious?

354
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,510
Is he that sick?

355
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,810
So I heard.

356
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,740
Anyway, thank you
for coming with me, Chief.

357
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,800
No problem. I should have come
anyway since Bumsang's sick.

358
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:58,550
But why did you want me
to come with you?

359
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:02,550
Why do you ask?
You didn't want to come with me?

360
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:06,730
That's not what I mean.
You like Bumsang.

361
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,800
This is a good opportunity for you two
to be alone. I don't want to ruin things.

362
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,590
No, no.
You're thinking about it all wrong.

363
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:19,660
Bumsang is a man, after all.
A very passionate man, at that.

364
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:24,870
I'm here to pay him a visit,
not to stir up his feelings for me.

365
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,860
Hello, Bumsang!

366
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,960
Here, flowers!

367
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:45,580
I'm relieved you're not that sick.
I was so worried about you.

368
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,540
You must be very uncomfortable.
The weather's hot, too.

369
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,880
Oh, this? Don't worry.
I'm taking it off tomorrow.

370
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,990
Why did you do
all that shoveling yesterday?

371
00:31:55,990 --> 00:32:00,810
Someone like you who needs
to protect the hands shouldn't shovel.

372
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,740
Definitely shouldn't shovel.

373
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,510
Joohyun, do you realize how many
times you said the word “shovel?”

374
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,840
Oh, I didn't mean to babble on.

375
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,760
Don't worry. I did do
a lot of shoveling, after all.

376
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:17,900
If I knew we were coming, I would've asked Chohee to join us. It's too bad.

377
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,610
I'll tell her to come
visit you sometime.

378
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:22,890
Sure...

379
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:29,970
Why is Chief Kang here?
Darnit, what to do?

380
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:34,880
Why is it so hot in here?
Ugh, I'm so hot.

381
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:44,880
What the! Bumsang, you pervert.
This is a padded bra...

382
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:49,620
Jeez...
I knew it, the perv.

383
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,740
Bumsang, I think
your phone is ringing?

384
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,750
Um, I don't think so.

385
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:05,500
No, I heard a phone ring.
From that direction.

386
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,720
No.

387
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,730
You heard wrong.

388
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:15,700
Ah, it must be the neighbor's.
The walls are terribly thin here.

389
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,610
That's not it. I definitely
heard it from over there...

390
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:21,510
No, no. Please stay seated.
I'll bring out some refreshments.

391
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:22,910
No, Bumsang. I'll do it.

392
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,810
I'm the host.

393
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:27,830
No, please stay here.
You have a hurt hand.

394
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:28,940
Then...

395
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,790
How did he cook with a hurt hand?

396
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,700
Two sets of chopsticks. Two cups.

397
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,870
Was he with a woman?

398
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,880
Hey...

399
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:07,920
Joohyun,
what are you looking for?

400
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:14,860
What? Oh, I'm just checking out
your home. It's so nicely decorated.

401
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,550
Checking out my home?

402
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:17,700
Yes.

403
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,570
Uh, wait...

404
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,740
Aren't you being rude?

405
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:29,840
You're the one being rude.
Stop coming between Bumsang and me.

406
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:36,910
I think you're way out of line here. Bumsang, we'll be leaving now.

407
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,560
What?

408
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,570
So soon?

409
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,930
Yes, you seem to be perfectly well.

410
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,850
Joohyun, we should let
Bumsang get some rest.

411
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:57,780
Joohyun, leaving already?

412
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:04,550
Please take care of yourself,
and we'll see you tomorrow.

413
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:08,640
Bumsang?
Take care. See you later.

414
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,590
Okay. It's a pity
you can't stay longer.

415
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,960
Hey, they're gone.

416
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
They left?

417
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,950
That was a close one.
What in the world was that?

418
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:28,950
You were in such a panic that you made me nervous, too. Come out, already.

419
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,930
I swear there was
a woman in there.

420
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,910
Let's assume there was. Why cause embarrassment for everyone?

421
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:40,550
She'd be the only one embarrassed.

422
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:44,520
It was a good chance to reform Bumsang's loose ways.

423
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,760
Look here, Joohyun.

424
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,660
Chief Kang, you're quite
an interesting character.

425
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,740
You act like you gave up on me, yet
here you are showing your true colors.

426
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,950
Are we talking about this again?

427
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:01,830
I mean, why else would you grab
my hand like that in front of Bumsang?

428
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,690
I knew I shouldn't have asked
you to come with me.

429
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:07,800
Enough already. I'm headed back
to the CHA. You want a ride or not?

430
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,830
No way. You think I'd ride your car after what just happened? I'm cabbing it.

431
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,830
Hey, do you like
Chief Kang that much?

432
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,610
What?

433
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,700
What are you talking about?

434
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,750
It's practically written on your face.
“I like him so much.”

435
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:45,610
Stop talking total nonsense.

436
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:52,520
Why else would you hide like that?
You could've told him you were visiting.

437
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,590
That was just...

438
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:00,700
Hey, you shouldn't be ashamed to
like someone. It's a natural emotion.

439
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,510
Then again, I would have never
expected you to be like this.

440
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,840
What?

441
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:13,510
I thought you didn't give guys the time
of day. So you are a woman after all.

442
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,980
Eh, whatever. I'm leaving.

443
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,860
What was it?
Hey, how do you open this?

444
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,630
I'll do it for you.

445
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,730
Yeah, you do it.

446
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:32,870
Okay.

447
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,930
Bumsang, I left my car keys here.

448
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,730
Chohee?

449
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,810
Chief!

450
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:56,710
Chief, the truth is,
what really happened is...

451
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:01,930
It's okay, you don't have to explain.
But I admit I'm a little taken aback.

452
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:06,640
You could've just told me honestly
last time that you really do like him.

453
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:13,850
No, that's not it. I came
because it's my fault he's hurt.

454
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:19,600
Anyway, it's not what you think,
so please believe me, Chief.

455
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:29,720
Okay, I believe you. I believe you,
but isn't this how love starts?

456
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:36,790
You cook for him,
worry about him when he's sick...

457
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:40,910
hold his hand, check his forehead
for a fever, things like that.

458
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:47,520
I remember that's
how things started for me.

459
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:54,960
Liking someone is an exhilarating feeling. So don't be embarrassed.

460
00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:01,530
No matter whom you like,
whether it's Bumsang or someone else.

461
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,850
It's you.

462
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:13,520
The person I like is you,
not Bumsang. It's you.

463
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:56,950
Oh my god.
Oh god, what did I just do?

464
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:04,640
Oh god, what am I going to do?
Oh no! Oh no...

465
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,690
[Your call has been transferred...]

466
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:11,750
Argh, she's not picking up again.
This is so frustrating!

467
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,870
Whatever. It's not like I wanted
the whole thing to happen.

468
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:26,800
Hey, it's pretty good.

469
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,910
Argh, this is so uncomfortable.

470
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,910
Daddy!

471
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,890
Hey, it's my little girl!
Come here!

472
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,760
Did you have fun
at kindergarten today?

473
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,570
Yup.

474
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:05,890
Aren't you going to give
me a kiss? Once more.

475
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,810
Ah, scratchy.

476
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:08,740
You're home.

477
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,860
Hello, Mother. Why are you
outside at this late hour?

478
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:16,840
Jiyoon couldn't sleep so we were playing at the playground. Did you have dinner?

479
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,910
Of course.
Let's go in, Mother.

480
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:27,580
Daddy, this is Cinderella, these are the stepsisters and this is the glass slipper.

481
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,860
And the prince will announce that he'll marry the owner of the slipper, right?

482
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,830
Right.

483
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,840
- Is that so?
- Jiyoon.

484
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:38,820
Time for bed. Come on,
Grandma will tuck you in. Let's go.

485
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,790
Don't wanna.
I wanna play with Daddy.

486
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:46,830
Daddy, can we play
just a little bit more? Please?

487
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,900
Sure, let's do that.

488
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,930
Mother, you can go to bed.
I'll tuck Jiyoon in later.

489
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,900
Daddy's the best.

490
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:01,710
Jiyoon, Daddy's tired so don't
keep him up too late, okay?

491
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:04,570
Okay, Grandma.
Don't worry.

492
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,870
Good night.

493
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:12,760
Ah, I almost forgot, Daddy.
I drew you today.

494
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,650
You did?

495
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:14,680
Yup.

496
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:17,550
Let's have a look.
Wow, you drew this?

497
00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:17,860
Yup.

498
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,770
And this is me?

499
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:19,870
Yup.

500
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,500
And...

501
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,760
This is Mommy.

502
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:33,540
Looks just like her, doesn't it?

503
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:39,630
Wow, it really looks like her.

504
00:42:54,550 --> 00:43:00,820
Why does the investigations team lack such basics? Especially Officer Cho.

505
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:05,640
What did they do to claim
“All for one and one for all.”

506
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,870
And insist on attending
the donation ceremony?

507
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:13,590
That's what I'm saying. After all, we're the ones who found the “Bihaedangjib.”

508
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:14,680
Right.

509
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:21,820
Joohyun, what do you think
about Officer Cho's motto?

510
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:23,780
Joohyun?

511
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:25,590
Yes?

512
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:26,820
(All for one and one for all.)

513
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,790
Ah, you're talking about that?

514
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:35,590
Let me take Chief Kang
and Bumsang for example.

515
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:41,870
They love the same woman, so how can we talk about all for one and one for all?

516
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:47,550
It's impossible.
Yup, totally impossible.

517
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:53,930
When is the museum bringing over
the “Bihaedangjib” tomorrow?

518
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,500
Oh, Chohee's in charge of that.

519
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:03,510
Hey, where did
she disappear to now?

520
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:14,820
Um, Chief? What I said
yesterday shocked you, right?

521
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:22,710
I don't know why I said that to you.
I shouldn't have said it.

522
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:29,800
You don't have to worry about it.
So just forget all about it.

523
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,780
Yes, please forget
I ever said anything.

524
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:43,890
When I was dating Jiyoon's mom,
she always used to say something to me.

525
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,840
She said I was tactless, slow
and never understood how she felt.

526
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,910
I'm like that.

527
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:59,570
I admit I was shocked to hear
what you said yesterday.

528
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,920
And I felt really sorry to you.

529
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,700
And truthfully, I was a little happy.

530
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:16,520
Being loved by someone
is an exhilarating feeling.

531
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,960
And you're such a good person.

532
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:36,790
But I don't think I'm ready
to start a new love, not yet.

533
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:47,740
I'm sorry, Chohee, to have
to refuse your feelings like this.

534
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:54,640
No, please don't be.
Why should you be?

535
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:59,550
I shouldn't have said
all that in the first place.

536
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:03,730
Like I said earlier,
please don't worry about it.

537
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:09,840
I have to attend the morning
meeting so I'll be going first.

538
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:23,500
Sir!

539
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:28,530
We heard you were very sick.
Are you okay now?

540
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,880
Yes, I'm fine.

541
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,610
And we heard that
you hurt your hand?

542
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,800
It's this hand.

543
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,910
Are you okay?

544
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,910
Sir, if you have any trouble
typing or anything like that...

545
00:46:41,910 --> 00:46:43,730
Um, my hand... Ow...

546
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:45,740
Oh, I'm sorry.

547
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,880
You can come to me anytime.
I will help you.

548
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,620
Thank you.

549
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,950
No, sir. I will help you.

550
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,780
Quiet. Sir,
I'm the best at typing.

551
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,640
Let me show you.
I'm typing now.

552
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,550
Sir, this is what I call
the “eagle typing” technique.

553
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:02,960
I can type a thousand
characters a minute.

554
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,570
Then who is the best?

555
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:05,850
I am!

556
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:29,760
Hey! What happened yesterday?
You didn't pick up your phone.

557
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,780
Things didn't work out well
with Chief Kang?

558
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,690
Guys should be more
understanding than that...

559
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,550
Should I explain things to him? That there's nothing going on between us?

560
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:45,650
It's fine.
There's no need for that.

561
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:49,580
Something really
did happen, didn't it?

562
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:56,720
By any chance did
he reject you? Is that it?

563
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:00,710
That's not it.

564
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:06,570
Hey, you realize
this is not my fault, right?

565
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:11,550
He already felt like that, so I don't
have to feel sorry to you, right?

566
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:19,620
Yeah, why should you be apologetic?
I should be thanking you.

567
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:25,880
For bringing my pathetic one-sided
crush to an end. I should be grateful.

568
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:30,840
I'll see you later.

569
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:51,790
She really liked him, didn't she?

570
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:59,910
I thought she'd be all over me for faking my injury. But she doesn't even care.

571
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,720
[Chairman Jang]

572
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,840
You work for the CHA these days?

573
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:24,640
I heard you were the one who verified the “Bihaedangjib” at my party.

574
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:30,770
Yes, it's true. I'm sorry, sir.

575
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,700
I didn't call you here
to scold you, so relax.

576
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,580
I called you here because of this.

577
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:49,580
I couldn't find another person
quite as talented as you are.

578
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:32,530
Did this piece come into Korea
through Dandong, China?

579
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,510
How did you know?

580
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:41,520
It's now a public fact that North Korea's authentic items come through Dandong.

581
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,890
So there tends to be
a lot of well-made pieces.

582
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:46,570
Are you absolutely sure?

583
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:49,600
Didn't you call me here because
you were already suspicious?

584
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,710
Yes, that's true.

585
00:50:56,610 --> 00:51:04,730
I've valued this item for a long time. What a pity. Should I just break it?

586
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:08,730
Is it really necessary to do that?

587
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:12,590
I might be speaking out of place...

588
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:16,520
but are are people who value
fake items suffused with memories...

589
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,900
as highly as authentic items.

590
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:24,650
It's actually quite well made. If you used to value it, then I suggest keeping it.

591
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:28,700
As a person
who values only the best...

592
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:32,550
I never thought I'd hear
you say something like that.

593
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,740
Don't feel I was unjust in calling you here simply because there was no one else.

594
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:42,770
Not at all. Please call me
whenever you need me.

595
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:44,700
I'll keep that in mind.

596
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:52,780
By the way, about Congressman Lee's “Bihaedangjib.” Is it authentic?

597
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:57,860
Yes, I'm sure of it. It'll probably be designated a national treasure soon.

598
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,910
A national treasure.
I wonder if it will come to that?

599
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,510
What did he mean by that?

600
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:24,910
But I don't think I'm ready
to start a new love, not yet.

601
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,750
I'm sorry, Chohee, to have
to refuse your feelings like this.

602
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:47,720
[Bumsang Kim]

603
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:50,990
What do you want?

604
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:52,670
[Whatcha doing?]

605
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:58,830
Just lying here.

606
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:03,650
Hey, it's not the end of the world.
Why are you so listless?

607
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,970
If you're trying to pick
a fight with me, I'm hanging up.

608
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,730
Do you want me
to buy you a drink?

609
00:53:09,730 --> 00:53:10,840
No.

610
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:14,660
Fine, then.
I'm just trying to comfort you.

611
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:19,730
Hey, if you want to comfort me,
sing me a song.

612
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:21,650
Sing a song?

613
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:25,630
Your singing amuses me.
Sing that song. What was it?

614
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:32,520
“If~” that song.
It'll help me laugh a bit. Yeah?

615
00:53:33,590 --> 00:53:34,680
Fine, I'll sing.

616
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:41,900
<i> If it's a person you
have to forget, then...</i>

617
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:45,890
Hey, blockhead, you really sang
'cause I told you to?

618
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,860
You're the one who asked me to. Who cares if you're listless? I'm hanging up.

619
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:10,610
What?
What is it now?

620
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:18,860
No, it's just that...
That did comfort me a lot.

621
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,900
[Good night.]

622
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,640
Hey, wait up.

623
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:25,980
What?

624
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:29,730
About the “Bihaedangjib.”

625
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:30,960
What about it?

626
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,810
Never mind. I'll see you tomorrow
at the ceremony. I'm hanging up.

627
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:45,550
Nothing will happen, right?

628
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,710
Jingook?

629
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:50,790
Yeah?

630
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:55,620
Why do the CHA boys
lack the basics?

631
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,640
What now?

632
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:02,900
I repeatedly taught them the mindset of “All for one and one for all.”

633
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:06,850
Yet there's not a single call
wondering where we are...

634
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:11,520
how we're getting there
and if we're even coming.

635
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:20,760
Who cares if they're not calling us? They'll probably buy dinner after, right?

636
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:25,580
If they buy pork ribs again,
I'm going to turn the CHA upside down.

637
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:31,810
It's time to go.

638
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:36,560
Hey, can the two of you
go without me?

639
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:37,910
Why? You're not going?

640
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:41,800
I have some things to take care of.

641
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:48,680
You're acting strangely.
Did someone at the CHA offend you?

642
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:48,900
What?

643
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:53,660
Who is it?
Was it the delusional Joohyun?

644
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:56,750
The rude Mr. Nah?
Sangho Lee? Who?

645
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,610
Officer Cho, why did
you leave Chohee out?

646
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:02,910
Hey, punk. You think Chohee
would offend Chief Kang?

647
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:05,770
Dogs will bite
the hand that feed them.

648
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:07,570
Punk, what do you mean by that?

649
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:08,990
Am I wrong? Am I?

650
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:12,930
That's enough. Let's head over
as soon as I take care of some things.

651
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,850
Did you just say “bonus?”

652
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:19,950
And extra vacation time,
on top of that?

653
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:26,670
And the director will also give us
enough for a grand dinner tonight.

654
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:29,830
Wow, this isn't a dream, is it?

655
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:30,960
Okay.

656
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,570
Now, now, we don't have
much time so let's hurry.

657
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:36,540
Yes, sir. Hurry!

658
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:39,890
Where's Chohee?

659
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:43,770
Chohee? She's working on the program for the ceremony. Should I go get her?

660
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:46,850
No. I'll call her.
Get back to work.

661
00:56:46,850 --> 00:56:47,840
Yes, sir!

662
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,790
Hello, this is Jeongpil Noh.

663
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:13,690
Congressman Lee, what brings
you here without prior notice?

664
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:17,920
It's not because...

665
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,810
Joohyun, can you look
through these for me?

666
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,920
You're leaving now?

667
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,810
You begged to be on the guest list
and you're going to be tardy?

668
00:57:32,810 --> 00:57:34,510
Bad news, bad news.

669
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:38,620
Congressman Lee is here
to take "The “Bihaedangjib" away.

670
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:41,680
What are you talking about?
How can he take it away?

671
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:44,840
He's claiming a good faith purchase.
A good faith purchase.

672

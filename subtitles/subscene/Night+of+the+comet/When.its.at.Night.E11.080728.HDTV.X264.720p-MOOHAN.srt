00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:09,230
<i> Cultural assets and individuals in this
program have been altered fictionally.

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,260
<i> They have no real-life
associations with this drama.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,330
Bumsang isn't Robin Hood.

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,420
The real Robin Hood is...

5
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:32,350
General Shovel Taesoo Heo.
My father is Robin Hood.

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:41,470
Fine. Let's assume your father is alive.
Can you prove that he's Robin Hood?

7
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:46,340
Sowonhwagae scrapbook, "Chochung"
collection and "Maejukmun" vase.

8
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,460
All the items that were sent to the museum were items my father stole.

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,430
But that alone could be
mere coincidence, not evidence.

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:03,450
Logically speaking, yes,
but I just know that it's my father.

11
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,650
That he's stealing those items
in order to come back to Gyoon and me.

12
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,280
That's what I can't help thinking.

13
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,330
What do you want to do?

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,250
Please reopen the
official investigation of my father.

15
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,450
No, we can't do that.

16
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,480
Chief.

17
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,530
Chohee! There's no need for that.

18
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,260
If his case is reopened, everyone
will find out you're his daughter.

19
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,470
Things will become difficult for you.

20
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,390
I can deal with that, Chief.

21
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,470
Chohee!

22
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:52,630
My only concern is causing trouble
for Chief Noh. I don't care about myself.

23
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,550
So please begin
the official investigation.

24
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:08,220
Chief Kang, can you give us a moment?
I want to talk to Chohee privately.

25
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,490
Chohee.

26
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,280
Yes, Uncle.

27
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,250
Don't make me say it twice.
Let's lay this case to rest.

28
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,270
No more talk about
an official investigation.

29
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,240
No, Uncle. I can't do that.

30
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:49,430
Chief Kang is right. If the truth
comes out, you'll have a difficult time.

31
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,650
I can handle that.

32
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,660
It's okay even if I'm forced to quit
the regulations team because of Dad.

33
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:04,250
I've prepared myself for at least
that much. So please do as I wish.

34
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:10,230
Why are you rushing things? Matters like
these should be approached carefully.

35
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,400
Dad's in danger.

36
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,300
What do you mean?

37
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:20,400
Think about it. Only Chairman Jang's
most valued items have been stolen.

38
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,600
What do you think will happen
if his side catches Robin Hood first?

39
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,300
Dad's alive.

40
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:37,610
I know he is. And he's targeting
another one of Chairman Jang's items.

41
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:47,330
We have to find him before it's too late.
Or something bad might really happen.

42
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:53,520
I don't want to lose him again
while I stand by and do nothing.

43
00:03:55,370 --> 00:04:00,690
Chief, you'll help me, won't you?

44
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,660
It's like the chiefs are working
in a different time zone today.

45
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,430
The meeting should've started a
long time ago. Why aren't they here yet?

46
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,240
What are you muttering about now?

47
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,630
Bumsang, weren't you
with Chief Kang earlier?

48
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,500
Yes. They'll be here soon.

49
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,520
What could be taking them so long?

50
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,550
Well...

51
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,420
Big news, big news! Really big news!

52
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,410
Joohyun, what's wrong?

53
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:34,420
About Robin Hood!
They found out who Robin Hood is!

54
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:35,650
What?

55
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,230
Who is it?

56
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,210
Who did they say?
That... Shove...

57
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,460
Right! The Shoveling General!
They said it's the Shoveling General.

58
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,660
Who the heck is the Shoveling General?

59
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,480
General Shovel?
General Shovel? Taesoo Heo?

60
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,680
Yes.

61
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:56,650
And here's the shocker.
Chohee is that person's daughter.

62
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:02,450
What in the world? You can't assume that
because they have the same surname.

63
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,470
Joohyun, let's stop getting
caught up in nonsensical gossip.

64
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,380
It's the truth. I overheard Chief Noh
and the others talking in the office.

65
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,580
Joohyun is speaking the truth.

66
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:29,540
We do think Taesoo Heo is Robin Hood,
and I am his daughter.

67
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,320
My father was missing for seven years.

68
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:44,520
I really want to find him.
So please lend me a hand.

69
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,210
Who is it? Who dares to come
into my bedroom and rob me?

70
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:01,500
And the “Maejukmun”vase was a gift to
Iwazaki. How could you let this happen?

71
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,310
I'm sorry, sir.

72
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,320
What did the police say?

73
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:09,310
Well, this is not a situation
we can report to the police.

74
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:13,390
They were all national treasures,
so we can't claim good faith purchases.

75
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,670
So you want me to take
the hits sitting down?

76
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,640
I'm sorry.

77
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:23,300
I don't need your apologies.
Go and find out who the thief is!

78
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,530
Do whatever it takes and find out!

79
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:37,320
When she was young, she used to cry
every time I took her dad away.

80
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,570
Then one day she stopped crying.

81
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:51,530
She would silently look at me, and I thought, “Am I sinning against her?”

82
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,580
I tried to excuse myself
that I was just doing my job.

83
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,690
But I couldn't stop
the overwhelming regret and guilt.

84
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,330
I'm a father, too.

85
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:17,350
I never imagined this was
the debt you mentioned.

86
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:29,280
I cluelessly spoke lightly about
General Shovel in front of her.

87
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,320
Imagine how hurt
she must've been each time.

88
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,570
Why didn't you tip me off beforehand?

89
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,530
I considered it.

90
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:52,440
But why didn't you?

91
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,270
The loss of Jiyoon's mother
seemed too great for you.

92
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:06,550
That's why I didn't tell you. But seeing
you now, it seems I made a mistake.

93
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,590
Excuse me?

94
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:13,320
If I knew you liked Chohee
so much, I would've told you.

95
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:16,630
Chief.

96
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,320
Here, let's drink.

97
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,230
Chief Kang, let me give you
a piece of information.

98
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:46,480
In my opinion Chohee
and Bumsang are not dating.

99
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:54,660
If you let go of the hand of the person
you like, it's hard to grab on again.

100
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,540
So go grab her hand.
It's okay for you to do so.

101
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,470
That's my opinion.

102
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,400
Don't involve yourself
anymore in this case.

103
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:31,640
What? Why do you say that
out of the blue?

104
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,390
Because I feel bad.

105
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,260
How can I ask for your help
when I know what you went through...

106
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,440
because my dad stole
the “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook?

107
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,200
What if I don't care?

108
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,250
What?

109
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:58,300
Things are fine if I don't care whether or
not your dad stole it or something worse.

110
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:08,540
Thanks for trying to make me feel better,
but that'll only make me feel worse.

111
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:18,430
I want to at least maintain a certain level
of courtesy with you. You understand.

112
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,600
Understand what? Since when
did you worry about courtesy?

113
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,460
There you go again.

114
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,650
Fine! If you don't need my help,
it's all the better for me.

115
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:34,240
Hey, are you pissed again?

116
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,210
I'm not. Bye.

117
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,390
Hey! Are you really not pissed?

118
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,600
I said I'm not!

119
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,510
I'm not pissed, I'm hurt.
You dense woman.

120
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:06,370
Now I feel bad again. But it wouldn't
be right for me to ask for his help.

121
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,340
Chohee!

122
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,430
Chief.

123
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,380
You're late.

124
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,540
Yes. Did you wait long?

125
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,430
No, I just got here.

126
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,220
What brings you here?

127
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,610
Just.

128
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,250
What?

129
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,440
Just wanted to see your face.

130
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,210
Did you drink?
You did, didn't you?

131
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,640
Chohee.

132
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,360
Yes?

133
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,220
I'm sorry.

134
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,550
For what?

135
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,640
Until now I didn't know
anything about you at all.

136
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:17,690
Chief, the reason I didn't tell you
about my father is I lacked courage.

137
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:22,640
So if you apologize to me,
I'll be ashamed.

138
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:34,530
Just like you couldn't tell me about your
father, I I couldn't tell you something, too.

139
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,580
What is it?

140
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,590
I'll tell you later.

141
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:49,630
You can't mention it
and not tell me. What is it?

142
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:54,380
Later. I'll tell you
after we find your father.

143
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,490
I'm good now that
I've seen your face. Bye, then.

144
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,220
Goodbye.

145
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,270
I wonder what it is?

146
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:44,240
The items returned are designated
cultural assets and national treasures.

147
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,400
So you want me to single out
stolen national treasures...

148
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,570
that can't be good faith purchases?

149
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,550
Right.

150
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,650
Taesoo stole seven national treasures.

151
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:46,320
Take out the returned “Sowonhwagae”
scrapbook, the “Chochung” collection...

152
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,560
and the “Maejukmun” vase,
and there are four remaining.

153
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,530
They are Duryang Kim's “Sansu” painting,
the “Gimainmul” double goblets...

154
00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:01,220
the “Geumdongdae” incense burner, and the “Geumdongyeorae” standing Buddha.

155
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,440
Do you know who
gained possession of them?

156
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:11,280
It's strange, actually.

157
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:19,510
Most of Taesoo's items passed through
me, but he sold these seven on his own.

158
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:23,390
But you were in charge of distribution.

159
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:28,380
For the most part, yes. But once
in a while, he sold items directly.

160
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,600
And that's what he did
with these seven.

161
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:41,540
If we find the four items, we can
figure out Robin Hood's next move.

162
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:49,310
All three at the museum came from
Chairman Jang. Maybe he had all seven?

163
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:55,290
That's possible.
Chairman Jang might've sold some.

164
00:15:55,290 --> 00:16:00,490
So let's find out his dealers first
and if any were sold separately.

165
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,350
Yes, sir.

166
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,270
Uncle, I should buy you dinner
but I have somewhere to go.

167
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,290
It's okay. Go on. I'm sure
you'll buy me dinner later.

168
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,300
Of course. Thank you
for coming today, Uncle.

169
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,230
At least she's smiling.

170
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:34,560
Chief Noh, do you think
Taesoo really is alive?

171
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,690
I hope so.
For Chohee's sake, I hope he is.

172
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,660
I'm sure it wasn't easy coming here.

173
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,430
Thanks for acknowledging.

174
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,580
By the way, who was that in the
conference room? The guy from TV?

175
00:16:54,580 --> 00:17:01,650
Something Kim. Bumsang Kim, right?
He's the perfect husband for Chohee.

176
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:05,530
What's your problem?
I told you I have someone in mind!

177
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,460
Who? Chief Kang? Jeez, that widower
with a kid and our single girl?

178
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,550
Who says a widower
can't marry a single woman?

179
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,590
You want to ruin Chohee's future?

180
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,630
Who's ruining her future?

181
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,320
Your suggestion itself
is ruining her future!

182
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,330
You...

183
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,400
Chohee!

184
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,400
Why are you running
in this sweltering heat?

185
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,500
Where are you headed?

186
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,460
Why do you ask?

187
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,420
Why else? I'm going with you.

188
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,660
No, you're not.

189
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:38,400
I thought about it, and I think it works out
better for me if you're indebted to me.

190
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,420
What?

191
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:45,360
And I promised to help you find
your father. A man should keep his word.

192
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,630
You don't need to.

193
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,640
Where are we headed?

194
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,590
Chohee!

195
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:56,460
The “Sansu” painting was seen
at a gallery in Pyeongchang-dong.

196
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,520
Let's go.

197
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,260
Oh, Bumsang, I heard you've
been helping Chohee out a lot.

198
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,320
Since the investigations team is in charge
of the case now, you don't have to worry.

199
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,560
And I'm sorry for accusing you of
being Robin Hood yesterday.

200
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,530
No problem.

201
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,460
Chohee, let's hurry.

202
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,500
Director Kang,
what are you saying?

203
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,440
They may be national treasures,
but thieves must still be arrested.

204
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,270
Isn't that a given?

205
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,440
I'll talk to you again soon.

206
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:00,650
The CHA is a pathetic institution
full of incompetent fools.

207
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,250
What did you find out?

208
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,200
I found out who
the CHA thinks is Robin Hood.

209
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,320
Yeah? Who is it?

210
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,580
They think it's Taesoo Heo.

211
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:15,500
Taesoo Heo? Who's that?

212
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,250
General Shovel Taesoo Heo?

213
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,590
Oh, your hands...

214
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,220
Your hands are so pretty for a guy.

215
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,510
You have great skin.

216
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:43,530
Do you want to eat?

217
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,530
Lil' Bro, why are you
holding up these busy ladies?

218
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,690
Hello, Bro!

219
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:54,240
Stop bothering these charming ladies
and let's go. Excuse us.

220
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,320
He called us charming!

221
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,660
Once they get a hold of you,
it's hard to get away.

222
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,440
You came here for nothing.
Your sister's not here.

223
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:11,260
I didn't come to see her.
I promised to meet Uncle Hwang here.

224
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,260
And I remembered
you were here, too, Bro.

225
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,360
I'm starting to get used to
you calling me that.

226
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,290
Is the Robin Hood
investigation going well?

227
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:26,310
What?

228
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,300
Who does the regulations team
think is Robin Hood?

229
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:38,350
Your sister didn't tell you? The truth is,
everyone thinks it might be your father.

230
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,310
My dad as Robin Hood?

231
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:46,220
I think she didn't want you to worry,
so maybe I shouldn't have told you.

232
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:53,410
My sister's like that. She still
thinks I'm a kid in grade school.

233
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,210
She probably didn't tell me
because she thought I'd worry.

234
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:03,480
Robin Hood is still a thief, after all.

235
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,200
But I worry more about her.

236
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,530
You do?

237
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:21,340
She's searching so hard for Dad,
so what if...

238
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:28,480
I mean, I desperately want him
to be alive, too, but if he isn't...

239
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,400
I don't think
I can watch her get hurt.

240
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,450
You care for her a lot, don't you?

241
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:45,440
She raised me from when I was kid,
acting as both my mother and father.

242
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,670
Dad might be the most
important person to her...

243
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:57,200
but she's my most important person.
She's all I have.

244
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:03,430
You're all grown up. I'll tell her to stop
treating you like a kid when I see her.

245
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,330
Excuse me.

246
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,440
Hey, Jonggyu.
Yeah, of course. I'll go.

247
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,450
All right, see you later.

248
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,500
I wish I could have dinner with you,
but I have to attend an alumni reunion.

249
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,330
An alumni reunion?

250
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,440
The “Sansu” painting at the gallery was
Jung Lee's, not Duryang Kim's. Your turn.

251
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,380
Chairman Jang is suspected
of dealing stolen goods...

252
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:32,310
but I'm not sure if it's
one of the four national treasures.

253
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:36,410
So we're going to stakeout
Chairman Jang's house.

254
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,270
Straightaway? Right now?

255
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:42,560
Of course now.
Let's hurry, we have no time.

256
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,640
Chief, we'll see you later.

257
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,590
Have a good day.

258
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,600
It's hard running around
doing legwork, right?

259
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,620
No, I'm just doing my job.

260
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,540
Um, Chohee?

261
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,220
Excuse me.

262
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,250
Hey, Gyoon.

263
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,640
You're with Chief Noh?
And Uncle Hwang?

264
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,250
Okay, I'll be right there. Yeah.

265
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:22,220
Chief, I'm so sorry.
I think I have to head out first.

266
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,600
No, no. You have to go.
Go on then.

267
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:31,500
Have a good day.
I'm leaving.

268
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,650
Chief!

269
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,680
Joohyun.

270
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,250
I brought the documents
you requested.

271
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,350
Thanks.

272
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:00,330
He doesn't look so good.

273
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:09,410
Is it because I didn't ask him to dinner?
Jeez, how bothersome.

274
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,490
Chief!

275
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,200
Your sister's coming right away?

276
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,270
No.

277
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,350
She has a lot of work to do
at the investigations office?

278
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:24,230
No, that's not it.

279
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:31,500
Uncles, I've decided
to marry off my sister.

280
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,480
So I sent Sis into
Bumsang Kim's arms tonight.

281
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,650
What?

282
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,410
How strange of Chief Noh
to want to eat at a place like this.

283
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,330
Where are they?

284
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,500
You skipped the last grad school alumni
reunion. What brings you out here today?

285
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:13,500
I told you I was sick last time! And I'm
leaving after greeting the professors.

286
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,550
The great Bumsang graced
our presence without a date?

287
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,330
Did you ever see me with a woman
after I joined the CHA?

288
00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:22,430
Why didn't you bring Chohee?

289
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:25,220
She's busy.

290
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,400
Why? Chasing Robin Hood?
Still, you should've asked her.

291
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,400
Why bring it up at all?
She's too busy to come.

292
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,330
But Bumsang, are you saying
you wanted to bring Chohee?

293
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:45,300
Didn't I tell you not to call her by
her first name? You hardly know her.

294
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,460
What else would I call her
if not by her given name?

295
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,660
Heo.

296
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,270
Ms.

297
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,320
Maybe I should've
just mentioned it to her.

298
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:07,250
Isn't that Chohee?

299
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,650
[Sis, you've probably arrived by now.
Have a good time with Bro.]

300
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,560
What is he talking about?

301
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,500
Hey.

302
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:25,260
Huh? What are you doing here?

303
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,580
Isn't it obvious? An alumni reunion.
What are you doing here?

304
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,200
Gyoon wanted me to meet him here.

305
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,300
Gyoon did?

306
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,310
Yeah.

307
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,490
So he planned this.

308
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,470
What's that?

309
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,320
I met him briefly at the CHA today.

310
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,550
I told him I was dateless, and he kept
asking me where it was being held.

311
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,320
I didn't expect this.

312
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,630
He did something
completely uncalled for.

313
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,240
Have a good time at your reunion.
I'll be going then.

314
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,310
You're leaving?

315
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:13,230
Of course I'm leaving. Why would I stay?
I don't have the peace of mind to stay.

316
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:17,280
There seems to be a lot of
beautiful women inside. Have fun.

317
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,390
Hey.

318
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,390
What?

319
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,590
You should at least eat
before you leave.

320
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:23,610
Huh?

321
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,420
I mean, you have to eat anyway.

322
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,550
And I'm leaving soon, too.
Let's eat and leave together.

323
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,400
Let go for a sec.

324
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,490
Okay.

325
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,430
If you come alone, they don't
discount the membership fee, right?

326
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,690
Of course they don't.

327
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:45,360
Yeah? Then we should eat.

328
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,560
Let's sit here.

329
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,380
Bumsang! Bumsang Kim!

330
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,460
Stay here while I go say hello.

331
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,580
All right.

332
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,640
Look who it is.
It's Bumsang Kim.

333
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,230
It's been a while.

334
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:15,200
Bumsang, I thought you'd be too
embarrassed to show your face tonight.

335
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,690
Why would I be embarrassed?

336
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,690
Ah, getting cut from my lectures
and the TV show? I'm fine with it.

337
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,670
Liar. Aren't you mad jealous right now
because I took over everything you had?

338
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,620
Whatever, good for you.

339
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:36,500
Hey Yongcheol, you do know
how scary netizens are these days, right?

340
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,310
Study some before you make a fool
of yourself by saying something stupid.

341
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,490
What? How rude.

342
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:46,560
Stop it already. Why do
you guys fight whenever you meet?

343
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:53,430
Did you hear? Chairman Jang
is majorly investing in me these days.

344
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:58,230
I doubt that. He's probably
investing in your father, Minister Gong.

345
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:03,580
Whatever! He wants to put me in charge
of the school and his private art gallery.

346
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,680
He even sent us a gift recently.

347
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,600
A gift? What kind of gift?

348
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,610
Let me just say
that it's very valuable.

349
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,500
Anyway, I pity you
for floundering around...

350
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,350
like a fish out of water
after Chairman Jang cut you loose.

351
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,600
My date is waiting for me, so...

352
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,530
That laugh,
I swear I'm gonna kill him.

353
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:38,200
Leave him be. Him being
an ass is nothing new.

354
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,340
Why don't us dateless people
share a drink?

355
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,630
Jonggyu, you can enjoy drinking.

356
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,680
What?

357
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,430
Hey, isn't that Chohee?

358
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,450
How did that happen?

359
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,480
So Chief, why is it that
you're always buying me food?

360
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,460
You always come at mealtimes.

361
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,480
That's totally an excuse, isn't it?

362
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,610
Why else?

363
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,390
Aren't you trying to build up our
relationshipthrough shared meals?

364
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:19,400
How can eating a meal together
add anything to a relationship?

365
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:24,450
Chief, loads of couples strengthen
their relationship by eating together.

366
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:30,350
You seem indifferent
but you're secretly pretty sly.

367
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,220
What? Sly?

368
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,500
You're the one
who asked me to dinner.

369
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,540
I did, didn't I?

370
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:48,630
Fine. I won't ever eat
with you again. Satisfied?

371
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,360
What?

372
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,670
You can eat with me...

373
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,480
Jealous?

374
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,410
Yeah right.
They do look good together, though.

375
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:17,470
Why don't you go up
and perform a song for us?

376
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,320
Only couples are allowed.
Want to go up?

377
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,470
No, thank you.
You can do it by yourself.

378
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:28,430
You said they looked good up there.
Singing one song is no big deal.

379
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:31,300
Look at them, they're just belting it.

380
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:37,470
I can't sing. Gyoon takes after
my dad so he's good.

381
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,380
Your father was good at singing?

382
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,460
Yeah. He was really good.

383
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:51,440
The funny thing was that he only
sang hymns when he was drunk.

384
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,370
Hymns?

385
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:59,350
Yeah. Said he liked hymns because they're “nice” songs. Isn't that hilarious?

386
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,530
You'll find him soon.

387
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,290
I hope so.

388
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,380
Stay put.

389
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,290
Hello, fellow alumni.
I'm Bumsang Kim from the class of 97.

390
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:32,300
There's a person I really want to sing with,
so I came up despite the embarrassment.

391
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:41,470
I hope that she can forget her troubles
today and be happy, if only momentarily.

392
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:51,220
Hey, where are you going? Huh?

393
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,410
Everyone, I think she's shy,
so please give her a hand.

394
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,460
You're dead after this is over.

395
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,630
It's okay.
I'll die with no regrets.

396
00:33:49,300 --> 00:34:00,280
<i>I hope I'm the first person you think of
when you wake up in the morning

397
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,640
<i>The way I think of you

398
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:14,560
<i>I hope I'm also the person you want
to share the good things with

399
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,410
<i>Though you'll probably leave me

400
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:36,410
<i>Yes, I know that right now
love is a fear you need to avoid

401
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:50,590
<i>You asked me uneasily if I knew that
when love deepens, it becomes sadness

402
00:34:50,590 --> 00:35:08,510
<i>But what you don't know is inexplicable sadness can give us the strength to live

403
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:44,590
<i>Yes, I know that right now
love is a fear you need to avoid

404
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:59,300
<i>You asked me uneasily if I knew that
when love deepens, it becomes sadness

405
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:17,660
<i>But what you don't know is inexplicable sadness can give us the strength to live

406
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:43,460
Hey, why are you out here?
Are you buzzed?

407
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,290
No, I'm just a little embarrassed.

408
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:51,490
You're pretty good at singing.
I thought you were someone else.

409
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,570
What aren't I good at?

410
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:01,360
When I first saw you in Japan,
I really thought you were a thief.

411
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:06,430
And when I saw you again at the CHA,
I thought you were a crook.

412
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,380
A crook?

413
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,420
To put in your terms,
you looked like a fake.

414
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:17,690
Now do you realize how bad
you are at evaluating men?

415
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:24,460
My realization hasn't reached that far yet.
But I do know one thing.

416
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:29,650
You're not a fake
to carelessly throw out.

417
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:37,410
You know what? For the most part,
the fakes tend to look more authentic.

418
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,690
Treasures are like that.

419
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,330
Authentic items can still be
authentic with a piece missing...

420
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,660
but fakes are imitations
no matter how beautiful.

421
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:55,390
The problem is that people don't
realize the value of their treasures.

422
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,200
I'm talking about you.

423
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,540
You should definitely find your father,
but value yourself more.

424
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:09,670
If you wait for him with an untroubled
heart, you'll meet him for sure.

425
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,390
Do you really think so?

426
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,340
Of course. Those fated
to meet will surely reunite.

427
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:20,270
Those tied together by the string
of fate will surely meet again..

428
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:24,530
If not in this life, then the next.

429
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:32,430
If it's impossible in this life,
then I hope it happens in my next life.

430
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:35,490
Why are you worried?
You still have a long life to live.

431
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:39,680
Don't worry. I'll do everything
in my power to help you.

432
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:43,260
Let's go in and have another drink.

433
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,340
Hey.

434
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:50,540
I got to sing in public thanks to you.

435
00:38:52,480 --> 00:39:00,640
I'd forgotten all about feeling happy,
but I was able to momentarily remember.

436
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,490
So thanks.

437
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,360
Chohee.

438
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,330
Yeah?

439
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:21,500
This time, I'm asking you
formally beforehand.

440
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,390
Lend me your lips.

441
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,440
What?

442
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,620
I'll be going then.

443
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,260
I'll take you home.

444
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,200
No, I'm more comfortable
going on my own.

445
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,270
Bye.

446
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,590
Oh, how sad my life is.

447
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,640
Is that you, Sis?
How was your date with Bro?

448
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,450
Sis! How was your date?

449
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:54,290
What's up with her?
How strange.

450
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,410
Oh my god, oh my god.

451
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,220
Why did I do that?

452
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:52,270
She thinks I'll miss
seeing her at her size?

453
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,380
Oh my god.
What do I do?

454
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:01,240
Oh! Chief.

455
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,690
Look forward while you're walking.

456
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,250
I'm sorry.

457
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,330
Did you have fun
with Chief Noh yesterday?

458
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:08,210
Yeah...

459
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:13,510
I found a middleman who met your dad
right after his release from prison.

460
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:17,370
I'm going now to meet him.
Want to come?

461
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:20,580
Is it okay if I tag along?

462
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,520
Of course. Let's go.

463
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,290
He came to borrow money.

464
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:41,450
He needed two grand. I didn't have
enough so I lent him twelve hundred.

465
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,300
Did he say anything else?

466
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,680
I asked him why he needed
the money, but he wouldn't answer.

467
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:53,440
I stopped asking, but he looked
strangely nervous about something.

468
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,490
What do you mean?

469
00:43:55,490 --> 00:44:03,330
He'd fidget and keep looking around.
It seemed like he was being chased.

470
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:07,310
Chased? By whom?

471
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:10,340
Since he was just released,
I doubt it was the police.

472
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:17,530
He just kept saying he was all right,
so I'm not sure what was going on.

473
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:28,290
We bury some Goryeo celadon
that Bumsang's grandfather made.

474
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:32,530
Then later we distribute them
with a fake appraisal by Bumsang.

475
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,680
He'll get into trouble with the police.
We'll make money and get him good.

476
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,690
That's not our priority right now.
Stop with the nonsense.

477
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:44,210
What?

478
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,500
Didn't you tell me seven years ago
that Taesoo Heo was definitely dead?

479
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,460
Yes, I did.

480
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:57,470
Then why is he stealing my things? How
is the dead Taesoo stealing from me?

481
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:06,370
Did you see his dead body?
Did you see it with your own eyes?

482
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,680
Um, the thing is...
What happened was...

483
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,350
What else would I expect from you?

484
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:18,410
Go find him immediately.
If you don't, you're a dead man. Got it?

485
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:20,390
Yes, sir.

486
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:22,480
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

487
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,330
That imbecile.

488
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:43,250
Was Minister Gong
satisfied with the gift?

489
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:46,530
Yes. But I wonder
if it will do any good.

490
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:50,390
The world can change, but people
and money will never change.

491
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,630
What gift should I prepare for when you
meet Chairman Iwazaki this weekend?

492
00:45:55,430 --> 00:45:58,260
Find a celadon on par
with the “Maejukmun” vase.

493
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:02,520
If that old fogey doesn't like it,
all our efforts will have been for naught.

494
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,460
Search out only the best.

495
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,250
- Officer Cho!
- What, what? What?

496
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,210
What?

497
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:27,430
Nothing, go back to sleep.

498
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,440
Hey, who's that?

499
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:41,550
Isn't that the secretary?

500
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:52,280
Why did you leave so early yesterday?
And Chohee, too. Did something happen?

501
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:54,630
Hey!

502
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:55,650
Huh?

503
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,330
Did you drink until late?

504
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,310
Don't even ask.

505
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:04,470
Yongcheol boasted about his father
so much that he ruined the mood.

506
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:07,370
Why's he like that?

507
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:09,240
Let him be.

508
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:13,380
Despite everything, we all know
how great his love is for his father.

509
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,590
The problem is he goes around
hurting his father's reputation.

510
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:21,500
Like how he mentioned the gift from
Chairman Jang. That's a bribe, not a gift.

511
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,540
A bribe from Chairman Jang?

512
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:31,260
It's obvious. You know well that Chairman
Jang doesn't give gifts without reason.

513
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:35,630
What was the gift?

514
00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:41,520
How would I know? I'm assuming
some expensive pottery or painting.

515
00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:46,520
Yongcheol's father is quite the collector
himself, so it's probably something big.

516
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:52,470
Chairman Jang gave
Minister Gong a bribe.

517
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,560
Jonggyu.

518
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,510
Yeah?

519
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:59,410
Can you subtly try asking
Yongcheol what the gift was?

520
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:29,360
‘It seemed like he was being chased.'

521
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:31,360
Chohee, let's go in.

522
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,690
What's wrong, Chohee?
Are you okay?

523
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:46,650
You're thinking about what we heard
earlier regarding your father.

524
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:52,330
I can't help being uneasy.

525
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,470
There's nothing to worry about.
That news was from seven years ago.

526
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:59,240
Someone might've chased
him then, but not anymore.

527
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:01,670
I hope so, Chief.

528
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,680
But I don't know why
I feel so apprehensive.

529
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:11,680
If something happened to him...

530
00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:17,350
It's okay.
Everything's going to be all right.

531
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,470
Chief, excuse me.

532
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:54,520
Bumsang.

533
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,220
Hey, Bumsang!

534
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:03,470
Bumsang, can we talk?

535
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,310
About what?

536
00:50:06,690 --> 00:50:12,260
You seem to be misunderstanding
something. Chief and I were...

537
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,460
Stop. I don't want to hear it.

538
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,480
Are you mad at me?

539
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:26,670
No. I'm not mad.
But I am a bit dumbfounded.

540
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:30,570
Bumsang.

541
00:50:30,570 --> 00:50:34,350
Yesterday you were in my arms,
and today you're in his.

542
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,240
Don't you think
it's a little ridiculous?

543
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,560
What? Ridiculous?

544
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:48,340
You don't even care to listen
to what I have to say.

545
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:56,350
Fine, think what you want.
But know this, Bumsang. I...

546
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,210
Let's just stop.

547
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,660
Why did you say that?

548
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,570
Why did you say that to Chohee?

549
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:47,620
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.
Don't misunderstand.

550
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:53,200
Now I have to explain
my feelings to you, too?

551
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,350
Chohee was in shock after hearing
that someone was chasing her father.

552
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,480
She was struggling to
handle that, so I hugged her.

553
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,650
You saw that and misunderstood.

554
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:11,590
What exactly are
your feelings towards her?

555
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,320
If neither of you is serious,
then you should drop the act...

556
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:19,560
What if I am serious?

557
00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:24,410
What if I do sincerely like her?

558
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:32,280
I fully understand why you're saying
all this and how you feel towards Chohee.

559
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:37,370
Please keep in mind
that I, too, am serious about her.

560
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,340
Bumsang!

561
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,520
You're here early today.

562
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,610
Yeah.

563
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:43,230
Why aren't you two saying anything?
Did you have a lovers' spat?

564
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:46,670
Joohyun, I'm going ahead.

565
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,320
Hey, we need to talk.

566
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:53,590
I have nothing to say to you.

567
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:03,560
Bumsang, what happened? People
like her are scary when they're mad.

568
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,310
Good luck.

569
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:10,340
Chohee! Wait up!

570
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,360
‘If neither of you is serious...'

571
00:54:15,360 --> 00:54:18,600
‘What if I am serious?
What if I do sincerely like her?'

572
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:21,230
Chief.

573
00:54:22,670 --> 00:54:23,650
Yes, Officer Cho?

574
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:27,520
I think Chairman Jang will be
on the move tonight with an item.

575
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,670
What item?

576
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:34,400
We're not sure,
but Officer Park says it's pottery.

577
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,690
He saw the secretary holding
a box designed for pottery.

578
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,530
Did you verify whom he's meeting?

579
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:42,580
We found out it's a Japanese person
after tailing the secretary yesterday.

580
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,500
So he's attempting
to smuggle it abroad?

581
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,410
I guess we'll find out
if we raid them tonight.

582
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,480
Robin Hood probably
knows about tonight, right?

583
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,320
Of course he knows.

584
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,330
He managed to steal all those items
because he's in Chairman Jang's vicinity.

585
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:02,340
What should we do?
Should we set the ball rolling?

586
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:21,300
Chief, they're on the move.

587
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:24,210
Got it. We're on our way.
Everyone, let's go!

588
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:24,670
Yes, sir.

589
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,260
Daegil!

590
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:34,400
The plan to arrest Robin Hood is in
motion? All right, we're on our way.

591
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:37,280
We're going on a mission
with Chief Noh absent?

592
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:42,480
Don't worry. I will fill
his shoes while he's gone.

593
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,460
Come on, let's go catch Robin Hood.

594
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:47,320
Why are you so tactless?

595
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:55,350
Isn't it better for you not to go, Chohee?
It'll be weird if you meet your father there.

596
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:57,560
Chohee, sit out on the mission today.

597
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:03,240
No, I'm fine. I'm going, too.

598
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:06,610
Let's go.

599
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,340
‘We need to talk.'

600
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:11,360
‘I have nothing to say to you.'

601
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,260
Jonggyu, did you find out anything?

602
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:26,670
[Yongcheol wouldn't get specific,
but I think it's a statue of Buddha.]

603
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:28,610
A statue of Buddha?

604
00:56:28,610 --> 00:56:32,270
[I think you should meet him
and verify things yourself.]

605
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:35,330
Okay, thanks.

606
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,280
A statue of Buddha...

607
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:52,290
Oh, Bumsang, are you headed home?

608
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:54,640
Yes, did something happen?

609
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,420
We're on our way
to arrest Robin Hood.

610
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,450
Hey, we're busy! Hurry, hurry!

611
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:01,230
He thinks he's chief.

612
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:02,400
Bumsang, see you tomorrow.

613
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:33,230
Chief, Chairman Jang's in sight.

614
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:33,690
And the item?

615
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:37,310
The secretary has it.
He's carrying it in right now.

616
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:40,390
I wonder if Robin Hood
will show up today.

617
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,530
Who knows?
We'll find out, I guess.

618
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:55,510
Forgive me for making you wait.

619
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:05,220
It's okay. It's been a long time
since we met, Chairman Jang.

620
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:11,530
Can I help...

621
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:15,280
We had a tip about an illegal trade today.
We ask for your cooperation.

622
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:38,200
Thank you sparing the time
to meet me, Chairman Iwazaki.

623
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:46,270
I hope for boundless growth
between our two companies.

624
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:59,290
If we were to join forces, we could
conquer the Asian market easily.

625
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:17,560
I've been keeping an eye on the Ohseong
Group. I'm here hoping for good results.

626
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,600
Thank you, Chairman Iwazaki.

627
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:30,390
Goodness, we were so busy talking
business that I forgot about the gift.

628
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:32,340
Kim, the gift.

629
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,240
I'm always receiving gifts from you...

630
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:47,470
Since you're well known
for your interest in Goryeo celadon...

631
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:50,430
it was extremely hard choosing
an appropriate gift for you.

632
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:58,430
What is it? What is it?

633
00:59:58,430 --> 00:59:59,360
Maybe it's Robin Hood?

634
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,380
Shh!

635
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:07,330
What the!

636
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:12,410
I'm Chief Shiwan Kang
of the investigations team.

637
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:14,270
We ask for your cooperation.

638
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:24,270
The item's still here.

639
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:29,390
I'm sorry. There was an outage
due to a power overload.

640
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,490
Then it was a real power outage?

641
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:36,370
What about Robin Hood?

642
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,640
What a nice house Yongcheol lives in.

643
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,590
Robin Hood?

644
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,680
Are you Taesoo Heo?

645
01:01:22,290 --> 01:02:15,370

1
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,220
<i>Un coup du champagne
si vous plait.</i>

2
00:01:03,565 --> 00:01:06,434
<i>Garcon, e cafe si vous plait.</i>

3
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:12,035
<i>T'as destres beaux yeux,
je peu t'acheter un verre?</i>

4
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:36,584
<i>Bonjour, Giles.</i>

5
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,547
<i>Ca va?</i>

6
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,009
You're late.

7
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:41,026
<i>Ca va bien, merci.</i>

8
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:44,736
So how's my girl?

9
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:46,568
Serviced and ready to go.

10
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:54,371
Papers are in the glove box.

11
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,359
I got you something.

12
00:01:57,642 --> 00:01:59,017
Just a little bon voyage.

13
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,334
You open it.

14
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,541
So you don't get lost.

15
00:02:11,242 --> 00:02:12,933
Maybe I want to.

16
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,552
I'll miss you, Holly.

17
00:02:22,922 --> 00:02:24,449
Come here.

18
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:37,860
<i>Ladies, I'd like
to introduce you to Giles.</i>

19
00:02:37,898 --> 00:02:42,120
As you can see,
he's a real peach.

20
00:02:42,154 --> 00:02:44,488
He's quick to learn
and eager to please.

21
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:45,929
He doesn't get tired,

22
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:48,863
and he goes off
like a firecracker.

23
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:05,255
What more could a girl want?

24
00:08:13,984 --> 00:08:15,708
You looking for a lay?

25
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:20,917
Oi.

26
00:08:28,096 --> 00:08:29,656
You shopping?

27
00:08:29,696 --> 00:08:31,125
How much?

28
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:40,086
What are you after,
handsome?

29
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:42,516
A handjob.

30
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,446
How much?

31
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:46,039
50?

32
00:08:47,263 --> 00:08:49,980
Without a condom,
and dirty talk.

33
00:08:57,727 --> 00:09:00,760
Well, don't just sit there.

34
00:09:07,326 --> 00:09:09,399
Don't you have any lube?

35
00:09:09,438 --> 00:09:10,366
What?

36
00:09:10,398 --> 00:09:12,187
Lube.
KY.

37
00:09:12,222 --> 00:09:13,237
Um...

38
00:09:15,294 --> 00:09:17,017
- Out.
- What?

39
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:21,015
I'm not paying top dollar
for amateur hour.

40
00:09:21,054 --> 00:09:22,330
I'll be good.
I promise.

41
00:09:22,366 --> 00:09:23,446
Fuck that.

42
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:26,588
You can do anything.

43
00:09:29,214 --> 00:09:30,676
20 bucks.

44
00:09:38,429 --> 00:09:40,087
Show me your tits.

45
00:09:56,573 --> 00:09:58,678
Gonna be a good girl?

46
00:10:08,348 --> 00:10:09,657
Give me your hand.

47
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:26,454
Oh, that's better.

48
00:10:27,516 --> 00:10:31,029
Now, what's a sweet face like
you doing hawking your fork?

49
00:10:32,316 --> 00:10:33,494
I'm broke.

50
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,703
That's not what
I'm paying you for.

51
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,081
Come on.

52
00:10:38,524 --> 00:10:42,233
Now, what's a sweet thing
like you doing on the streets?

53
00:10:43,548 --> 00:10:45,010
I love sex.

54
00:10:45,052 --> 00:10:46,459
Yes.

55
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:47,866
Um, I'm a slut.

56
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,427
I just can't get enough.

57
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:50,645
Yeah, you fucking whore.

58
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,406
You're all the same.

59
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:54,232
Oh, baby, I can feel
you getting hot.

60
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:55,511
That's better.

61
00:10:55,547 --> 00:10:56,660
How old are you?

62
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,073
17.

63
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:00,277
You like us young?

64
00:11:00,315 --> 00:11:02,355
Young and tight.

65
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:04,283
Come on, dirtier.

66
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:07,992
Ah, my tight, young pussy's
aching for your big juicy cock.

67
00:11:08,027 --> 00:11:09,172
Take it, you bitch.

68
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,160
Make me beg.

69
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:11,097
I'll teach you.

70
00:11:11,131 --> 00:11:12,593
Teach me a lesson.

71
00:11:12,635 --> 00:11:14,544
Oh, you fucking whore.

72
00:11:14,587 --> 00:11:17,270
Oh, make me scream.
Come on, come on.

73
00:11:17,306 --> 00:11:18,964
That's better.
That's better.

74
00:11:19,003 --> 00:11:20,432
Yes.

75
00:11:20,475 --> 00:11:21,784
Harder!

76
00:11:21,818 --> 00:11:23,062
No!

77
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:36,335
Where did you get this?

78
00:11:36,378 --> 00:11:38,320
Freedom of Information.

79
00:11:38,362 --> 00:11:39,791
Got mine as well.

80
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,345
Look at you.

81
00:11:44,378 --> 00:11:47,193
The prick made me suck him off
then arrested me anyway.

82
00:11:48,602 --> 00:11:51,122
Ligurian arrested me.

83
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:53,616
His kid had just been born.

84
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:57,527
Does he know?

85
00:11:57,562 --> 00:11:59,187
I'm meeting him for dinner.

86
00:11:59,226 --> 00:12:01,495
Don't you tell him, Holly.

87
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:03,090
He'll stop you if he finds out.

88
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,985
I can't just disappear.

89
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:07,603
Forget the past.

90
00:12:07,641 --> 00:12:10,957
In Paris,
it'll be all future.

91
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:14,702
To the end.

92
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:15,760
To the beginning.

93
00:12:17,465 --> 00:12:18,610
clink!

94
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:26,195
Show it to me.

95
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:36,051
First class.

96
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:40,535
I'm proud of you, Holly.

97
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:45,071
A little something
to help you stay retired.

98
00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:47,887
Happy birthday.

99
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,144
I don't know what to say.

100
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,736
Say a prayer for me
in that hunchback's church.

101
00:13:08,248 --> 00:13:10,517
I never thanked you.

102
00:13:10,551 --> 00:13:12,690
What for?

103
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:15,149
Giving me a chance.

104
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:21,652
Why did you pick me?

105
00:13:22,423 --> 00:13:24,016
I needed a blonde.

106
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,525
You looked tough.

107
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,315
You looked like a survivor.

108
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:34,031
I wasn't wrong.

109
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,621
Be careful, Holly.

110
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,728
Don't forget what he is.

111
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,783
Say something to me in French.

112
00:14:14,262 --> 00:14:17,109
Don't say what it means.

113
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:34,928
What are you after?

114
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:35,892
A hand job would be good.

115
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:37,386
50, up front.

116
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,496
- Hi.
- Hi.

117
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,255
Got a spare ciggie?

118
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,720
Don't smoke.

119
00:15:35,763 --> 00:15:37,192
Nobody smokes anymore.

120
00:15:37,235 --> 00:15:38,315
It's feral, eh?

121
00:15:38,356 --> 00:15:39,632
Stunts your growth.

122
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:41,456
Puts you in an early grave.

123
00:15:41,491 --> 00:15:42,539
What's your name?

124
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:43,953
Shay.

125
00:15:43,987 --> 00:15:46,605
I'm Cindy.

126
00:15:46,643 --> 00:15:47,821
Buy me a soft serve, Shay?

127
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:49,932
I'll pay you back.

128
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:52,338
Okay.

129
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:55,534
Can I get a soft serve,
small fries, and a Coke?

130
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:24,553
Don't flash your money around.

131
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:27,409
There's a lot of eyes,
and they're always watching.

132
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:38,633
You must be starving, eh?

133
00:16:38,674 --> 00:16:39,688
You want some?

134
00:16:39,729 --> 00:16:41,006
This'll fill me up.

135
00:16:41,874 --> 00:16:43,401
I'm a real sweet tooth.

136
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:47,431
Haven't seen you
around here before.

137
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:48,553
I just got here.

138
00:16:58,097 --> 00:16:59,438
Can you lend me a dollar?

139
00:16:59,473 --> 00:17:00,400
I'll pay you back.

140
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:01,993
I can get a smoke for a dollar.

141
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:07,494
You're a real friend.

142
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,143
Don't keep your cash
in your pocket either.

143
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,046
Happy birthday, Holly.

144
00:17:43,215 --> 00:17:44,524
Come here.

145
00:17:53,935 --> 00:17:55,593
Ever felt like running away?

146
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:59,496
Ever felt like
changing your life?

147
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,927
What's your dream, Holly?

148
00:18:06,959 --> 00:18:10,374
If you could do anything,
go anywhere, what would it be?

149
00:18:19,023 --> 00:18:21,706
Before my mum died,
she took me to Paris.

150
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,061
That's what I remember
about her.

151
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:29,476
She was happy.

152
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,773
I've always wanted to go back.

153
00:18:33,806 --> 00:18:35,235
Let's do it.

154
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:37,285
Let's go to Paris.

155
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:39,530
I'm getting out.

156
00:18:39,566 --> 00:18:42,249
I'm gonna disappear,
and I want you to come with me.

157
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:44,522
Money won't be a problem.

158
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:46,281
What about your family?

159
00:18:46,318 --> 00:18:48,074
I don't love them.

160
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:57,508
Open it.

161
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:09,413
Put it on.

162
00:19:09,454 --> 00:19:11,493
You have to.

163
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,540
It's bad luck otherwise.

164
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:20,778
What?

165
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,052
Let's go.

166
00:22:26,856 --> 00:22:28,743
Sorry.

167
00:22:28,776 --> 00:22:31,012
It's all right.

168
00:22:31,048 --> 00:22:33,469
Look me in the eyes
and say that.

169
00:22:38,951 --> 00:22:40,609
It's all right, Michael.

170
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:44,420
Pack your bags.

171
00:22:44,455 --> 00:22:47,488
Tomorrow I'll be rich enough
to set us free.

172
00:23:49,062 --> 00:23:51,069
Monkey, be quiet.

173
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,191
Fuck.

174
00:24:57,635 --> 00:24:59,490
I'll give you
the group discount.

175
00:24:59,523 --> 00:25:02,938
100 a hole, 50 a hand,
that's 350.

176
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:05,467
That's right boys.

177
00:25:05,507 --> 00:25:07,002
It's real too.

178
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:17,629
Fuck.

179
00:25:33,378 --> 00:25:34,426
Rocky.

180
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:35,513
Rock.

181
00:25:35,554 --> 00:25:37,659
I got her.
You fuckin' tryin' to avoid me?

182
00:25:37,698 --> 00:25:38,778
No.

183
00:25:38,818 --> 00:25:39,800
What the fuck
you runnin' from, then?

184
00:25:39,842 --> 00:25:41,500
You fuckin' scrote.
Where's my money?

185
00:25:41,538 --> 00:25:43,577
I seen her, Rock,
stealin' Karlene's trade.

186
00:25:43,618 --> 00:25:45,560
It's my stretch,
you fuckin' slut.

187
00:25:45,602 --> 00:25:47,096
No, no, no, I wasn't.

188
00:25:47,138 --> 00:25:48,066
That's fuckin' bullshit!

189
00:25:48,098 --> 00:25:49,243
Shut up, Karlene.

190
00:25:49,282 --> 00:25:50,743
Thinks she's so fuckin' good.

191
00:25:50,785 --> 00:25:53,567
Do somethin'.
Do somethin'!

192
00:25:53,602 --> 00:25:54,944
- Give us the money.
- I don't have any.

193
00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:55,905
What the fuck did you say?

194
00:25:55,937 --> 00:25:57,399
I spent it.

195
00:26:03,617 --> 00:26:04,632
See that?

196
00:26:04,674 --> 00:26:06,746
See fuckin' that?

197
00:26:06,785 --> 00:26:08,476
Fuckin' lying bitch.

198
00:26:08,514 --> 00:26:09,943
Listen, you fuckin' slut.

199
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,018
Next time, it's a hot shot.

200
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:16,570
Stay off our fuckin' street,
or you're dead, cunt.

201
00:26:23,072 --> 00:26:25,341
You fuckin' bitch.

202
00:26:32,705 --> 00:26:35,388
Bel, hey, it's Holly.

203
00:26:35,425 --> 00:26:37,530
Hi, are you working?

204
00:26:37,568 --> 00:26:39,259
Yeah, now.

205
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:41,052
No, no, no,
just a couple of hours.

206
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:43,706
Okay.

207
00:26:43,744 --> 00:26:45,948
Yeah, no, that's fine.
Bye.

208
00:26:45,984 --> 00:26:49,596
Um, well I'm swinging by yours,
like, in two minutes.

209
00:26:49,632 --> 00:26:50,745
I can come get you.

210
00:26:50,784 --> 00:26:52,093
It's good money.

211
00:26:53,984 --> 00:26:56,602
Yeah, no, that's not
gonna help me, so...

212
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,567
No, it's all right.

213
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,422
Okay, bye.

214
00:27:03,391 --> 00:27:05,301
Hey, Monique, it's Holly.

215
00:27:06,496 --> 00:27:08,056
You working?

216
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:09,753
It's good money.

217
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:11,580
Come on, Mon,
you're my last hope.

218
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:17,177
Yeah, thanks anyway.

219
00:27:20,031 --> 00:27:21,373
Dramas?

220
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,758
It's the night for it.

221
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:27,384
Full moon.

222
00:27:27,423 --> 00:27:29,333
Everyone's a little crazy.

223
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,131
Great.

224
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:33,436
Maybe I can help.

225
00:27:33,471 --> 00:27:35,991
Can you find me a brunette
who can fuck and suck?

226
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,557
Look out!

227
00:27:37,598 --> 00:27:38,842
Fuckin' asshole!

228
00:27:38,879 --> 00:27:40,089
Why don't you watch
where you're going?

229
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:41,304
You could've fuckin' killed me!

230
00:27:41,342 --> 00:27:42,869
You fuckin' idiot!

231
00:27:46,015 --> 00:27:48,381
She's perfect.

232
00:27:48,414 --> 00:27:51,164
Wait up.

233
00:27:51,198 --> 00:27:53,686
Hey, I'm talking to you.

234
00:27:53,726 --> 00:27:55,002
Fuck off!

235
00:27:55,998 --> 00:27:57,274
Want a job?

236
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,325
I said piss off, lady.

237
00:27:58,366 --> 00:28:00,602
Don't you understand English?

238
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:03,605
I need a girl right now,
and you're perfect.

239
00:28:03,646 --> 00:28:04,890
Threesome at the Hyatt.

240
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:06,452
Couple of hours, tops.

241
00:28:08,413 --> 00:28:10,039
It's 300.

242
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,255
When was the last time
you made that much?

243
00:28:18,046 --> 00:28:19,572
Nothing weird?

244
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,556
Nothing weird.

245
00:28:21,597 --> 00:28:23,091
Just one bloke?

246
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:25,337
Just me and the guy.

247
00:28:28,093 --> 00:28:29,402
$400.

248
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:33,975
Wait.

249
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:36,020
I need the money.

250
00:28:36,061 --> 00:28:37,337
Just give me a chance.

251
00:28:51,068 --> 00:28:53,108
How old are you?

252
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,839
19.

253
00:28:54,877 --> 00:28:56,502
Don't bullshit me.

254
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:59,162
17.

255
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,594
You got anything else
to wear?

256
00:29:03,325 --> 00:29:04,568
Just this.

257
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:07,257
Put it on.

258
00:29:12,475 --> 00:29:14,363
What's your name?

259
00:29:14,395 --> 00:29:15,737
Shay.

260
00:29:15,772 --> 00:29:17,266
It's $300, Shay.

261
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,129
Okay.

262
00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:22,614
I'm Holly.

263
00:29:22,652 --> 00:29:24,375
Let's go.

264
00:29:35,675 --> 00:29:37,911
You okay?

265
00:29:37,947 --> 00:29:39,954
Yeah.

266
00:29:39,995 --> 00:29:41,239
Nervous?

267
00:29:41,275 --> 00:29:42,202
No.

268
00:29:46,395 --> 00:29:48,118
Just follow my lead, okay?

269
00:31:18,073 --> 00:31:19,447
Better out than in.

270
00:31:21,272 --> 00:31:23,127
Present company excepted.

271
00:31:39,415 --> 00:31:40,593
You like that?

272
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:03,796
When I fuck you,
when I make you come,

273
00:32:03,831 --> 00:32:07,213
I know it's all an act,

274
00:32:07,255 --> 00:32:09,011
an illusion.

275
00:32:09,047 --> 00:32:11,633
It doesn't matter.

276
00:32:11,671 --> 00:32:14,060
I want the illusion.

277
00:32:14,103 --> 00:32:16,143
That's what I'm paying for.

278
00:32:17,847 --> 00:32:20,465
Just for an hour,
I've got the biggest dick...

279
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:25,005
The magic touch.

280
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:28,908
I can make you come
in under a minute.

281
00:32:36,343 --> 00:32:38,165
Prove it.

282
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,744
Oh, yeah.

283
00:34:03,155 --> 00:34:05,010
Mm.

284
00:34:10,164 --> 00:34:12,236
Yeah?

285
00:34:13,811 --> 00:34:15,218
No, no.

286
00:34:15,251 --> 00:34:16,495
You're early.

287
00:34:16,532 --> 00:34:18,768
No problem.

288
00:34:18,803 --> 00:34:21,422
Come up.

289
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:22,506
Fuck!

290
00:34:22,547 --> 00:34:23,474
I got business.

291
00:34:23,507 --> 00:34:26,223
Get in the bathroom
and shut up.

292
00:34:26,259 --> 00:34:27,819
Take your clothes.

293
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:29,102
Come on, move!

294
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:31,277
Move!

295
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,337
Hello, Willie.

296
00:34:58,578 --> 00:34:59,788
Lovely night for it.

297
00:34:59,826 --> 00:35:03,121
Yes, top night, Mr. Bennett.

298
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:05,837
Things went great,
I'm happy to say.

299
00:35:05,874 --> 00:35:07,729
Fine.

300
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,479
Well, come on.

301
00:35:14,514 --> 00:35:16,368
Make me happy.

302
00:35:29,777 --> 00:35:31,533
They loved the gear.

303
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,084
You too?
Did you love it too?

304
00:35:35,121 --> 00:35:36,266
Yeah.

305
00:35:36,305 --> 00:35:38,061
I had a taste, Mr. Bennett.

306
00:35:38,097 --> 00:35:40,617
I'm not gonna deny it.

307
00:35:40,657 --> 00:35:42,446
Of course you did, Willie.
Yeah.

308
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,488
A good salesman's
got to know his product.

309
00:35:44,529 --> 00:35:45,958
Here.

310
00:35:48,337 --> 00:35:50,955
You better count that.

311
00:36:16,848 --> 00:36:19,695
Do you like bowling, Willie?

312
00:36:19,727 --> 00:36:21,036
Dunno.
Why?

313
00:36:26,128 --> 00:36:29,444
Because now you're
a bowling ball.

314
00:37:57,293 --> 00:37:59,300
Drive!

315
00:37:59,341 --> 00:38:00,967
<i>You've rung Holly.</i>

316
00:38:01,005 --> 00:38:02,467
<i>I'm tied up right now,</i>

317
00:38:02,509 --> 00:38:04,134
<i>but if you leave your name
and number, I'll call you back</i>

318
00:38:04,173 --> 00:38:06,409
<i>to arrange an appointment.</i>

319
00:38:07,821 --> 00:38:09,315
Gotcha.

320
00:38:17,933 --> 00:38:19,307
Fuck.

321
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,289
Fuck.

322
00:38:20,332 --> 00:38:24,904
Calm down.

323
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,827
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Shh.

324
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,202
- He shot him in the head!
- Shut up!

325
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:30,825
I saw it!
I saw it!

326
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,282
Just calm down, all right?

327
00:38:33,324 --> 00:38:34,534
All right?

328
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:43,585
Oh, shit.

329
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:50,569
What the fuck
are you looking at?

330
00:38:50,603 --> 00:38:51,531
Where to?

331
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,473
Just drive.

332
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:59,108
He knew we were there.

333
00:38:59,147 --> 00:39:00,609
He didn't see us.

334
00:39:00,651 --> 00:39:01,763
How do you know?

335
00:39:01,803 --> 00:39:04,323
You're safe.

336
00:39:04,363 --> 00:39:06,273
Oh, fuck.

337
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:28,226
Stop.

338
00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:29,673
Stop!

339
00:39:33,866 --> 00:39:35,721
You don't know me.

340
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:37,412
I don't know you.

341
00:39:40,553 --> 00:39:41,982
Hey.

342
00:39:42,794 --> 00:39:45,030
Wait!

343
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:46,472
Where to?

344
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,828
Where can I take you?

345
00:39:51,785 --> 00:39:54,120
Look, give me a destination
or get out.

346
00:40:02,057 --> 00:40:03,301
You all right?

347
00:40:06,793 --> 00:40:09,411
Everyone's crazy tonight.

348
00:40:16,297 --> 00:40:18,468
What's that?

349
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:20,195
Don't worry.

350
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:23,102
Shh.

351
00:40:25,033 --> 00:40:27,269
Can't leave him at home.

352
00:40:27,304 --> 00:40:30,087
He's part of my act.

353
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,778
Look, can I take you somewhere?

354
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,367
I'm hungry.

355
00:40:42,568 --> 00:40:44,477
How about your favorite
restaurant?

356
00:41:42,311 --> 00:41:45,540
Vegas is the place
for any serious magician.

357
00:41:45,574 --> 00:41:49,316
My old man used to say
that if you conquer Vegas,

358
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:51,073
the world will follow.

359
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:52,932
If you could work
at any casino,

360
00:41:52,966 --> 00:41:53,915
which one would it be?

361
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,584
Caesar's.

362
00:41:55,622 --> 00:41:57,280
How come?

363
00:41:57,318 --> 00:41:59,228
It's the coolest.

364
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:02,336
And he played there once
on the same bill as Tom Jones.

365
00:42:02,373 --> 00:42:04,642
Who?

366
00:42:04,678 --> 00:42:06,500
Tom Jones?

367
00:42:06,534 --> 00:42:07,940
The singer.

368
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:12,194
Forget it.

369
00:42:16,069 --> 00:42:17,825
Your Dad sounds cool.

370
00:42:19,269 --> 00:42:21,603
Yeah, he was.

371
00:42:21,637 --> 00:42:24,932
I used to watch his shows
over and over.

372
00:42:31,365 --> 00:42:32,991
My dad was magic too.

373
00:42:33,029 --> 00:42:35,266
He disappeared when I was born.

374
00:42:43,685 --> 00:42:45,441
What, you never saw him?

375
00:42:47,972 --> 00:42:49,401
I got a stepdad.

376
00:43:01,252 --> 00:43:03,488
Aren't you cold?

377
00:43:03,524 --> 00:43:06,273
I left my coat at the hotel.

378
00:43:06,308 --> 00:43:07,933
Here.

379
00:43:13,956 --> 00:43:17,469
So what did you want to be
when you grew up?

380
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:21,465
I never had a dream
or anything.

381
00:43:21,507 --> 00:43:23,100
Not like you.

382
00:43:27,492 --> 00:43:29,695
Maybe I could be your...

383
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:34,968
Your lovely assistant.

384
00:43:44,419 --> 00:43:45,629
Hello, Holly.

385
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:48,928
I'm Willie's friend.

386
00:43:48,963 --> 00:43:50,686
You going somewhere?

387
00:43:50,723 --> 00:43:52,632
Where's your friend?

388
00:43:52,674 --> 00:43:53,819
Willie was a greedy turd.

389
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:55,135
He always got a double act.

390
00:43:55,171 --> 00:43:56,480
I don't know
what you're talking about.

391
00:43:59,746 --> 00:44:01,306
That was foreplay.

392
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:04,161
Do you want to fuck with me?

393
00:44:04,194 --> 00:44:06,779
Your friend
with the pink lipstick.

394
00:44:06,818 --> 00:44:07,745
She was from the street.

395
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:09,785
I don't know her name.

396
00:44:09,826 --> 00:44:10,939
Wrong answer.

397
00:45:04,736 --> 00:45:09,821
Look into my eyes and listen
to the sound of my voice.

398
00:45:09,857 --> 00:45:12,507
There is nothing
but the sound of my voice

399
00:45:12,545 --> 00:45:13,974
and my eyes.

400
00:45:16,448 --> 00:45:19,131
I will count backwards
from five.

401
00:45:19,168 --> 00:45:22,037
When I reach one,
you will be under my spell.

402
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,695
Five.

403
00:45:25,728 --> 00:45:28,598
I want you to completely
free your mind.

404
00:45:30,624 --> 00:45:32,315
Four.

405
00:45:32,352 --> 00:45:35,069
All tension flows
from your body.

406
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,516
Three.

407
00:45:39,552 --> 00:45:42,104
You feel totally relaxed.

408
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,589
Two.

409
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,379
You're light as a feather.

410
00:45:51,263 --> 00:45:53,019
One.

411
00:45:53,055 --> 00:45:55,925
A deep sleep envelopes you.

412
00:46:08,063 --> 00:46:10,234
Can you hear me?

413
00:46:10,271 --> 00:46:12,213
Yeah.

414
00:46:12,255 --> 00:46:13,716
Tell me your name.

415
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:16,028
Shay Maree Ryan.

416
00:46:17,726 --> 00:46:19,548
How old are you, Shay?

417
00:46:19,583 --> 00:46:21,176
17.

418
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:25,685
Tell me something
about yourself.

419
00:46:25,726 --> 00:46:27,635
I never forget a face.

420
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:33,337
Where are you from?

421
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,992
Up north.

422
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:38,648
Why are you here?

423
00:46:38,686 --> 00:46:40,541
Mum died, so I ran away.

424
00:46:43,774 --> 00:46:45,367
Sorry.

425
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:49,748
Do you have a boyfriend?

426
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:50,902
No.

427
00:46:59,997 --> 00:47:02,419
Look at me.

428
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:08,891
You're beautiful.

429
00:47:13,757 --> 00:47:15,186
Don't.

430
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:27,539
Can I see you again?

431
00:47:29,724 --> 00:47:32,571
<i>Do you want to see me
or see me?</i>

432
00:47:34,748 --> 00:47:35,828
I want to see you.

433
00:47:42,396 --> 00:47:44,436
"Harry the Impossible."

434
00:47:44,476 --> 00:47:47,029
Will you call?

435
00:47:49,756 --> 00:47:52,625
I don't just hypnotize anyone,
you know.

436
00:47:54,428 --> 00:47:56,338
It wouldn't work out.

437
00:47:58,044 --> 00:48:01,753
How do you know if you don't
take a chance?

438
00:48:13,211 --> 00:48:14,520
What's in the bag, bitch?

439
00:48:14,555 --> 00:48:15,570
Hand it over,
and you won't get hurt.

440
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:16,625
You're the one'll get hurt.

441
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:18,041
Aww teach her
some manners, Rock.

442
00:48:18,075 --> 00:48:19,504
I'll teach her some fuckin'
manners, all right.

443
00:48:19,547 --> 00:48:21,237
Oh, fuck!

444
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:22,289
My fuckin' eyes!

445
00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:31,826
My fucking head!
You bitch!

446
00:48:51,898 --> 00:48:54,865
I fuckin' hate you people.

447
00:48:54,906 --> 00:48:56,215
Open your mouth!

448
00:48:58,426 --> 00:49:00,728
Open your mouth!

449
00:49:29,465 --> 00:49:31,189
I want a room.

450
00:49:31,225 --> 00:49:33,462
$25 the half,
$30 the hour.

451
00:49:33,497 --> 00:49:35,733
Five bucks for the towel.

452
00:49:37,048 --> 00:49:40,015
No, for the...
for the night.

453
00:49:40,057 --> 00:49:42,358
80 bucks for the night.

454
00:49:47,353 --> 00:49:50,702
Room three, first floor,
end of the corridor.

455
00:49:50,744 --> 00:49:52,118
Thanks.

456
00:50:17,112 --> 00:50:22,808
<i>Whoo, oh, my God!</i>

457
00:52:16,052 --> 00:52:18,124
Hey.
Hey.

458
00:52:18,164 --> 00:52:19,277
Hey, Mum.

459
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,238
Don't you ever be afraid

460
00:52:28,275 --> 00:52:30,828
to take a chance, Shay,
you know?

461
00:53:42,193 --> 00:53:43,687
We're looking for your friend.

462
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:45,584
I don't know her.

463
00:53:45,618 --> 00:53:49,676
Yeah, but you know what she
looks like, though, don't you?

464
00:53:49,714 --> 00:53:51,241
Huh?
Don't ya?

465
00:53:51,282 --> 00:53:52,940
No.

466
00:54:00,913 --> 00:54:02,801
Ah!

467
00:54:06,097 --> 00:54:07,690
Don't you?

468
00:54:09,617 --> 00:54:11,886
Stop, stop.

469
00:54:15,217 --> 00:54:16,777
All right.

470
00:54:16,816 --> 00:54:18,726
All right!

471
00:54:20,304 --> 00:54:22,192
She didn't see you.

472
00:54:22,224 --> 00:54:24,134
She can't hurt you.

473
00:54:27,216 --> 00:54:29,288
You can't trust women.

474
00:54:29,329 --> 00:54:32,176
Shit just fuckin' flies
out of their mouth

475
00:54:32,209 --> 00:54:33,616
without them even thinking.

476
00:54:33,648 --> 00:54:35,371
It's biological.

477
00:54:35,408 --> 00:54:36,935
It's because they got
a cunt hidden away.

478
00:54:36,976 --> 00:54:38,983
It's natural they're gonna
be hiding something.

479
00:54:39,024 --> 00:54:40,617
With a bloke,
it's all just there, isn't it?

480
00:54:40,656 --> 00:54:42,063
What you see is what you get.

481
00:54:42,096 --> 00:54:43,722
But women are fuckin' liars.

482
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,451
I fuckin' hate women.

483
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:49,931
Start looking.

484
00:55:40,174 --> 00:55:41,832
Where's Rose?

485
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:44,139
Don't know.

486
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,767
Who are you?

487
00:55:45,806 --> 00:55:48,937
I heard you from next door.

488
00:55:48,974 --> 00:55:50,665
Have you got anything?

489
00:55:50,702 --> 00:55:52,677
No.

490
00:55:52,718 --> 00:55:54,343
Got a smoke?

491
00:55:54,382 --> 00:55:56,869
Sorry.

492
00:55:56,910 --> 00:55:58,568
Fuck.

493
00:56:00,814 --> 00:56:02,919
What time is it?

494
00:56:02,957 --> 00:56:05,346
It's late.

495
00:56:05,389 --> 00:56:07,015
Where the fuck is she?

496
00:56:08,462 --> 00:56:10,796
I'll get you some water.

497
00:56:44,588 --> 00:56:45,766
Okay?

498
00:56:47,852 --> 00:56:49,794
Sweet.

499
00:56:54,444 --> 00:56:57,226
Here I am, baby.

500
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,689
Who the fuck are you?

501
00:56:58,732 --> 00:57:00,674
She's the girl from next door.

502
00:57:00,716 --> 00:57:03,236
Well, she can fuck off,
because we're fuckin' busy.

503
00:57:03,276 --> 00:57:05,764
I was just seeing
if your friend was all right.

504
00:57:05,804 --> 00:57:07,714
He's not my friend.

505
00:57:07,756 --> 00:57:09,130
Hurry.

506
00:57:10,572 --> 00:57:12,459
Come on.

507
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:16,714
Hurry up.

508
00:57:18,411 --> 00:57:20,583
Come on. Come on.

509
00:57:20,619 --> 00:57:22,081
Come on!

510
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:36,578
Half.

511
00:57:41,323 --> 00:57:42,752
Half.

512
00:57:43,339 --> 00:57:44,288
Half!

513
00:57:51,242 --> 00:57:53,992
Fuck.

514
00:57:54,026 --> 00:57:54,920
Fuck, fuck.

515
00:57:54,955 --> 00:57:55,903
The back of your hand.

516
00:57:55,946 --> 00:57:57,637
Shut up, bitch!

517
00:57:57,674 --> 00:58:00,424
Shut up.

518
00:58:00,458 --> 00:58:01,407
Fuck!

519
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:31,743
Ooh.

520
00:58:39,753 --> 00:58:42,241
You got any money?

521
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:44,223
No.

522
00:58:44,265 --> 00:58:46,021
Bullshit.

523
00:58:46,057 --> 00:58:48,326
Cutie like you.

524
00:58:48,361 --> 00:58:50,630
Come on.

525
00:58:50,665 --> 00:58:52,388
Give us some money.

526
00:58:53,736 --> 00:58:55,809
I don't have any.

527
00:58:55,849 --> 00:58:57,922
Fuck you.

528
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:03,805
<i>Hey, open the fucking door.</i>

529
00:59:03,848 --> 00:59:04,961
<i>Come on, sweetheart.</i>

530
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,210
<i>Open the fucking door.</i>

531
00:59:06,249 --> 00:59:07,623
The welcome wagon.

532
00:59:07,657 --> 00:59:10,112
Cunts.

533
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,130
That's the way it is.

534
00:59:12,169 --> 00:59:15,038
They fucked me.
Now it's your turn.

535
00:59:21,256 --> 00:59:23,645
I could tell 'em you're here.

536
00:59:23,688 --> 00:59:25,860
They'd pay me for it.

537
00:59:42,376 --> 00:59:44,961
Thanks.

538
00:59:46,759 --> 00:59:49,345
Get fucked.

539
01:01:19,365 --> 01:01:20,444
Hey.

540
01:01:21,957 --> 01:01:22,939
Pink lipstick.

541
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,889
Run!

542
01:02:10,403 --> 01:02:11,331
Gotcha.

543
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:15,007
Get in!

544
01:02:42,786 --> 01:02:44,379
Are you all right?

545
01:02:52,098 --> 01:02:53,659
What did he do to you?

546
01:02:56,130 --> 01:02:57,690
Police radio.

547
01:02:57,730 --> 01:02:59,006
What?

548
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:00,765
He's a cop.

549
01:03:02,306 --> 01:03:04,826
Fuck.

550
01:03:04,866 --> 01:03:07,582
You should go home.

551
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:08,565
I can't.

552
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:11,260
Somewhere else, then.

553
01:03:11,298 --> 01:03:13,207
There's nowhere else.

554
01:03:16,354 --> 01:03:18,459
I could stay with you.

555
01:03:18,497 --> 01:03:22,206
I'm going to the airport
to get on a plane out of here.

556
01:03:23,585 --> 01:03:26,301
That guy'll come after me.

557
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:34,362
I offered you a job.
No one forced you.

558
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,288
You don't give a shit.

559
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,662
I just saved you.

560
01:03:37,696 --> 01:03:40,118
I don't owe you anything.

561
01:03:43,169 --> 01:03:45,208
You can have the car.

562
01:03:45,249 --> 01:03:46,176
I can't drive.

563
01:03:46,209 --> 01:03:47,769
Get out.
Get out!

564
01:03:47,808 --> 01:03:49,401
Get out!

565
01:05:03,006 --> 01:05:04,697
Hey.

566
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:05,781
Fuck off!

567
01:05:06,782 --> 01:05:08,156
It's Shay.

568
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:10,907
Fully didn't recognize you.

569
01:05:13,373 --> 01:05:14,900
Where you going?

570
01:05:14,941 --> 01:05:16,152
Nowhere.

571
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:18,678
Can I come?

572
01:05:18,718 --> 01:05:19,994
I saw a guy get killed.

573
01:05:20,030 --> 01:05:21,786
You okay?

574
01:05:23,933 --> 01:05:25,362
I think someone's after me.

575
01:05:25,405 --> 01:05:26,998
Who's lookin' out for you?

576
01:05:29,693 --> 01:05:31,253
Rocky will help.

577
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:32,722
He looks after me.

578
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:33,748
He'll love you.

579
01:05:33,789 --> 01:05:35,131
Yeah.

580
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:37,467
I'll go get him.

581
01:05:37,501 --> 01:05:39,738
Lend me some ciggie money?
I'll pay you back.

582
01:05:45,373 --> 01:05:47,129
You're a real friend.

583
01:05:47,165 --> 01:05:48,594
Don't move.

584
01:06:01,692 --> 01:06:03,067
Get in.

585
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:04,791
I'm waiting for someone.

586
01:06:05,692 --> 01:06:07,602
Shay, get in.

587
01:06:12,924 --> 01:06:15,313
I met my first trick
on this street.

588
01:06:17,116 --> 01:06:19,353
I was so scared.

589
01:06:19,388 --> 01:06:21,144
This big old man.

590
01:06:23,292 --> 01:06:26,259
I thought he was gonna
have a heart attack on me.

591
01:06:28,059 --> 01:06:31,988
I promised myself,
before I turned 30, I'd quit,

592
01:06:32,028 --> 01:06:36,785
move to Paris,
reinvent myself.

593
01:06:37,628 --> 01:06:41,905
It's my birthday today.

594
01:06:41,947 --> 01:06:45,744
I've been fucking for money
since I was 15.

595
01:06:45,787 --> 01:06:48,340
I want a new life.

596
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:51,695
There's this guy.

597
01:06:51,739 --> 01:06:53,146
He doesn't know
that I'm leaving,

598
01:06:53,179 --> 01:06:55,634
and I don't want him to.

599
01:06:55,675 --> 01:06:57,366
He can help us.

600
01:06:58,779 --> 01:07:01,200
Who is he?

601
01:07:01,243 --> 01:07:03,993
He's a cop.

602
01:09:03,031 --> 01:09:04,340
Don't worry, ladies.

603
01:09:04,375 --> 01:09:06,579
Safe as houses here.

604
01:09:06,615 --> 01:09:07,542
Take a load off.

605
01:09:07,575 --> 01:09:09,582
This is Bob's place.

606
01:09:09,623 --> 01:09:11,216
No secrets between him and me.

607
01:09:11,255 --> 01:09:13,142
Except where the bodies
are buried.

608
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:18,701
Good one.

609
01:09:27,222 --> 01:09:29,132
- Who's this?
- Shay.

610
01:09:29,175 --> 01:09:30,931
We were on the job together.

611
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:32,624
You see what happened?

612
01:09:32,663 --> 01:09:35,052
- He shot him in the head.
- Who shot him?

613
01:09:35,094 --> 01:09:36,436
A cop named Bennett.

614
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:38,226
He tried to kill us.

615
01:09:38,262 --> 01:09:40,368
He's after us, Michael.

616
01:09:40,406 --> 01:09:42,740
Where'd you park
his car darlin'?

617
01:09:44,374 --> 01:09:46,862
We didn't say anything
about a car.

618
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,477
Gotcha.

619
01:09:56,694 --> 01:09:59,628
Mate, you got more bruises
than a Queensland banana.

620
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:05,102
I reckon your nose looks better
on this side.

621
01:10:08,278 --> 01:10:09,488
Fonzie got busted!

622
01:10:39,701 --> 01:10:42,319
Laugh now, you fuckin' dog!

623
01:10:42,356 --> 01:10:44,331
Where's my car, cunt?

624
01:10:46,069 --> 01:10:47,116
Settle down.

625
01:10:47,156 --> 01:10:48,083
Get out of my way.

626
01:10:48,116 --> 01:10:49,578
You made enough mistakes
tonight.

627
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:51,856
Fuckin' settle down.

628
01:10:51,892 --> 01:10:54,445
Look at my suit.

629
01:10:54,484 --> 01:10:56,240
That bitch broke
my fuckin' nose.

630
01:10:56,276 --> 01:10:58,480
- You can have the girl.
- What do you care?

631
01:10:58,516 --> 01:11:00,141
Holly's mine.

632
01:11:03,508 --> 01:11:05,930
Oh, mate.

633
01:11:05,972 --> 01:11:07,695
She's a fuckin' whore.

634
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:13,679
She's pissing off.

635
01:11:13,716 --> 01:11:15,058
Her place was empty.

636
01:11:15,091 --> 01:11:16,040
She's coming with me.

637
01:11:16,084 --> 01:11:18,833
No, no, look at her bag.

638
01:11:18,868 --> 01:11:20,461
I saw the ticket.

639
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:25,296
Whores only love money.

640
01:11:25,332 --> 01:11:27,186
Everything else is an act.

641
01:12:12,690 --> 01:12:14,599
<i>Back to the car.</i>

642
01:12:53,489 --> 01:12:56,206
He was lying, Michael.

643
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,942
I remember the first time
I saw you.

644
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:20,047
I arrested you just so
I could hear your voice.

645
01:13:28,464 --> 01:13:30,406
I'm gonna believe you, Holly.

646
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:33,644
We're rich enough to disappear.

647
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:35,435
What about Shay?

648
01:13:35,472 --> 01:13:37,577
It's just you and me now.

649
01:13:37,615 --> 01:13:39,077
She's my friend.

650
01:13:41,904 --> 01:13:43,726
It's just you and me now.

651
01:13:45,327 --> 01:13:48,011
Look in my eyes and say yes.

652
01:13:56,206 --> 01:13:57,254
No.

653
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:01,895
I can't.

654
01:14:04,302 --> 01:14:06,855
Tell me it wasn't all an act.

655
01:14:07,855 --> 01:14:10,407
Police!
Police!

656
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:11,374
Get in the car.

657
01:14:11,407 --> 01:14:13,032
Get in the car!
Move!

658
01:14:13,071 --> 01:14:14,893
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!

659
01:14:14,926 --> 01:14:16,170
Drop the fucking gun!

660
01:14:16,207 --> 01:14:18,094
Drive,
or I'll fucking kill you!

661
01:14:18,127 --> 01:14:20,134
Come on!
Step on the fucking peddle.

662
01:14:20,174 --> 01:14:22,029
Come on!

663
01:14:31,470 --> 01:14:32,485
Faster!

664
01:14:38,478 --> 01:14:39,558
Come on!

665
01:14:42,222 --> 01:14:43,782
Come on!

666
01:14:47,693 --> 01:14:49,122
Come on!
Faster!

667
01:15:05,069 --> 01:15:06,378
Holly.

668
01:15:06,413 --> 01:15:07,787
Okay.

669
01:15:07,821 --> 01:15:09,250
Holly.

670
01:15:20,748 --> 01:15:22,406
The case.

671
01:15:53,772 --> 01:15:55,844
It's just a scratch.

672
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:57,989
You're still beautiful.

673
01:15:59,851 --> 01:16:01,411
What time's your flight?

674
01:16:04,043 --> 01:16:06,182
I'll never make it now.

675
01:16:06,219 --> 01:16:08,194
You've got to try.

676
01:16:10,539 --> 01:16:11,587
I'll call Harry.

677
01:16:12,939 --> 01:16:14,662
Who?

678
01:16:14,699 --> 01:16:16,935
The taxi driver.

679
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:18,759
He's also an escape artist.

680
01:16:42,122 --> 01:16:43,683
It's ringing.

681
01:16:43,722 --> 01:16:45,216
Oh my God.

682
01:16:45,258 --> 01:16:46,665
Holly?

683
01:16:48,170 --> 01:16:49,861
Holly, lie down.
Lie down.

684
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:53,857
Just lie down.

685
01:16:59,594 --> 01:17:00,968
<i>Tenir moi.</i>

686
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:06,472
Holly?

687
01:17:06,505 --> 01:17:08,098
Holly?

688
01:17:08,138 --> 01:17:10,145
Somebody help me!

689
01:17:10,185 --> 01:17:12,640
Help me!

690
01:17:12,681 --> 01:17:14,110
Somebody help me!

691
01:17:14,154 --> 01:17:16,837
Help me!

692
01:20:58,051 --> 01:21:00,603
I usually
pull him out of a hat.

693
01:21:26,754 --> 01:21:28,576
You like me, don't you?

694
01:21:31,074 --> 01:21:32,830
Yeah.

695
01:21:42,369 --> 01:21:45,239
I want you
to make me disappear.

<i> Cultural assets and individuals in this
program have been altered fictionally.

00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,420
<i> They have no real-life

<i> Episode 5

4
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,650
Hey! Isn't that Bumsang?

5
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,890
So it is.

6
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,780
Chief Kang, didn't you say
he wasn't coming?

7
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,840
I thought so, too.
I wonder what happened.

8
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,540
Weren't you unsure
about that Professor Gong?

9
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,750
I guess things
worked out for the best.

10
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,680
Aw man, I should have
volunteered for this mission...

11
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,650
Why did you suddenly change your mind? You said you weren't coming.

12
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,710
It's an ideal chance for me score
brownie points with the director.

13
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:22,820
I can't miss that chance
just because I don't like you.

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,600
Yeah, I should have known.

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,490
Hold on a sec.

16
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:40,640
Yes, Chief.
I'm with Bumsang. Yes.

17
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,770
She said her daddy was taken away
far more times than my daddy.

18
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:50,640
For them, it's a worse pain
knowing that their father is a thief.

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,840
Would you say the same
if it were your father?

20
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,710
Yes, sir.

21
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:02,710
Chief Kang saw us together.
He thinks it's for the better.

22
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,670
Of course it is.
Yongchul is no match for me at all.

23
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,530
Why, do you want me
to bring him back?

24
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,570
No, not at all.

25
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,660
Ah, see that dude with the red tie?
Remember him.

26
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,830
Why?

27
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,690
You think the filthy rich
handle deals on their own?

28
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,630
That's the guy who handles business
for Chairman Kim of Dongwan Group.

29
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:31,860
Ah, the woman in the lavender works
for Chairman Oh of Hyunjae Group.

30
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,490
I heard she also deals for
Chairman Jang these days as well.

31
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,740
Ah, is she your substitute?

32
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,720
Bingo.

33
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:49,680
Isn't it a little risky for you to be here? You might run into Chairman Jang.

34
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,670
Don't worry. He has no interest
in attending parties like these.

35
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:59,410
A lot of guests attended
upon hearing that you'd be here.

36
00:02:59,410 --> 00:02:59,860
You should make a speech...

37
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,630
No. A simple
greeting should suffice.

38
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,800
Have you been well,
Chairman Jang?

39
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,470
It's been a while.

40
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,480
It's been seven years.

41
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,580
What brings you here?

42
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:24,820
Thought I'd thank you
for getting me out of prison.

43
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,750
How do you like
the “Bihaedangjib?”

44
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,570
I have no interest in books. I accepted it because my friends would enjoy it.

45
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:38,540
Then I'll be visiting you soon
with an item you'd appreciate.

46
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,770
There's no need.

47
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,720
Don't cause any trouble
while you're here.

48
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,790
Let's go.

49
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,700
The old man still
has a fiery temper.

50
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,650
Ow, my feet.

51
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,760
You borrowed those shoes, too?

52
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,580
What was I supposed to do?
I don't have any of my own.

53
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,820
Can you get any more pathetic?

54
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,780
You're how old and you still
don't have a pair of heels?

55
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:14,720
I don't see why it's any of your business. Man, when are the deals gonna start?

56
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,770
That's what I'm saying.
They're stalling today for some reason.

57
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,880
Ow, my feet.

58
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,540
What are you doing?

59
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,530
Quiet. It's Chairman Jang.
Chairman Jang!

60
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,570
Oh my god!
The bag, the bag...

61
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,410
What are you doing?
Joohyun is gonna have a fit...

62
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:36,740
Shut up!

63
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,450
Ugh, really!
What are you doing?

64
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,440
I nearly had a heart attack!

65
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,720
Why is he here today?

66
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,500
You shooting a movie?

67
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:06,670
You've clearly watched too many.
Of all the things to imitate...

68
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:12,750
What are you gonna do about the bag? Joohyun emphasized it was from Paris.

69
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,640
Ort court or something like that!

70
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,890
It's fine. It's totally fine.

71
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,680
If she says anything,
you're taking the blame, got it?

72
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,840
And how dare
you try to choke me?

73
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,730
Hey, I didn't try to choke you.
I merely grabbed your neck.

74
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,870
That was grabbing?
That was not grabbing!

75
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,870
That wasn't how I did it.
I did it lightly, like this.

76
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:43,650
Thank you for attending this charity auction despite your busy schedules.

77
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:51,660
We invite you to create a beautiful world by helping our less fortunate neighbors.

78
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,460
Please watch the screen.

79
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,670
Okay. As soon as the item
is identified, give us a call.

80
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,420
It seems the illegal auction will
begin soon. They're on the move.

81
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,450
Yeah?

82
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:04,640
Are the riot police standing by?

83
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,770
Yes, sir.

84
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:08,480
What if the “Bihaedangjib”
doesn't show today?

85
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:10,570
Don't jinx the mission.

86
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:15,510
It was hard enough getting here.
We have to get something out of all this.

87
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,810
As soon as we confirm there is
an illegal auction, we'll raid the place.

88
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,840
What the hell?
This isn't good.

89
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,890
The eagle is set to fly. When the sparrow appears, we'll swoop in, so give us a call.

90
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,600
Seriously, where's the creativity?

91
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,650
Of all the possible codenames, “sparrow?” How trite.

92
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,580
Shut it!

93
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,450
It's just been used so many times.

94
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,540
Did I choose the codenames?
We're gonna settle this later.

95
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,820
Dude, why are you
so sensitive these days?

96
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,530
Everyone look sharp. Let's score
some big points today, okay?

97
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,710
Yes, sir!

98
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,830
Why is Yonggu so late?
Are you sure he made it to the hotel?

99
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:26,730
He said he was almost here.

100
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,550
Hey, isn't that
the girl from the CHA?

101
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,850
Look at that.
Who's the sucker beside her?

102
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,670
This party has a lot of
unexpected guests.

103
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,890
Sir!

104
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,530
Oh, Yonggu. I have something
you need to take care of.

105
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,610
Wait, sir. There's trouble.

106
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,400
I was coming into the hotel
when I saw the fuzz everywhere.

107
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,510
What?

108
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,800
I think they're onto us.

109
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,840
Everywhere?

110
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,720
All around!

111
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,730
Since everyone here is already well informed, I won't give any explanations.

112
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:40,700
Previewing time is over.
Let's begin the bidding.

113
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,430
<i> The chicken has flown the coop.

114
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,510
Here we go.

115
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:57,550
First we'll reveal the highest written bid. It is 2.5 million dollars. We'll start there.

116
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,520
I'm sorry, today's auction is cancelled. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

117
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,800
Sir!

118
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,470
Yonggu Lee?

119
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,690
Let's go!

120
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,780
Mr. Kim!

121
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,860
Hey!

122
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,400
What is the meaning of this?

123
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,470
Police.

124
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,420
We're here about an illegal auction and a violation of protected cultural assets.

125
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,420
We ask that you cooperate.

126
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:52,800
We can't let you.

127
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,830
- Search the premises.
- You can't do this.

128
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,410
What the...

129
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,410
What happened?

130
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,770
They took everything and ran.

131
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,550
Chohee, where are you?

132
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:20,660
Yes, Mr. Kim is back in Korea.
I'm telling the truth.

133
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,770
We're following him right now
so please send backup. Yes.

134
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,710
Hey! What took you so long?

135
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:50,660
One, two, three!
One, two, three!

136
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,890
There's no time. I'll go ahead,
follow me when you can.

137
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,820
Excuse me, Chief.
Can I go with you?

138
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,490
It might be dangerous
so stay here.

139
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:04,420
No. Bumsang's out there,
so I have to go. I want to go.

140
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,740
Do what you want, then.

141
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,510
Tch! Think I can't guess
what you're thinking?

142
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:15,440
Planning to keep Bumsang and me apart? No~ that's not gonna happen.

143
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,790
Chief, wait for me. Chief!

144
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,430
Oh my god.
How could you lose them?

145
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,880
Who knew he was
going to make that turn?

146
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,870
That's why I told you to stay in that lane. Why did you suddenly change lanes?

147
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,560
I'm not exactly experienced in these kinds of situations. I'm not a cop, yanno.

148
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:46,440
I'm disappointed we lost the chance to catch Mr. Kim and Yonggu Lee together.

149
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,890
Oh yeah. Yonggu.

150
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,560
Ah, it's beautiful.
The “Naegeumgang.”

151
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,750
I think I have an idea
where their hideout is.

152
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:04,780
What?

153
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,490
The hideout?
How did he find that out?

154
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,820
Not sure, I didn't
ask him the details.

155
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,500
Anyway, they're headed
to the Incheon Port.

156
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,730
The Incheon Port?

157
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,780
Darnit, they all look the same.
It'll be hard to find.

158
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,490
Ow!

159
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,570
Hey, are you all right?

160
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,860
Yeah, I'm fine.

161
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,790
Ouch...

162
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:48,830
Did you sprain your ankle?

163
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,890
No, I'm fine. I'm all right.

164
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,640
What do you mean you're
all right? Try and move it.

165
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,410
It's fine.

166
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,610
Geez, you're such a klutz.

167
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,790
I'm fine, I tell you.

168
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,580
Hey, Bumsang!

169
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,620
What?

170
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:23,640
The thing is,
thanks for coming today.

171
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:35,720
And when we fought
in front of Cheoljin Lee's house...

172
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:41,410
you said to let him go
because you felt bad for the kids.

173
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,820
I just want to thank you
for thinking that.

174
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:57,760
You probably don't understand why,
but I just wanted to say thank you.

175
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,420
Thank me all at once
after we find the book.

176
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:12,890
Huh.

177
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,590
Did I ask a lot from you?

178
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:35,620
I just wanted this one job to go right, and you led the stinkin' dogs into the house?

179
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,870
That's not it. I didn't know Bumsang
was chummy with the regulations team.

180
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,530
That's not how he rolls.

181
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,480
Stop your nonsense.

182
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,430
Yonggu, how tall are you?

183
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,880
I'm five-seven.

184
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,870
You're taller than me.

185
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,740
Hey!

186
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:06,570
Go order me a coffin
that fits a man of five-seven.

187
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,710
- Sir?
- Yes, sir.

188
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:15,580
What's so funny? Go move
everything before the fuzz get here.

189
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,560
Yes, sir.

190
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:23,630
You wanna be a bum?
Is that it?

191
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,500
Ugh, you're such a deadweight.

192
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,700
Jeez...

193
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,850
We have no other choice.
We have to grab the book first.

194
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,680
Are you crazy?
What if we get caught?

195
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,480
We just need to creep up there undetected and steal it.

196
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,760
Stop with the ridiculous plan now
and just wait until Chief Kang arrives.

197
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,640
And if we do that we'll lose them
like last time. I'll be right back.

198
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,820
Go wait in the car.
I'll do it.

199
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,540
What?

200
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,690
You think you can run away with that ankle? Go back and call Chief Kang.

201
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,590
Go on!

202
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,600
Use your brain, if you have one.

203
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,810
The fuzz will be here any minute!

204
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,870
Use your heads!

205
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,790
Hurry and move them along.

206
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,620
Darnit, where is she?
I told her to wait in the car.

207
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,780
Chohee's not picking up.

208
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,530
She's not?
That's strange.

209
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,470
Let me try calling Bumsang.

210
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,520
She did say it was
somewhere around here.

211
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,480
I never expected to meet the Bumsang Kim I've been hearing so much about.

212
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:43,830
Cut the crap. I'll give you
the book, so let the woman go.

213
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:49,520
First the bowl, then the “Naegeumgang,” and now you've ruined today's party.

214
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:54,470
Our paths have crossed
one too many times.

215
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:00,810
I wish I could take this opportunity
to teach you a life lesson...

216
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:05,810
but I'm in a bit of a hurry.
Hand over the “Bihaedangjib!”

217
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,730
Let her go, and I'll hand it over.

218
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,820
You must be confused.

219
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:20,540
Who's in the more vulnerable
situation right now? Huh?

220
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:26,520
You're right. Who is in the more vulnerable situation? Huh?

221
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:32,680
Hey, hey, stop bluffing
and hand it over.

222
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,490
You think I'm bluffing?
I don't value this thing one bit.

223
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,790
It's not mine, so I don't care
who owns it or if it burns to ashes.

224
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:46,660
You're not really going
to set it on fire, are you?

225
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,400
You think I won't?

226
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,820
Hey! What are you doing?

227
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,600
How much were you aiming to get for this? How high did you set the price?

228
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,530
Enough so that even the middleman would get hundreds of thousands, right?

229
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,680
Well, there goes
a hundred thousand.

230
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,510
Are you out of your mind?

231
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,880
So let her go already.
A hundred thousand wasn't enough?

232
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,680
There goes a
few hundred thousand.

233
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,700
Let her go!

234
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,580
There, we let her go,
so give the remaining pages to us.

235
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:45,680
Don't give it to them.
You can't, okay?

236
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,700
We don't have much time.
Hand it over.

237
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:56,690
You know the saying,
“Pearls before swine?”

238
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:05,540
If it's gonna end up in your hands,
it's better off as ashes.

239
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,810
Hey!

240
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,530
Darnit!

241
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,500
Go after them!

242
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,690
Yes, sir!

243
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,850
Stop right there, you bastard!

244
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,590
Hey!

245
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,660
Joohyun, the siren.

246
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:44,590
Chohee, Bumsang,
are you guys all right?

247
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:47,860
Bumsang, I was so worried about you. Hurry and get in the car.

248
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,500
We're fine. Mr. Kim's probably
still lurking around. You should hurry.

249
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,440
We'll be right back.

250
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,830
- No, wait. Bumsang!
- Joohyun.

251
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,770
Are you okay?

252
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,560
I'm all right.

253
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:16,740
I'm fine, but how could you set
the “Bihaedangjib” on fire like that?

254
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,630
Hey, no matter what, that book
is not important than a human life.

255
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,870
Who cares if a thief owns it?
At least it's safe.

256
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:30,690
At least that's better than it no longer existing. How could you burn it, huh?

257
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,620
How could I burn what?
You still don't know me at all.

258
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,400
C'mon, follow me.

259
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:42,670
Come on. I'll take you
to see the “Bihaedangjib.”

260
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,760
Here.

261
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:03,800
That book from earlier, that was an experimental copy my students made.

262
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,820
It just happened to be in the car.

263
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,410
If Mr. Kim didn't fall for it,
I would've handed the real thing over.

264
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,520
But it seems he has bad eyesight.

265
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,640
Or maybe he's just dumb.
From all the bleaching.

266
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,410
You're speechless
with gratitude, aren't you?

267
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,890
I found Mr. Kim for you. And the “Bihaedangjib.” And I saved your life.

268
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,460
When are you gonna
repay me for all this?

269
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,530
It'll take your entire life...

270
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,530
Oh my!

271
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:33,760
If you came out to exercise,
don't just stand around staring blankly.

272
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,680
I'll stare if I want.

273
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:43,650
You're not acting like your usual self.
Did you find yourself a man?

274
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,450
Am I not allowed to?

275
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:52,470
What's this? You're smiling?
So it must be true.

276
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,540
Who is it?
Who could it be? Who...

277
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,720
By any chance, is it
that Chief Whatchamacallit?

278
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:07,680
You little punk!
Have some respect.

279
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:15,520
Why'd you hit me! Stop wasting your time here, and let's go have breakfast.

280
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,460
Gyoon!

281
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,680
What?

282
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:25,510
I found the “Bihaedangjib.”

283
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,510
Sis...

284
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,800
Aren't you gonna congratulate me?

285
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,880
You found one little thing and
you expect me to congratulate you?

286
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,790
You've got guts.

287
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,570
Dad stole loads of things.

288
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:47,690
Ms. Heo, you're gonna
have to work even harder, got it?

289
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:59,400
Ah, what a loss. It was a great chance
to catch both Mr. Kim and Yonggu.

290
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,480
What did you expect from
the investigations team?

291
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,570
At least we found the book.
What if we hadn't even found that?

292
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,750
All of us would've
kicked the bucket...

293
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,580
What a relief.

294
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,410
You're right. And this
is all thanks to Chohee.

295
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,410
I've never been
so grateful to her before.

296
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,760
I know, right?
And she never looked sexier.

297
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,690
You thought so, too?

298
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:27,510
With that figure, of course.

299
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:28,600
So true, so true.

300
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,660
You two, get things straight.

301
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:37,740
Chohee didn't look fabulous.
My dress looked fabulous.

302
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,470
Yeah! That dress
looked awfully expensive.

303
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,560
Right, right! Hey, didn't you say you
were gonna buy coffee this morning?

304
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,650
- I did.
- Let's take Joohyun with us.

305
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,870
I'll buy.

306
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,400
Good morning.

307
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,580
By the way, Chohee.

308
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
Yeah?

309
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:03,590
Don't forget to dry clean the dress.
I'll leave that to you.

310
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,690
I was gonna do that.

311
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,590
“Don't forget
to dry clean the dress.”

312
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,840
What's with the tongue rolling?
Haute couture...

313
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,780
Ah, Joohyun... "Dress"...

314
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:36,870
If we don't find it, are you going to
give the recording to the press?

315
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:41,890
Hey, I'm trying my best.
So don't be like that.

316
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,440
I didn't erase it, did I?

317
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:53,570
[Hey, Chohee! You're too late.
I already erased everything!]

318
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,790
What the heck is this?

319
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,700
[You dare to blackmail me with this pathetic recording? What nonsense.]

320
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,590
[Don't underestimate me. You'll bite off more than you can chew, understand?]

321
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,570
[Since I have an audience, I'll sing you
a little song just for the heck of it.]

322
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:19,710
[If this a recording you'll have to forget~ Don't pine after it, dry your tears~]

323
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,560
[Dry your tears,
you little kid. Bye, bye.]

324
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,420
Bumsang, what will you do next?

325
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,830
Ugh... ow, it hurts.

326
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,610
Huh?

327
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,650
Jeez, when did I get this stain?

328
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,420
It'll take your entire life...

329
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,540
Was she that happy?

330
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,640
Speak of the devil.

331
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,830
What do you want
so early in the morning?

332
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,400
What do you mean,
early in the morning?

333
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,890
Take a look at the clock.
See know how late it is?

334
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,770
Huh?
Wow, it's already this late?

335
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,680
Bumsang, can we meet up later?

336
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,730
You called me out
and you dare to be late?

337
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,510
You dare to sing
with that level of skill?

338
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,710
What are you
talking about? Sing?

339
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,840
You erased it.
I was gonna erase it for you.

340
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,850
Took you long enough.

341
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,520
Here!

342
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,740
You called me out
to give me this?

343
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,670
No way.

344
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,540
Let's go have a drink.

345
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,710
A drink?

346
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:37,730
I mean, I want to
thank you, you know.

347
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:44,730
You said you wanted an official
thank you when we found the book.

348
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:54,540
You attended the party, found the “Bihaedangjib,” and you saved my life.

349
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,860
Thank you.

350
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,550
What's with the handshake?

351
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:10,570
Let's put the past behind us
and start anew.

352
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:14,400
Like we have
a past to put behind.

353
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,800
The slate's clean, right?
Forever!

354
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,720
Yes, forever.

355
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,710
You promised.

356
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:22,400
Okay.

357
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,840
Haven't seen you around in a while. What brings you here?

358
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,860
Why are you so defensive?
I have good news.

359
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:39,640
Good news? What?
You're retiring early?

360
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:46,520
We found the “Bihaedangjib.”
Chohee found it.

361
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:49,730
That brat, she's good.

362
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,780
It's been seven years
since Taesoo disappeared.

363
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,410
The statute of
limitations is almost up.

364
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:04,590
More of the items
he stole will surface.

365
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:09,400
Not like you can even dream
of getting a glance of them.

366
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,870
They're going to pass
from one rich guy to another.

367
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:15,840
Somehow when you state the obvious,
it pisses me off even more.

368
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,690
You know why? Because Chohee
likes me more, and that irks you.

369
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,640
Think what you will.

370
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:27,710
I'll be the one to walk her
down the aisle anyway.

371
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:32,790
Don't even think about it!
I'm going to marry her off.

372
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:37,470
Like a regulations team member walking in with a middleman isn't weird.

373
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,400
What's it to you
if she walks in with me?

374
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,630
Does she even have a man?

375
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:50,620
There's a guy I'm nudging her way,
but who knows.

376
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,790
He's not a cop, is he?

377
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,440
How'd you know?

378
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:59,410
What cop?
It's not Chief Kang, is it?

379
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:07,610
I don't understand you at all.
Why do you insist on working with me?

380
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,700
I'm the one
who doesn't understand.

381
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,600
What's with that delusion
that I insist on working with you?

382
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,650
Oh my, oh my,
what do you mean delusion?

383
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:22,450
I'm here,
sitting in your car, aren't I?

384
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:25,770
You called me here.
And you specifically asked for me.

385
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:31,640
That's because you're in charge
of the Hahman robbery case.

386
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,820
Chief.

387
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,560
Yes?

388
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,570
Be honest for once.

389
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:40,870
You think I don't realize that
you're doing this because of Bumsang?

390
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,880
You don't give me any opportunities
to meet up with him, not one...

391
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,790
What are you doing?

392
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,600
Joohyun.

393
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,460
Chief.

394
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,420
What can I do to convince you
that I'm not interested in you?

395
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:11,620
Would it help if I created an opportunity for you and Bumsang to get together?

396
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,600
You'll set it up?

397
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,460
Okay, call me
when you get near. Okay.

398
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,480
Hey, that was Chief Kang.
He wants to have a drink.

399
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,500
Chief Kang?

400
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,590
So I told him to come here.
Is that okay?

401
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,550
Of course it's okay.

402
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,590
Is he coming alone?

403
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,720
I had no idea
you were going to be here.

404
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,560
And I had no idea
you were coming, too.

405
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:13,400
The way I see it, that weird rumor started because you chase after Bumsang.

406
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,470
Rumor? What rumor?

407
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,840
Oh my, you didn't hear?
It was quite a rumor.

408
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,820
Apparently Chohee seduced Bumsang
in the hot springs and had a kid...

409
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,830
Hey!

410
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,830
Looks delicious.

411
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:36,660
Wow, it'll fit right into your mouth, Joohyun. Have some.

412
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,830
Don't want it!

413
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:44,500
Chief, don't listen to her at all.
Have some of this...

414
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,790
All right, let's just drink.

415
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,700
Okay.

416
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:55,450
It's not like I'm making things up.
I say she started the rumors herself.

417
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,530
Hey!

418
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,460
Follow me.

419
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,430
Why?

420
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:06,750
Don't you have
to go to the restroom?

421
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:15,500
Fine, let's go!
Please continue your meal.

422
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:22,870
Excuse us.
Continue your meal.

423
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,720
What in the world was that about?

424
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,720
Oh that, it's no big deal.

425
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,710
I think Chohee was interested
in me when we first met.

426
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:43,400
But that got blown out of proportion
and spread at the CHA.

427
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,480
It's all a misunderstanding.

428
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,880
Isn't that how rumors are?
Mountains are made out of molehills.

429
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,700
Ah, I see.

430
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,750
Chohee must've had a rough time.

431
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,400
Yes, I guess she did.

432
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,420
Let's drink.

433
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,420
Okay.

434
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:18,670
- She's not gonna wash her hands?
- Ew, how gross.

435
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:24,850
Stop stalling and say what
you want already. Or let me go.

436
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,720
Joohyun.

437
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,670
Yes?

438
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,780
You like Bumsang, right?

439
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,850
You're worried that
I'm interested in him, right?

440
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,840
Oh, how did you know...

441
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,700
I know, I know everything.
But you know what?

442
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,640
I don't have
a speck of interest in him.

443
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:56,630
Hold on. Can I take that to mean
that you'll give him up completely?

444
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:03,400
Fine, I give up. I give up
completely. Satisfied? Right?

445
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,570
Wait.

446
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:10,590
Can you swear you're gonna
erase him forever from your heart?

447
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,470
Yes.

448
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:18,630
I swear I erased him forever,
so please just leave me alone. Okay?

449
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:23,770
Sis! You should've said so from the start. I misunderstood you for no reason.

450
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,870
- We're done. Let's go.
- Okay!

451
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,680
One more hair sweep.

452
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,800
Let's go.

453
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,560
I worry about her.

454
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,490
What's with the hair sweeping?

455
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,710
Careful, Chohee.

456
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,630
What do you say to
another round of drinks?

457
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,720
Sure. Um...

458
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,700
I'll buy the next round.

459
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,630
Sounds great!

460
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:02,570
Bumsang!
Let's drink another round.

461
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:05,590
Um, Joohyun? I'm not...

462
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:11,520
C'mon, Bumsang!
I'm so, so happy to be with you.

463
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,400
Hey... Hey!

464
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:18,620
I knew this would happen
when she started chugging her drinks.

465
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:22,820
Chohee, I'll take Joohyun home.
You have another round with Bumsang.

466
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,510
Bumsang, see you next time.

467
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,840
Bumsang, another round.

468
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,770
Sure, let's go, c'mon!

469
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,890
Chief!

470
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,690
Oh my, she's lost it,
completely lost it.

471
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,530
Wow, she's flying away.

472
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,430
In what way are they similar?
Enough for her to mix them up?

473
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,480
Who's similar? To whom?

474
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,600
Jeez...

475
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,790
Hey, aren't you gonna
drink more with me?

476
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,540
Not gonna drink!

477
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:05,760
Taxi! Taxi. I'm going to Jangchoong-dong!

478
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,660
Man, why is it
so hard to catch a taxi?

479
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:16,540
I told you I could handle it.
Go home already.

480
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,620
Sit down. You're a girl, after all.
I can't let you go home alone this late.

481
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:21,840
What's this?

482
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:27,680
You can't let a girl get wet in the rain or go home by herself at night. What next?

483
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,740
You can't stand to see
a girl cry all alone?

484
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,630
Good guess.

485
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:39,670
And in case you might misunderstand,
in no way am I hitting on you.

486
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:45,670
This is a case of philanthropy
based on humanism, okay?

487
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,880
I'm a pretty nice guy
once you get to know me. Got it?

488
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,690
Yeah, you're super nice.

489
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:02,550
Almost...

490
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,550
Ow!

491
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:07,620
This much but then you just ruined it.
So get over yourself, okay?

492
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:11,550
How dare you poke at
your superior's face like that.

493
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,740
Superior, my butt.

494
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,730
Why do I feel lightheaded?
I didn't drink much.

495
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:22,420
But I feel good.

496
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,740
Oh, there's a taxi.
Then I'm off.

497
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,520
Hey, hey!

498
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,600
Uh, there was
something on your face.

499
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,680
I was trying to remove it
when you opened your eyes.

500
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,460
What?

501
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:13,740
I know what you want.

502
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:16,410
You do?

503
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,490
Ack!

504
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:33,630
Oh dear, I'm so sorry.
That car cut in front of me.

505
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:38,450
It's okay.
Mister, where are we?

506
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,710
We're almost there.
Just a bit more.

507
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,470
Ah, okay.

508
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,760
What's wrong?

509
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,450
Huh, nothing, nothing at all.

510
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,790
Oh! Mister, please take
a right at the next light.

511
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:04,420
Okay.

512
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:23,590
On the surface I appear to be all right, but inside I wanna jump off a cliff.

513
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,750
This was a rare chance for a promotion.
I can't believe Mr. Kim got away.

514
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,570
We just caught
a lot of small fry instead.

515
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,570
This is so humiliating.

516
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:42,800
Man, cheer up.

517
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:45,850
We found out Mr. Kim
sent Gyucheol Seo to Japan.

518
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:49,660
And we retrieved some items
when we raided their hideout.

519
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:56,470
All thanks to your excellent
questioning of the small fry.

520
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,710
That's not true.

521
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:03,450
Of course it is. Anything less
and I would've quit my job.

522
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,780
So thank you, Officer Cho.

523
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,490
Oh no, there's
no need to thank me...

524
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,450
Chief Kang!

525
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,610
Oh, hey, Joohyun.

526
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:20,420
I hope you weren't in the middle of spreading rumors about last night.

527
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,580
Your mother was really bewildered
last night. Did you get into trouble?

528
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,540
Of course I did.

529
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:30,580
What mother would be okay with
her daughter coming home wasted?

530
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,440
Right? Right?

531
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,470
And I, for one, cannot forgive myself
for my behavior yesterday.

532
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:38,880
It happens, Joohyun.

533
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,500
No.

534
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,480
I plan to take some time
to reflect back on my behavior.

535
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:49,700
I came here to make one thing absolutely clear to you.

536
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,620
What's that?

537
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:56,650
You introduced yourself
to my mother yesterday.

538
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:00,540
You're more
calculating than I thought.

539
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:09,540
Keep in mind that yesterday means nothing to me so don't expect anything.

540
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,760
I'm a one-man kind of girl.

541
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,770
Look here, Joohyun. You seem to be greatly misunderstanding something.

542
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:24,660
No, no, no, no! For exactly one week, please do not attempt to speak to me.

543
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:30,690
I'm giving you some time
to resolve your feelings for me.

544
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:34,510
Then, excuse me.

545
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:43,430
What the...
“No, no, no...”

546
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:47,740
She talks about not spreading rumors and comes in spilling everything herself.

547
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:52,540
Mr. Nah says she's not
your normal case of narcissism.

548
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,440
You've got a nutcase
on your hands.

549
00:45:56,600 --> 00:46:02,490
How annoying. How in the world did I confuse Chief Kang with my Bumsang?

550
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,790
I'm usually too smart
to make mistakes like that.

551
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,450
Aw, man, how am I going
to look Bumsang in the face?

552
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,430
Ow, my stomach...

553
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,570
- Joohyun!
- You startled me.

554
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:17,640
You're just coming to work now?
You're tardy!

555
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:20,550
I'm sorry. I - ow...

556
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:22,510
What's wrong?
Are you sick?

557
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:28,530
I've had a serious case
of anemia since I was a kid.

558
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:31,870
Then you should've stayed home. Why'd you come to work? It's too much trouble.

559
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:35,450
No, no. The workplace
shouldn't be taken lightly.

560
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:41,620
I'll endure it for as long as I can.
If it's too much, I can go home early.

561
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:43,850
Then. Ow...

562
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,650
She should just go home.
No need to endure pain.

563
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:51,440
Not like they'll pay her more
for staying. Is she gonna be okay?

564
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,800
Hey, does your stomach hurt
when you have anemia?

565
00:46:55,660 --> 00:47:00,530
That's not important!
Joohyun! Joohyun!

566
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:04,730
Why is he yelling?
Is he taking after Officer Cho? Hey!

567
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,650
I must be losing it.

568
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,780
How could I dream
something like that?

569
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,500
Have I been repressing myself
too much these days?

570
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:38,720
Yes, too much abstinence is clearly harmful to one's mental health.

571
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:43,810
Right, gotta release. Gotta release things. It's because I haven't that -

572
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,460
What the!

573
00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:46,890
Why are you so jumpy?

574
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:47,780
Who's jumpy?

575
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:48,690
You!

576
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:53,680
Oh, I see. You did
something bad again, right?

577
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,600
Why am I your usual suspect?
Nothing, I did nothing!

578
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:58,610
Really?

579
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:01,580
Yes, really.
How're you feeling?

580
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,860
I didn't drink enough
to be worried about.

581
00:48:04,890 --> 00:48:06,590
What's up?

582
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:08,780
I'm supposed to meet
the grandfather from the Lee family.

583
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:13,710
He wants to see you, the man
who found the “Bihaedangjib.”

584
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:16,770
I want to donate it to the country.

585
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,820
What did you just say?

586
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:23,690
You want to donate
the “Bihaedangjib?”

587
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:24,830
Yes.

588
00:48:27,570 --> 00:48:29,500
Really, Grandfather?

589
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:32,510
Excuse me, sir.
Can I speak with you privately?

590
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:33,690
Hey, stay here.

591
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:35,850
- No need for that.
- But this is...

592
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:37,720
Stop it.

593
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:43,660
I kept it stuffed in some corner
without realizing its value.

594
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,710
I don't deserve to own it.

595
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:54,850
If I want to see it,
I can come here.

596
00:48:54,850 --> 00:49:00,510
And it'll be more worthwhile
if lots of people can see it, too.

597
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:02,870
- Grandfather.
- Grandfather...

598
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,770
This way I can save face
in front of my ancestors.

599
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:16,890
Thank you for finding
this valuable book, young lady.

600
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:20,840
Thank you, Mr. Kim.

601
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:35,430
I mistreated the book
against my ancestors' wishes.

602
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:39,550
It's under the protection
of the country now.

603
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,820
So please forgive me,
dear ancestors.

604
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:56,690
He's gonna cry tears of regret.
He's gonna regret it so much it'll hurt.

605
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,520
Does he realize how much money
it's worth? How could he donate it?

606
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:04,640
How much money? Is that what
a national hero should be saying?

607
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:08,500
Cultural assets are
essentially private property.

608
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:12,470
They're part of a cultural heritage, thereby property belonging to all.

609
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,680
Everything you say
is so narrow-minded.

610
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,750
I'm not being narrow-minded. Listen when I say such valuable things to you.

611
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:20,730
Stop being so twisted.

612
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,540
Valuable, my butt. Valueless...

613
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,450
- Did you just say valueless?
- Nope.

614
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:29,700
Hey, you think Congressman
Junpil Lee will take this sitting down?

615
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,570
I heard the “Bihaedangjib” made
an appearance at your auction.

616
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:38,840
How could you do that
when you knew it belonged to me?

617
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:42,860
Oh, did that happen?
I had no idea.

618
00:50:43,730 --> 00:50:47,770
And the CHA took it away.
Why are you complaining to me?

619
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,820
You're the one who set the stage.

620
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:57,690
Fine, I guess you could think that.

621
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:03,530
Three things are needed
in order to acquire priceless items.

622
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:08,860
A good eye for recognizing items, enough wealth to relocate them...

623
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:12,420
and the patience to wait
until it comes into one's possession.

624
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:20,870
If you have these three,
all you need to do is find a way.

625
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:26,640
Are you saying there's a way for me
to get the “Bihaedangjib” back?

626
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:36,620
I'll go get the car,
you help her out.

627
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,410
Bumsang!

628
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,550
Joohyun, are you sick?

629
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:41,760
- Ah...
- Joohyun.

630
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:47,480
I'm sorry for showing you
such a weak side of me.

631
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,540
Oh no, don't be. You don't have
to apologize to me. Joohyun...

632
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,780
No, no.

633
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:57,850
Don't speak.
I know how you feel.

634
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,420
I know that
you're hurting for me.

635
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:05,810
I will be back tomorrow,
bright and healthy.

636
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:09,490
Um, the car...

637
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:11,470
- What?
- The car.

638
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,820
- Let's go.
- Bumsang, see you tomorrow.

639
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,650
Oh, Chief. Why are you here
when we don't have a meeting today?

640
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:31,450
Chief Noh asked me to come.

641
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:35,600
By the way, did you drink
some more with Bumsang yesterday?

642
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,600
No. We just went home.

643
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:44,530
I see. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday. For tactlessly crashing your party.

644
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:47,460
What are you talking about?

645
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:49,880
I heard you were
interested in Bumsang.

646
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,710
I didn't realize and I was going
to set him and Joohyun up.

647
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:55,580
I almost made a big mistake.

648
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:00,460
Chief, what are you saying?

649
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:05,800
Did Bumsang tell you
that I'm interested in him?

650
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,690
Then you're not?

651
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:13,500
Of course not. I'm really
not interested in him, Chief. Gosh...

652
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:20,430
I dunno what nonsense he told you, but I'm not the least bit interested in him.

653
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:25,530
So please don't misunderstand.

654
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:30,700
But you guys looked like
you were pretty close.

655
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,750
Give it a chance.
You guys look great together.

656
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:36,510
Chief!

657
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:47,690
I have someone that I like.
So please don't say things like that.

658
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:52,660
Hey, Chohee!

659
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,500
I can't seem to open it...

660
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,610
I'll do it for you.

661
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:10,580
- Mine, too, please.
- Sure.

662
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:16,430
Sir, can I see
you for a moment?

663
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:17,430
Later.

664
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,820
Open that later and come here.

665
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:21,560
I still have one more to open.

666
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,570
Open it yourself. Follow me.

667
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,430
One sec. Don't open it.

668
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,750
Bumsang! Did you tell
Chief Kang that I like you?

669
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:39,670
What?

670
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:47,710
Ah, that? I didn't say you like me.
I said you were initially interested in me.

671
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:48,620
What?

672
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:52,520
He asked about the rumor,
so I just said whatever came to mind.

673
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:57,480
Hey! Why didn't you just tell him
the truth? Why'd you lie? Why, why!

674
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,720
Why are you throwing such a fit
over something so trivial?

675
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:05,520
Do you like Chief Kang?

676
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:06,870
What?

677
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:11,580
Lookee this. What's with the squirm? You do like him, don't you?

678
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:16,530
I don't like him.

679
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:25,570
Anyway, why is Chief Kang telling me
to give you and me a chance? Why?

680
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,890
Chief Kang said that?

681
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:29,780
Yes.

682
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:34,590
He doesn't look it
but he's quite the gossip.

683
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:38,570
You... don't you dare
talk about him like that.

684
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:42,560
He's a way better
person than you are.

685
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,410
Good person, my butt.

686
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:47,890
How is he a good person when he blabs about things said over some drinks?

687
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:55,430
You're two-faced,
a player and a total pervert.

688
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:57,530
You have no right to say that.

689
00:55:57,530 --> 00:56:00,530
Wh - what? Pervert?

690
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:05,810
Am I wrong? When I think about you coming towards me in that hot spring.

691
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:09,480
Ugh, it's enough
to give me nightmares.

692
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,610
Are your screws loose? Suffering
from heatstroke? How dare you!

693
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:14,760
I have one more thing to say.

694
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,430
I'm warning you.

695
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:21,780
You say one more ridiculous thing
about me and I'll kick your butt. Got it?

696
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,700
Why, you little...

697
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:38,550
What the? Pervert? The more I think about it, the more it pisses me off.

698
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:46,520
Fine. Since I'm the better person,
I'll let it slide. I will.

699
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:52,510
Wait, why should I?
This isn't a matter I should let slide.

700
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:02,480
Hey, Chohee! I was gonna let it go,
but you went too far. Apologize now.

701
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:06,620
Apologize? Why should I?
I didn't do anything wrong.

702
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,890
You turned me into a pervert,
and you say you did nothing wrong?

703
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:15,450
Not like I made it all up. You should be the one apologizing, you shameless jerk.

704
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:16,620
What?

705
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,780
Cut the crap
and come to my room.

706
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:20,850
Why should I?

707
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:23,620
When your superior
orders you to come, you come.

708
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:26,820
Ms. Chohee Heo,
come to my room at once!

709
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:34,660
What the heck.
Who is he to order me around?

710
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:41,690
Fine, I'll be the bigger person and go. We'll settle this once and for all.

711
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:47,760
Why are you knocking?
Just come in!

712
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:56,500
Tch, so you want me to open the door
for you? Fine, I'll open the door.

713
00:57:58,760 --> 00:57:59,790
Satisfied?

714
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,640
Doin' dandy, Bumsang?

715
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:10,530
Bumsang, you bastard.

716
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:16,410
Yonggu! Let's talk about this.
We don't have this kind of relationship.

717
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,470
“We don't have
this kind of relationship?”

718
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:19,660
Shut your trap.

719
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,440
I had the crap beaten
out of me because of you.

720
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:25,690
You're dead.

721
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:33,860
Hey, do you realize where you are?
What if someone comes in?

722
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:35,550
Let them!

723
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,790
If I were to write down
everything you put me through...

724
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:40,530
it'll be longer than the Bible.

725
00:58:46,510 --> 00:58:47,780
See, I told you someone'll come.

726
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:50,490
Bumsang, open the door.

727
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:54,800
I'm going to call security.
Hey, open the door!

728
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,650
What the...!

729
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:04,670
Bumsang, is that you?

730
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,440
Ugh, it hurts.

731
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:15,640
Whew, I'm tired.

732
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,880
Are you sure you don't
have to go to the hospital?

733
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,670
No way.
This is way too embarrassing.

734
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:24,820
That was Yonggu Lee, right?

735
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,660
How many times
do I have to tell you no?

736
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:32,650
I dunno who he was,
but he kept aiming at my face.

737
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:35,890
Hey, what happened her?
Hurts like hell.

738
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:38,450
It seems to be torn a bit.

739
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,850
Anyway, consider
today your lucky day.

740
00:59:41,850 --> 00:59:46,500
If it wasn't for that guy who might be Yonggu, I would've kicked your butt.

741
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,630
You should be the one
thanking the faceless attacker.

742
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,450
Turn your face.

743
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:55,560
Hey, it hurts.
Gently, please.

744
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:59,750
What's with the vulnerable act?
It doesn't suit you.

745
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:08,870
Hey.

746
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:10,540
What?

747
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:14,460
At least your eyes are
a bit on the pretty side.

748
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:15,830
What are you babbling about?

749
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:20,610
Look at that, your eyelashes
are quite long, too. Are they fake?

750
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:23,800
No way! I don't have
the time to get it done.

751
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:30,620
So when you look uncharacteristically sad, it's because of your eyelashes.

752
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:33,600
Can I touch them
to see if they're real?

753
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:35,670
What are you doing?

754
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:42,750
So this is how
you hit on women, huh?

755
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:51,590
You've got a problem, but the women who fall for you are even worse.

756
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:53,620
Hey, kid.

757
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:55,480
What, kid?

758
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:57,600
Let me ask you one thing.

759
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:58,580
What?

760
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:05,420
You weren't attracted to me
at all up to now? Not even once?

761
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:08,530
Did you get hit on the head too hard? Stop talking nonsense.

762
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:12,870
What are you saying?
Married Chief Kang is better than me?

763
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:17,740
Hey, didn't I tell you not
to compare yourself to Chief Kang?

764
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:20,430
Of all people...

765
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:27,660
And I've never, not even once,
been attracted to you, so don't worry.

766
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:29,770
You're telling the truth?

767
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:34,790
Yes, I'm telling the truth.
I swear to God, not even once.

768
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:37,890
And never in the future either,
so don't worry.

769
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,530
Never in the future either, you say?

770
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:44,470
Of course.
There, I'm all done. Let's go.

771
01:02:04,530 --> 01:03:05,780

five times.

are we talking about?

Well, what are her options?

What about a liver transplant?

Why not?

Ask about her Child-Pugh score.
Trust me.

What's her Child-Pugh score?

AB. Uh...

00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,358
What about
her bilirubin levels?

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,773
If they're low enough,
they might consider yttrium-90.

Hold on. You know,
you have really bad social skills.

Can you at least pretend to
not listen to my conversation?

Don't be that guy. Eyes on the prize.

Her bilirubin levels
are too high?

OK. Listen. I'm gonna
get on a flight in the morning.

35
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,882
So I should be at the hospital
by 3:00.

Yeah.

40
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:58,346
- How long are they giving her?
-I don't know. A few years.

-Yeah.

-What kind of question is that?

a fucking meteor shower. "Why?"

Yeah, I did.

get into top 10 pre-med

What makes you think
I want to go pre-med?

55
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:41,146
Well, other than the fact
that you knew what yttrium-90 is

56
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,478
when most of your peers
are still...battling to crack

58
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,650
That's just because my mom...

59
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,689
Your mom died of liver cancer.
Yeah. I know.

60
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,824
Your book bag
has a cancer ribbon pinned to it.

61
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,985
It can only be
a picture of your mom.

62
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:57,371
Fits the age range.
You guys have the same nose bridge.

63
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,157
Makes sense you want to
become a doctor that saves people.

64
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:03,122
Right? Make up for the doctor
that couldn't save your mom.

65
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,083
You know, in time,
those good intentions will fade

66
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,124
and become about the money,
it always does,

67
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,169
and you become bitter,
like everyone always becomes.

68
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:14,463
And then you die,
probably from cancer.

69
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,678

that I'm the smartest person

I feel like my life
just flashed before my eyes.

where the main character dies
in the beginning

90
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,518
but he keeps going,
not realising he's dead.

91

I'm talking about?

- What is it'? lt...it's...
-Oh, uh, sure. Uh...

Yeah, like Bruce Willis
in 'The Sixth Sense'.

00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:44,447
Exactly, yeah. Wait, no.
You know what? I never saw that.

that everyone was talking about?

97
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,702
Bruce Willis dies
in the beginning of that? That sucks!

That's a lie. I'll...

103
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,223
I'll probably harbour this
for a few more months at least.

104
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,855
And then...you know,
we'll see...see what happens.

105
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,392
That's cute.
You have an eating problem?

No. Not like... I'm... Sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

- How do you do that?
-What?

118
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,535
I haven't seen you
in a year when...

119
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,454
I was literally
just thinking about you.

120
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,840
- Gosh. Really?
-Yeah, because of that song.

121
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,468
I was listening to it
as I was walking here,

122
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,720
and it reminded me
of the hotel.

123
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,012
The one we stayed at
for my friend's wedding in Paris.

124
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,552
Yeah, yeah. Paris.
The City of Lights.

125
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,938
And pretension, as I recall.

126
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,064
We had one of
our biggest fights.

127
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,726
And that was your friend's wedding
from Wisconsin, right?

128
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:40,520
What was her name?
Lenora or Leonora?

129
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,486
- Sarah? Right.
-Right. I remember that wedding.

130
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,616
I remember that was the one
where the DJ

131
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,698
played that Montell Jordan song
twice.

132
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,704
Remember, the first time,
we thought it was ironic,

133
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,616
and then we realised
he just liked the song.

134
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,205
Definitely our biggest fight.

135
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,915
The beginning of the end,
really.

136
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,501
Yeah. Yeah.

137
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,667
MAN: Look, it's like
the Beatles, right?

138
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,132
I mean, I liked them
when lwas five.

139
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,093
But at a certain point,
you just want something

140
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,178
with a little more nuance,
you know?

141
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,559
Don't get me wrong -
I could handle them a little better

142
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,220
when they had Pete Best
to ground them,

143
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,356
but past that, I don't know -
they just got so...pedestrian.

144
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:21,358
- Do you come here a lot?
-Do I come to the cemetery?

145
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,237
I like cemeteries, you know.

146
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,774
They're romantic.
Especially this one.

147
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,988
Soccer is by far
the most elegant sport.

148
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:30,324
It's gonna overtake football in America
in the next two years.

149
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,285
Oh, God. Really? Two years?

150
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,949
A friend of mine
described it perfectly.

151
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,492
Clock's ticking.

152
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,035
He blogs, "Soccer's...

153
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,045
-"Soccer's chess on the field."
-Oh.

154
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,753
Do you have any vomit bags
in there?

155
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:44,794
I guess we could just throw...
I'd hate to throw up at a grave.

156
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,132
Why didn't you just go to
the Griffith Park Observatory, then,

157
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,717
to watch the meteor shower?

158
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,382
Well, they have assholes there too.
Trust me.

159
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,266
And there are assholes
all over this city,

160
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,769
but rarely do you get to be
next to one so spectacular.

161
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,272
Only knock on him, I have to say,
he's from New York.

162
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,183
I can't stand that place.
Seriously. It's so overrated.

163
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,102
Why, because of all the bridges
and the culture

164
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,895
and the history they have?

165
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,939
Who needs it?
I'll take Orlando any day.

166
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,824
They got so many more
TGI Fridays.

167
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:10,155
That's why I love L.A.
Los Angeles is just more...

168
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,161
- Oh, no.
-Modern.

169
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,493
There's a relevancy about it.
New York doesn't have any...

170
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,079
Kimberly, I was wondering
if I could have your number.

171
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,745
- What?
-Your phone number.

172
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,460
Dude.

173
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,000
She's with me.

174
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:26,042
No.

175
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:28,678
Uh, yeah. She is.

176
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,635
No, she's not.
Not yet anyway.

177
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,299
At best,
this is a first date,

178
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,388
and I'm shocked that
that even happened.

179
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,929
I have nothing against you.
You might not be a bad guy.

180
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,348
Most likely, but maybe not.
You're incredibly handsome.

181
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,733
You were probably very handsome
when you were a kid too.

182
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,814
I think that explains your lack
of substance and personality.

183
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,945
Only because nobody's ever
really challenged you before.

184
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,653
So now as an adult,
you think everything you say

185
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,692
means something,
but it means nothing, actually.

186
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,078
You don't know what you're
talking about, it's upsetting,

187
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,079
and I think she probably
sees through that.

188
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,115
You're very pretty,
but you're shallow beyond belief.

189
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:02,587
Anyway, can I have
your number?

190
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,873
- OK. OK.
-What are you doing?

191
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,258
You just said all that shit.

192
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,419
Yeah, but it was
just an observation.

193
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,299
And you ask my girl out
in front of me?

194
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:19,141
Shit. Sorry. My mistake.
I see that now.

195
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,181
I shouldn't have done that.
She's way too beautiful.

196
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,896
- What?
-I should be more of a realist.

197
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,481
I should know I'm a C,
maybe a C+ in winter,

198
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,567
when I can cover up
my body more.

199
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,198
Even though you're a douchebag,
you're incredibly attractive,

200
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:31,824
so maybe it's only fair
you two pair.

201
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,656
(LAUGHS)

202
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,741
What? It rhymed.

203
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,032
She's right. It rhymed.
Alright. Let's...

204
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,246
Can you just put me down?
This is...

205
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,910
This is embarrassing now
for everyone.

206
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,374
OK. Come on, Josh.
The line's moving. Let's just go.

207
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,917
- KIMBERLY: Come on.
-Wanna get a good seat.

208
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:55,098
The only thing wrong with you
is you're a chickenshit.

209
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,384
- That's all.
-lt's not the only problem.

210
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,770
- Let's go. Excuse me. Excuse me.
-lt's one of many.

211
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,273
- You OK?
-Yeah. I shouldn't talk.

212
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,275
That's when
I get into trouble.

213
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,358
I'm sorry I made fun of
your sandwich bag.

214
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,443
I didn't mean to.
That's not true. I did.

215
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,201
Sorry. I'm really nervous.

216
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,364
It's OK.
Well, I'm sorry he bothered you.

217
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,657
Oh. I'm not nervous
because of him.

218

219
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,256

00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,139
...beautiful.

The Wedding's in an hour.

222

- You got to get ready.
-(SIGHS)

223
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:50,146
So...have you ever
dreamt about me'?

224
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,985
- Dreamt about you?
-Yeah.

225
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,650
You know, in the 700+ days
we've dated.

226
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,616
MAN: You ever dreamt about me?

227
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,827
KIMBERLY: So...
Yeah, of course.

228
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,618
Oh, yeah? Like, uh...
like, sex dreams?

229
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,004
At first, but then we had sex
and that went away.

230
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,961
Ha. ls that how you
really want to say that?

231
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,752
I was all hot to trot for you,
or whatever, in the beginning,

232
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,671
and now, you know,
reality set in.

233
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,216
That's not what I meant.
I meant, like...

234
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:21,476
- I got it.
-A dream, like...

235

of what we are,

236
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,598
or were, or could be,
stuff like that.

237
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,516
Will you stop it already?
I got it.

238
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:31,357
- Why, I oughta...
-Hey! Whoa.

239
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,521
Put that down.
You're not yourself.

240
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,066

-l'm gonna give you what-for.

00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,609

242
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,028
Yeah.

243
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,946

244
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,667
OK.

245
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,249
OK. That was fun.

246
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,710
Does it bother you
that you don't make me happy?

247
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,001
- Always with the jokes.
-l'm serious.

248
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,261
Seriously, you went from sex dreams
to not being happy.

249
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,467
False. I wasn't talking about sex dreams.
You were.

250
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,597
And, secondly, I'm a girl,
so, yes, we're non sequitur.

251
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,306
- Ah, that's a little clich?d.
-I want a baby.

252
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,767
- Point taken.
-Seriously.

253
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,023
Don't you want a baby?

when we get to it, OK?

256
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,483
See? Not making me happy.

257
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,153
How do you do that?
How do you do that?

258
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,963
Oh, my God, she's beautiful.
She's beyond beautiful.

259
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,259
She's real.
And she seems funny too.

260
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,887
And just have a hint of crazy.
I can feel it.

I saw...
I thought I saw somebody,

278
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:10,061
a friend of mine, behind you,
coming over, so...

279
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:12,187
Well, that's why
I turned around and waited.

280

So, what's the big deal?

281
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,726
Wasn't because
you were watching me?

282
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,987
It looked like you were
kind of watching me.

283
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,568
No. It was because of a friend
that was behind you.

Well, so they're...so they're
not there now, obviously.

285
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:28,287
Besides, you were being weird.
You were talking to yourself.

00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,750
- What were you saying anyway?
-You know, you say 'so' a lot.

-It's really annoying.
-So, do...

Are you trying
to make this awkward now?

- It feels awkward now.
-Awkward feels good to me.

I'm not trying to fuck you.

293

I mean...

294

If they haven't divorced by now,
probably means they've just

302

surrendered to the fact
that being apart is much better

303
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:12,324
than being together -
you know, the lesser of two evils.

304

It's like an emotional holocaust
between your parents right now.

something redeemable.

00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,580
I was thinking about
how that applies to us,

339
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,124
you know, the idea of us,

340
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,792
how we've...we've really
mutated and evolved.

341
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,336
J' And it's a hard

343
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,382
Because if you think about it,

344
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,471
we were just dumb young kids
when we first met,

345
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,887
then we broke up, got back together,
blah, blah, blah,

346
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,306
and now, now we're this
really mature, loving couple

00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,725

and admiration for each other -

348
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:03,518
you know what I mean?

349
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,695
Kimberly?

350
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,191
You hung up on me,
didn't you?

351
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:12,736
J' But it's over now

352
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:18,625
J' From the moment we touched

356
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:39,520

Yeah, I meditate before every date.

a Bob Dylan song

a Britney Spears song.

-No... It's really important.

00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,932
- Really important.
-l'm on the frickin' phone.

381

-Yeah.

You know, like, tears ofjoy,
that kind of thing.

00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,535
No. I've never cried
at one of these things.

387
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,163
Yeah, no.
Either have I, ever, ever.

388
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,165
In fact, I don't understand
people that do it.

389
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,826
It's kind of bullshit,
happy crying, isn't it?

390
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,744
What are you...what are
your thoughts on that?

391
00:21:26,911 --> 00:21:30,256
So...l was on the phone.

392
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,293
So, yeah,
you were on the phone.

393
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:35,086
Sorry. Was it important?

394
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,720
More important
than your question?

395
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,381
- Yes.
-Yes.

396
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,720
My mistake. Sorry.

00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:43,306
-L'll never interrupt you again.
-Thank you.

398
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,392
- OK.
-Well...

399
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,976
- I should get back to my date.
-I want to keep talking to you.

400
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,815
- What?
-For multiple reasons.

401
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:53,820
You're beautiful, but it's more
than that, I promise.

402
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,027
Well, that's very nice,
but I should go.

403
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,864
Maybe I'll see you
in the winter, when you're a C+.

404
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,654
Oh. See? I knew it.
I knew you were superficial. I told you.

405
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,244
The only reason you're talking to me
is you think I'm hot.

406
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,750
The only reason why you won't
is because you think I'm not.

407
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,707
Fine. Give me a reason
why I should.

408
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,879
I was saying,
"Don't miss her."

409
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,135
When you saw me talking
to myself, "Don't miss her."

410
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,671
I'm always afraid I'm gonna miss
the important things in life,

411
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,091
and something about you has given me
a heightened curiosity

412
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,430
to know you better, and that is
a near-impossible feat

413
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,970
when it comes to me,
'cause I hate getting to know people.

414
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,979
But I can tell
you're not like the others.

415
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,856
- What others?
-People.

416
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,767
People? You can tell
I'm not a person?

417
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:33,902
Yeah.
You're not phoney like them.

418
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,189
I didn't say you were hot.
I said you're beautiful.

419
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,280
When is this dumb thing
gonna happen?

420
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,206
It's a beautiful night, though.

421
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,000
What?

422
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,510
I never know that means,
people saying it's a beautiful night.

423
00:22:58,669 --> 00:22:59,795
What does that mean?

424
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:04,141
So... Well, to me...

425
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,271
It means it's...
it's comfortable, familiar.

426
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,432
Yet deeply moving.

427
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,398
Right. No, I feel you.
Like, um...

428
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,279
Like I'm stoned
and listen to Steely Dan.

429
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,440
No. Nothing at all like that.

430
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,076
Not like... No. I know.
More like an... Yeah.

431
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,738
Like...floating down
a serene lake in a rowboat

432
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,033
when the sun is setting

433
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:30,326
or like when the sun is...
being a part of nature.

434
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,914
_StQp speaking.
-Yep.

435
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:36,127
It's beautiful when
the weather's not hot or cold.

436
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:40,420
Kind of like you don't notice it,
kind of like it's perfect

437
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,213
'cause everything's
so balanced.

438
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,381
You don't even feel it.

439
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:47,176
And while you're feeling
that non-feeling...

440
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,479
...you look up in the sky

441
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,606
and you almost think,

442
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,563
"That's why,"

443
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,069
because how everything is
right now,

444
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,650
all the stars
and planets

445
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:04,068
and us and the ground
and the cells and molecules...

446
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,111
Right now...

447
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,531
...is exactly the reason.

448
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,247
Right now is comfortable.

449
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,786
You're a now person.

450
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,330
- True.
-Yeah.

451
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,123
See, I'm a five-minutes-from-now
person,

452
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,666
because five minutes from now,

453
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,460
a gust of wind could come
and blow H1 N1 in everyone's eyes.

454
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:24,722
Right.
Except that's highly unlikely.

455
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,099
Or five minutes from now,
an earthquake could erupt

456
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:29,134
and swallow us all whole.

457
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,599
Right. Except that... Shit.
That could actually happen.

458
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,639
Yeah - the point is
I'm way too anxious about

459
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,104
what could happen five minutes
from now to be content with now.

460
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,563
Can't do it.

461
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,478
What if something good happens

462
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,022
five minutes from now?

463
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,407
- Can't that happen?
-No.

464
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,363
What did you think
was gonna happen

465
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:47,494
five minutes
before you met me?

466
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,415
Just really paranoid
I'm gonna miss it.

467
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,580
I miss things a lot.

468
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,800
I don't care ifl miss it
because...

469
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:03,961
You're a now person. Got it.

470
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,174
So, another weird thing -

471
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,560
I don't mind your pessimism

472
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,813
as much as I usually mind pessimism.

473
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,690
That's great. I hate people
who think I'm too negative.

474
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:20,861
Also, I like your hat.

475
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,569
Yeah, I'm probably gonna
fall in love with you.

That's it?

479
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,547
What were you hoping for?

480
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,253
"I'm going to

Well, yeah.

483
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,172
So all that stuff about
not believing in relationships...

484
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,715
That's just
a pick-up line.

485
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,056
Do we have a deal, then?

486
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,312
'Cause you said you believe in love.
I don't.

487
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,099
So let's put it to the test-
date each other, me and you,

488
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,188
in a relationship.

489
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,352
Let's do it.

490
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,954
Why the hell
am I shaking your hand?

491
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,414
I should be scared to death
of who you are as a person.

492
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:25,005
Instead, I'm scared to death
of weddings - death, literally.

493
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,044
I'd probably have a coronary

494

Please invite me to your wedding.

496
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,263
I'd love to see that.

497
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,346
Well, that's morbid and telling.

498
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,436
Yeah, well, if snuff films
were readily available,

499
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,475
I'd probably watch 'em -
not gonna lie.

500
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,986
- Is that a deal-breaker for you?
-No.

501
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,818
Because for some reason,
I still happen to be in love with you.

502
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,357
No, it's because
you didn't think

you'd be the one
marrying me.

Don't do that.

00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,655
- So do you still love me?
-(SIGHS)

507
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,665
I tell you all the time.

508
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:59,452
If you died right now,
I'd visit your grave every single day.

509
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,630
Not every day. It's crazy.

510
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:05,257
That doesn't
answer the question.

511
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,961
Of course I love you.

512
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,351
It never sounds real
when you say it.

513
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,307
Like it doesn't exist.

514
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:52,922
So, what are you doing here?

515
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,886
I'm going up north.

516
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,471
- Why would you do that?
-I don't know.

517
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,513
- You don't know?
-|... Of course. I'm kidding.

518
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,558
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna meet someone.

519
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:08,821
So... Right. OK.

520
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,700
- How's your mom doing?
-Uh, she's actually fine.

521
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,907
I can't believe I haven't
talked to you this long.

522
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,788
Her doctors were huge idiots,
so I took matters in my own hands.

523
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,291
I figured out a way to dose her
with that experimental drug

524
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,827
we were developing
in the lab.

525
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:25,212
Wait. Are you allowed
to do that?

526
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,168
No.

527
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,460
Wasn't that...
extremely dangerous?

528
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,674
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
-Well, she's fine now?

529
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,965
Yeah, completely.
She's in remission. So...

530
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,008
- Dell, that's great.
-Yeah.

531
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,098
I mean, other than
the totally unethical

532
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,013
recklessly risking your mom's life part,
that's...that's...

533
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:45,774
- You...you saved her.
-Yeah, I guess.

534
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:47,981
We should probably keep that
between us, by the way,

535
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,770
just because
there's a good chance

536
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:52,156
<i>what</i> I <i>did was illegal...ish.</i>

537
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,282
Right.

538
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,660
-(HORN TOOTS)
-Oh.

539
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,196
- All aboard!
-Right.

540
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:01,115
- Uh...
-We should probably...

541
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,534
OK, right.

542
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,543
Well, still. Wow.

543
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,454
Can't believe
you're curing cancer now.

544
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,168
Does that mean
you've stopped hating people?

545
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,878
Not at all.

546
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,420
Kill Zelda Fitzgerald.

547
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,844
Right?

548
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,974
- Who is that?
-Really?

549
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,635
I don't know who that is.

550
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,806
F. Scott Fitzgerald's
annoying...wife.

551
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,895
- Oh, really?
-Yeah.

552
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,526
DELL: I'd definitely marry
Rita Hayworth.

553
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:33,235
- Great hair.
-Hair, right.

554
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,241
Guys love her hair.

555
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,071
I definitely have to
shit out of this one.

556
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:43,161
- Olga Kordenstitch? Who is that?
-I don't know.

557
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,291
I've just always
wanted to fuck an Olga.

558
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,794
I would definitely
marry Tupac.

559
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:50,001
Kimberly Shakur.

560
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,632
It's got a good ring to it.

561
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,920
KIMBERLY: I would definitely eff
Edward R. Murrow.

562
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,555
I picture him
starting up sex with,

563
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,638
"Goodnight and good luck."

564
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,849
(LAUGHS)

565
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,602
I'd probably laugh so much
that I'd have an orgasm

566
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,486
right then and there.

567
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,989
(SNORTS)

568
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,991
From the laughter, you know?

569
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,619
I lied about
not seeing 'The Sixth Sense'.

570
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,905
- You saw it?
-Of course I saw it.

571
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,573
Everybody saw it.
It's amazing.

572
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,708
Who didn't see
'The Sixth Sense'?

573
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,086
Why would you lie
about that?

574
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:33,670
I read in a woman's magazine
that every relationship,

575
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,209
whether it be short-term
or long-term,

576
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,753
there's usually one big lie
relative to that relationship,

577
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,718
and Ijust...l wanted to
get mine over with, I guess.

578
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:43,725
Why would you want to
get a jump start on the lying?

579
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,306
Because of...

580
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:46,846
Oh, because of
five minutes from now.

581
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:49,060
Well, yeah.

582
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,817
You're assuming that we're in
a relationship, or going to be,

583
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,695
when I'm still technically
on a date with someone else,

584
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,027
which I should probably
be getting back to, by the way.

585
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,409
What about the handshake?
We shook hands. You can't do that.

586
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,821
- I was leading you on.
-That's really fucked up.

587
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,578
- That's the business.
-Well, what about a friendship?

588
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,334
Actually,
what am I talking about?

589
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,461
I definitely don't
want to be friends with you.

590
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,092
I was raped, in high school,

591
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,380
by the quarterback
of the football team.

592
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,049
Jesus!

593
00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,139
I know.

594
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,224
That is a terrible lie.

595
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,310
Hey. How do you know
that's a lie?

596
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,190
You were raped in high school

597
00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:33,851
by the quarterback
of the football team?

598
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,815
I don't think after-school
specials are that clich?.

599
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,524
You couldn't have gone with,
like, a cornerback

600
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,655
or a defensive end
or something?

601
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:41,988
Well, lwas just trying
to get mine over with.

602
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,948
- Your what over who?
-My lie to you.

603
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,113
- You can't.
-Why can't?

604
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,452
Because I saw it coming,
'cause we just talked about it.

605
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,913
(SIGHS)
You're very good at this.

606
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,249
You got to wait until I'm in
a completely vulnerable position

607
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,085
where I'd really
fall for it.

608
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:56,624
- Sounds really dangerous.
-Oh, yeah.

609
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,212
That's the problem
with relationships.

610
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,048
- Danger?
-Or worse.

611
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,178
- Worse?
-You change the other person.

612
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,848
You are a very broken man, Dell.

613
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,101
In theory.

614
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,354
Speaking of broken men,

615
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,981
your goateed philistine
is sashaying toward us.

616
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,529
- Run. Run! Run!
-What? What?

617
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,669
Well, that's settled.

618
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,130
Want a hit?

619
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,795
No way.

620
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,929
It has a weird effect on me.

621
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:48,433
For some reason, when I'm high,
I think people can't hear me

622
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:51,266
and I start speaking
really loudly.

623
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,024
(LOUDLY) Do you remember
memorising phone numbers?

624
00:32:56,183 --> 00:33:00,188
I don't remember the last time
I memorised a phone number.

625
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,776
Yeah, I don't either, actually.
Remember...

626
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,816
Remember checking the newspaper
for movie show times?

627
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,530
Can remember that.

628
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,320
Or writing people those notes
in those, like,

629
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,080
folded-up triangles

630
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,036
and then...putting them
in their lockers?

631
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,540
Do you think
kids still do that,

632
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,704
as opposed to
just emails or texts?

633
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,999
No way. It's all about
emails and texts.

634
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,418
Those goddamn hugs and kisses.

635
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,552
Oh, I hate those things.

636
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,429
Whenever anybody emails me
hugs and kisses,

637
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,761
I want to just email them back
oral and penetration.

638
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,265
Are we old?

639
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,896
Are we talking
like old people?

640
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,730
Are we on the verge ofjoining
the sweatpants culture?

641
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,653
Was I just saying something?

642
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,364
- What? What'd I say?
-Give me that.

643
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:55,284
- Why?
-Give me that. OK.

644
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,872
That's it for you. Mmm.

645
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,584
I think you should, uh...

646
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,874
You should start drinking
some coffee.

647
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,044

-That's why I hate time.

I want to have sex with you.

-Yeah. We got to get ready.

gonna make it.

but we got to go, Kim.

at the wedding, you know,

the wedding that we're supposed
to go to in half an hour.

665
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,296
And you just ate lunch.
You're not full?

What does that
have to do with anything?

Jesus. This is the pot talking.
You shouldn't have smoked.

668
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:13,346
I knew it. You got to get ready.
What are you doing?

669
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,099
You made me promise to get you
there on time, no matter what.

670
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:20,979
- You warned me you'd do this.
-See? This is why I hate time.

673

I wish I could just...
stop it or something.

674
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:31,448
Or at least just make it pause
when needed, like now.

675
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,530
Really, I'd just
get rid of it altogether.

676
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,162

How would you do that?

00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,788
You know how there's
time-based art?

678
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:41,541
Movies, music, plays -
it's all time-based art.

679
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,419
There's a beginning
and a middle and an end.

680
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,251
And you have to see it
from beginning to end.

681
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:49,667
You're restrained
to that time line,

682
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,881
that way of experiencing it.

683
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:57,470
But then there's paintings -
no beginning, no middle, no end.

684
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,852
You see what you want to see
when you want to see it.

685
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,265
No restrictions.
It's just there.

686
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:08,436
OK. So you want life
to be a painting.

687
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,353
Great.

688
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,119
Come on.

689
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:24,000
(BURPS)

690
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,540
Thanks.

691
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,754
So do you know
you really love me?

692
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,055
So, what's in your pocket?

693
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:43,219
My wallet.

694
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,104
It's stuffed with
our saved movie ticket stubs

695
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,765
'cause I'm a romantic
like that.

696
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,558
- Can you please get ready?
-Shh!

697
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:51,148
Can't you see
I'm trying to touch my toes?

698
00:37:51,311 --> 00:37:53,655
I don't want to be that couple
that's always late for things.

699
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,066
Can we please not be
that couple?

700
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,360
At least for the tenure
of our relationship. Please?

701
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,117
You did it again.

702
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,409
What? What? I'm just saying
I want us to respect time.

703
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:09,000
- Not that.
-OK. What, then?

704
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:11,756
What did I do that I did
twice now and still not know?

705
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:13,792
You said
"the tenure of our relationship".

706
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,960
You keep speaking about
our relationship as if it's ending.

707
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,755
OK. You see how this relates to
the time thing?

708
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,765
Why don't you take
your own advice

709
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:22,847
and instead of seeing
a beginning, middle and an end,

710
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,011
just see it as a painting.

711
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,101
-(HAIR DRYER BLOWS)
-Kimberly, what are you doing?

712
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,607
We're gonna be late! And I'm
gonna somehow get blamed for it.

713
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:30,767
I know it.

714
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,858
-(HAIR DRYER BLOWS)
-(TRAIN HORN BLOWS)

715
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,828
What...what are you reading?

716
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,114
Roald Dahl short stories.

717
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:51,580
So is it about a girl-
you're going up north, new girlfriend,

718
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,999
you're not telling me
'cause you think it'll make it awkward?

719
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,382
Right.

720
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:58,173
Yeah.

721
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:02,883
So, right? OK.

722
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,973
- A girl.
-I love Roald Dahl.

723
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,137
It's the best.
Which one are you reading?

724
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,102
And are you sleeping
with anyone?

725
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,858
The one about Hitler. And yes.

726
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,895
Shit.

727
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,938
I didn't know
he wrote one about Hitler.

728
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,324
Well, kind of.

729
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,530
Well, it's about this doctor
that saves this woman's life.

730
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,946
She's on the verge of death
through the whole delivery.

731
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:27,116
And this doctor is so determined
to save this woman's life

732
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,034
and the life
of her unborn child, right?

733
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,329
But...it turns out...
the child's Hitler.

734
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,624
OK. Did you just
give away the ending?

735
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:37,292
How can I tell you
what it's about

736
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,835
without giving away
the ending?

737
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:40,379
What are you talking about?

738
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,889
Just say it's a story about
a doctor who saves a woman

739
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,640
from a potentially fatal pregnancy.

740
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,392
- That's what the story's about?
-It is.

741
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,519
False, birdbrain.
That is not what the story's about.

742
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,976
It's about the...irony
that the baby's Hitler.

743
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:52,982
- OK. You're mad.
-l'm not mad.

744
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:55,235
- You're mad 'cause of the girl.
-l'm seeing a guy - Jack.

745
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:59,273
- You're seeing a Jack?
-He's an executive at MTV.

746
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:01,157
Looks like a cross
between Salvador Dali

747
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:03,785
and Dwayne Wayne
from 'A Different World', which is hot.

748
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,205
That's a weird combination.

749
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,336
I got to go to the bathroom
really quick.

750
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:27,142
Oh, that...fucking hurt.

751
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,974
- What?
-You hung up on me.

752
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,763
- What happened?
-Because.

753
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,059
OK, you realise that's not
an answer to my question, right?

754
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,942
What is it
I can help you with, sir?

755
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,069
Have I told you
how much New York reminds me

756
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,775
of why I hate L.A.
so much?

757
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,067
No, please do, because
the New Yorker who opines

758
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:46,327
the inferiorities of Los Angeles
is bursting with originality.

759
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:48,784
I'm serious, Kimberly.
We gotta move here.

760
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,917
It is the fucking best.
It's enough already with L.A.

761
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:54,578
It's like a mix of
moral nihilism and Disneyland.

762
00:40:54,744 --> 00:40:56,712
- So are you.
-Hey. Uh...

763
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,044
Did I tell you
the proof of concept on our drug

764
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:01,005
passed with flying colours?

765
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,386
There's actually a bidding war
between a few pharmas right now.

766
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,138
Looks like we could be licensing it
for close to 25 million.

767
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,138
- Money for soul seems like...
-BOTH: An even swap.

768
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,302
Yes. It's not like
I'm not happy for you.

769
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,688
But you did already tell me this
all this morning, remember?

770
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,894
- Did <i>l</i> really?
- Uh-huh.

771
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,651
Oh, shit.
Short-term memory must be shot.

772
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,653
What with the smoking pot
and whatnot.

773
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,110
I'm your new
second-term girlfriend, man.

774
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,149
Aren't you supposed to be,
like, impressing me still?

775
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,535
Your second-term boyfriend
just told you he made his bosses

776
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,321
close to $25 million today.

777
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,993
-L'm not materialistic.
-Yeah, I know that.

778
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,456
But $25 million sort of...

779
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,871
...l don't know,
makes that sound retarded.

780
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,290
OK, seeing as there's
no new information in this call,

781
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,379
I am gonna go -
I'm almost at the gun range.

782
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:45,091
Hey - don't you think it's cute
that you own a gun card

783
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:47,005
and I own a pot card?

784
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,173
Now you sound retarded.

785
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,842
Listen, we should probably
stop saying 'retarded'.

786
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:52,386
L'm starting to feel
like an asshole.

787
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,054
Oh, is that
just now starting?

788
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:00,185
What's going on?
You sound off.

789
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,945
- You're off.
-No, no, no. I'm serious.

790
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:05,357
Cadence is all over the place.

791
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,946
You sound a little like
Ms Teschmacher

792
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,827
when she betrayed
Lex Luthor.

793
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,613
Something's wrong.
I can tell.

794
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:16,747
What's going on?

795
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,171
God, this is gonna blow.

796
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,798
- What's going on'?
-(SIGHS)

797
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,755
Oh, shit.
This is bad, isn't it?

798
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,092
This is, like,
infidelity bad.

799
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:33,893
I definitely heard a silence
just now.

800
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,771
- What is going on?
-(THUNDER RUMBLES)

801
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,187
- You OK?
-Yeah. You OK?

802
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,447
<i>So...</i>

803
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:49,405
-lt's been a while.
-Yep.

804
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,950
- Glad you're finally here.
-Yeah. Me too.

805
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,129
Been trying to get a hold of you
for a long time now.

806
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,791
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

807
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,504
Do you want a tour
of the place?

808
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:08,761
- No.
-Oh. OK.

809
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,757
- Seriously?
-Oh, yeah.

810
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,552
You know I don't care about
stupid shit like that.

811
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,223
Right.
J' It must have been love... J'

812
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,187
Sorry. I have adjusted to
normal people.

813
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:23,897
So your presence
is gonna take some realignment.

814
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,313
- Are you moving?
-Uh...

815
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:29,653
No. Kind of. Uh...

816
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,695
Do you want anything,
by the way, like, uh...

817
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,407
I want to talk.

818
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,089
What?

819
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,388
Nothing. For a second, I...

820
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,723
I forgot
what you looked like.

821
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,477
For the record, I've never
forgotten what you look like.

822
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,068
OK. Chill out, OK?
I didn't sleep with anyone.

823
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:13,280
OK. Did you see and/or touch
another man's penis in any way?

824
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:17,037
Really? Out of all the things you want to know,
this is what you want to ask most?

825
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,573
What kind of question's that?

826
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,707
Of course that's what
I want to know the most.

827
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,494
No. Penises
were not involved.

828
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,287
Were your boobs
and/or vagina?

829
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:27,627
No! It was...texts.

830
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,292
That's all it was.

831
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,677
Damn! I should never have
gone against my own advice.

832
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,089
I should always be the better-looking one
in the relationship.

833
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:36,007
I just sort of
hit an impasse on that.

834
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,767
Honestly! Gosh.
Dell, do you really think...

835
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,927
Who was it?

836
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:49,779
It was my...in-between ex, Jack.

837
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:53,282
Jack? The MTV exec?
Are you fucking serious?

838
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,364
I thought you hated MTV.

839
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,200
- Isn't he short?
-He's not tall.

840
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,286
Are you seriously defending him?
You can't call him short?

841
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:04,544
You have to go with "not tall"?
Jesus, you like him.

842
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,955
Why the fuck are you being
so sangfroid over this shit?

843

of a monsoon right now.

847
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:18,137
Well, so...
Maybe I should let you go, then?

848
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,472
Why? Because I'm standing
in the middle of a monsoon?

849
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,512
No, because you... Yes!

850
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,521

in the middle of a monsoon.

What are you staring at?

855
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:52,216
That reminds rne. I've been
keeping articles about you.

856

They said that your drug
led to major breakthroughs

-Jack.

talking about?

862

Well, you boxed up a lot of
old kitchen appliances over there.

863
00:46:18,693 --> 00:46:20,286

on General Electric

out of your friends
and family.

You've been fidgeting
with your ring finger nonstop.

867
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:27,998
You're also
giving me that look

868
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,128
like you're trying
to think of a lie real quick.

- Getting sized.
-Huh.

874
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,104
Question number two -
why didn't you tell me?

875
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:50,107
I was gonna tell you, before you did
your whole annoying MacGyver thing.

876
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:52,769
Yeah, I don't think that's the reference
you're looking for.

- Does Jack even know I'm here?
-(SCOFFS)

- Trust me. He knows you're here.
-What does that mean?

- Why'd you scoff?
-What scoff? I didn't scoff.

880

You scoffed.

You guys fought
about me coming.

882
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,785
I'm actually kind of flattered.

883
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,420
Didn't know yours truly
could threaten

884
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:13,047
the evil prince
of the MTV generation.

885
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,128
First of all,
Jack's leaving MTV.

886
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:17,214
His article in 'Esquire'
was optioned by George Clooney.

Yeah, well, I won my fantasy
baseball league last year.

00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,922
Let's not talk
about Jack, OK?

889
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,465
I'm happy
to not talk about Jack.

in here?

So, l...l had a very vivid dream
the other night about us.

894

What was it about,
this vivid dream?

896
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,910

of memories,

897

You owe the person
that saved you, don't you think?

900
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:55,839
You had a dream
that was really a series

901
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,966
of memories of conversations
we've had?

902
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,469
Yeah, don't hurt yourself.
It's not that complicated.

903
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,505

there's no difference

904
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,514
between reality and dreams.

905
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,926
They were just memories of us
over the years.

906
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:11,765
What if I don't subscribe to
a culture of indentured servitude?

907
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,808
You can't unsubscribe.

908
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:17,399
It's a thing of nature.
It's here to stay.

909
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,359
But they weaved in and out
of each other

910
00:48:19,522 --> 00:48:21,240
like those...
those M.C. Escher drawings,

911
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,901
so one second,
I'd be on the train

912
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,115
that time
that we got back together,

913
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,496
after our first break-up.

914
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:30,499
Another second,
I was on the phone in New York...

915
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:35,459
...the last time
we ever talked to each other.

916
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:39,087
But they...they blended together
like a...

917
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,627
Painting?

918
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:42,921
I saved your life.

919
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:46,182
If it weren't for me, you would
have been run over by that car.

920
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,684
You would have been splat,

921
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:51,847
just like my
timeless life painting thing.

922
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:55,483
And they were all real,

923
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,860
but there was one moment
in the dream that was...

924
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:03,529
Well, it was one we never had.
It was...it was the only one.

925
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:06,991
KIMBERLY: What was it about,
this made-up moment?

926
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:09,906
It's gonna sound weird -
it was...us talking,

927
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,949
after not having talked
for however long.

928
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:17,205
- Wait. I'm confused. It was...
-This moment. Yeah.

929
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,169
This moment
that we're having right now,

930
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,924
so me coming over,
seeing your apartment,

931
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,677
your life with Jack,
and reconnecting.

I blame L.A. for this.

you fall in love in Los Angeles.

- Are you breaking up with me'?
-I don't want to, no.

But...you like
this Jack guy, right?

was one of my favourite characters

his good name.

00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:55,326
I can't even order
a Jack and Coke anymore.

- My life is ruined.
-OK.

You're mad.

947
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,928
And any words we exchange now
are gonna be bleak at best.

948
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,054
You used to never want
to get off the phone.

949
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:10,967
I used to want to get off the phone.
I just used to not.

950
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,056
And now you can't wait
to get off the phone.

we're fighting about anymore.

fine, but I'm too tired

for another one
of your meta arguments.

954
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,648
There's no way I deserve
to be treated like this.

to be my indentured servant.

-So...

right now?

prescription-to-life thing.

subscription to nature.

-But then I saved your life.

On the train. We ran into each together.
We got back together.

963

You mean when you stalked
and followed me onto the train?

964
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,218
You got off at Chico.
You weren't supposed to get off.

965
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,596
You were supposed to go to Portland,
but because of me,

966
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:51,428
you got off at Chico and weren't
on the train when it derailed.

967
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,638
- You could have died.
-No-one died, Dell.

968
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:56,554
- The point remains.
-No, that is not the same. OK?

969
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,848
You would absolutely have died
had I not saved you.

970
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,688
Plus, I saw that car coming.
I knew it was gonna hit you.

- And I knowingly saved you.
-Yeah, well...

That's starting to feel
like a minus, not a plus.

Be that as it may,
you didn't know you were saving me.

974

You were just trying
to get back in my pants.

975
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,038
No! lwas trying
to get you back.

976

Which just happens to include
getting in your pants.

977
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:19,035
So yours was a sinister doing.
Mine was pure altruism.

I should have told you I loved you more,
when we were together.

987
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:59,826
I mean...
I was also such a dick to you.

988
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,960
I just thought you'd find it endearing
for some reason,

989
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,919
like the way people feel about
Don Rickles or Mussolini.

990

It's not an excuse.
It's just...just a reason.

Anyway, I'm sorry, OK?

992
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:22,018
I need a drink, in a bad way.

There's a bar car here,
and they sell drinks.

994

- Let's go.
-Does that mean we have to...

995

We have to walk
in between the cars while...

996

I can't do that

take every little opportunity

alleviate some of the guilt,
you know?

noises that the train makes.

with gravity.

"Where's my fucking money?"

00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:07,139
- Have you ever done that?
-You mean, like, at random?

01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:45,368
Listen. Come on.

1175
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:48,204
I want you to do this.

1176
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:57,175
Why wouldn't you
want this forever?

1177
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,837
I'd like for once
to understand

1178
01:04:01,004 --> 01:04:03,348
why you wouldn't
want this always.

1179
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:09,514
DELL: 'Cause 'always' is scary.
There's a finality to it.

1180
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:15,769
Just don't ever want you
to feel like a limitation.

1181
01:04:18,021 --> 01:04:20,820
OK. Let me go
a different way with it.

1182
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:23,110
Why are girls so scared
of cockroaches, huh?

1183
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:24,653
It's 'cause you think
they'll hurt you,

1184
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,196
even though they can't,

1185
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:27,865
just like I'm afraid 'always'
will hurt me.

1186
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,624
- They're both irrational.
-False on so many fronts.

1187
01:04:29,783 --> 01:04:31,456
Well, why?

1188
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:33,086
Girls are afraid of cockroaches

1189
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:35,212
because they're gross
and they carry disease,

1190
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:37,591
proven by the fact that they're
one of the biblical plagues.

1191
01:04:37,749 --> 01:04:40,377
Also, they love to lay eggs
in your vagina.

1192
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,511
Secondly,
it's not irrational to think

1193
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:46,015
that commitment can hurt you,
'cause it can.

1194
01:04:55,683 --> 01:04:57,936
Know that when you
steal a girl's 20s,

1195
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:00,731
it's dangerous business,
buster.

1196
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:09,323
You're officially on notice,
Mr Pink Lighter.

1197
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:12,830
Duly noted, Mrs Pink Lighter.

1198
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,211
No. You can't call rne that.

1199
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,418
You don't want to marry me,
remember?

1200
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,958
I didn't say that.

1201
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,093
Where's my phone?

1202
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:26,223
Where's my phone?
Where's my fucking phone?

1203
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:29,510
('FONDU AU NOIR' CONTINUES)

1204
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:42,147
Hey, w-w-why don't I call it?

1205
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:44,486
Why are you acting like that?

1206
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:47,118
- Like what?
Uncomfortable.

1207
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:49,200
In the two years
we've known each other,

1208
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:50,784
I have rarely seen you
uncomfortable.

1209
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:52,699
L'm...l'm not.

1210
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:54,868
You are.

1211
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,877
You're hiding something
from me.

1212
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:59,209
Oh, God. You just got
too stoned, Kimberly.

1213
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:01,340
And I thought we were going
after your last cigarette.

1214
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,172
- What are you doing?
-What are you hiding?

1215
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,132
- You know something.
-There's no something.

1216
01:06:05,295 --> 01:06:07,013
You just got too high.

1217
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:08,549
You best motherfucking believe
there's a something.

1218
01:06:08,715 --> 01:06:10,183
There is
always a something, OK?

1219
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:12,264
This is not the first time
I have felt that.

1220
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:13,804
- Felt what?
-You.

1221
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,472
Saying something
like you've slipped.

1222
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,015
I didn't slip.

1223
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:18,980
Like a cartoon character
on a banana peel.

1224
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:21,065
You know what?
You're actually starting to freak me out.

1225
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,446
- There's nothing going on.
-lt's about time you're freaked.

1226
01:06:23,605 --> 01:06:25,778
OK, I hate always feeling like the freak
in this relationship.

1227
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,988
Why are you doing this?

1228
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:30,279
Because there's something
you're not telling me.

1229
01:06:30,445 --> 01:06:32,698
OK, I know you, and I know
when you get uncomfortable.

1230
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:34,491
And it's so rare
that I have formed

1231
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,534
an acute discomfort detector
on you.

1232
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,203
Are you gonna tell me
what it is,

1233
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:41,293
or are you gonna force me to be late
to my own annoying friend's

1234
01:06:41,456 --> 01:06:43,754
Louis L'Amour
goddamn Western-themed wedding?

1235
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:54,227
Kimberly, let's not do this.
This is paranoia.

1236
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:08,449
Hey.

1237
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:10,485
Kim.

1238
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,072
Look at me.

1239
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:17,038
Keep looking.

1240
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:26,676
You're right. You're right.

1241
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:28,632
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1242
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,478
In the dream, I told you
I wanted to be with you,

1243
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:39,935
you to leave Jack
and walk out the door with me.

1244
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:45,020
-(RUMBLING)
-Wow.

1245
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,942
Do you feel that?

1246
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:53,077
What?

1247
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:55,739
OK. Calm down.

1248
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,454
Maybe you just need some air.
Let's go up to the rooftop.

1249
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:02,337
So, what else happens
in this dream? Do I...

1250
01:08:02,495 --> 01:08:05,795
Do I go with you,
all happily ever after and the like?

1251
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:08,631
Or do I slap you
and tell you, "Begone"?

1252
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:11,592
I don't know, actually.
We were looking at each other.

1253
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,756
And I went to kiss you,

1254
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,426
and before our lips touched,
I woke up.

1255
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:19,938
-(RUMBLING)
-KIMBERLY: What?

1256
01:08:22,849 --> 01:08:25,477
Maybe I never saved you
that night we met.

1257
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:28,271
Maybe you did die
hit by that car

1258
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:31,442
and this...is just
some afterlife fantasy

1259
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:32,985
playing out in your head.

1260
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:36,451
- KIMBERLY: What?
-DELL: Something feels weird.

1261
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:41,869
KIMBERLY: Remember how you
used to love flipping the pillow over

1262
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,833
to feel the cool side?

1263
01:08:43,995 --> 01:08:45,622
Yeah.

1264
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:50,088
That's what our relationship
felt like.

1265
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,549
Constant tossing and turning,

1266
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:54,589
looking for
that perfect balance.

1267
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:58,386
Sometimes it was there.
And other times...

1268
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:01,100
I know. I know.

1269
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:06,852
You always expected us to break up.
Why was that?

1270
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:10,022
Is that 'cause of your dumb
five-minutes-from-now rule?

1271
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:12,816
After we stopped talking,

1272
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,359
the five-minute rule
started shrinking.

1273
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:17,529
Went...went to four minutes,
then three...

1274
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,823
...then two, then one.

1275
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:22,458
KIMBERLY:
Let's go up to the rooftop.

1276
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:25,040
Come on!

1277
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:28,715
I thought my unconscious
was trying to tell me something -

1278
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,046
you know, by dreaming that dream
a few nights ago,

1279
01:09:31,209 --> 01:09:33,382
coming here
and talking to you,

1280
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:37,924
I might close the gap
that...that last minute.

1281
01:09:40,593 --> 01:09:42,595
<i>Or...</i>

1282
01:09:42,762 --> 01:09:44,685
Or none of this
is really happening.

1283
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:49,811
This could still be your dream.

1284
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:52,230
Dun-dun-dun!

1285
01:09:52,397 --> 01:09:54,650
-(RUMBLING)
-(TYRES SQUEAL)

1286
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:58,616
- Oh, crap!
-What? What happened?

1287
01:09:58,778 --> 01:10:01,907
Fucking bird carcass
on my windshield.

1288
01:10:02,073 --> 01:10:05,327
What? OK. Slow down.
Tell me what's going on.

1289
01:10:05,493 --> 01:10:07,666
I'm saying a fucking bird
just committed suicide

1290
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:09,706
on my windshield.

1291
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:12,751
What? In the middle
of our conversation?

1292
01:10:13,918 --> 01:10:16,137
What does our conversation
have to do with anything?

1293
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:19,390
It must mean something.
It must mean that...that...that...

1294
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:21,768
Maybe the bird was commenting
on our situation.

1295
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:23,599
Commenting?

1296
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:26,355
- You think this is commentary?
-Definitely! I mean...

1297
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:29,893
Something - the universe,
cosmos, all that, via the bird -

1298
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,982
sent us a signal, yeah.

1299
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:34,113
OK.

1300
01:10:34,272 --> 01:10:36,775
I want you to listen to me
very, very carefully, OK?

1301
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:38,989
OK. You're gonna be mean,
aren't you?

1302
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,745
On this already horrible call,

1303
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,655
you're gonna be mean
on top of it.

1304
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:45,371
You are very, very, very...

1305
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,752
You know what,
I can't even say 'very' enough.

1306
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:50,129
So just imagine an
infinite number of 'very's. OK?

1307
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:52,791
Well, I don't have
that kind of imagination.

1308
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:54,630
I can barely picture
odd-numbered things.

1309
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:56,760
Well, freaking try, OK?

1310
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,923
'Cause that number of 'very's
precedes sick, sick.

1311
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,966
S-I-C-K.

1312
01:11:02,133 --> 01:11:04,386
Told you you were gonna be mean,
and condescending,

1313
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,600
as if I didn't already know
how to spell 'sick'.

1314
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:09,141
You are not being
a nice person right now!

1315
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:18,237
(sighs)

1316
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:27,000
So...l'm at the gun range.

1317
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:31,003
This is a nightmare.

1318
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:33,164
Sartre was right.

1319
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:37,006
- Hell is other people.
-(SIGHS) I should go.

1320
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:38,670
I've got my goggles on.

1321
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:40,804
You did this on purpose,
didn't you?

1322
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:43,557
You wanted me to find out
when I was 3,000 miles away.

1323
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,764
You were telegraphing
all the signs

1324
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:47,429
like you were
Samuel-fucking-Morse.

1325
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:49,393
You wanted me to know.

1326
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:51,228
That's the part
that hurts the most.

1327
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,108
Why would I want that?

1328
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,816
'Cause maybe your feelings for him
are real.

1329
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:01,784
How long
has it been going on?

1330
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:07,706
- About a month.
-A month?! Oh, shit.

1331
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:09,913
I'm so sorry for interrupting
the honeymoon period.

1332
01:12:10,076 --> 01:12:12,124
Hear those are the best parts
of a relationship.

1333
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:15,039
I'm gonna go, OK?
I've got my goggles on.

1334
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:16,753
Yes, I fucking heard you!

1335
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:18,418
Enough with the goggles already!
Jesus Christ!

1336
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,052
How are you gonna
get off the phone

1337
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:21,929
and just go about your day
after this, huh?

1338
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:23,681
'Cause I don't think
all of our conversations

1339
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,513
need to necessarily
feel good!

1340
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:27,302
They should feel bad, then?

1341
01:12:27,468 --> 01:12:29,345
They should be whatever
the conversation should...

1342
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:32,061
I don't know! Why are you
analysing this so much?

1343
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:33,850
Oh, I'm not analysing it yet.

1344

I'm just giving you
my initial gut reaction.

Can I please get off the phone with you
and not feel like shit?

I don't...
I don't love you, Kimberly.

Honestly, I don't know
if I ever really did.

You definitely didn't.

If you're capable
of making choices

1358
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:21,777
that knowingly hurts the other person,
that's not love.

OK. You're mad.
You're mad. You...

It came when I least expected it.

- Bravo.
-OK! Fine.

No. No.
You want to be right.

Truth is not what you're after,
because if you wanted the truth,

then you would have to accept

like it was last time.

that you said 'so'
all the time.

you'd be my special,

to be mine,

You were the type of girl
that could sleep through wars.

looking so beautiful -

not picking up the signal.

And let's get real for a second
about the ring, alright?

You're not having it sized.

4.5.

'cause you didn't want me to see it.

Don't marry him, OK?
I want you back.

has been keeping me up.

to the world anything.

how bad our relationship got,

01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:26,634
I didn't see that coming.

1510
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:30,093
Do you know what it is yet?

1511
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:31,848
Not yet.

1512
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:34,681
Hoping it's a girl.

1513
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,854
Uh...l almost proposed to you,
you know.

1514
01:23:48,482 --> 01:23:50,735
When we were
in that hotel room in Paris.

1515
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:54,371
I even picked out the ring.
I had it with me.

1516
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,077
I was about to
give it to you.

1517
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:57,742
I took it, and...

1518
01:23:57,908 --> 01:24:00,206
I flushed it down the toilet.

1519
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:03,248
(SIGHS)
I keep replaying that moment

1520
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:04,790
over and over again
in my head.

1521
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,675
L...

1522
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:11,300
Why are you crying?

1523
01:24:14,841 --> 01:24:17,435
I'm just happy to see you.

1524
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:21,060
Ancl it's such a beautiful night.

1525
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:29,656
I feel like
I'm in the wrong world.

1526
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:32,867
'Cause I don't...
I don't belong in a world

1527
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:35,154
where we don't end up together,
I don't.

1528
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,415
There are parallel universes out there
where this didn't happen.

1529
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:41,202
Where I was with you
and you were with me.

1530
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:42,745
And whatever universe that is,

1531
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,834
that's the one
that my heart lives in.

1532
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,173
I wanted so badly
to go back into that dream

1533
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:51,712
I had the other night.

1534
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:56,975
L...tried so hard
to go back to sleep.

1535
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:05,601
You know, I never thought
love was real. I didn't.

1536
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:08,771
And now I think life isn't real
without it.

1537
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:12,566
And that sounds like
a really bad greeting card.

1538
01:25:12,733 --> 01:25:14,280
Don't.

1539
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,161
Don't make it a joke.

1540
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:22,618
Truth?

1541
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:26,038
I think you always
believed in love.

1542
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:28,832
(SCOFFS) This is so stupid.

1543
01:25:29,875 --> 01:25:32,003
So irrational.

1544
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:34,342
Why am I so hell-bent
on getting you back?

1545
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:36,506
You fucking hate Pixar movies,
for crying out loud.

1546
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:38,471
You still have an AOL account.

1547
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:40,853
I don't want to be with
a person like that.

1548
01:25:45,015 --> 01:25:47,438
Why does it feel so impossible
to let you go?

1549
01:25:51,605 --> 01:25:53,653
It's an addiction, you know?
That's all it is.

1550
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:56,739
It's a biochemical addiction.
It's so stupid.

1551
01:25:56,902 --> 01:25:58,575
If you think about it,

1552
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:00,205
relationships
are all totally narcissistic,

1553
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:02,082
'cause basically,
you're just looking for someone

1554
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,163
who will love you <i>as</i> much
as you love yourself.

1555
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:05,703
- That's all it is.
-No, it's not!

1556
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:07,416
- Yes, it is.
-No, it's not.

1557
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:13,961
No, it's not.

1558
01:26:16,254 --> 01:26:18,473
I don't know anything anymore.

1559
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:22,052
But I know I do love you.

1560
01:26:29,476 --> 01:26:32,696
- Dell?
-Just...give me a minute, OK?

1561

00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,990
<i> Episode 4</i>

2
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,890
We were robbed. Robbed!

3
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,970
You think there's some kind of show here for you to watch? Get out of here!

4
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,980
If you have nothing better to do,
go home!

5
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,170
Why's he all pissy at us?

6
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,110
Stop your muttering, you trio.

7
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,070
Anyway, you missed going to
your alumni association.

8
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,850
Who cares about that?

9
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:41,800
Why'd this cursed thief create
this ruckus by robbing the CHA?

10
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,780
This is driving me up the wall.

11
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:47,000
What is that fool doing now?
Let's go!

12
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,900
-Do your job already.
- Shouldn't you be working?

13
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,140
Punk...

14
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,770
Chief!

15
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,170
Yeah?

16
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,960
We looked up the license plate number Chohee gave us. It's a stolen car

17
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,070
As expected.

18
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,070
I don't know how she managed to see the number in that kind of situation.

19
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,030
Oh, and here's the list...

20
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,750
...of suspects according to previous convictions of the same crime.

21
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,980
Good. Report the car
as an accessory to robbery...

22
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,980
...and check the surrounding traffic cameras for any possible shots.

23
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,980
Yes, sir.

24
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,020
Officer Cho...

25
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,950
...after getting the witness statements, have a montage of the suspect drawn.

26
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,070
As soon as that's done, call me.

27
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,930
Goodness, the CHA guys are
all screwed. Completely.

28
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,950
Chief Kang.

29
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,040
Yes, Chief Noh.
Sorry you had to come all the way here.

30
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,980
The main office is in an uproar.

31
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,960
The stolen item is
really the “Bihaedangjib?”

32
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,030
Yes, I'm positive since Bumsang is
the one who identified it.

33
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,960
It had occurred to me that it might be
time for that to resurface...

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,730
What? You have
prior knowledge about it?

35
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,180
Ah, where's Chohee?

36
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,170
This is definitely breaking news.

37
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,000
What foolhardy fella dared to
steal from the CHA?

38
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,130
Maybe he had an accomplice
on the inside?

39
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,170
What are you thinking about?

40
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,960
Chohee Heo.

41
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,880
She can't be the accomplice.
She helped to chase the thief.

42
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,020
No, not that.
There's something strange about her.

43
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,890
No matter how much
she wants to catch the thief...

44
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,760
how could she risk her life like that?

45
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,790
She's clearly a hardcore patriot,
inside and out.

46
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,090
One out of a hundred
government workers is like her...

47
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,740
...practically sacrificing their lives.

48
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,080
You work for the government. You're telling me you understand that mindset?

49
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,730
You said women should be
experienced, not understood.

50
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,750
Stop trying to understand her. Experience.

51
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,190
Jonggyu Oh!

52
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,090
Yes?

53
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:44,130
Jonggyu Oh?

54
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:45,040
That's me.

55
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,110
Mr. Oh, I need your witness statement.

56
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,070
Sure, sure.

57
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,840
Follow me.

58
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,920
Policemen make me so nervous, like
I'm guilty of a crime I didn't commit.

59
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,180
Right, the recording.
I need to take care of that.

60
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,710
Why didn't you tell me about the “Bihaedangjib?”

61
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,150
I'm sorry, Chief.

62
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,000
You thought you'd be troubling me?

63
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,870
Look here, kid,
didn't I tell you not to think that?

64
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,000
How can I not?
You're the one who hired me.

65
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,060
I didn't pull strings to get you in.

66
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:34,070
You got in based on your skill.
What's the problem?

67
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,780
Chief.

68
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,130
Straighten your shoulders and do your work. Don't worry. Do you understand?

69
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,960
Ack!

70
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,810
What's with the serious convo?
Is he really mad?

71
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:07,890
No, it's nothing.
Oh, how are your injuries?

72
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,830
Huh? Oh, this is nothing.

73
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:16,900
Anyway, let's resolve our unfinished business, shall we?

74
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,770
What unfinished business?

75
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,170
Hold on.

76
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,150
Yes, Chief.

77
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:29,080
The security camera in front of
the Preservation Science Lab is broken?

78
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,030
Yes, I'll check it out right now. Okay.

79
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,720
Where are you going?
Erase the recording already, will you?

80
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,910
Recording. So the unfinished business is erasing the recording?

81
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:49,760
What else? After all I did for you,
the least you can do is erase it!

82
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:57,960
Of all the... I can erase it later.
Get your priorities straight. Get out!

83
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,070
Later when? Hey!

84
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,700
I tried to be a gentleman about this, but...

85
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:11,820
Ah, Mr. Son, it's me. Do a background check on Chohee Heo for me.

86
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:18,860
No, small stuff, too. Any bribery cases, favors she fulfilled for a cost. All of it.

87
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,050
Why are you asking me
for something like that?

88
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,720
You think I'm a private eye?

89
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,750
I'm sorry about that.
Where were we?

90
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:40,710
I need you to ask around for
a man skilled in restoring books.

91
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,750
Someone top-notch.

92
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:49,120
That man would have to be
able to keep secrets, right?

93
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,960
Need you ask?

94
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:02,010
With an incident of this scale,
I predict a lot of heads will roll.

95
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,930
First, the head of security will have to do more than hand in a written apology.

96
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:11,780
Same goes for the head of
the Preservation Science Lab, no?

97
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,930
You think Chief Noh might be
forced into early retirement?

98
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,850
Early retirement?

99
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,000
Why should our regulations team
be blamed for anything?

100
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,710
If the book is found it'll be okay,
but what if it's not?

101
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,910
Who else will be the scapegoat?

102
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,820
Then there will be an opening
in the chief's position.

103
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,070
Gosh! You think we'll be safe
when Chief Noh is blamed?

104
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:43,720
We won't be, will we?
I guess we won't be safe.

105
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:49,030
I'm not going to take it lying down
if our team is blamed in the least.

106
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,920
What do you plan to do?

107
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,840
Let's think of something
over some coffee.

108
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,130
Coins. Joohyun, I have a ton
for the vending machine.

109
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,060
I'm doing things I've never done before,
all thanks to Chohee.

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,030
Now where did she hide it...

111
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:35,090
Whew. Now how to erase it...

112
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:57,150
Dear lord, she's doing
all the CHA's work on her own. Okay.

113
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,960
Did you do something wrong? What's your ulterior motive in buying this meal?

114
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,850
Nothing!

115
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,980
I'm buying simply because meals
must be eaten even when busy. Right?

116
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,800
Gosh!

117
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:45,130
Stop glaring at me when I felt sorry that you obviously pulled an all-nighter.

118
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,860
A thank you would be
the proper response.

119
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,860
Thank you so very much. Happy?

120
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,900
By the way, doesn't your father mind that you stay out all night?

121
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,750
Then again, you're past the age of
being nagged by your father.

122
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,960
I don't want to talk about my father.
So stop.

123
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,120
Yeah?

124
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:24,170
But he should at least say something about you living with some guy.

125
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:31,170
I do live with a guy,
but that guy's my younger brother.

126
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,090
Younger brother?
Not a yakuza member?

127
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,930
The only yakuza member I've seen in real life is Mr. Tanaka. Satisfied now?

128
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,800
What about the rumor that you and Chief Noh are more than co-workers?

129
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,940
I knew it, it's a rumor.

130
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,880
Chief Noh is a father figure to me!

131
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:01,780
Keep saying stuff like that,
and karma will bite you in the butt.

132
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,970
Watch that temper.

133
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:07,930
The rumors are rampant because of your needlessly fiery temper.

134
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:16,820
Let me advise you sincerely. Don't live so inflexibly. Slamming on tables and all.

135
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,100
Look here.

136
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,030
Yes?

137
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,840
It's easy to spot the faults of others...

138
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,180
...but even easier to turn
a blind eye to one's own.

139
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:33,730
Keep that in mind, okay?
Thanks for the meal.

140
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,880
What the? What's her problem now?

141
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,100
How could the CHA of
all places get robbed? How?

142
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,870
How could you let thieves
into our home? Huh?

143
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:57,010
Find the stolen book before the reporters get a wind of this. Understand?

144
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,940
What are you doing?
Get the meeting started!

145
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,120
Why the hell is he yelling
at the investigations team?

146
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,000
And you think we're here
because we deserve this?

147
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,090
I'm sorry. It took a while
to draw up the suspect montage.

148
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,040
Gyucheol Seo. He's a middle boss
of the Makdae Crime Family...

149
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,960
...with three convictions under his belt.

150
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,880
He's also currently wanted for
charges of violence and larceny.

151
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,970
The Makdae family? Isn't that
Mr. Kim's domestic crime partner?

152
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,950
Mr. Kim again? That bastard.
Excuse my language.

153
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,710
We suspect he played a hand
in the theft, but we have no evidence.

154
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:56,030
And we lost track of him after his release so looking for him is a problem.

155
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,760
Any ideas?

156
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,850
May I make a suggestion?

157
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:09,190
At the time of theft, the “Bihaedangjib” was in the middle of being restored.

158
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,120
In other words, if the thieves want to
sell it at a top price...

159
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,000
...they have to prepare the restoration material and hire an expert to do it.

160
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,160
It was printed on paper...

161
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,050
...reserved for palace use, beaten and bleached several times.

162
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:32,790
There are currently
only two places in the nation...

163
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,790
...that can reproduce this paper.

164
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,030
And there are only a handful of places...

165
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:40,950
...that can expertly restore it, including the Preservation Science Lab.

166
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,770
This could be a good starting point.

167
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,830
Yes.

168
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:55,090
Joohyun, I didn't mess up
in front of the director, did I?

169
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,830
Smart, very smart. Super smart!

170
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:04,020
You had quite the silver tongue in there with the director as your audience.

171
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,840
If this is a fight you're picking,
leave me out. I'm busy today.

172
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,720
Doing what? You don't have any lectures or your TV appearance today.

173
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,780
I have some restoration work of my own.

174
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,890
Remember? How you ruined
my relationship at the TV station?

175
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:21,850
I can take care of
that restoration work for you.

176
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,990
Instead, help me check out
those private restoration places...

177
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,920
...you were talking about.

178
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,870
Um, no.

179
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:35,990
C'mon. Why you gotta be like that? Ah, the recording. I'll release it to the world.

180
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:41,760
Oh, right, the recording.
Speaking of that, go ahead.

181
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,910
I think I've fulfilled my duty
as the advisory member.

182
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,930
Mr. Kim.

183
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,080
Yes, Director Kang.

184
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:55,860
I'm so proud of you.
You are truly a pillar of the CHA.

185
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,850
Oh, sir, your praise is too grand.

186
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:05,860
Chief Noh, Mr. Kim will take an active part of the “Bihaedangjib” investigation.

187
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,160
Won't you, Mr. Kim?

188
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,830
Of course, of course I will.

189
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:18,740
Would you be able to help Chohee check out the different restoration places?

190
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,180
Since you're the expert and all.

191
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,080
Yes, I can. I will go with her.
Don't worry.

192
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,800
Then shall we go, Mr. Kim?

193
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,760
Let's go. We're off.

194
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,890
This is a conspiracy.
You guys are all in on it, aren't you?

195
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:42,730
Conspiracy? Well, the director is
a closet conspiracy theory nut, I think.

196
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:51,970
I don't know. Really. I haven't seen Gyucheol is over two months.

197
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,010
You should tell us the truth
while we're asking nicely.

198
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:02,160
Pissing this man off has led
some men to dire consequences.

199
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,130
So tell us while he's still calm.

200
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,890
Gosh, I can't tell you what I don't know. This is so frustrating.

201
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:12,830
You're making it hard for me to mediate. Really, you are.

202
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:17,910
So you won't tell us
when we're asking nicely?

203
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,730
See this? The Bendengee Family's right-hand man gave me this.

204
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:30,830
You think this is my only scar?
You're gonna tell me the info or not?

205
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,870
That's enough!
Hurry and tell him. Tell him!

206
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:42,800
I don't know where he is. And I wouldn't tell you even if I knew. He's my son.

207
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,910
Hold on. So can we assume
that you do know where he is?

208
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,770
Well... I could know. Or not.

209
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:58,170
C'mon. Which is it? It's one or
the another. You can't be both!

210
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:03,060
You bastard.

211
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,070
Gyucheol, see how these men
mistreat me because of what you did...

212
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:12,150
Uh, ma'am. Please calm down, ma'am. Calm down.

213
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,720
I'm sorry, ma'am.

214
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,980
So you haven't had any new business lately? No new deliveries?

215
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:19,000
Yes, that's right.

216
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,790
Can we see your most recent
inventory for deliveries?

217
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,970
The inventory? Sure, here you go.

218
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,190
This is our account book.

219
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,990
Oh! Help! Help!

220
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,800
What the... What are you
going to do about this mess?

221
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,120
Do you know how expensive this stuff is? What are you going to do? Huh?

222
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,830
No matter how much money is offered,
I don't work on books that appear shady.

223
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,040
That's my work ethic.

224
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,790
So you haven't had any new restoration work come up in the past few days?

225
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:07,090
None. By the way, sir,
I've always wanted to meet you.

226
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:11,790
If you're free today, how would you
like to go grab some coffee?

227
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,960
My schedule's pretty free today.

228
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:22,170
Ha ha, you jokester. What about the other date you made for today?

229
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,110
Do you plan to teleport back and forth?

230
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,840
You really can't stand to see me
get any action, can you?

231
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,100
We're in the middle of official business. Come along, we don't have much time.

232
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,820
Do you like me, or something?

233
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,710
What?

234
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,780
I mean, it's weird how you keep ruining my chances with other women.

235
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,790
Oh lord...

236
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:50,870
Right? You pretend to dislike me,
but secretly you like me, right?

237
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:56,040
No wonder you keep using the excuse
of work to be with me all the time.

238
00:18:56,750 --> 00:19:04,150
That's right, I like you. No, I love you. So...

239
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,780
Stop screwing around and let's get back to work, Bumsang. All right?

240
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,730
What? We have more places to visit?

241
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,700
Three more.

242
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,980
What? Three more places.

243
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,860
I dug my own grave
when I mentioned restoration experts.

244
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,730
It's been over five years
since I stopped restoring books.

245
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:35,140
You were quite famous in the frame mounting business. Why did you stop?

246
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,950
You know how things are. It's hard work.

247
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,010
My eyesight was getting worse
and money wasn't great.

248
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,860
I see.

249
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,130
That painting's beautiful.

250
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,740
Yes, I restored that
when I was still working.

251
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,750
That's all, I think.
Thank you for your cooperation.

252
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:13,780
Scratch this place off the list. Whew,
we still have two more places to go.

253
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,160
There's no need for that.
This is the place.

254
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,810
What are you talking about?

255
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,110
Didn't you smell anything
while you were inside?

256
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,730
Smell what? I'm not sure.

257
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:26,830
Your nose for decorative purposes only?

258
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,880
I could definitely smell
the boiling amur corktree oil.

259
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,880
Amur corktree oil? What's that?

260
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,150
It's material used when restoring books in the traditional manner.

261
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,880
It dyes the paper
the same color as old books...

262
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,730
...and effectively protects against moths.

263
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,870
You know the “Mugucheong'wang Daedaranikyeong,” right?

264
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,820
It's the oldest book in existence in Korea that was printed with a wooden press.

265
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,960
That managed to last over 1200 years...

266
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,040
...because it used dye
from the amur corktree.

267
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:54,110
So you're sure you smelled this oil
inside that house?

268
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:59,180
Yes. Isn't it strange that his house smells of it when he supposedly quit working?

269
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,750
So even if it's not the “Bihaedangjib”...

270
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,060
...he's probably restoring
something illegal.

271
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,140
Exactly.

272
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,730
Man, I'm good. At times like these,
I can't help but pat myself on the back.

273
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,910
What are you doing?
Call Chief Kang already.

274
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:21,750
Ugh, my arms are sore. Gyucheol Seo's mom is really intimidating, isn't she?

275
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,840
We got no information from her and instead did tons of manual labor.

276
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,780
That's too bad for you. I at least
got a peek at Officer Cho's underwear.

277
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:33,990
He stripped again? Tell him to wash
his underwear if he's gonna do that.

278
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,150
I have a headache...

279
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:42,020
Joohyun, didn't you follow Chief Kang so where Bumsang is?

280
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:47,760
Don't ask. Chief Kang told me
to head back to the office.

281
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,160
Who's he to order me around?

282
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,020
And don't you think he's a bit
guarded against Bumsang?

283
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,990
Guarded? Why would he be?

284
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:01,760
Oh, there's a reason.

285
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,990
Anyway, good work.
Sit down and rest a bit.

286
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,820
Sit, sit.

287
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:12,990
If the “Bihaedangjib” is there,
Bumsang will have hit the jackpot.

288
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,030
The mega jackpot.

289
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,710
Yeah.

290
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,960
After all the bad vibes
between him and Chohee...

291
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,020
...they're always together on cases...

292
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,700
Do you think
that maybe they like each other?

293
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,190
Who likes whom!

294
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:35,860
What I mean is,
that's all one-sided on Chohee's part.

295
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,000
It is?

296
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,740
And Bumsang happens to
like someone else.

297
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:47,800
He does? Who?
Who does Bumsang like?

298
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:54,890
Really, do you need me to spell things out for you? You two are so dense.

299
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,030
Sangho.

300
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:03,990
Yeah?

301
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,120
She needs serious help.

302
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,940
Yes, she does, but she's pretty.

303
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,100
Yeah.

304
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,030
So this is the house?
Is this gate the only exit?

305
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,020
No. There's another exit
on the other side.

306
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,130
Yeah? Good work. Chohee.

307
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:26,170
We'll take care of things here,
so you can head back.

308
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,970
No, I'll stay...

309
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,780
Chohee, take Bumsang
back to the office.

310
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:34,080
We have plenty of hands, so don't worry.

311
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,890
Yes, sir.

312
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,840
If we find it today, I'll buy drinks.

313
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:42,010
No, that's not necessary. You're doing
all the work. I'll buy you a drink.

314
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,890
We'll contact you as soon as
things are confirmed. Go on, Chohee.

315
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:48,780
Then, we'll leave things to you.

316
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,830
Goodbye.

317
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,720
He might attempt an escape so stand guard in this alley and the one out back.

318
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,700
Officer Park and Officer Cho,
you two accompany me inside.

319
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,120
Yes, sir.

320
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:05,940
Who is it?

321
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,150
This is the police.

322
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,170
What was that?

323
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:16,140
You're always snippety with me but docile as a lamb in front of him.

324
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:22,030
Tch. People think
he's a bit unapproachable...

325
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:27,800
...because he's serious all the time,
but he's actually a really good person.

326
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,180
And Bumsang. You reap what you sow. Don't you agree?

327
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,870
If we find the “Bihaedangjib”
and we catch Mr. Kim today...

328
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,920
...I promise to play nice.

329
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,040
Like that's so likely.

330
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:49,770
So who comes up with
these nicknames for the art thieves?

331
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:55,730
Mr. Kim I understand, though a tad trite. What's his real name, by the way?

332
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:56,190
Hyukjoong Kim.

333
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:01,000
Hyukjoong Kim. What an embarrassment to the surname Kim.

334
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,820
What about General Shovel?

335
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:06,840
What?

336
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,700
Officer Cho mentioned him last time. What's his real name?

337
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,160
Dunno? You're on the regulations team and you don't know his name?

338
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:26,720
Taesoo Heo. His name is Taesoo Heo.

339
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,750
Taesoo Heo? Is he of
the Yangcheon Heos, I wonder?

340
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,890
Hey, you have the same surname as him.

341
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,810
There are a lot of people
with the surname Heo.

342
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:42,930
I know. There are a lot of celebrities
with that surname, too.

343
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,970
Why aren't they calling yet? They've had plenty of time to raid the place.

344
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,990
I've been brewing
herbal medicine for my arthritis.

345
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,850
Amur corktree oil does smell
awfully similar to herbal medicine.

346
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,910
I guess that young man from earlier...

347
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,820
...knows a bit about
the restorative process.

348
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,870
I think Chohee secretly enjoys
sending us on wild goose chases.

349
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:21,010
Why does she keep wasting
our time like this?

350
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:23,980
Same goes for Bumsang.

351
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,090
I thought he was smart,
but Chohee is rubbing off on him.

352
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,780
That's enough. Half of the leads
we chase are false.

353
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,140
Let's stop pointing fingers and go.

354
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,120
Yes, sir.

355
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,010
They're gone.

356
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,910
I can't believe he correctly
guessed the smell of the oil.

357
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:18,040
That young man was quite sharp.

358
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:21,910
The CHA doesn't have anyone like that.

359
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,700
He looked a bit familiar...

360
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,090
That's not important.
You know our deadline, right?

361
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,910
It's too tight.

362
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:36,910
So...you're saying you can't do it?

363
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,170
No, no. I can get it done.

364
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:48,960
What? Herbal medicine? Hand me
the phone. Who are you talking to?

365
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,730
Yes, yes, Chief. I understand.

366
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,910
They searched everywhere
but nothing came up.

367
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:00,100
It was a normal house and
he was brewing herbal medicine.

368
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,990
So you're saying I'm wrong?

369
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,100
Is that so hard to admit?

370
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,090
No way I'm wrong about this.

371
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:10,130
I smelled that oil every day
until I was positively sick of it.

372
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,150
This isn't right.

373
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:18,180
I understand that your pride took a blow, but stop it already.

374
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,910
We keep raiding his house, and
he'll file an official complaint.

375
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,770
Just follow me
if you want to catch a thief.

376
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,040
Ugh, what a temper...

377
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,910
Who's he trying to fool?
Hey, tell Chief Kang...

378
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:45,120
Look who's here.
Hanako of the CHA, right?

379
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,830
Why are you following us?

380
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,940
Ah, this neighborhood has
no public restrooms. Gosh, darnit...

381
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:06,130
No way Bumsang is wrong. Are you sure you didn't make a mistake?

382
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:18,840
Dunno, but I wish I had. By the way, why the boundless confidence in Bumsang?

383
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,790
Chief Kang, are you jealous?

384
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,940
What?

385
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:30,910
Are you jealous of Bumsang's abilities? Or are you jealous of his interest in me?

386
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,100
Hold on, Joohyun.

387
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,110
Hmm.

388
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:37,860
If it's the prior, you're wasting your time.

389
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,870
And if it's the latter,
you're attempting the impossible.

390
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,950
I'm sure I'm breaking your heart...

391
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:46,930
...but please understand
that I have no other choice.

392
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,990
Be strong. Good luck!

393
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,990
Chief Kang!

394
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,770
Ah, Chief Noh.

395
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,190
Why are you standing here?

396
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:09,760
Joohyun gets weirder
the more I get to know her.

397
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,860
I can't get inside her head at all.

398
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:18,720
Women are impossible to understand.
I still don't get my wife after thirty years.

399
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,060
By the way, how'd things go today?

400
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:26,110
We checked out a lot of places
but to no avail.

401
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,080
Excuse me.

402
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:37,150
Yeah, Officer Park? What's up? What? Mr. Kim did what to Chohee?

403
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,940
Oh, long time no see to both chiefs.

404
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,980
You've got a lot of nerve,
voluntarily coming here.

405
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:10,090
I didn't want to come, but I had to
report a case of illegal tailing.

406
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,850
Illegal tailing?

407
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,080
Ask this little lady here.
Ask her if I'm lying.

408
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,750
You know about double jeopardy, right?

409
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:25,790
I was acquitted.
So why do you keep tailing me?

410
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:32,100
And isn't it illegal for a non-police officer, a CHA employee to tail me?

411
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,030
Hey, Bleach head.

412
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,930
The regulations team has special police jurisdiction, so it's not illegal! ...

413
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,780
Get things right
if you're gonna complain.

414
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:44,130
Oh, it's not illegal? My bad.

415
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,070
I'm sorry, Hanako.

416
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:55,010
I was just exercising my rights
as a citizen, but I guess I was wrong.

417
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:57,970
Then I'll be going.

418
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,960
Hyukjoong Kim.

419
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,080
You've been studying, seeing
how you know about double jeopardy.

420
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:11,010
Then didn't you read up
on zero tolerance?

421
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:14,090
In layman's terms, it means
that men like you are screwed...

422
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,900
...once we get a conviction.

423
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,020
Don't underestimate the police.

424
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:28,760
I'll keep that in mind, Chief Kang.
Filed it away in here.

425
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:37,940
Oh, and Chief Noh. Keep an eye on this girl here. She should be more careful.

426
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:40,910
What are you gonna do if she meets someone with a nasty temper?

427
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:48,980
Girlie, take care of yourself, okay?
I'm out.

428
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:03,190
Chohee, we need to talk.

429
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:19,190
Are you out of your mind?

430
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,870
If you saw Mr. Kim,
you should've called me or Chief Kang.

431
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:26,860
Why the hell would you follow him on your own? Why are you so fearless?

432
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:31,840
Thank goodness
he brought you here to piss us off.

433
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,700
Imagine if he had kidnapped you!
What would have happened then?

434
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,820
I'm sorry.

435
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,110
I don't wanna hear it.
You're off the case.

436
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,190
Chief.

437
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,910
You jumped in front of a car when you were chasing Gyucheol Seo, right?

438
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:52,160
I can't watch you be
so reckless anymore.

439
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,070
You're off the case!

440
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,010
Chief, I can't do that.

441
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:57,900
What?

442
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:03,730
I'm very sorry. I will try my hardest
not to let this happen again.

443
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:06,770
So please don't take me off the case.

444
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,070
You know how important
this case is to me.

445
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:14,910
I know. All the more reason
for you to remain uninvolved.

446
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:20,860
Officer Park, is Chohee inside?

447
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:24,840
Yes. She's getting an earful
from Chief Noh right now.

448
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:28,930
Huh... She dare to give me
a fright like that?

449
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:35,120
You can't because of your father.
For his sake.

450
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,080
Chief.

451
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:46,040
I've watched you grow up
since you were eight years old.

452
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,890
I've seen it all.
You entering junior high school...

453
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:58,030
...you trying to survive with little Gyoon...

454
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:05,930
...never complaining once no matter
how hard life was. I've seen all of it.

455
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:13,820
I don't know how you think of me,
but to me you're my daughter.

456
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:24,720
And fathers just want to see
their daughters safe.

457
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:30,960
And happy.

458
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:38,790
Your father probably feels the same
as I do. So I can't let you continue.

459
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:32,190
So Chief Noh was her father's friend? Why is she crying? It's so unlike her.

460
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,070
So is everything cleaned up
at the restoration house?

461
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,820
Everything's cleaned up
at the restoration house.

462
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,720
Tell them to wrap things up.

463
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,000
Wrap things up!
I told them to wrap things up.

464
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,760
Goodbye.

465
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:58,830
But sir, wasn't it awfully reckless of you to go to the investigations team?

466
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:03,960
It was, it was. I think
you overdid it with that one.

467
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,950
Not like I'm on the wanted list.

468
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,730
They've got nothing against me.
No need to worry.

469
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,780
But it's so hard to
shake them off each time...

470
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,830
I've got a way to clear them out all
at once, so don't worry.

471
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,040
Gyucheol, you get ready to
lay low for a while.

472
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,030
Yonggu! Go fetch me my passport.

473
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,860
Ugh, that leech.

474
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:47,090
Chief! Chief, bad news.
Mr. Kim just left for Japan.

475
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:47,910
What?

476
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:51,720
I went to the immigration service
to ask for their cooperation...

477
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,870
...and when I checked on Mr. Kim,
he had already left the country.

478
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,070
Call the airport's customs office
at once and...

479
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,700
...check if the “Bihaedangjib” went
with him. If it did, we're done for!

480
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:04,030
Bribes, favors, none of it. She's clean.

481
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:08,740
No one's ever bought Chohee anything, not so much as a burger.

482
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:12,780
Bumsang, are you listening?

483
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,040
I'm listening.

484
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:20,050
Tsk, tsk. Just how much did she
screw you for you to be so dispirited?

485
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,740
So who's behind the “Bihaedangjib” theft?

486
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,950
And why do you want to know?

487
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,730
Just, you know...

488
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,770
I'm just curious.

489
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,960
Curious? You expect me to believe that?

490
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,930
You know something, don't you?

491
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,700
Nope.

492
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,000
What is it? You can tell me.

493
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Knowing when to keep
one's mouth shut is...

494
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,020
...a basic rule of
a successful businessman.

495
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,870
Ah, so you know nothing.

496
00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:04,980
I'll tell you this. The person who first stole the “Bihaedangjib” was General Shovel.

497
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,760
Who cares who stole it in the first place? How is that important now?

498
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:16,770
Anyway, don't worry about Chohee. She'll get what's coming to her soon.

499
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:18,880
What do you mean?

500
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,980
She's public enemy number one
to a lot of guys.

501
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,180
Kkaldagu of Jangan-pyeong, Jjakbal of Insa-dong, Dari Jong of Daegu.

502
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,740
They all wanna teach her a lesson.

503
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:33,940
She should watch her back,
or she'll get it. Good to hear, isn't it?

504
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,920
Grown men have nothing better to do than pick on a girl? What cowards.

505
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:42,750
What the. Why is he yelling at me?

506
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,160
What has she been doing with her life, amassing so many enemies?

507
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,730
Oh, Bumsang!

508
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:50,960
Ah, Joohyun.

509
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:58,190
Look at those bags under the eyes.
You don't look so hot.

510
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,070
Are you still depressed about being wrong yesterday?

511
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:11,030
I'm sorry, I should have comforted you. I'm really sorry.

512
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,720
You waited for my call, didn't you?

513
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,850
Huh? Ah, yes, well.

514
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,050
I was dying to call you...

515
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:24,940
...but I had the tact not to make
matters worse by mentioning it.

516
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,970
That's proper etiquette, I think.

517
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:31,950
Ah, yes. Thank you. Joohyun, I'm a bit busy right now.

518
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:36,900
By the way, did you hear
that Chohee was taken off the case?

519
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,760
What? What happened?

520
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:45,920
Yesterday she was following
Mr. Kim when he caught her.

521
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:50,030
So Chief Noh has her working
on a different case.

522
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,940
What case?

523
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,700
Just some petty robbery case.

524
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,980
She looked so down earlier
I couldn't help but be a little glee...

525
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,190
I mean, I really felt for her. Deeply.

526
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,110
Hey, get in.

527
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,730
Why?

528
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:40,030
I heard you were taken off the case?
I'm partly to blame. I hate feeling guilty.

529
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:44,780
If you want to save on some cab fare,
get in. Before I change my mind.

530
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:12,190
Ah! Mommy! What the! Dear lord, seatbelt, seatbelt!

531
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,920
According to the airport,
the “Bihaedangjib” wasn't smuggled out.

532
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,820
If that's true, what a relief.

533
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:34,930
Chief, about Chohee.
Why did you take her off the case?

534
00:43:35,730 --> 00:43:39,170
I owe him a bit.

535
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:41,080
What?

536
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,140
You wouldn't understand.

537
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:49,900
If it wasn't smuggled out...

538
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:54,790
...that means it'll end up at some
rich man's house. What to do...

539
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:57,820
Our hands are tied either way.

540
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:03,800
There has to be a distribution channel in which they make deals under the table.

541
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,180
Where do we start looking?

542
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,960
Rich men, you say...

543
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:26,040
Dear me, Chief Kang,
what brings you here?

544
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,070
How've you been, Hwaja Ji?
Or should I call you Hanako Suzuki?

545
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:41,150
Ugh, it's hot and I'm bored.
Until when do we have to wait?

546
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,790
I told you to go home.

547
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:50,790
I already came this far. So, what did this guy steal?

548
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,170
He cleaned out some store in Insa-dong.

549
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:57,870
We'll ask the family members
about the missing items...

550
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:02,110
...and if that doesn't pan out, we'll have to take a turn around the streets.

551
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:06,090
What a tiresome life you lead.

552
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,810
Hey, when you have some free time, learn some combative sport.

553
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,740
Combative sport?

554
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,700
Yeah, like boxing.
Or some self-defense martial arts.

555
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,110
What for?

556
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:21,140
It's a scary world.

557
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,900
You're always out and about. Who knows what could happen at night?

558
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,090
Just take lessons.

559
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:29,190
Or find yourself a boyfriend
who can double as your bodyguard.

560
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:33,030
How inappropriate.
That's unsolicited advice.

561
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:41,100
Who, who are you?

562
00:45:49,900 --> 00:46:00,190
I don't know nothin'. I haven't seen
my son in months. I really haven't.

563
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:05,960
Grandma, I'm not asking
if you've seen your son.

564
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,990
I'm asking if you've seen
the items he stole.

565
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:16,950
I don't know! How would I know that? I don't know nothin'!

566
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:23,910
Granny, why don't you just ask Daddy? Daddy!

567
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:26,850
Hey, Bumsang!

568
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:31,140
Ow, ow...

569
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,140
Daddy! Daddy...

570
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:36,730
Daddy.

571
00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:38,940
Daddy...

572
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:47,900
Yes, Officer Cho. Yes, yes. You just need to come up a little bit further. Yes, yes.

573
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:54,850
Excuse me. I'm really sorry...

574
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,720
...but this is the first time
I've come home in eight months.

575
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,750
This weekend is my daughter's birthday.

576
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:06,970
Can't I turn myself in
after this weekend?

577
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:15,760
I'm sorry, the matter is out of my hands. I'm sorry. Let's go.

578
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:20,830
Daddy! Daddy!

579
00:47:20,830 --> 00:47:23,830
My son, my son! My son!

580
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:26,850
- Daddy!
- Please don't take Daddy.

581
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:28,150
Youngshin.

582
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:30,830
Please let him go.

583
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:36,790
Please let him go just once.

584
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:44,810
Let him go, please let Daddy go. Mister, please let Daddy go! Daddy...

585
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:47,720
Mister, please let him go...

586
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,720
‘I hate this.'

587
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,950
Daddy, please don't go.

588
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:56,030
Youngshin, I'm sorry.

589
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:00,140
[Officer Cho]

590
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:11,000
I'll be home soon, so don't cry.Listen
to your grandmother and study hard.

591
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:12,870
Don't go.

592
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:19,130
Why are you crying? I'll be home soon.

593
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,890
Don't go.

594
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:26,110
Can't you let him go?
You can pretend he got away.

595
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:30,780
Let's let him go. Okay?

596
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,140
No. I can't do that.

597
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,130
Daddy!

598
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:43,000
My son!

599
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:52,750
Yes, Officer Cho. Take a right and keep coming up. Yes.

600
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,900
I'll follow you.

601
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,770
Okay.

602
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,870
Good job.

603
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:07,700
- Thank you.
- Head on home.

604
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:12,080
Bumsang, we should have
a drink next time. I'm off then.

605
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:19,710
Goodbye.

606
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,010
Thanks for today.

607
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:36,820
Hey! Isn't this a bit much even for you?

608
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,740
He was going to turn himself in?
Why are you so cruel?

609
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:46,790
Think it's funny that I'm saying this?

610
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:50,710
You're right. I'm not the nicest guy...

611
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:54,960
...but the girl was crying and begging. Don't you have a heart?

612
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,830
You think that letting him go
would be any better for them?

613
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:02,160
At least they wouldn't have to
watch him get dragged away.

614
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,840
Do you understand at all
how much that must hurt for them?

615
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,110
You think that kind of pain is a big deal?

616
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,110
What?

617
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:15,750
For them, it's a worse pain knowing
that their father is a thief.

618
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:20,750
And it's better for the kids
if he's in prison.

619
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:25,050
Letting him go because of
pity won't help anyone.

620
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,900
Would you say the same
if it were your father?

621
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,730
If he were the one
getting dragged away?

622
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:45,840
Even after all the squabbling we did,
I never hated you or anything.

623
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:48,990
Watching you always
immersed in your work...

624
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:51,150
...I thought you had a reason
and I felt bad for you.

625
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:55,830
But I was wrong about you.

626
00:50:55,830 --> 00:51:00,910
I didn't realize
you were such a heartless woman.

627
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,920
I'd heard that Chohee had a younger brother. It's nice to meet you.

628
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,750
I've heard about you, too,
Chief Shiwan Kang.

629
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:32,840
Oh, does Chohee talk about me?

630
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:35,710
Did my sister talk about me?

631
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:38,090
No, I heard about you from Chief Noh.

632
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:43,880
Ah, am I being too informal
on our first meeting?

633
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:47,950
One has to make allowances for age,
so it can't be helped.

634
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:53,730
I heard you have a kid.
So what brings you here?

635
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:56,130
What do you mean by that?

636
00:51:56,870 --> 00:52:00,780
Nothing, really. But I will say this.

637
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:04,700
My sister is extremely lazy and dirty...

638
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,800
...has a horrible temper and
a bad personality, too.

639
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,740
And most importantly,
she really hates kids.

640
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:16,140
I think I've made my point, right?

641
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:20,910
So in other words, if I'm interested in your sister, I should just give up now?

642
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:26,130
So you're actually quite perceptive.

643
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:31,710
I'm here to talk about work,
so don't worry.

644
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:33,850
Can you give her another call?
Isn't it about time she arrived?

645
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,000
Should I?

646
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,920
Oh, Chohee, you're home.

647
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,980
Chief?

648
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:53,170
They're not gonna do any funny business because I'm not there, are they?

649
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,880
They wouldn't, right?

650
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:01,800
Ah! Ah...

651
00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:04,180
I heard you headed home as soon as handing over Cheoljin Lee.

652
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,140
So why are you so late?

653
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:11,700
I went for a walk.

654
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:14,810
You don't look too well.

655
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:22,830
Officer Cho said the daughter was bawling. Is it because of that?

656
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:25,110
It is, isn't it?

657
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:33,790
To tell you the truth, I wanted to
let him go. I could have, you know...

658
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:38,190
But I thought the kids were better off knowing their father was safe in prison...

659
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:42,190
...rather than being chased around because he was a wanted man.

660
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:48,010
Seeing him only on their birthdays...

661
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:53,780
...and waiting all the time is
too much for them.

662
00:53:55,170 --> 00:54:02,000
At least this way they can go see him when they want...

663
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:12,910
...and they don't have to worry about him starving or sleeping on the streets.

664
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:20,840
So I steeled myself and
forced myself to hold onto him.

665
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:25,080
You did well, it was the right decision.

666
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,090
You don't need to
beat yourself up about it.

667
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,080
I'm sorry, Chief.

668
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:34,910
Why are you sorry?
I'm actually feeling quite good.

669
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,870
This is the first time you've really
opened up to me, Chohee.

670
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:44,120
It troubled me that you were always uncomfortable with me.

671
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,790
I'm glad I came here today.

672
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:55,890
Excuse me. Can I make you guys
some coffee or something?

673
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:57,760
No, thank you. I have to get going.

674
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:03,820
Oh, I nearly forgot. I almost left without telling you what I came here to tell you.

675
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:08,980
I found a possible distribution
channel through Hwaja Ji.

676
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:17,100
So talk to Chief Noh and
try to get back on the case.

677
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,190
Chief.

678
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:22,830
You see, I'm a bit on the selfish side.

679
00:55:23,810 --> 00:55:27,780
I can't stand the idea of you
bumming around.

680
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:50,870
What is this?

681
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:53,050
An invitation.

682
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,090
To what?

683
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:57,970
First, put me back on the case.

684
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,970
You've got a lead?

685
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:06,150
There's a chance
we might recover the “Bihaedangjib.”

686
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:08,900
And you want to strike a deal with me?

687
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:10,000
Yes.

688
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:15,140
I refuse. Take this and leave.

689
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,050
Chief!

690
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:19,770
I already told you. You're off the case.

691
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:22,780
Uncle.

692
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:34,870
Uncle... Uncle, you've looked after me like a daughter since I was eight.

693
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:41,050
Did you know? The parent always
gives in to the child in a battle of wills.

694
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:48,030
You'll give in to me. Even if you tell me no, I'm still gonna work on this case.

695
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:51,970
But I'd rather have your permission.

696
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,180
So what's the lead?

697
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,970
Here's the thing.

698
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:11,180
Chairman Jang of the Ohsung Group is holding a charity auction this weekend.

699
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:14,090
It's a charity auction by name...

700
00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:17,810
...but in reality there's going to be
a lot of illegal deals.

701
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:21,010
There's no guarantee
we'll find the “Bihaedangjib,”...

702
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:24,160
...but I think it's worth a try.

703
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:28,820
A charity auction?
And why would I want to go there?

704
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:30,840
If the “Bihaedangjib” shows up...

705
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:33,710
...you're the only one
that can verify its authenticity.

706
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:36,110
Is this my duty as the advisory member?

707
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:39,060
No, not really...

708
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:40,720
Are we done here?

709
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:46,030
Hey, Bumsang.
Come on, at least consider it.

710
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:50,880
I really need your help, okay?
I'm asking you for a favor.

711
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,860
How unlike you,
the heartless Chohee I know.

712
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,920
I'm not going to change my mind,
so leave.

713
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:01,720
Is this about what happened last time?

714
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:05,950
Because I didn't let Cheoljin Lee go?
Is that what this is about?

715
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:10,890
No, this is about you. I don't like you.

716
00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:14,930
You're heartless and
only care about your work.

717
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:17,700
So I don't want to help you. Got it?

718
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,080
Sangho! The lobby, the lobby!

719
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:27,930
The lobby?

720
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:29,760
- Did you check it?
- The lobby's all clear.

721
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,850
Hurry, hurry!

722
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,800
Joohyun, Joohyun,
must you do that right now?

723
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,840
Did you check up on the vehicle?
Can you do that? Let's do a good job.

724
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:43,710
Yes, this is Joohyung Wang. How's
the vehicle coming along? Please hurry.

725
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:48,060
Chohee, what did Mr. Kim say?
Will he help?

726
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:51,830
I don't think
that's going to work out.

727
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:53,940
What to do...

728
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,040
We have no other choice.
We'll have to ask someone else.

729
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:00,960
Sangho, when will Chief Noh arrive?

730
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,870
Five minutes. He says
he'll be here in five minutes.

731
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:06,130
Then we'll start our preparation
for the auction when he arrives.

732
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,960
How are you? I'm here
from the catering service.

733
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:25,990
Please sign here.

734
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:31,770
Sure. It's hot today, isn't it?
Have a good day.

735
00:59:46,090 --> 00:59:49,090
After all those years as a fuzz,
you still can't get it right?

736
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:54,800
It's working, it's working!

737
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,700
Look, look.

738
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:01,720
Idiots.

739
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:04,110
What the, that startled me.

740
01:00:09,870 --> 01:00:13,880
Are they mocking me right now?

741
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:30,970
Officer Cho.

742
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,940
You're a movie star.

743
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:56,900
This is an haute couture piece
my mother bought specially in Paris.

744
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:02,010
If you so much as spill
a drop of wine on it...

745
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:04,990
Haute what?

746
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:09,070
You don't know what haute couture is?

747
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:14,950
Then again, you probably don't have much experience with expensive clothes.

748
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:20,800
Anyway, this is really expensive,
so please be careful.

749
01:01:21,060 --> 01:01:22,040
Thanks.

750
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:28,900
So why can't Bumsang come?
Some important business?

751
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:31,720
Uh...

752
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:37,780
You're heartless and only care about your work. So I don't want to help you.

753
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:42,000
I have no idea.

754
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,080
If he were coming, I'd be the one
going into the auction.

755
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,110
Did you hire someone else
to be the appraiser?

756
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:56,080
What? Oh, Yongcheol Gong of Hanguk University agreed to come.

757
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:59,790
It's time. Call me when you're ready.

758
01:01:59,790 --> 01:02:00,060
Okay.

759
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,890
Oh my! Dear lord...

760
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:29,170
Man, I'm not good with
these kinds of situations.

761
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:33,140
Why'd she have to cry
so heartbreakingly?

762
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:48,890
Excuse me? Anyone home?

763
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:52,770
Who are you?

764
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:54,700
Huh?

765
01:02:55,030 --> 01:02:58,060
Oh, you're the mister
who came the other day.

766
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,110
Yeah, you remember me.

767
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:03,900
Yes. But why did you come back here?

768
01:03:04,130 --> 01:03:09,110
Today's your birthday, right?
Here. Happy birthday.

769
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:11,890
Wow, thank you.

770
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:18,190
How did you know it was my birthday? Oh, did that lady tell you?

771
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:24,190
Wait, the lady who was with me
last time came by again?

772
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:27,800
Yes. She bought me this dress.

773
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:32,040
Oh... I see. It's heavy, isn't it?

774
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:38,960
You know what? She's not such
a bad person once you get to know her.

775
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:43,150
She just talks a bit roughly.
So don't hate her, okay?

776
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:46,960
I don't hate her.
I understand everything now.

777
01:03:47,830 --> 01:03:51,800
And I promised her
I wouldn't cry anymore.

778
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,020
You did? You're a brave little girl.

779
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,050
She said the same thing.

780
01:03:57,050 --> 01:04:00,760
She said when her daddy was
first taken away...

781
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:05,120
...she cried every day and
beat up her little brother.

782
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:07,830
I never hit Younghoon.

783
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:10,980
What did you just say?

784
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:11,750
Huh?

785
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,980
Her daddy was taken away?

786
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,150
Didn't you know?

787
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:22,050
She said her daddy was taken away
far more times than my daddy.

788
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:30,900
For them, it's a worse pain
knowing that their father is a thief.

789
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,810
Would you say the same
if it were your father?

790
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:42,080
The person who first stole
the “Bihaedangjib” was General Shovel.

791
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,800
A famous art thief well educated in Chinese literature as well as...

792
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,060
...topographic divination.

793
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:47,860
Thank you for the meal.

794
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:54,080
You're on the regulations team and
you don't know General Shovel's name?

795
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:57,080
Taesoo Heo. His name is Taesoo Heo.

796
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,940
Hey, you have
the same surname as him.

797
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:04,190
So Chohee's father was...

798
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,890
So we're waiting for Chohee Heo?

799
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:12,980
Yes.

800
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,130
Why isn't she here yet?

801
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:16,990
She's almost here.

802
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:21,160
I heard you're a professor in the same department as Bumsang Kim?

803
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,880
The same department, yes...

804
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,100
...but I'm a professor and he's a lecturer. Don't compare us.

805
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:31,930
Ah... Okay.

806
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:09,810
I'm sorry I'm late.
Well then, we're off.

807
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:10,130
Okay.

808
01:06:10,130 --> 01:06:11,060
Let's go.

809
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,120
Looks fabulous, no?

810
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:19,940
What?

811
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:26,170
That dress, that purse, those shoes, they're all mine.

812
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:29,870
The latest haute couture.

813
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,920
You look very beautiful.

814
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:40,140
I came here to help out my country.

815
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:44,880
I never expected to meet
such a beautiful woman.

816
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:47,900
Let's hurry.

817
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:52,110
Sure, let's go. Let's go find Prince Yangnyeong's “Bihaedangjib.”

818
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:56,120
Prince Yangnyeong?
You mean Prince Ahnpyeong.

819
01:06:56,120 --> 01:07:04,900
What? Ah, right, right. Prince Ahnpyeong. He was an excellent person.

820
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:11,090
Do you know anything at all
about the “Bihaedangjib?”

821
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:15,760
Why is that important?

822
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:20,180
I'm a professor at Hanguk University.
A professor at Hanguk University!

823
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:24,160
One quick look, and it'll be obvious, more or less. Let's go.

824
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:31,990
What do you mean, more or less?
I'm sorry, but I refuse to go in with you.

825
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:37,100
Why are you being so uptight?
Let's just go in without a fuss.

826
01:07:39,050 --> 01:07:41,090
I refuse to exchange words
with someone...

827
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:43,190
...who doesn't even know
the “Bihaedangjib.”

828
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:49,980
Why are you being so bullheaded?
Do you intend to disgrace me?

829
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:52,710
Let go! I said, let go!

830
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:58,720
My, my, this is quite shameful for
a professor at Hanguk University.

831
01:07:58,720 --> 01:07:59,810
Bumsang?

832
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:03,980
You should also consider your father's reputation. Let her go.

833
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:04,990
You let go!

834
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:10,190
You haven't been shamed enough?

835
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:16,150
Yongcheol, Prince Yangnyeong is
King Taejong's son...

836
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:18,990
...and Prince Ahnpyeong is
King Sejong's son!

837
01:08:18,990 --> 01:08:22,810
We're talking about two completely different reigns here.

838
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:25,170
Didn't you learn this
in elementary school?

839
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:29,030
Go brush up on your history, you idiot.

840
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:32,700
Leave! Idiot.

841
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:42,950
I thought you weren't coming.

842
01:08:43,900 --> 01:08:47,170
We don't have much time, so let's talk about that later. You have the invitation?

843
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:50,950
Ah, here.

844
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:55,980
Where'd you get such an unbefitting dress? Rent it from a rental store?

845
01:08:57,130 --> 01:09:03,040
Huh! Was Joohyun bluffing?
I wouldn't know the difference...

846
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:15,070
The weather's great.
Perfect weather for a party.

847
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:22,120
Hey.

848
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:23,130
What?

849
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:28,140
Can't you see?
Partners are walking arm in arm.

850
01:09:52,910 --> 01:11:00,040

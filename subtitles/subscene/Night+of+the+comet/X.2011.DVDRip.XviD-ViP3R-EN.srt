1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
X (2011)

2
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,975
<i>Un coup du champagne
si vous plait.</i>

3
00:01:17,377 --> 00:01:20,369
<i>Garcon, e cafe si vous plait.</i>

4
00:01:22,682 --> 00:01:26,209
<i>T'as destres beaux yeux,
je peu t'acheter un verre?</i>

5
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:51,808
<i>Bonjour, Giles.</i>

6
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:52,812
<i>Ca va?</i>

7
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,336
You're late.

8
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,439
<i>Ca va bien, merci.</i>

9
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,308
So how's my girl?

10
00:02:00,353 --> 00:02:02,218
Serviced and ready to go.

11
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:10,355
Papers are in the glove box.

12
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,428
I got you something.

13
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,199
Just a little bon voyage.

14
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,701
You open it.

15
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,173
So you don't get lost.

16
00:02:27,947 --> 00:02:29,710
Maybe I want to.

17
00:02:31,584 --> 00:02:33,484
I'll miss you, Holly.

18
00:02:40,126 --> 00:02:41,718
Come here.

19
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,702
<i>Ladies, I'd like
to introduce you to Giles.</i>

20
00:02:55,742 --> 00:03:00,145
As you can see,
he's a real peach.

21
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,614
He's quick to learn
and eager to please.

22
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,116
He doesn't get tired,

23
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,176
and he goes off
like a firecracker.

24
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:24,268
What more could a girl want?

25
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,989
You looking for a lay?

26
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,421
Oi.

27
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,534
You shopping?

28
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,065
How much?

29
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,409
What are you after,
handsome?

30
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:15,943
A handjob.

31
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,956
How much?

32
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,617
50?

33
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,726
Without a condom,
and dirty talk.

34
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,967
Well, don't just sit there.

35
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,975
Don't you have any lube?

36
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:44,983
What?

37
00:09:45,017 --> 00:09:46,882
Lube.
KY.

38
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:47,977
Um...

39
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,919
- Out.
- What?

40
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:56,088
I'm not paying top dollar
for amateur hour.

41
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:57,459
I'll be good.
I promise.

42
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:58,622
Fuck that.

43
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,899
You can do anything.

44
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,161
20 bucks.

45
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,975
Show me your tits.

46
00:10:33,165 --> 00:10:35,360
Gonna be a good girl?

47
00:10:45,444 --> 00:10:46,809
Give me your hand.

48
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,323
Oh, that's better.

49
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:09,094
Now, what's a sweet face like
you doing hawking your fork?

50
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:11,664
I'm broke.

51
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:13,968
That's not what
I'm paying you for.

52
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,405
Come on.

53
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:20,777
Now, what's a sweet thing
like you doing on the streets?

54
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,672
I love sex.

55
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,183
Yes.

56
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,650
Um, I'm a slut.

57
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,278
I just can't get enough.

58
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,548
Yeah, you fucking whore.

59
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,385
You're all the same.

60
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,289
Oh, baby, I can feel
you getting hot.

61
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,622
That's better.

62
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,820
How old are you?

63
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,294
17.

64
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,592
You like us young?

65
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,759
Young and tight.

66
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:43,769
Come on, dirtier.

67
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:47,637
Ah, my tight, young pussy's
aching for your big juicy cock.

68
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:48,867
Take it, you bitch.

69
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:49,897
Make me beg.

70
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:50,874
I'll teach you.

71
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,434
Teach me a lesson.

72
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,469
Oh, you fucking whore.

73
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,311
Oh, make me scream.
Come on, come on.

74
00:11:57,349 --> 00:11:59,078
That's better.
That's better.

75
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,608
Yes.

76
00:12:00,653 --> 00:12:02,018
Harder!

77
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,351
No!

78
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:17,191
Where did you get this?

79
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,261
Freedom of Information.

80
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:20,795
Got mine as well.

81
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,543
Look at you.

82
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,513
The prick made me suck him off
then arrested me anyway.

83
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,610
Ligurian arrested me.

84
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:35,211
His kid had just been born.

85
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,289
Does he know?

86
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:41,020
I'm meeting him for dinner.

87
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,426
Don't you tell him, Holly.

88
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,089
He'll stop you if he finds out.

89
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:47,065
I can't just disappear.

90
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:49,795
Forget the past.

91
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:53,293
In Paris,
it'll be all future.

92
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,198
To the end.

93
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,301
To the beginning.

94
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,273
clink!

95
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,182
Show it to me.

96
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,459
First class.

97
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:24,135
I'm proud of you, Holly.

98
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,865
A little something
to help you stay retired.

99
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:31,801
Happy birthday.

100
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,753
I don't know what to say.

101
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,456
Say a prayer for me
in that hunchback's church.

102
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,398
I never thanked you.

103
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:57,664
What for?

104
00:13:57,703 --> 00:14:00,228
Giving me a chance.

105
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:07,009
Why did you pick me?

106
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:09,474
I needed a blonde.

107
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:15,218
You looked tough.

108
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,085
You looked like a survivor.

109
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,917
I wasn't wrong.

110
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,831
Be careful, Holly.

111
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,028
Don't forget what he is.

112
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,983
Say something to me in French.

113
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,836
Don't say what it means.

114
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:23,417
What are you after?

115
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,422
A hand job would be good.

116
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,980
50, up front.

117
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,445
- Hi.
- Hi.

118
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,279
Got a spare ciggie?

119
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,807
Don't smoke.

120
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,342
Nobody smokes anymore.

121
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:29,513
It's feral, eh?

122
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,886
Stunts your growth.

123
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,788
Puts you in an early grave.

124
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,917
What's your name?

125
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:35,392
Shay.

126
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:38,157
I'm Cindy.

127
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,425
Buy me a soft serve, Shay?

128
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,626
I'll pay you back.

129
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,135
Okay.

130
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,468
Can I get a soft serve,
small fries, and a Coke?

131
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,727
Don't flash your money around.

132
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,705
There's a lot of eyes,
and they're always watching.

133
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:32,409
You must be starving, eh?

134
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:33,509
You want some?

135
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,883
This'll fill me up.

136
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:37,380
I'm a real sweet tooth.

137
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,583
Haven't seen you
around here before.

138
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:42,753
I just got here.

139
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,103
Can you lend me a dollar?

140
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,106
I'll pay you back.

141
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,767
I can get a smoke for a dollar.

142
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:02,503
You're a real friend.

143
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,351
Don't keep your cash
in your pocket either.

144
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,233
Happy birthday, Holly.

145
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,116
Come here.

146
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:52,658
Ever felt like running away?

147
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,728
Ever felt like
changing your life?

148
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,476
What's your dream, Holly?

149
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:08,071
If you could do anything,
go anywhere, what would it be?

150
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,887
Before my mum died,
she took me to Paris.

151
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,428
That's what I remember
about her.

152
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,989
She was happy.

153
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,470
I've always wanted to go back.

154
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,994
Let's do it.

155
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,132
Let's go to Paris.

156
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,473
I'm getting out.

157
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,308
I'm gonna disappear,
and I want you to come with me.

158
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,678
Money won't be a problem.

159
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:45,512
What about your family?

160
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,382
I don't love them.

161
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,219
Open it.

162
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,633
Put it on.

163
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:11,802
You have to.

164
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:14,979
It's bad luck otherwise.

165
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:21,483
What?

166
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,009
Let's go.

167
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:37,482
Sorry.

168
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:39,848
It's all right.

169
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,410
Look me in the eyes
and say that.

170
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,855
It's all right, Michael.

171
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:53,829
Pack your bags.

172
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:57,028
Tomorrow I'll be rich enough
to set us free.

173
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,326
Monkey, be quiet.

174
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:07,060
Fuck.

175
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,671
I'll give you
the group discount.

176
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:18,267
100 a hole, 50 a hand,
that's 350.

177
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,904
That's right boys.

178
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:22,504
It's real too.

179
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,586
Fuck.

180
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:51,100
Rocky.

181
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:52,234
Rock.

182
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,472
I got her.
You fuckin' tryin' to avoid me?

183
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:55,638
No.

184
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,704
What the fuck
you runnin' from, then?

185
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:58,477
You fuckin' scrote.
Where's my money?

186
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:00,643
I seen her, Rock,
stealin' Karlene's trade.

187
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,710
It's my stretch,
you fuckin' slut.

188
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,312
No, no, no, I wasn't.

189
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:05,323
That's fuckin' bullshit!

190
00:27:05,357 --> 00:27:06,551
Shut up, Karlene.

191
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,115
Thinks she's so fuckin' good.

192
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,060
Do somethin'.
Do somethin'!

193
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:12,495
- Give us the money.
- I don't have any.

194
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,497
What the fuck did you say?

195
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,055
I spent it.

196
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,597
See that?

197
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,802
See fuckin' that?

198
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,606
Fuckin' lying bitch.

199
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,135
Listen, you fuckin' slut.

200
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:31,342
Next time, it's a hot shot.

201
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:35,046
Stay off our fuckin' street,
or you're dead, cunt.

202
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,192
You fuckin' bitch.

203
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,668
Bel, hey, it's Holly.

204
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:56,901
Hi, are you working?

205
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:58,704
Yeah, now.

206
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,574
No, no, no,
just a couple of hours.

207
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:03,341
Okay.

208
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:05,679
Yeah, no, that's fine.
Bye.

209
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:09,483
Um, well I'm swinging by yours,
like, in two minutes.

210
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,681
I can come get you.

211
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:12,087
It's good money.

212
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,789
Yeah, no, that's not
gonna help me, so...

213
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:17,795
No, it's all right.

214
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,729
Okay, bye.

215
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,859
Hey, Monique, it's Holly.

216
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,732
You working?

217
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:30,502
It's good money.

218
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,407
Come on, Mon,
you're my last hope.

219
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,243
Yeah, thanks anyway.

220
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,618
Dramas?

221
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,191
It's the night for it.

222
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,886
Full moon.

223
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,918
Everyone's a little crazy.

224
00:28:50,962 --> 00:28:52,793
Great.

225
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,197
Maybe I can help.

226
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,861
Can you find me a brunette
who can fuck and suck?

227
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,494
Look out!

228
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:00,834
Fuckin' asshole!

229
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,134
Why don't you watch
where you're going?

230
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,401
You could've fuckin' killed me!

231
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,033
You fuckin' idiot!

232
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,781
She's perfect.

233
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,682
Wait up.

234
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:16,312
Hey, I'm talking to you.

235
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,685
Fuck off!

236
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,054
Want a job?

237
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,149
I said piss off, lady.

238
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,524
Don't you understand English?

239
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:26,655
I need a girl right now,
and you're perfect.

240
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:27,995
Threesome at the Hyatt.

241
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,624
Couple of hours, tops.

242
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,364
It's 300.

243
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,803
When was the last time
you made that much?

244
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,305
Nothing weird?

245
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,373
Nothing weird.

246
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,974
Just one bloke?

247
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:49,316
Just me and the guy.

248
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,555
$400.

249
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,323
Wait.

250
00:29:58,363 --> 00:30:00,456
I need the money.

251
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,829
Just give me a chance.

252
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,274
How old are you?

253
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,079
19.

254
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:21,813
Don't bullshit me.

255
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:24,587
17.

256
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,123
You got anything else
to wear?

257
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:30,224
Just this.

258
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:33,028
Put it on.

259
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,437
What's your name?

260
00:30:40,471 --> 00:30:41,870
Shay.

261
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:43,464
It's $300, Shay.

262
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,407
Okay.

263
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:49,041
I'm Holly.

264
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,877
Let's go.

265
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,992
You okay?

266
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,122
Yeah.

267
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:08,462
Nervous?

268
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:09,466
No.

269
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,635
Just follow my lead, okay?

270
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:50,867
Better out than in.

271
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,704
Present company excepted.

272
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:12,917
You like that?

273
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:37,111
When I fuck you,
when I make you come,

274
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:40,675
I know it's all an act,

275
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:42,549
an illusion.

276
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:45,283
It doesn't matter.

277
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:47,814
I want the illusion.

278
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,986
That's what I'm paying for.

279
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:54,493
Just for an hour,
I've got the biggest dick...

280
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:59,227
The magic touch.

281
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:03,297
I can make you come
in under a minute.

282
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,949
Prove it.

283
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:15,075
Oh, yeah.

284
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:43,506
Mm.

285
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,041
Yeah?

286
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:54,150
No, no.

287
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,482
You're early.

288
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,852
No problem.

289
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,619
Come up.

290
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,750
Fuck!

291
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:02,759
I got business.

292
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:05,626
Get in the bathroom
and shut up.

293
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,290
Take your clothes.

294
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,628
Come on, move!

295
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,896
Move!

296
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:35,984
Hello, Willie.

297
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,625
Lovely night for it.

298
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:44,101
Yes, top night, Mr. Bennett.

299
00:36:44,135 --> 00:36:46,933
Things went great,
I'm happy to say.

300
00:36:46,971 --> 00:36:48,905
Fine.

301
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:55,944
Well, come on.

302
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,914
Make me happy.

303
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,727
They loved the gear.

304
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:17,430
You too?
Did you love it too?

305
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:18,662
Yeah.

306
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,534
I had a taste, Mr. Bennett.

307
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:23,199
I'm not gonna deny it.

308
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,106
Of course you did, Willie.
Yeah.

309
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,235
A good salesman's
got to know his product.

310
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:28,768
Here.

311
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,979
You better count that.

312
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:03,947
Do you like bowling, Willie?

313
00:38:03,981 --> 00:38:05,346
Dunno.
Why?

314
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:14,113
Because now you're
a bowling ball.

315
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,809
Drive!

316
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,547
<i>You've rung Holly.</i>

317
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,111
<i>I'm tied up right now,</i>

318
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,850
<i>but if you leave your name
and number, I'll call you back</i>

319
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,222
<i>to arrange an appointment.</i>

320
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:58,252
Gotcha.

321
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,671
Fuck.

322
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:09,695
Fuck.

323
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:14,507
Calm down.

324
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:16,513
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Shh.

325
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:17,946
- He shot him in the head!
- Shut up!

326
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:20,681
I saw it!
I saw it!

327
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:23,243
Just calm down, all right?

328
00:40:23,287 --> 00:40:24,549
All right?

329
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,987
Oh, shit.

330
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,269
What the fuck
are you looking at?

331
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,272
Where to?

332
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:44,297
Just drive.

333
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:50,173
He knew we were there.

334
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:51,738
He didn't see us.

335
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:52,942
How do you know?

336
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,611
You're safe.

337
00:40:55,653 --> 00:40:57,644
Oh, fuck.

338
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,536
Stop.

339
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:22,045
Stop!

340
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,351
You don't know me.

341
00:41:28,385 --> 00:41:30,114
I don't know you.

342
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,880
Hey.

343
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:38,058
Wait!

344
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:39,562
Where to?

345
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,061
Where can I take you?

346
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:47,536
Look, give me a destination
or get out.

347
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:57,110
You all right?

348
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:03,481
Everyone's crazy tonight.

349
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:12,925
What's that?

350
00:42:12,963 --> 00:42:14,726
Don't worry.

351
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:17,757
Shh.

352
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,102
Can't leave him at home.

353
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:25,040
He's part of my act.

354
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:26,804
Look, can I take you somewhere?

355
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,546
I'm hungry.

356
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,046
How about your favorite
restaurant?

357
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,718
Vegas is the place
for any serious magician.

358
00:43:43,754 --> 00:43:47,656
My old man used to say
that if you conquer Vegas,

359
00:43:47,691 --> 00:43:49,488
the world will follow.

360
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,426
If you could work
at any casino,

361
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,451
which one would it be?

362
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:54,191
Caesar's.

363
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:55,960
How come?

364
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,991
It's the coolest.

365
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:01,232
And he played there once
on the same bill as Tom Jones.

366
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,637
Who?

367
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,574
Tom Jones?

368
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,076
The singer.

369
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,511
Forget it.

370
00:44:15,552 --> 00:44:17,383
Your Dad sounds cool.

371
00:44:18,889 --> 00:44:21,323
Yeah, he was.

372
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,794
I used to watch his shows
over and over.

373
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,197
My dad was magic too.

374
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:35,569
He disappeared when I was born.

375
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,179
What, you never saw him?

376
00:44:48,819 --> 00:44:50,309
I got a stepdad.

377
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:04,998
Aren't you cold?

378
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,902
I left my coat at the hotel.

379
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,633
Here.

380
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:19,576
So what did you want to be
when you grew up?

381
00:45:20,751 --> 00:45:23,743
I never had a dream
or anything.

382
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,448
Not like you.

383
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,325
Maybe I could be your...

384
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:37,823
Your lovely assistant.

385
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:48,940
Hello, Holly.

386
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:52,380
I'm Willie's friend.

387
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,213
You going somewhere?

388
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,242
Where's your friend?

389
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,480
Willie was a greedy turd.

390
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:58,852
He always got a double act.

391
00:45:58,889 --> 00:46:00,254
I don't know
what you're talking about.

392
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,287
That was foreplay.

393
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:08,264
Do you want to fuck with me?

394
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:10,994
Your friend
with the pink lipstick.

395
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,001
She was from the street.

396
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:14,128
I don't know her name.

397
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:15,331
Wrong answer.

398
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:16,730
Look into my eyes and listen
to the sound of my voice.

399
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,531
There is nothing
but the sound of my voice

400
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,060
and my eyes.

401
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,438
I will count backwards
from five.

402
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:29,468
When I reach one,
you will be under my spell.

403
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,282
Five.

404
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:36,309
I want you to completely
free your mind.

405
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:40,185
Four.

406
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:43,057
All tension flows
from your body.

407
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,694
Three.

408
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:50,393
You feel totally relaxed.

409
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:55,069
Two.

410
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:56,936
You're light as a feather.

411
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:01,774
One.

412
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:04,804
A deep sleep envelopes you.

413
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,725
Can you hear me?

414
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:21,788
Yeah.

415
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,356
Tell me your name.

416
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,766
Shay Maree Ryan.

417
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:29,437
How old are you, Shay?

418
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:31,134
17.

419
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:35,836
Tell me something
about yourself.

420
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:37,870
I never forget a face.

421
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:43,815
Where are you from?

422
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:46,584
Up north.

423
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:49,353
Why are you here?

424
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,327
Mum died, so I ran away.

425
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,359
Sorry.

426
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:00,928
Do you have a boyfriend?

427
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,131
No.

428
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,140
Look at me.

429
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,889
You're beautiful.

430
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,453
Don't.

431
00:49:38,742 --> 00:49:40,334
Can I see you again?

432
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:45,581
<i>Do you want to see me
or see me?</i>

433
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:48,977
I want to see you.

434
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,953
"Harry the Impossible."

435
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,657
Will you call?

436
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,492
I don't just hypnotize anyone,
you know.

437
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:10,363
It wouldn't work out.

438
00:50:12,142 --> 00:50:16,010
How do you know if you don't
take a chance?

439
00:50:27,958 --> 00:50:29,323
What's in the bag, bitch?

440
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:30,417
Hand it over,
and you won't get hurt.

441
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,518
You're the one'll get hurt.

442
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:32,994
Aww teach her
some manners, Rock.

443
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,520
I'll teach her some fuckin'
manners, all right.

444
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:36,327
Oh, fuck!

445
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:37,424
My fuckin' eyes!

446
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:47,368
My fucking head!
You bitch!

447
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:11,392
I fuckin' hate you people.

448
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:12,800
Open your mouth!

449
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:17,505
Open your mouth!

450
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:49,268
I want a room.

451
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:51,638
$25 the half,
$30 the hour.

452
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:54,007
Five bucks for the towel.

453
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:58,472
No, for the...
for the night.

454
00:51:58,515 --> 00:52:00,915
80 bucks for the night.

455
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:09,615
Room three, first floor,
end of the corridor.

456
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:11,092
Thanks.

457
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:43,093
<i>Whoo, oh, my God!</i>

458
00:54:41,177 --> 00:54:43,338
Hey.
Hey.

459
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,540
Hey, Mum.

460
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,884
Don't you ever be afraid

461
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:56,585
to take a chance, Shay,
you know?

462
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,558
We're looking for your friend.

463
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:14,536
I don't know her.

464
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:18,803
Yeah, but you know what she
looks like, though, don't you?

465
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:20,434
Huh?
Don't ya?

466
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:22,206
No.

467
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,488
Ah!

468
00:56:35,925 --> 00:56:37,586
Don't you?

469
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:41,962
Stop, stop.

470
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:47,062
All right.

471
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,094
All right!

472
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,708
She didn't see you.

473
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,733
She can't hurt you.

474
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:00,108
You can't trust women.

475
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:03,119
Shit just fuckin' flies
out of their mouth

476
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:04,620
without them even thinking.

477
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:06,451
It's biological.

478
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:08,081
It's because they got
a cunt hidden away.

479
00:57:08,124 --> 00:57:10,217
It's natural they're gonna
be hiding something.

480
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,921
With a bloke,
it's all just there, isn't it?

481
00:57:11,961 --> 00:57:13,428
What you see is what you get.

482
00:57:13,463 --> 00:57:15,158
But women are fuckin' liars.

483
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:16,961
I fuckin' hate women.

484
00:57:19,836 --> 00:57:21,633
Start looking.

485
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:15,752
Where's Rose?

486
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:18,158
Don't know.

487
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:19,855
Who are you?

488
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:23,161
I heard you from next door.

489
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:24,962
Have you got anything?

490
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,060
No.

491
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:28,798
Got a smoke?

492
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:31,432
Sorry.

493
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:33,203
Fuck.

494
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,740
What time is it?

495
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:40,271
It's late.

496
00:58:40,316 --> 00:58:42,011
Where the fuck is she?

497
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,954
I'll get you some water.

498
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:22,418
Okay?

499
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:26,619
Sweet.

500
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:34,368
Here I am, baby.

501
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,894
Who the fuck are you?

502
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:37,964
She's the girl from next door.

503
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:40,635
Well, she can fuck off,
because we're fuckin' busy.

504
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:43,271
I was just seeing
if your friend was all right.

505
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:45,304
He's not my friend.

506
00:59:45,348 --> 00:59:46,781
Hurry.

507
00:59:48,284 --> 00:59:50,252
Come on.

508
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:54,689
Hurry up.

509
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:58,723
Come on. Come on.

510
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,285
Come on!

511
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:15,402
Half.

512
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:21,840
Half.

513
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,441
Half!

514
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:33,560
Fuck.

515
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:34,528
Fuck, fuck.

516
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:35,553
The back of your hand.

517
01:00:35,598 --> 01:00:37,361
Shut up, bitch!

518
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:40,267
Shut up.

519
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,292
Fuck!

520
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,925
Ooh.

521
01:01:21,277 --> 01:01:23,871
You got any money?

522
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,938
No.

523
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:27,813
Bullshit.

524
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,216
Cutie like you.

525
01:01:30,253 --> 01:01:32,619
Come on.

526
01:01:32,655 --> 01:01:34,452
Give us some money.

527
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,019
I don't have any.

528
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:40,222
Fuck you.

529
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:46,357
<i>Hey, open the fucking door.</i>

530
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:47,562
<i>Come on, sweetheart.</i>

531
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:48,865
<i>Open the fucking door.</i>

532
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:50,338
The welcome wagon.

533
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,933
Cunts.

534
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:55,038
That's the way it is.

535
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:58,070
They fucked me.
Now it's your turn.

536
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:07,045
I could tell 'em you're here.

537
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,354
They'd pay me for it.

538
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:29,272
Thanks.

539
01:02:31,147 --> 01:02:33,843
Get fucked.

540
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:08,836
Hey.

541
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:11,437
Pink lipstick.

542
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,471
Run!

543
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:01,897
Gotcha.

544
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:05,731
Get in!

545
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:36,358
Are you all right?

546
01:05:44,407 --> 01:05:46,034
What did he do to you?

547
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,238
Police radio.

548
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:51,610
What?

549
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:53,444
He's a cop.

550
01:05:55,051 --> 01:05:57,679
Fuck.

551
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,553
You should go home.

552
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:01,578
I can't.

553
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:04,388
Somewhere else, then.

554
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:06,418
There's nowhere else.

555
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:11,894
I could stay with you.

556
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:15,802
I'm going to the airport
to get on a plane out of here.

557
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:20,072
That guy'll come after me.

558
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:28,477
I offered you a job.
No one forced you.

559
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:30,485
You don't give a shit.

560
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:31,918
I just saved you.

561
01:06:31,954 --> 01:06:34,479
I don't owe you anything.

562
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,787
You can have the car.

563
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:40,796
I can't drive.

564
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,457
Get out.
Get out!

565
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,159
Get out!

566
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,673
Hey.

567
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:03,803
Fuck off!

568
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:06,280
It's Shay.

569
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:09,148
Fully didn't recognize you.

570
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:13,312
Where you going?

571
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:14,617
Nowhere.

572
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:17,251
Can I come?

573
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:18,624
I saw a guy get killed.

574
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:20,492
You okay?

575
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:24,221
I think someone's after me.

576
01:08:24,266 --> 01:08:25,927
Who's lookin' out for you?

577
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:30,364
Rocky will help.

578
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:31,896
He looks after me.

579
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:32,965
He'll love you.

580
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:34,407
Yeah.

581
01:08:34,443 --> 01:08:36,843
I'll go get him.

582
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:39,211
Lend me some ciggie money?
I'll pay you back.

583
01:08:45,087 --> 01:08:46,918
You're a real friend.

584
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:48,446
Don't move.

585
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:03,537
Get in.

586
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:05,335
I'm waiting for someone.

587
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:08,266
Shay, get in.

588
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:16,307
I met my first trick
on this street.

589
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:20,519
I was so scared.

590
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:22,387
This big old man.

591
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:27,721
I thought he was gonna
have a heart attack on me.

592
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:33,694
I promised myself,
before I turned 30, I'd quit,

593
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:38,696
move to Paris,
reinvent myself.

594
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:44,035
It's my birthday today.

595
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:48,038
I've been fucking for money
since I was 15.

596
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:50,745
I want a new life.

597
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:54,244
There's this guy.

598
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:55,757
He doesn't know
that I'm leaving,

599
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:58,351
and I don't want him to.

600
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:00,157
He can help us.

601
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:04,155
Who is he?

602
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,067
He's a cop.

603
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:12,558
Don't worry, ladies.

604
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:14,892
Safe as houses here.

605
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:15,897
Take a load off.

606
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:18,024
This is Bob's place.

607
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:19,728
No secrets between him and me.

608
01:12:19,768 --> 01:12:21,736
Except where the bodies
are buried.

609
01:12:25,541 --> 01:12:27,532
Good one.

610
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:38,409
- Who's this?
- Shay.

611
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:40,285
We were on the job together.

612
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:42,051
You see what happened?

613
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:44,582
- He shot him in the head.
- Who shot him?

614
01:12:44,626 --> 01:12:46,025
A cop named Bennett.

615
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:47,892
He tried to kill us.

616
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:50,125
He's after us, Michael.

617
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:52,599
Where'd you park
his car darlin'?

618
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:56,897
We didn't say anything
about a car.

619
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,838
Gotcha.

620
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:10,209
Mate, you got more bruises
than a Queensland banana.

621
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:15,917
I reckon your nose looks better
on this side.

622
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,490
Fonzie got busted!

623
01:13:51,994 --> 01:13:54,724
Laugh now, you fuckin' dog!

624
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:56,822
Where's my car, cunt?

625
01:13:58,634 --> 01:13:59,726
Settle down.

626
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:00,735
Get out of my way.

627
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:02,293
You made enough mistakes
tonight.

628
01:14:02,337 --> 01:14:04,669
Fuckin' settle down.

629
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:07,368
Look at my suit.

630
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:09,240
That bitch broke
my fuckin' nose.

631
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,576
- You can have the girl.
- What do you care?

632
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:13,308
Holly's mine.

633
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:19,344
Oh, mate.

634
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:21,185
She's a fuckin' whore.

635
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:27,424
She's pissing off.

636
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,862
Her place was empty.

637
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:29,886
She's coming with me.

638
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:32,799
No, no, look at her bag.

639
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:34,496
I saw the ticket.

640
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:39,538
Whores only love money.

641
01:14:39,575 --> 01:14:41,509
Everything else is an act.

642
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:30,948
<i>Back to the car.</i>

643
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,333
He was lying, Michael.

644
01:16:28,884 --> 01:16:31,785
I remember the first time
I saw you.

645
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:39,193
I arrested you just so
I could hear your voice.

646
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:49,995
I'm gonna believe you, Holly.

647
01:16:50,038 --> 01:16:53,371
We're rich enough to disappear.

648
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:55,239
What about Shay?

649
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:57,472
It's just you and me now.

650
01:16:57,512 --> 01:16:59,036
She's my friend.

651
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:03,884
It's just you and me now.

652
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:08,352
Look in my eyes and say yes.

653
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:17,990
No.

654
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:22,830
I can't.

655
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:28,002
Tell me it wasn't all an act.

656
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:31,706
Police!
Police!

657
01:17:31,747 --> 01:17:32,714
Get in the car.

658
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:34,443
Get in the car!
Move!

659
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,383
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!

660
01:17:36,418 --> 01:17:37,715
Drop the fucking gun!

661
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:39,721
Drive,
or I'll fucking kill you!

662
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:41,848
Come on!
Step on the fucking peddle.

663
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:43,824
Come on!

664
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:54,727
Faster!

665
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:02,102
Come on!

666
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:06,507
Come on!

667
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:12,075
Come on!
Faster!

668
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,069
Holly.

669
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:31,538
Okay.

670
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:33,063
Holly.

671
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,782
The case.

672
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:21,649
It's just a scratch.

673
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,885
You're still beautiful.

674
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:27,454
What time's your flight?

675
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:32,428
I'll never make it now.

676
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,526
You've got to try.

677
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:38,064
I'll call Harry.

678
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:41,271
Who?

679
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:43,641
The taxi driver.

680
01:19:43,678 --> 01:19:45,543
He's also an escape artist.

681
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:11,532
It's ringing.

682
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:13,131
Oh my God.

683
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:14,642
Holly?

684
01:20:16,211 --> 01:20:17,974
Holly, lie down.
Lie down.

685
01:20:21,049 --> 01:20:22,141
Just lie down.

686
01:20:28,123 --> 01:20:29,556
<i>Tenir moi.</i>

687
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:35,295
Holly?

688
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:36,991
Holly?

689
01:20:37,032 --> 01:20:39,125
Somebody help me!

690
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:41,727
Help me!

691
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:43,260
Somebody help me!

692
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:46,103
Help me!

693
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:39,433
I usually
pull him out of a hat.

694
01:25:06,701 --> 01:25:08,601
You like me, don't you?

695
01:25:11,206 --> 01:25:13,037
Yeah.

696
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:25,976
I want you
to make me disappear.

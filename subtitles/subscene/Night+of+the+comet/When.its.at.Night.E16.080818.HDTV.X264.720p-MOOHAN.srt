00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,740
<i> Cultural assets and individuals in this
program have been altered fictionally.</i>

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,810
<i> They have no real-life
associations with this drama.</i>

3
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,840
Boys, why don't we let Bumsang
appraise your punches?

4
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,600
Unfortunately, I don't have
much experience appraising thugs.

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,890
Thugs?

6
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,830
That's it, boys. Let's make
mashed potatoes out of him today.

7
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,010
Get him! Get him!

8
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,910
Bumsang!

9
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,640
Bumsang, are you all right?

10
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,830
I'm fine.

11
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,780
Hey, you, Bleach Head.

12
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:03,870
Hey, Bleach Head!

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,630
Bleach Head?
You fuzz have no manners.

14
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,610
Hey, run for it.

15
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:15,600
Bumsang, give us a moment.
We'll be right back.

16
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:30,930
Hey, Mr. Kim, it's too hot for a chase.
Just give up already.

17
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:33,610
And if I refuse?

18
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:37,630
Then we'll probably lose to you.
But we're only gonna go after one guy.

19
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,990
That would be you, Bleach Head.

20
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,980
Boss, let's just turn ourselves in.

21
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,900
Boss, we've got nothing to lose.
Let's give this fight a shot.

22
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,910
Dongpal, you're right.

23
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,570
Chief Kang, we're not going
to get caught so easily.

24
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,850
Boys!

25
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,920
Yes, sir!

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,880
Crush ‘em!

27
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,780
Boss! Boss!

28
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,700
Stay safe! Boss...

29
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,750
What's up with
the investigations team?

30
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:50,880
They should at least give us a call,
telling us if they caught Mr. Kim or not.

31
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,870
What if they haven't found Bumsang yet
and they're just wandering around?

32
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:05,040
Chohee, don't worry. Chief Kang went,
so he'll save Bumsang for sure.

33
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,820
Yes, Officer Cho. What?

34
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,870
Bumsang was taken to the hospital?

35
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay. All right, then we'll head over
there right now. Okay. All right.

36
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,840
They found Bumsang?

37
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,900
Yeah, he was taken to the hospital.

38
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,850
Let's go to show Bumsang
our sense of camaraderie.

39
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,670
Chohee!

40
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,710
How'd you know I was here?

41
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,630
Chohee ran off in such a hurry -

42
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:40,930
Thank god.
I'm so relieved you're safe.

43
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,820
Did you think I was gonna die?

44
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,570
What do we do?

45
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,560
I'm so jealous.

46
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,630
A lovely Kodak moment,
isn't it, Joohyun?

47
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,040
Hey, guys.

48
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,730
Chief! Where's everyone else?

49
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,900
They'll be here soon.

50
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,660
Let's leave before we interrupt them.
Chief Kang, let's go.

51
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,990
Let's go! Let's go!

52
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,840
Maybe you should stop now.
There are other patients here.

53
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,000
Does it hurt?

54
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,850
Of course it does.

55
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,710
You were really worried
about me, weren't you?

56
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,900
Just a little.
About this much?

57
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,740
Thanks, for even that much.

58
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,590
What about Gyoon and Chief Noh?

59
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,870
Excuse me.

60
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,920
Gyoon.

61
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,920
Sis.

62
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,670
Are you okay?
Are you really okay?

63
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,970
You're back now, right?

64
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,930
Yeah.

65
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,750
You did well.

66
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:40,000
Chief.

67
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,550
I'm fine.

68
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,750
Chief, are you really okay?

69
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,560
I can leave tomorrow.

70
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,040
Oh, and Bumsang?
Thanks for your help earlier.

71
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,750
No need to thank me.
I'm just glad that you're safe.

72
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,790
I guess I got a little
too ambitious for my age.

73
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,670
Gyoon, don't just sit there.
Get them some refreshments.

74
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,630
It's fine.
I'll step outside with Gyoon.

75
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,900
Why?

76
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,810
I believe Chohee has
something to say to you.

77
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:21,850
Bro, what's going on?

78
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,800
That's my question. What happened
today? Why were you there?

79
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:35,550
The thing is, I stole a portable hard drive
full of Chairman Jang's illegal deals

80
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:36,880
and gave it to Chief Noh.

81
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,580
You robbed his house again?

82
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:48,830
Yeah, but Chief Noh said that stolen evidence can't be submitted in court

83
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:52,810
so we tried to set what turned out
to be an unsuccessful trap.

84
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,690
You two are unbelievable.
How could you be so reckless?

85
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,970
If only it had worked.
I'm so ashamed.

86
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,940
Don't say that. We should
be glad you're safe right now.

87
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,860
I guess.

88
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,960
So what are Sis
and Uncle talking about?

89
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:24,700
I didn't want to believe Chairman Jang,
but truthfully I felt some doubt.

90
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,770
So I felt I had to ask you
once and for all.

91
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,780
What do you want to know?

92
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:42,680
Did you meet Dad around the time
when he disappeared seven years ago?

93
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,590
I did.

94
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,650
What happened between you two?

95
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,990
I never imagined that would be
the last time I'd see him.

96
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,000
‘I went intending to arrest him.'

97
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:14,780
All seven national treasures I stole are
in Chairman Jang's hands. Arrest him.

98
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,920
Taesoo!

99
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,860
I'll take the stand.

100
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:23,730
I'll testify how I stole them and
how Chairman Jang took them away.

101
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,880
So go after him.

102
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,930
How can I with only
your testimony as evidence?

103
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:33,010
Besides, I came to arrest you, not him.

104
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:40,570
Chief Noh!
How could you do this to me?

105
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,700
You were always the one
who believed me.

106
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:51,580
I may be a thief, but you know
as well as I do that I'm not lying.

107
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,920
Enough already. Let's go.
I'll tell them you turned yourself in.

108
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,940
Chief Noh!

109
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:00,590
Think of your kids.
Until when are you going to live like this?

110
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,870
Think of Chohee and Gyoon. Turn
yourself in! Don't you want to go home?

111
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:12,920
I can't give up for their sake.

112
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,670
Taesoo!

113
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:22,920
I have to get those items back
if I want to go back to my kids.

114
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,640
I need to return them to their
rightful places. So don't arrest me now.

115
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:31,820
Taesoo.

116
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,890
I just ask that
you don't arrest me today.

117
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,910
Taesoo! Taesoo!

118
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,980
Taesoo...

119
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,750
That was the first and last time
I let him walk away.

120
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,810
I should have arrested him then.

121
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:57,020
Then he would still be alive now.

122
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,040
It was all my fault.

123
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,680
Why is that your fault?
You did nothing wrong.

124
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:16,650
Chairman Jang has to pay for this.
He's the one who had Dad murdered.

125
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:22,630
This time I'll arrest him myself.

126
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:24,720
No. I'll get him.

127
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,820
Chohee.

128
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,890
I'm going to do it, Chief.

129
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,960
I'll be busy starting tomorrow,
gathering evidence against him.

130
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:40,810
So don't be stingy
with the traveling expenses.

131
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,010
I'll think about it, Chohee.

132
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,950
By the way, Chohee, I recorded
my conversation with Chairman Jang.

133
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:59,750
Recorded? What?
You mean like a hidden camera?

134
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:07,700
That's nearly enough evidence.
Chief, where is the recording?

135
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,660
Check for a necktie clip
somewhere among my clothes.

136
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,580
Chief, it's not here.

137
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,630
That can't be.

138
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,770
The vase, the vase!

139
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,000
What in the world does
Bumsang Kim have against me?

140
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:06,900
It's bad enough I lost the “Bihaedangjib”
to him, but he had to show up right then?

141
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,820
That's what I'm saying.

142
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,860
How did he know to come there?

143
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:19,670
This is your fault. If you had taken care of
him earlier this wouldn't have happened.

144
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,650
I'm sorry, Boss.

145
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:24,010
Sorry?
You think that solves anything?

146
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:28,700
Look at what happened
to me because of you.

147
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,830
Boss, this isn't the time to be whining.

148
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,560
We have to get far away before
Dongpal tells the fuzz everything.

149
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,860
You're right. We should.

150
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,570
But I'm more scared
of Chairman Jang.

151
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,740
What the?
Who are you guys?

152
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,870
Mr. Kim turned out
to be completely useless.

153
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:04,570
I thought maybe he could handle
something that didn't require brains.

154
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,770
We captured him like you ordered.
What do we do with him?

155
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:15,020
Find out through him who handled
Taesoo Heo. Then get rid of the whole lot.

156
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,780
Yes, sir.

157
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,680
What are the cops up to?

158
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,710
I'm afraid they plan
to launch an official investigation.

159
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:29,010
I'm sorry, sir.

160
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,580
What a bother.

161
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,650
Let Secretary Oh handle things
for a while, and you lay low.

162
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,820
And just in case, tell my team of attorneys
to prepare for all possible scenarios.

163
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:47,750
Yes, sir. Oh, and Iwazaki is flying in
tomorrow. What shall I do?

164
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,890
With things looking not so good,
should I cancel the appointment?

165
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:00,940
We can't do that to Iwazaki.
Continue that as is.

166
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,780
Bro, I'm heading to bed.

167
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,820
Okay.

168
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,910
You're turning yourself in tomorrow?

169
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,950
Yeah.

170
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,890
I'll leave you two alone then.

171
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,930
I looked into the matter.

172
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:46,920
Since no one reported the thefts
and the nature of the crimes wasn't bad

173
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,990
he'll probably just be placed
on probation. Don't worry about it.

174
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:57,590
I'm not worried.
In fact, I feel at peace now.

175
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,960
Gyoon probably feels the same.

176
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,880
Yeah. You have to be
strong for Gyoon's sake.

177
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,020
Want some tea?

178
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:10,780
No, I'm fine. I can't intrude on
your sibling time. I'll be going then.

179
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,940
You know what? I'm going
to tell Chief Kang tomorrow.

180
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,910
Tell him what?

181
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,670
That I'm sorry
but I can't accept his feelings.

182
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:39,030
Not because of everything going on,
but because there's someone I like.

183
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:44,010
So I can't accept his feelings.
I'm going to tell him that.

184
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,830
Go on then.

185
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,610
Gyoon might come out.
Go home.

186
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:26,820
Can't sleep?

187
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,730
Bro left?

188
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,560
What are you doing?

189
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:39,910
Dad didn't carry around much cash.
Twelve bucks. How sad is that?

190
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,860
That's seriously sad.

191
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,830
Why'd he carry this around
when he didn't even smoke?

192
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,950
Sis, this is so interesting.

193
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,960
Look here, at Dad's handwriting.
It looks just like mine.

194
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,930
It does.

195
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,040
It's practically the same.

196
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,910
I know I take after him a lot,
but similar handwriting, too?

197
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,970
I know.

198
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:26,780
Gyoon, I'm not going
with you tomorrow.

199
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,780
Okay.

200
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:37,670
When you come back,
let's be happy, okay?

201
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,990
You and me both.

202
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:42,740
Okay.

203
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,880
We'll be together again soon.

204
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,720
We can charge Chairman Jang
with the following crimes.

205
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,040
The trafficking, possession
and concealment of stolen goods.

206
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,820
The murder of Taesoo Heo.
The attempted murder of Chief Noh.

207
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,790
He'll be locked up
even way past his death.

208
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:14,670
We took the information from his
hard drive, and after retracing his steps,

209
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,650
we found some evidence supporting
his purchase of stolen goods.

210
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:25,820
His defense team will flat out deny
all charges and try to hide the evidence.

211
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,030
So we need to hurry.

212
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:31,560
I will catch Mr. Kim and
Yonggu Lee with my bare hands

213
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,560
for their offense against Chief Noh
and for staining our team's honor.

214
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,950
Your sporadic outbursts
can be seen as signs of illness.

215
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,000
Did I exaggerate a little too much?

216
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,550
We're lacking in manpower, so let's not
divide into teams and all work together.

217
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,870
We'll end the meeting here.

218
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,910
Chief.

219
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,970
Can I have a moment?

220
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,660
Drink up.

221
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,620
Okay.

222
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,650
Um, Chief? I...

223
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,780
I know what it is
you want to say to me.

224
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,030
I saw you and Bumsang together
in the hospital yesterday.

225
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,890
I regret that I didn't accept
your feelings when I had the chance.

226
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:47,930
I really hope everything works out well
between you two. I really do.

227
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,840
Thank you.

228
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,870
I'll be going then.

229
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,610
It's so hot.
I'm being steamed here.

230
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:16,680
The investigations team should do
stakeouts. Why are they making us do it?

231
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,970
Don't you agree, Chief?

232
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:21,850
Who cares who's doing it?
As long as we get something out of it.

233
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,880
Yeah, yeah. I shouldn't have
expected any sympathy from you.

234
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:31,820
Why did Sangho suddenly go to a training
seminar? When's he coming back?

235
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,770
It'll be a while. I'll stick with you
until he comes back, so don't worry.

236
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:42,030
You will?
There's no need.

237
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:46,550
I'm deeply honored that
you're here with me today.

238
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,730
I can handle this on my own.
I'll fly solo.

239
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,030
Isn't that Iwazaki?

240
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,940
He's the Japanese dude
who was with Chairman Jang last time!

241
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,000
Why is he here again?

242
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,020
I can smell the stink from here.

243
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,780
Welcome, Chairman Iwazaki.

244
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,730
“Good afternoon, Chairman Jang.”

245
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,040
Please have a seat.

246
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,740
Forgive me for asking you
to come all the way to my home.

247
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,980
He says it's fine.

248
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,650
I imagine you were very upset because
of the disgraceful affair last time.

249
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,760
I thought maybe you refused my gift
because it was not up to your standards

250
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,630
so I prepared something
more valuable. Show him.

251
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,750
Yes, sir.

252
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:30,590
The “Geumdongdae” incense burner.
One of my most cherished items.

253
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,680
Do you like it?

254
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,970
I love it.
Thank you so much.

255
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:50,990
Considering the relationship between
our companies, this gift is not enough.

256
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,800
Chairman Jang, may I ask
an impertinent favor of you?

257
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:11,800
If it's for you, I will do
everything in my power to help you.

258
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,670
Recently, I bought
a lot of Goryeo celadon.

259
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:36,030
I need to take it to Japan but Korea's
Cultural Properties Protection Act is...

260
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:41,750
Ah, there's nothing to worry about.
I happen to know a good way to help you.

261
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:47,780
God, this is frustrating. I told you I don't
even know what Taesoo Heo looks like.

262
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,970
How can you falsely accuse me of
killing him when I don't even know him?

263
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:54,930
What?
I'm gonna kick your...

264
00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:01,870
Think you'll get away with spewing lies?
Gyoon already told us everything.

265
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:08,700
Mr. Kim received orders from Chairman
Jang, and those orders passed onto you.

266
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,970
You gonna keep lying like this?

267
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:11,040
Hey, Dongpal.

268
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:16,550
You were part of the Makddae Family
that managed the Hwangjae Nightclub

269
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,810
seven years ago?

270
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:24,720
Take a good look at this.
Taesoo Heo had this on him.

271
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:31,730
See this here? Hwangjae Nightclub.
You saw Heo there, didn't you?

272
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,910
Man, I really don't know him.

273
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,800
What does Heo coming to
the nightclub have to do with me?

274
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:45,920
Stop making wild guesses and
do the interrogation properly, will you?

275
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,820
Come here.
Not coming? Get over here.

276
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:54,730
Leave the room.

277
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,850
We need to teach
bastards like him a lesson.

278
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,980
You'll get into trouble. The world doesn't
work like that anymore. Calm down.

279
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,860
I'm going to get some water.

280
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,830
- Hey, Chohee.
- Hello.

281
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,940
Hey. You're here to see Gyoon?

282
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,590
I just met him.
It's hot. Here you go.

283
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:18,900
Dongpal Kim is being uncooperative?

284
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,840
Tell me about it. He's a tough nut
to crack. Keeps denying everything!

285
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,660
Oh, that's refreshing.

286
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,000
This is...

287
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:40,600
Truthfully, it's a business card
that was found on your father.

288
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,940
We held onto it because we thought
it would help with the investigation.

289
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,030
Sorry we didn't tell you earlier, Chohee.

290
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:52,590
Don't be. You don't have to
tell me such things.

291
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,920
Excuse me, but I have
to get going. Goodbye.

292
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,710
Chohee.

293
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,030
What's with her?

294
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,880
Dunno.

[Hwangjae Nightclub
Mister Oh]

296
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,750
So we have writing on thin silk paper.

297
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:49,760
Yes. It's so contaminated we have to
clean it, but we can't use warm water.

298
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,820
In a case like this, the heart of the piece
can be ruined if not done with care.

299
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,720
If possible, the lining paper
should be kept while restoring.

300
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,790
It should be easy if you layer
repeatedly using neutral paper

301
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:04,810
while watching the
progress with each step.

302
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,860
Nothing's difficult for you, is it?

303
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:11,850
Glad to be of help. Is that all?

304
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:13,760
Sir!

305
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,690
Yes?

306
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:20,780
If you're free this evening,
I'd like to buy you a cup of coffee.

307
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,970
What? Well...

I'm sorry, but it seems my girlfriend
is already checking up on me.

310
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,840
If I'm caught having coffee,
I won't escape unscathed.

311
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,700
You know how Chohee is.

312
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,620
Yeah?

313
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:53,860

Yes.

316
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,740
We heard he worked here
seven years ago.

317
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,880
I'm not sure.

318
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:07,550
Manager Park! Did a waiter named
Mister Oh work here seven years ago?

319
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,770
Mister Oh?

320
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,800
You're talking about Changsu.

Changsu Oh?

322
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,020
Yes, but he's not here right now.
He went on vacation starting yesterday.

323
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,940
When will he be back?

324
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,890
I have no idea.

325
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:25,030
What do you mean?
How can you not know?

326
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,930
Truth is, the day before yesterday
some men came looking for him.

327
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,810
He left with them after exchanging words.
Then he went on vacation yesterday.

328

Why does everyone like Chohee?

329
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,910
You startled me! Chief!

Where's Chief Noh?

331
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,570
What? He'll be in soon.

332
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,770
Yeah?

The statement with
Chairman Jang's illegal deals.

336
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,700
Most were done under someone else's
name, so it was hard to sort through.

337
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:17,970
Chief, why are you so anxious
to arrest Chairman Jang?

00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,710
What?

00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,810
Is it because you want to help Chohee?

340
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:32,790
I see. I knew it.

341
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:37,630
That's the reason why
our entire team wants to get him.

342
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,000
That's the biggest reason,
but I have another reason.

343
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,810
I made a promise with my daughter.

344
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:50,870
I'll arrest wrongdoers and
will never lock up the innocent.

345
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:55,960
But it isn't easy
keeping that simple promise.

346
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:05,710
If only we had Chief Noh's necktie clip,
things would be easier. What a loss.

347
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,900
A necktie clip?

348
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:13,950
Yeah. It had a camera
built into it. If we had that...

349
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,970
Chief! You're wearing ties
more and more these days.

350
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,620
Does it look bad?

351
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,740
Then that was a hidden camera?

352
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,820
Dongpal Kim isn't spilling anything.

353
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:32,820
Mr. Nah, was Iwazaki carrying anything
when he left Chairman Jang's house?

354
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,800
No, I don't think so.

355
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:40,920
He was all smiles and
in a great mood when he was leaving.

356
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,980
There's definitely something
going on between those two.

357
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:48,020
Mr. Nah, please
watch Iwazaki a bit longer.

358
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,660
And let's wait a bit on Dongpal.

359
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,910
Hey, Chohee.

360
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:02,840
[Chief, we have to look for Changsu Oh
from the Hwangjae Nightclub.]

361
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,660
Changsu Oh?

362
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:15,030
Boss, where do you think
they're taking us?

363
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:22,560
I think Chairman Jang
wants to knock us off.

364
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,700
Knock us off? Knock?

365
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,920
No, no. I can't die.
I can't die!

366
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:36,810
I can't die now.
I wanna live.

367
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:39,770
It's okay, Yonggu.
Get a grip.

368
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:44,900
We'll figure something out.

369
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,860
You're Changsu Oh, the guy
who took care of Taesoo Heo, right?

370
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:05,970
We're all in the same boat here,
so why don't you stop staring daggers?

371
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,850
Let's join forces.

372
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:28,730
Officer Cho.

373
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,770
It seems Chohee hit a mark.

374
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,890
What?

375
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,720
This Changsu Oh character
is extremely suspicious.

376
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,830
Not only did he work alongside
Dongpal in the Makddae Family

377
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:49,730
they were also buddies
in the army and in prison.

378
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,850
Is that so?

379
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,900
Eat.

380
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,620
Eat up, punk.

381
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:18,680
This will be the last meal of noodles
you'll have if you go to prison for murder.

382
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,730
What are you talking about?

383
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:36,750
You know Changsu, right?
Your gang buddy.

384
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,700
He told us that you were
the one who took care of Taesoo Heo.

385
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,640
W-w-what?

386
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:50,870
Changsu Oh said that?
I can't believe this.

387
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:55,970
You know that Changsu's not exactly
smart but he's not the type to lie.

388
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:01,770
So tell me every detail on who, what,
when, where, why and how you did it.

389
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,760
I really didn't do it!

390
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,020
Then spill it.
If it's not you, who?

391
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,850
It's not me.

392
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,720
Was it Mr. Kim?

393
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,740
Yes or no?

394
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:23,720
It wasn't me and
it wasn't my boss either.

395
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,880
It was Changsu Oh who did it!

396
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,740
He did it?

397
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,690
Drag them out.

398
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:39,650
Yes, sir.

399
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,590
Where did they go?

400
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:21,880
Are they gone?

401
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,020
They're gone.

402
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,840
Where are we?

403
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:33,690
I saw a small amusement park while
running. It seems we're on Wolmi Island.

404
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:40,910
Wolmi Island? We were in there for
only an hour? I thought we traveled far.

405
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,710
You're quite useful.

406
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:54,970
I thought our gang only had idiots
like him, but we have someone like you.

407
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,910
How about working for me?

408
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,820
Let's go our separate ways.

409
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,940
Jeez, talk about lack of manners.
He ignored me.

410
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:14,740
Hey, why are you ignoring Boss,
you jerk! Right, Boss?

411
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,720
Isn't she back from
the investigations team yet?

412
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:36,880
Please send someone to work with me.
I'm dying here without Sangho.

413
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,780
I'll work on it, so be patient.

414
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,580
Bumsang, when did you get here?

415
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,880
You're back from a stakeout?

416
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,890
I'm dying here trying to tail
Iwazaki or whatever his name is.

417
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,980
Iwazaki is that guy from
the Robin Hood incident.

418
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:56,840
Yeah, I'm tailing him because him
and Chairman Jang are up to something.

419
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:03,550
But all they do is golf or eat out
or party with some ladies.

420
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:07,660
But he went to a pottery
exhibition today, didn't he?

421
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:12,840
Yeah, yeah. Thanks to that I feel
a little more learned myself.

422
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:16,990
I'll be going then. Good day.

423
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,710
Yeah, yeah.

424
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,910
Mr. Nah.

425
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,760
Where's Joohyun every day?

426
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,950
Where is it?

427
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:53,710
Lady, what are you looking for? There's
nothing worth money around here.

428
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,730
The thing is...
Just something.

429
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:05,600
You're in uniform - you're students -
Why aren't you in school?

430
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,920
Listen to her.
She's asking why we're not in school.

431
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:14,840
It seems you're a little confused.
Who are you to nag us?

432
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,870
No, I'm not nagging you.

433
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:25,710
We have stuff to do here.
Find what you're looking for and scram!

434
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,860
Think I'd leave just
‘cause you told me to?

435
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,660
Where is that necktie clip?

436
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,880
There you are.

437
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,650
Were you waiting for me?

438
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:05,710
Who else would I wait for?

439
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:10,720
Gyoon is being moved next week,
so I spent some time with him.

440
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,020
How's he doing?

441
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:18,740
Gyoon?
He gained weight.

442
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,840
That's not what I was asking.

443
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:23,780
Let's go eat.

444
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,800
Wait up.
In the cafeteria?

445
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,830
Yeah.

446
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:30,730
There is other food in this world
besides food in the cafeteria.

447
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:32,940
And who goes on
a date to the cafeteria?

448
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,040
We're going on a date right now?

449
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,770
Of course. Let's go out.
I'll buy you something good.

450
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:45,010
Sorry, but I'm joining the stakeout
in front of Changsu Oh's house tonight.

451
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,740
Stakeout?

452
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,670
Yeah.

453
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,770
What's with the sudden stakeout?

454
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:54,620
Let's just eat here today
and eat well next time, okay?

455
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,690
Just for today.

456
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:01,630
All right.
Hey, are you sulking again?

457
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:01,990
No, I'm not.

458
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,840
Looks like you are.

459
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,940
Hey, isn't that Chairman Jang?

460
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,550
Don't let them say otherwise.
And don't call them either.

461
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:26,860
Well, look who it is.
It's been a while.

462
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,610
Yes, it has, sir.
Have you been well?

463
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:35,800
Of course. What are
you doing here at the CHA?

464
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:43,570
Advisory member. I forgot.
You're lasting longer than I expected.

465
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,950
Thanks to you. What brings
a busy person like you to the CHA?

466
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:51,970
You really don't know?
I'm disappointed.

467
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,770
Don't the CHA employees know

468
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:57,640
I was appointed the chief director
of the Monuments Fund?

469
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:04,830
I'm here to see the director of the CHA
before I'm inaugurated into office.

470
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:12,910
Chairman Jang, do you think
you deserve to hold that position?

471
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,580
Hey!

472
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:20,650
I happen to think that no one loves
cultural assets as much as I do.

473
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:30,020
Of course you do. Perhaps that's why
you've forgotten how to value human life.

474
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,800
What are you talking about?

475
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:40,790
Drop the act.
You killed my father.

476
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,710
Chohee.

477
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,740
Do you understand
what she's talking about?

478
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,880
Chairman Jang, you killed my father.

479
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:58,780
You're quite impertinent.
Or perhaps you're just fearless?

480
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:04,890
Wait and see.
I'll lock you up myself.

481
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:12,990
I'll be waiting. But you should
watch your mouth and your back first.

482
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:29,000
They think they stand a chance
against me. What are the police up to?

483
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,940
Nothing out of the ordinary.
We've managed to plug up the leaks.

484
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,580
And Iwazaki?

485
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,550
Manager Kang is taking care of it.

486
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:41,870
The exhibition was officially held today
and everything's in order.

487
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:44,710
Professor Gong even wrote
a dedicatory letter for us.

488
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,940
Make sure no word of this gets out.

489
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,710
Yes, sir.

490
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:59,640
Maybe we're wasting our time here.

491
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,910
If Chairman Jang's men kidnapped
Changsu Oh, he's probably a dead man.

492
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:11,910
Dead or alive, it is our officer's code
to continue until we know for sure.

493
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:15,570
I've followed that code this far.
You know that.

494
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,920
Sure, like the time
you went off to meet Ms. Kim...

495
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:21,000
Jinguk, what is that?

496
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:25,750
Isn't that Chohee?

497
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,600
Oh, my poor heart.

498
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:34,650
Sorry I'm late.

499
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:38,770
No need for you to come. You have
a too strong sense of responsibility.

500
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:44,000
Aren't you two sleepy?
Get some shuteye. I'll stand guard.

501
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,940
No, it's okay. Seriously...

502
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:50,620
Well, if you insist.

503
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:55,610
Let's take turns.
Chohee, thanks.

504
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:56,550
Sure.

505
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:56,970
Thanks.

506
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:57,950
Yeah.

507
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,830
Are you serious?

508
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:11,700
If it's proven that Chairman Jang was
behind all that, it'll be a major headline.

509
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:15,810
Don't say a word until it is proven.
It'll cause big trouble if it leaks out.

510
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:21,790
All right. Chohee must be in a lot of pain.
Thinking about her dad and all.

511
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,790
Yeah.

512
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,760
By the way, take this.

513
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:27,920
What is it?

514
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:33,710
Jeez. Yongcheol wrote the review of some exhibition, and he bragged so much.

515
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:35,790
He left a copy for you, too.

516
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:37,760
He did?

517
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,870
This is...

518
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:42,990
Why? Did you go to this exhibition?

519
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,870
Not me, but the people at the CHA.

520
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,790
Something's off.

521
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:54,820
Huh?

522
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:00,610
Hey, I have to go check this out.
Sorry, but I have to go.

523
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:01,690
Sure.

524
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,690
What was that about?

525
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:16,920
The exhibition is over?

526
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:21,770
Yes. It was a special exhibition
held only yesterday.

527
00:46:21,970 --> 00:46:23,670
Why only one day?

528
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:27,570
I heard it's because the next exhibition
is scheduled to be in Japan.

529
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,600
Could I take a look at the pottery?

530
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:35,730
Didn't you see them on your way in?
They were being loaded into a truck.

[Ohseong Distributive Services]

532
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,650
Ohseong Distributive Services?

533
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,770
This is the pamphlet of
the exhibition Iwazaki attended.

534
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:57,670
You can tell that it's all a pretense.

535
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,560
A pretense?

536
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:03,700
On the outside, they look like regular pottery, but see the brush strokes?

537
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,960
I'm sure they were covered
with mud and disguised as pottery.

538
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,960
Why would someone do this?

539
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,760
To smuggle them abroad.

540
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,590
As you know well, cultural assets are
forbidden by law to leave the country.

541
00:47:17,590 --> 00:47:20,890
With one exception.
Unless the purpose is to be exhibited.

542
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:27,020
So Chairman Jang set up this exhibition
to help Iwazaki smuggle things out.

543
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:32,700
If not, why hold a special exhibition
for just a day and invite no one?

544
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:38,690
They're planning to legally carry things
out under the pretense of this exhibition.

545
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:43,980
The truck used belonged to Ohseong
Distributive Services. Start there.

546
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,800
No, we'll head straight to the airport.

547
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:47,980
The airport?

548
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:50,970
Iwazaki's flight is set to leave today.

549
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:55,670
Then everyone's headed to the airport?

550
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,990
Oh, okay.

551
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:00,750
Got it.

552
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,740
Then shouldn't we go back them up?

553
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:09,990
Right?

554
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:16,560
Since you have to catch Changsu Oh,
stay here. I'll go to the airport.

555
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:18,860
Yeah, that sounds good.

556
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:19,810
Be careful.

557
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:21,650
I will. Good luck.

558
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:31,940
It seems Chairman Jang had his guts
botoxed. He started some major stuff.

559
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:34,980
That man isn't afraid of anything.

560
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,760
Man, where is Changsu Oh?
There are no signs of him anywhere.

561
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,890
I'm sorry.

562
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,910

563
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,880
Okay, I understand. Yes...

564
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,680
Which airport?

565
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:06,860
I'm not sure, but it seems Iwazaki headed
towards Haneda Airport in Japan.

566
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,970
Then we should head to Kimpo Airport.

567
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:49,780
Officer Cho, I'm tailing Changsu Oh right
now. Opposite that house. Hurry. Okay...

Stop right there!

Where did he go?

570
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:34,930
I'm sure he came this way.

571
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:37,920
Isn't that him?

572
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:38,920

What is a cultural asset?

620
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:41,820
It connects our nation's
past, present and future.

621
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:45,660
It's an inheritance that holds
a great emotional value for us.

622
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:50,750
Therefore, we all have
the responsibility and right

623
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:57,810
to share, cherish, protect and love
this valuable cultural inheritance.

sacred items that cannot

625
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:08,760

possessed by a sole owner.

and Duryang Kim's “Sansu” painting?

00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:27,880
Is it impossible? I think the files are worth
those two items. Are you going to refuse?

I couldn't.
Fine, I'll give them to you.

Your items?

632
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:50,630
Cultural assets belong to the country, no?
Moreover, these are national treasures.

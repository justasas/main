1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:08,790
<i> Cultural assets and individuals in this
program have been altered fictionally.</i>

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,750
<i> They have no real-life
associations with this drama.</i>

3
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:19,730
Is this where we're having dinner?

4
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,520
<i> Episode 3</i>

5
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,310
I should've skipped lunch
for this grand dinner!

6
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:29,440
Though I'm undeserving, thank you
for giving me this opportunity.

7
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,340
I will do my best to protect
our nation's cultural assets.

8
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:41,680
And dinner's on me,
so please enjoy yourselves.

9
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,490
Whoa!

10
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,560
He's as generous
as the affluent air he exudes.

11
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,480
And he looks like he has a frank
and straightforward personality.

12
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,360
He looks better in person than on TV.

13
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,730
I thought
you said he looked like a fop.

14
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,780
Since when is a fop a bad thing?

15
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,370
Work isn't easy, is it?
Please enjoy yourself.

16
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,340
Please help yourself to more.

17
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,490
Joohyun,
let me pour you a drink.

18
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,450
Oh no,
I can't drink very well,

19
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,660
Just a little?

20
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,540
Just a little.

21
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:37,350
Just a bit more. More, more.

22
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,590
Oh, it's overflowing.

23
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,310
Thank you.

24
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,770
Chohee, would you like a drink?

25
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,710
If you insist. I really want just a little.

26
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:04,440
So, how did you manage to find
Kyeomjae's “Naegeumgang”?

27
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,400
What?

28
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,310
I mean, we couldn't even find it,
yet you found it so easily.

29
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,580
He did, didn't he?

30
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,630
Why are you asking... Oh, that's true.

31
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,310
What happened was...

32
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,660
A few days ago a man came to me
with a painting to appraise.

33
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,680
But something seemed
awfully fishy about it.

34
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,560
Is this a stolen painting?

35
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,750
Gosh, darnit. How'd you know?

36
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:24,520
And that's when I called
Ms. Joohyun Wang here.

37
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,500
And that's why I insisted that...

38
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,360
...he absolutely must be
our committee member.

39
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,390
Good job.

40
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,580
Good work, good work!

41
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,450
Oh, you're done with your drink.

42
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:34,740
Yes.

43
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:41,460
Then you must've seen the thief's face.

44
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,620
Right.

45
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,400
Can you describe
his physical attributes to us?

46
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:55,750
Was he tall or short?

47
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,470
How was his build?

48
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,400
Was he, by any chance, bald?

49
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,530
The thing is,
he seemed to be in disguise...

50
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:10,360
So he must be the jerk that led us on
that wild goose chase at Mt. Jangyong.

51
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,470
Then we have to catch him!

52
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:18,650
I'll do more than catch him!
I'll break his little legs.

53
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,560
I'll cooperate with your investigation...

54
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,750
...so please don't worry
and have another drink.

55
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,680
Yes, another drink.

56
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,300
Let me fill you up.

57
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,720
So what ulterior motive do you have to becoming the committee member?

58
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,690
Why, are you nervous?

59
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,340
If you are, you're welcome to act as rudely as you did before.

60
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,370
“Bumsang Kim doesn't
deserve that position.”

61
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,690
I considered it but..

62
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,670
...why stop you when you volunteered to protect the cultural assets?

63
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,560
I should help you any way I can. Right?

64
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,560
Bumsang Kim, I welcome you to the Cultural Heritage Administration.

65
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:25,680
I don't know what you have up your sleeve, but I advise you to brace yourself.

66
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,680
Look here, about that...

67
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,720
why don't you listen to your own advice?

68
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,640
Stop picking petty fights with me.

69
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,370
You little...

70
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:42,690
Sir.

71
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:52,630
Oh my my,
look at the uncouth way she speaks.

72
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,480
Why does Chohee dislike you so much?

73
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:07,570
The truth is, in Japan...
Well, something happened.

74
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,350
What happened?

75
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,370
No, no. I don't think
I should be telling you.

76
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:21,380
Sir, it's okay.
You can tell me anything.

77
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:27,570
I can, right? The truth is...

78
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,320
What? She tried to seduce him
while completely naked?

79
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,420
She's totally crazy!

80
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,650
Is she out of her mind?

81
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,520
Do you realize whom we're talking about?

82
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,600
Chohee Heo,
the woman who does everything...

83
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,310
...and anything she can
to achieve her goals.

84
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,510
That's chump change to her.

85
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,480
No wonder.

86
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,330
After being rebuffed, she took it out on him in the Preservation Science Lab.

87
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,300
Still, how could she do that when she already lives together with a man?

88
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,360
Seriously!

89
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,710
What? Chohee lives with a man?

90
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,300
You didn't know? I heard he was yakuza.

91
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:24,460
Yakuza...
Somehow that doesn't seem to fit.

92
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,700
The rumors are
probably everywhere by now.

93
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,740
I hope she's thoroughly embarrassed.

94
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,480
You jerk. What's wrong with you?

95
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:51,560
There were already a ton of rumors about her anyway.

96
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,380
And I had to do it in order to
survive at the CHA.

97
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:05,470
I bet. Wow, this is a great room. Yongchul's probably green with envy.

98
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:07,440
Don't even mention that jerk.

99
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,700
If I think about how I lost the professorship to him...

100
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,540
I have to succeed here
if only to squash his ego.

101
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:17,580
I'm going to become the director, no,...

102
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:21,750
...the Minister of Culture,
and exact my revenge on him.

103
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,690
Bumsang...

104
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,720
Why? Don't think I can do it?

105
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,440
Look, the director of the CHA is...
calling me?

106
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,660
Yes, sir?

107
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,680
Chief, I seriously think he's the one who hid away the “Naegeumgang.”

108
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,320
You saw him yesterday,
all the crap he was spewing.

109
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,650
Everyone has skeletons in the closet.

110
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,540
One foot in heaven, one in hell.
That's how everyone is.

111
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,650
Chief!

112
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,600
Don't go around accusing a superior without any evidence, okay? Got it?

113
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:00,580
The director is here from the main office, and he wants to see you. Let's go.

114
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,440
What about?

115
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,390
Probably about the main family of the Kangheung branch of Lees.

116
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,450
We won't find out ‘til we go.

117
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:13,430
Your handwriting is amazing.

118
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,480
You balance the discipline of the Chinese print and the independence of...

119
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,570
...the Chinese cursive handwriting well in your brush strokes.

120
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,560
Did you really write this yourself?

121
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,730
I'm embarrassed to admit yes.

122
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,680
It's wonderful.

123
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,710
Really?

124
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,540
Come in.

125
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,720
This is the head investigator...

126
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,510
...for the robbery case of the main family of the Kangheung branch of Lees.

127
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,530
Wait, aren't you the employee
who caused trouble last time?

128
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:04,470
Since it's a family matter of mine, I was going to personally ask for help, but...

129
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,450
Chief Noh, can't you go
instead of this employee?

130
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,580
But I have to prep for the National Assembly's inspection...

131
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,600
...of our administration with you.

132
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,580
Then whom can I trust with this endeavor?

133
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,680
I will help you.

134
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,670
You will?

135
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,460
If I can help in any way with my lacking
services, I will try my best.

136
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:33,700
I'm impressed, Mr. Kim. Then I will entrust the matter to you.

137
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,600
But someone should still go with you...

138
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,320
I will go with him.

139
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,310
It's only natural that I should since we've already worked together in Japan.

140
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,630
And I would like this opportunity to make up for my mistake last time.

141
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,750
It's impressive that you are going
to the crime scene yourself.

142
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,770
We've never had a committee member like you before.

143
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:08,530
Please, you flatter me too much.

144
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,460
I need to familiarize myself...

145
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,340
...with crime scenes as well as
learn the ropes of the trade.

146
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:18,530
Will you be okay going with Chohee?

147
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:23,700
Yes, that worries me a bit. It would be great if I were going with you instead.

148
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,610
Should I request a change in partners?

149
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,400
What are you saying?

150
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,480
We have to go check out the robbery at Congressman Junpil Lee's house.

151
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,620
Congressman Junpil Lee?

152
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,340
Congressman Junpil Lee,
three-time Congressman...

153
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,440
...and chairman of the National
Assembly's Cultural Assets Bureau.

154
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,390
‘It would be great if I could make an appearance there as well.'

155
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,310
Too bad you can't go.

156
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,750
You should chase
just one rabbit at a time.

157
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,500
She speaks absolute rubbish sometimes.

158
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,520
Shall we?

159
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:04,780
We shall. I'll see you later.

160
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,590
What an impressive fellow.

161
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,710
Doesn't it look like
Chohee hasn't given up on him yet?

162
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,770
That's what I'm saying.

163
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:22,790
I should have gone with him.
Did you see how he wanted me?

164
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:28,770
Jiyoung, how can you say that?
Of course I miss you, too.

165
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,620
Yes, let's meet up next week.
I'll call you. Okay.

166
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,470
Hello, Yeonju. How have you been?
I waited for your call.

167
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:47,710
Hello? Hello? Ah, my battery
died at this critical moment.

168
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,710
Let me borrow your phone for one call.

169
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,430
Never mind.

170
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:03,600
You're so busy. What with Jungeun, Minju, Youngju, Soyoung...

171
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,770
I never knew you were an expert appraiser of women as well.

172
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:10,600
Why, are you interested in being appraised by me?

173
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,570
Heck no.

174
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:16,350
Why refuse? You're the one who's following me around.

175
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,620
Think what you want...

176
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,590
...but I want to make sure you don't dupe anyone like with the cat's food bowl.

177
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,470
What are you doing?

178
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,450
Are you okay?
I forgot to tell you.

179
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:34,370
I'm not the expert women appraiser.
My car is.

180
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,350
He does this whenever
a wretched woman rides.

181
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,350
He bucks like a wild bronco.

182
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,400
What did you say?

183
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,390
What's important in pottery
is the base of the piece...

184
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,440
...and in paintings the artist's seal.

185
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,380
When it comes to women, they should be kind or at least not speak crudely.

186
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,590
You are impossible to appraise.

187
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,760
You should to work on that.
Maybe pay the doctor a visit.

188
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:03,300
What? In my opinion, you should be
the one seeing a doctor.

189
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,450
What's your mental age?
You're such a schoolboy. So immature.

190
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,400
Let's stop the bickering,
you schoolgirl...

191
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:11,670
Say what?

192
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,400
Over here, too, please.

193
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:15,710
Okay.

194
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,460
He has a lot of old books.

195
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:33,730
At 08:47. I'll give you a call
as soon as it's verified. Okay.

196
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,550
Chief Kang.

197
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,360
Yes?

198
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,490
Chief, about the main family
of the Kangheung Lees..

199
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,630
Seeing how Bumsang was sent down, the losses must be serious.

200
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:48,680
Shouldn't we go, too?

201
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,360
We can't go anywhere...

202
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,410
...until the Congressman shows up to confirm his losses.

203
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,340
We have to wait.

204
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,550
How long do you think
we'll have to wait?

205
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,590
He'll be here soon, right? He has to.

206
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,330
Joohyun, what's up? Are you interested in Bumsang Kim?

207
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:06,300
What?

208
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,570
Oh, I'm not the one who's interested. He's interested in me.

209
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:14,410
What?

210
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,660
Why else would he agree to be
the committee member...

211
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,670
...after refusing multiple times?

212
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:26,460
I should have known when he called me about the “Naegeumgang.”

213
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:32,470
He said earlier that he really wanted to go with me.

214
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:41,320
I hope the Congressman shows up before lunchtime.

215
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,580
Is she being cute or
is she really that clueless?

216
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,370
Congressman, sir.
What items did you lose...

217
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,440
What do you mean nothing was stolen?

218
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,690
In other words, all the important
cultural assets are still here.

219
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:09,480
The rest we'll have to sort out,
one by one.

220
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:16,460
What an unfortunate thief. It's not an easy feat to steal only useless things.

221
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:23,550
That's strange. Let's compile a list of the damages.

222
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:27,790
The furniture and pottery are intact...

223
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:31,300
...but what do we do about the old books? There are tons.

224
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,390
Are there?

225
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,750
I'm not sorting through them. Looking at Chinese characters gives me headaches.

226
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:51,330
There's nothing to fear.
Bumsang Kim is here.

227
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,670
Sir?

228
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,720
You want me to sort through
all these books?

229
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,710
What happened to familiarizing yourself with crime scenes...

230
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,740
...as well as learning the ropes of the trade?

231
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,700
I think this is
a great opportunity for just that.

232
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,740
And if you filch anything, you're dead.

233
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,520
We're so incompetent
in Chinese characters...

234
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,630
...that it'll take us months to do it.

235
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,400
We sure are glad you're here with us, sir.

236
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,670
God's going to bless you.

237
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,460
For sure.
He's gonna do more than bless him.

238
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:18,710
So she's gonna pull one over me like this? How am I going to finish all this?

239
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,560
Something like this has never happened in our village before.

240
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,400
You must be in shock.

241
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,630
I can't even begin to describe
how I feel...

242
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,540
...but thankfully I won't be ashamed in front of our ancestors.

243
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:41,470
Yes, we should be glad that
no one was hurt. Then we'll be going.

244
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,530
Hold on.

245
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,510
Are you by any chance
Mr. Bumsang Kim?

246
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,610
Yes, I am.

247
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:05,730
It is you! Don't you remember me?
You took a look at my book at the CHA.

248
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,410
Ah, yes, yes. I remember.

249
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,620
It's you, it's you.

250
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:17,790
Fellas, this is the amazing guy
I was telling you about. Come here.

251
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:26,680
Sirs, may I ask you a question?

252
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,300
Shoot.

253
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,440
Ask anything you want.

254
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,370
Testing, testing.

255
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,620
As descendants of Hyunro Lee of
the Kangheung branch...

256
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:42,300
...there's no way the thief is one of us.

257
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,690
I sincerely beseech you,
as village leader,...

258
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:50,440
...to find that disgraceful thief and restore our good name.

259
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:00,790
Ah, so you didn't witness the crime?

260
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:06,350
If I saw him, I would've done something about it. Beat him down with a stick.

261
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,300
Ah, yes. Have you seen any strangers around the village?

262
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:19,720
Strangers? There's a stranger now.

263
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,770
Chief.

264
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,470
Huh.

265
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,660
What's with the sudden rain?

266
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,350
Beats me.
What brings you here?

267
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,700
Oh, Joohyun insisted persistently
that we come.

268
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,310
Don't you have an umbrella?

269
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,780
No umbrella.

270
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:42,450
Ack, it's cold.
Where's Bumsang...

271
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:43,750
Why would she want to come here?

272
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,430
I think she's interested in Bumsang.

273
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:47,710
What?

274
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,720
Where is he, by the way?

275
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,530
He's probably sweating it right now, cataloging the old books.

276
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,570
Look here.
That is the character for “uniform.”

277
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:08,510
No, it's not. Use your bifocal glasses.
This character means “to cross.”

278
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:13,320
You need another brush stroke here for it to mean “to cross.”

279
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,420
Adding that brush stroke would give you “to resume.”

280
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,410
You're back. They're almost done,
wait just a bit more.

281
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:25,320
Then is it “to resume?”

282
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:25,790
It is, I tell you.

283
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,570
It shouldn't have that brush stroke.

284
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,370
Listen, listen.

285
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,390
Here, here.

286
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,470
We're leaving.

287
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:42,350
It's is indeed difficult to determine who's superior. You're all so knowledgeable.

288
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,640
Please take care.

289
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,630
That's a great talent of yours.
You were born wily, weren't you?

290
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:06,690
I'm not wily.
I have wisdom from experience.

291
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,790
Anyway, was anything missing?

292
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,420
Just one.
The “Myungshimbogam.”

293
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,320
What I don't understand is...

294
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,490
...why steal a common book like
the “Myungshimbogam?”

295
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:26,320
Exactly.

296
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,430
The dead dog was probably worth more. He should have just taken the dog.

297
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,380
Maybe it's an amateur who knows little about cultural assets?

298
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,590
But isn't it strange? He tore off the door and killed the dog.

299
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,400
It seems awfully premeditated,
doesn't it?

300
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,370
By the way, what was missing from Congressman Lee's house?

301
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,710
He's a famous collector.

302
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:49,420
That's the funny part. A thief came in, but apparently nothing's missing.

303
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,740
Maybe the Congressman purchased
a stolen good and had that stolen?

304
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:56,550
He is, after all, a politician.

305
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,340
It wouldn't be worth the trouble...

306
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,720
...being charged with the concealment
of stolen goods.

307
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,360
That's probably why he claimed
that nothing was missing.

308
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,580
I'm on the same page as you, but what can we do? He insists nothing is missing.

309
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,580
We can't go looking for an item
when we don't know what it is.

310
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:13,460
Would you happen to know?

311
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,640
What? How would I...

312
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,560
You're quite familiar with this kind
of thing, the back alley stuff.

313
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,630
Me? Dear no, I'm an appraiser.

314
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,750
How would I know about
the circulation of stolen items?

315
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,410
Is that so?

316
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:34,650
Excuse me.

317
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,430
Please enjoy yourselves.

318
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,750
He's a gem all right.

319
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:48,480
It must be quite a hassle to be a thief.

320
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,550
You'd have to study up on
what's valuable.

321
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,640
Just be glad that thieves these days
are stupid.

322
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,480
If we had more men like Mr. Kim and “General Shovel,” we'd be in trouble.

323
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,360
I've heard of Mr. Kim,
but who is this “General Shovel?”

324
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,310
A famous art thief well educated in Chinese literature...

325
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,620
...as well as topographic divination.

326
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,670
It was said that if his trail of conquests had been followed properly...

327
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:12,460
...our country's archeological history would have turned out differently.

328
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,760
Oh, the man who cleaned out Kyungju, Buyeo and even Gongju?

329
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,750
Yes, him.

330
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,640
Chief Noh caught him
a couple of times...

331
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,690
...but he dropped off the radar
for the past few years.

332
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:32,660
There's a rumor that he's dead,
but no one's sure.

333
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:37,540
Thank you for the meal.

334
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,760
Why aren't you eating more?

335
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,650
I ate plenty. Excuse me.

336
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:51,450
Is it morning sickness?
Why isn't she eating?

337
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,390
Is Chohee pregnant?

338
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:15,760
Dad, Dad! Dad,
where are you going? Where?

339
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,360
Oh, Chohee.

340
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,630
You're not going to steal again, are you?
Are you?

341
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,510
You told me you quit. You said
you were never going to steal again!

342
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,580
This is the last run. The last one.

343
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:38,530
Dad, you can't. You can't do this.
I don't need to go to college.

344
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:44,790
I'll work more part-time jobs. So please don't go, Dad. Please don't go.

345
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,560
I'll be back.

346
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,560
Dad, Dad!

347
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,470
Dad!

348
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:16,790
What is she doing? Why'd she wander into that isolated area?

349
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:24,780
Sir, won't you be bored while driving back? I was thinking of riding with you...

350
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,360
Well, then I'm saved from boredom, aren't I?

351
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:27,720
Right?

352
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,510
Let's go.

353
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:28,750
Okay.

354
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:44,610
No, Jiyoon, I really will be home
early today.

355
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,470
Ice cream? Want me to buy some? Strawberry?

356
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,630
Huh? Okay.

357
00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:01,350
All right. I really, really love you, too.
Okay.

358
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,640
Chohee, when did you get here?

359
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:16,680
Just now. Chief, you're a great dad.

360
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:25,720
Me? Far from it. I always go home late,
I don't play with her. I fail as a dad.

361
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,490
So what brings you here?

362
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,470
Ah, I was told Mr. Kim's trial is today.

363
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:34,450
Oh, didn't you hear?
The trial was moved to eleven.

364
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:34,720
What?

365
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,710
Aw, man.

366
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,340
You're already late,
nothing you can do.

367
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,500
Let's go, I'll buy you something to eat. What do you want?

368
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,780
I... Anything's fine with me.

369
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:53,590
Anything's fine?
I can't just buy you anything.

370
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,670
What shall we eat?

371
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,770
Hold on.
Yeah, Officer Park. What?

372
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:03,470
What?

373
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,750
What happened?

374
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:17,300
Due to insufficient evidence.

375
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,660
No doubt the filthy rich men who deal with Mr. Kim pulled some strings.

376
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,460
Chief, there he comes.

377
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,650
Sir, congratulations on being acquitted.

378
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:42,620
I enjoyed my stay in jail, thanks for that.

379
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,460
But unfortunately for you,
I'm already out.

380
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,530
Enjoy your freedom
while you can, Mr. Hyukjoong Kim.

381
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:52,520
You'll be back in there
before you know it.

382
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:59,630
And who is this lady?
Oh, the famous Ms. Fake Hanako?

383
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:08,310
So the CHA's hiring based on looks now?

384
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,340
I don't know
who's pulling strings for you...

385
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:15,450
...but it'll be in your best interest
to lay low.

386
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:19,330
I'll keep that in mind.

387
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:33,350
Sir, we've got a shadow on our tail.

388
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:41,370
Leave them be. Let them waste some more gas. We'll shake them off later.

389
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:44,460
They gave you a hard time.
Should we go teach them a lesson?

390
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,520
No good, it might affect the big deal.

391
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,570
We can always take care of
the small fry later.

392
00:31:52,740 --> 00:32:01,400
So who's the guy who tricked Yonggu Lee into giving up the “Naegeumgang?”

393
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,540
A pretty famous guy
named Bumsang Kim.

394
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:10,640
Bumsang Kim? It was him, you say?

395
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:21,310
The national hero. You're quite popular. Just like a celebrity.

396
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:25,370
Not you, too. You know
I don't care about that sort of thing.

397
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:30,320
I don't like it when other women
throw themselves at you.

398
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,760
So what? You know
that you're the only one for me...

399
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,350
Really?

400
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:35,640
No.

401
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,370
Meanie.

402
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,350
Come here.

403
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,680
Bumsang, hey.

404
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:50,670
That was the host of “Discovering Cultural Assets,” right?

405
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:57,350
She's as plastic as the rumors say she is.

406
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,530
What were you two up to?

407
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,630
Nothing. Is this it?

408
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,450
Yeah.

409
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:15,580
By the way, don't you think
you're being awfully shameless?

410
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,370
How can you become
a CHA committee member...

411
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,550
...after pulling that stunt with
the “Naegeumgang?”

412
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,720
Hey, watch what you say.
Someone'll hear you.

413
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,390
You know Congressman Lee, right?

414
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,590
Congressman Junpil Lee?

415
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,490
Ever hear of an item that went into
that house on the down-low?

416
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:39,330
Tons. He practically feeds everyone in the black market. What's up?

417
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:44,660
He had a huge catch stolen, but he denies it. Got any ideas?

418
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,430
A huge catch, you say?

419
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:53,470
There is a pretty tremendous catch
that comes to mind.

420
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:54,640
What is it?

421
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:56,740
Can't tell you for free.

422
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,360
Free? I set up
your television appearance.

423
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:05,690
Fine, fine. The item is...

424
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,720
Really? That exists in real life?

425
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:21,310
Yup. Congressman Lee's
a real fanatic of Prince Ahnpyeong.

426
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,480
I'm sure about this one.

427
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,420
Please standby.
Recording will start soon.

428
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:31,760
Oh, I'm nervous. ‘Cause this is
my first TV appearance.

429
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,620
I should have gone to
the congressman's home yesterday.

430
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,540
I chased the wrong rabbit.

431
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,390
That's my seat. You're over here.

432
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:47,330
Someone from the investigations team is tailing Mr. Kim.

433
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,630
As for the Kangheung family case...

434
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,400
...we're planning to sort through well-known thieves...

435
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,700
...of rare books for suspects.

436
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,360
And I'm going to go to Congressman Lee's house later.

437
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,730
Hey! The congressman recanted his theft report. Why are you going there?

438
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:03,330
Shouldn't we be investigating him
for the concealment of stolen goods?

439
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:06,690
Don't you know what that man's
capable of? Drop that case.

440
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,300
Chief...

441
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,330
You wanna turn the CHA upside down?

442
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:14,370
Digging around with no evidence
will get us all fired.

443
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:18,680
I know something's fishy, but there's nothing we can do. Back off.

444
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,300
Fine.

445
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,520
Big news, big news! Chohee, Chohee...

446
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,670
What about her?

447
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,500
She's pregnant.

448
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,610
Shut up! Shut up!

449
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,560
Who's the father?

450
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,770
Apparently, she doesn't even know.

451
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,520
Shut up! Shut up!

452
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:46,560
You don't think it might be
Bumsang Kim, do you?

453
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,470
No way. What do you take him for?

454
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:54,710
Didn't you hear that he rejected her even when she was seducing him butt-naked?

455
00:35:54,710 --> 00:36:01,750
You think that's true? He is a guy
after all. It's probably true, right?

456
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,390
I did what to whom?

457
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,760
Oh, Chohee.

458
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:17,420
I wanna hear everything you know.
All of it.

459
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,320
What can we say?

460
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:31,590
Bumsang Kim, you're dead meat.
I'm gonna kill you...

461
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,550
And I'm the art expert Bumsang Kim. Good night.

462
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:41,320
Cut. Good job.

463
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,750
Exit slowly. Starting from the back.

464
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,610
Honey, you're leaving?

465
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:50,370
Huh?

466
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:55,630
We should finish our conversation
from earlier.

467
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,570
What were we talking about?

468
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,640
Yoo-hoo. Bumsang?

469
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:10,530
Hey, what are you doing here?

470
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,710
What do you mean?

471
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:14,650
What are you doing with this woman after you knocked me up?

472
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,560
Wh ? what? Knocked up whom?

473
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,390
What are you babbling about?

474
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:25,600
Darling, who's this woman?

475
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,380
Didn't I tell you?

476
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:31,740
Is this Soyoung? Jungeun?
Fine, darling. I don't care.

477
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,430
But don't throw away
your child for this woman.

478
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,770
Hey, what the hell are you talking about?

479
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:44,690
You don't know? Don't you remember that hot, steamy night in Japan?

480
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,540
I'm pregnant due to that night.

481
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,690
What do you expect me to do
if you ignore me like this?

482
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,300
It's not true.

483
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,390
Honey...

484
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,550
Hey, it's really not true. Really.

485
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:58,540
You jerk. you dare to two-time me?

486
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,780
No, no, I tell you it's not true.

487
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:18,720
Are you insane? Why are you doing
this to me? What did I do to you?

488
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,730
Drop the innocent act.

489
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:23,720
I did what? I threw myself at you
while completely naked?

490
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:28,440
You're the insane one. How could you start a rumor like that?

491
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,570
It's not like it was a complete lie.

492
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:33,300
You did jump into the hot spring completely naked. Am I wrong?

493
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,680
What?

494
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,470
It's not my fault you have such a loose reputation that everyone believed it.

495
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,630
Rumors about you and Chief Noh and that you live with a man are...

496
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,710
...already rampant.

497
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:46,510
I can't believe this.

498
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:52,510
Fine, let's assume I do live loosely.
Why are you so self-righteous?

499
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,590
You tricked a man
out of his cat's food bowl.

500
00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:00,410
Why are you drudging up the past? Fine, so it wasn't just a cat's food bowl.

501
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,630
Was it such a sin
that I tried to sneak it out?

502
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,690
And you snuck
the “Naegeumgang” away, too.

503
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,440
Speaking of which...

504
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,570
...you had one long night in the mountains but eventually got it.

505
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,500
What are you so upset about? It's not like I sold it on the black market.

506
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,730
You were going to.
To Chairman Kim of the Dongsan Group.

507
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:15,350
That's not even funny.
I've never even met Chairman Kim.

508
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,400
Who do you think you're fooling?

509
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,620
Chairman Kim sent you
to Japan to get the vase.

510
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:21,310
You don't know anything.
It was Chairman Jang...

511
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:30,310
Oh yeah? Chairman Ohsung Jang
of the Ohsung Group?

512
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,610
Yeah, he did. So what?

513
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,590
I recorded the conversation.

514
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:39,620
What?

515
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:46,590
If you had just apologized,
I would have let bygones be bygones.

516
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,760
But it's too late.

517
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,350
Make sure to check out the front page
of the newspaper tomorrow.

518
00:39:54,430 --> 00:40:01,340
What the... Are you threatening me?
You think I'd shake in my boots?

519
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,610
It really made the front page.

520
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,650
Dear lord, how could he
be so shameless?

521
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,750
I know. And we hated on
Chohee for nothing.

522
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:18,400
I didn't know this was your true nature.

523
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,580
I'm so disappointed in you.

524
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,470
Me, too.

525
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:29,420
So you were the one who screwed us over with the “Naegeumgang?”

526
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,430
And you still agreed to
be the committee member?

527
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,440
How shameless.

528
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,320
Shall we teach him a lesson?

529
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,340
How about we start by snapping
his legs into two?

530
00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:43,310
Whoa, that's bad.

531
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:49,760
Thank you. Bumsang, you're dead.

532
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,380
- Hey, wait! Let's talk about this.
- What are you doing?

533
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,390
I have nothing to discuss with you.

534
00:40:55,390 --> 00:41:01,630
Let's compromise. I have
an incredible bit of information.

535
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,420
Don't need it, so back off.

536
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,650
Aren't you curious about the item Congressman Lee lost?

537
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:13,750
Not in the least, so will you stop already? Got it?

538
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:20,550
“Bihaedangjib.”
Written by Prince Ahnpyeong...

539
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:24,480
...one of the three great calligraphers
of the Joseon Era.

540
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,530
Aren't you intrigued?

541
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,730
Other than the “Mongyoodowondo” currently at Japan's Tenri University...

542
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:38,350
...and national treasure no. 238, “Sowon-
hwagyecheob,” which was stolen...

543
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:40,710
...there are no other intact authentic works written by Prince Ahnpyeong.

544
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:42,420
...You know this.

545
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:49,520
That means if this “Bihaedangjib” is authentic... Hey, hey!

546
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:04,610
Uncle. Uncle, where are you right now?

547
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:09,440
Was the “Bihaedangjib”
info a little too much for her?

548
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:18,640
Shoot, that's not the problem right now. What do I do about that recording...

549
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:24,720
There's no way she already
sold it to the press.

550
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,600
No, she's totally capable of doing that. And more.

551
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,400
“Bihaedangjib?”

552
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:40,640
The “Bihaedangjib” really surfaced?

553
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:48,720
Dad stole that, right? Tell me, Uncle.

554
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:56,770
Chief Noh. Does he know about this?

555
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,370
No. The theft report was recanted...

556
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:08,430
...so it's not even being investigated.
I didn't want to cause him any trouble.

557
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,430
So Uncle, you have to help me.

558
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,320
You're going to look for it by yourself?

559
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,620
I have to find it. Whatever it takes,
I have to find it.

560
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,580
Why?

561
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:35,520
‘Cause Dad stole it. The wrongs my thief father committed, I have to set right.

562
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,390
I have to be the one who finds it.

563
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:41,630
Do you think you'll find
some traces of your father...

564
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:47,700
...if you find the “Bihaedangjib?”

565
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,660
You're barking up the wrong tree, Uncle.

566
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:58,300
I don't want to find him at all. I don't care if he's dead or alive.

567
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:01,360
So stop worrying over nothing.

568
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,490
Chohee.

569
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:08,460
I'm sorry, I have to leave first.

570
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:38,790
Ah...

571
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:51,340
Huh, you're home? I cooked some noodles, want some?

572
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:55,360
No, you eat it all.

573
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,360
It's all overcooked.

574
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,530
Thanks. I was asking just to be polite.

575
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:08,300
Gyoon.

576
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:09,550
Yeah?

577
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:16,320
What if Dad... Dad...

578
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,670
Dad...

579
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:33,740
If you're asking if I miss him, then yes.

580
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:41,330
If you're asking if I think he's alive,
then the answer is no.

581
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:50,330
Uncle Hwang called.
An item Dad stole surfaced, right?

582
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:54,630
You know what?

583
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:58,470
I don't think...

584
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:02,620
...Dad's such a terrible person that he'd sever contact with us for seven years...

585
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,730
...if he were alive.

586
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:14,520
So don't go looking for him, okay?

587
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:17,340
Gyoon.

588
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:24,600
Instead, search out the items
that he stole.

589
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,540
After all, you're a member of
the regulations team. Right?

590
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,440
Do you want to find the “Bihaedangjib,” or do you want to find your father?

591
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,560
The wrongs my thief father committed...

592
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,460
...I have to set right.

593
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,600
I have to be the one who finds it.

594
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:23,680
[Bumsang Kim]

595
00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:27,490
Why is she ignoring my calls?

596
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:38,380
Wait, I mustn't show her
how desperate I am right now.

597
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:45,450
Be patient. Be patient.

598
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:50,330
Darnit, I can't! I'm going crazy.

599
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:52,430
[Bumsang Kim]

600
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,330
Bumsang Kim...

601
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:21,300
She ignored all my calls.
What is this woman up to?

602
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,300
Mr. Kim?

603
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:25,750
Ah...

604
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:31,740
Ah, Sunyoung. How are you?

605
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:35,440
How could you not visit me
at the Preservation Science Lab?

606
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,630
Of course I have to visit. I was planning to go see how you were doing.

607
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:42,660
So did you find out what the mysterious book we restored was?

608
00:48:42,660 --> 00:48:47,340
Not yet. But the book it was in is the “Myungshimbogam.”

609
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,490
“Myungshimbogam?”

610
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:54,460
Please call me anytime
when you find out what it is. I'm curious.

611
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:58,770
I can call you anytime?
Even late at night?

612
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:02,300
Of course.

613
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:05,600
But wouldn't Ms. Heo mind?

614
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,440
What?

615
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,540
I heard you two were getting married.

616
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,690
Married?

617
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:17,450
I probably shouldn't be saying this,
but I think you're being hasty.

618
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:23,370
Marriage is not something
you decide on a whim. Then, bye...

619
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:30,660
Wait...
This is absolutely preposterous.

620
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:35,570
So basically I just fell into the trap
that I dug for Chohee, right?

621
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,470
[Chohee Heo]

622
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:41,550
Hey, where are you!

623
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,440
Recording, where's the recording?

624
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:01,510
I can't just give it to you.
I have a condition.

625
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,770
What kind of condition?

626
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:06,740
Help me find the “Bihaedangjib.”
Then I'll give it to you.

627
00:50:06,740 --> 00:50:13,650
Dude, I practically handed it to you on
a silver platter. No way I'm helping you

628
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:15,340
No?

629
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,360
No.

630
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:22,680
Oh yeah? Too bad.
I wasn't going to call them...

631
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,390
Hello, is this the broadcasting station?

632
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:33,640
Fine, I'll help you.
What do you need me to do?

633
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,490
I want you to contact
all the middlemen...

634
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,660
...that you know
who specialize in rare books.

635
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:43,550
Why do you want me to do that?
You probably know more people.

636
00:50:43,550 --> 00:50:46,670
What middleman would willingly
help out the regulations team?

637
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,320
So you have to help.

638
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,760
I would if I knew any middlemen.

639
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:52,760
You don't know any?

640
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,730
None.

641
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,420
Really?

642
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,680
Of course not really.
I know lots. Put that away.

643
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:09,760
Prince Ahnpyeong's “Bihaedangjib.” Who filched it?

644
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,780
Put a pile of greens in my hand,
and I'll tell you.

645
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:17,550
Don't try to play me.
We both know how this game works.

646
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:24,600
Fine. Mr. Son in Insa-dong
can probably help you out.

647
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:31,580
I just came from him! You're useless.
Absolutely useless.

648
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,420
How am I supposed to know something that Mr. Son doesn't?

649
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:46,580
So the “Bihaedangjip” is in the open again, is it? Thanks for the tip.

650
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:53,650
What the... Hey, do I have to
continue this charade?

651
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:56,620
Of course. Next.

652
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:59,510
“Bihaedangjib?”

653
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:06,440
Never heard of it. While you're here,
can you appraise this for me?

654
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:11,380
Aw, man. Mr. Park.

655
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,560
That looks real familiar.

656
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,450
Why do you have that when you said
you quit this business?

657
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,590
Goodness...
Long time no see, Ms. Heo.

658
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:25,440
I have another engagement,
so gotta run. See you next time.

659
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,640
You pay for the coffee.

660
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:31,670
All right, onto the next player.

661
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:41,300
I'm serious.
That's the bottom of the barrel.

662
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,740
Quit lying through your teeth.
I'll release the recording.

663
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:52,690
Seriously... I really don't have any more. Why do you have to be like that?

664
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:54,510
Why do I have to be like what?

665
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:59,430
So, you absolutely refuse to dip into your secret stash?

666
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:02,660
Who gave you the tip about the “Bihaedangjib?” Was it Mr. Son?

667
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:11,420
Fine, we'll meet him tomorrow.
For now let's go eat. I'm starving. Okay?

668
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:14,490
Then we're going to do
this tomorrow, too?

669
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,340
Here are the files on Mr. Kim
that you requested.

670
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:42,540
Sorry for making you
come out all this way.

671
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,700
Why should you be sorry?

672
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,570
Chohee should be for dumping it to me instead of doing it herself.

673
00:53:49,770 --> 00:53:54,760
I wonder why she's so busy every day?
It's awfully suspicious.

674
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,720
This is your first stake-out, isn't it?

675
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:04,500
Stake-outs and spying are
Chohee's specialties.

676
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:07,450
Are you really mad that you had to
come here instead of Chohee?

677
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:14,340
Oh my, of course not.
It's all part of my job.

678
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:22,360
So how long do you have to do this?
It must be terribly boring.

679
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,550
Yeah, so how about a little drive?

680
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:26,790
What?

681
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:38,500
Ch-chief. How about
dropping me off first?

682
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:40,360
There's no time.

683
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:47,370
It's time to lose the shadow.
That persistent bastard.

684
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:48,660
Yes, sir.

685
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,790
Oh, gonna burn some rubber, huh?

686
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,570
Ch-chief?

687
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:00,540
What the! Why are you screaming?

688
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:06,320
Sl-slowly! Fifty miles per hour. You should keep the speed limit.

689
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:16,340
Ack, oh my god.

690
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:19,680
Joohyun, lift your head.
I can't see the sideview mirror.

691
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,710
Mommy!

692
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:36,580
Joohyun.

693
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,460
Hey, Joohyun.

694
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:10,380
Those suckers must be pissed about losing me. But the real game starts now.

695
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:14,370
What happened to the “Bihaedangjib?”

696
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,640
The first volume is already packaged...

697
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,670
...and we're still looking for
the second one.

698
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:25,640
If you screw up this time, you're done for. Life's too long to spend in pain.

699
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:26,750
Yes, sir.

700
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:37,550
D-day's almost here. Find the other volume as soon as possible, okay?

701
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:41,430
Don't worry, sir.

702
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:47,610
The “Bihaedangjib” has two volumes?

703
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:50,490
It was originally one.

704
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,430
But according to the book “Seollo Ilgi,”...

705
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:58,420
...Prince Ahnpyeong's tactician Hyunro Lee split it into two volumes...

706
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,700
...and hid them before his death.

707
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:05,620
Then there's another volume aside...

708
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:09,780
...from the one stolen from
Congressman Lee? Where's that one?

709
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,350
How should I know?

710
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:22,730
So why are you so hung up over this?

711
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:28,790
Do I need a reason
to search for a cultural asset?

712
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:33,460
Yes, if you're going to be hung up over something that's not an official mission.

713
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:38,490
Wasn't this case closed?
So why are you working your butt off?

714
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:49,310
Everyone at the CHA knows.
My goal is to be the next chief.

715
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,420
Chief?

716
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,740
If I want to up my performance rating...

717
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:56,440
...this is the kind of thing
I have to suffer through.

718
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:02,700
It's a reasonably persuasive reason. But why can't I believe a word of it? Huh?

719
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:12,640
Believe it. Stop talking nonsense
and eat. It's on me.

720
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:17,320
In case you've forgotten...

721
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:23,460
...I'm an expert appraiser. I separate
the real from the fake for a living.

722
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:30,470
And I say that everything you said just now is a complete lie. Not that I care.

723
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:35,570
Hey, hey.

724
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:36,420
What?

725
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,340
Say cheese.

726
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:38,730
What for?

727
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:43,450
You've got a whopper stuck in there.

728
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:44,490
What?

729
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:49,410
Ah, there's nothing there...

730
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:59,560
Ugh, why's it raining?

731
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:04,550
Hey, if we don't find the “Bihaedangjib,”...

732
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:06,460
...are you going to give
the recording to the press?

733
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,580
Need you ask?

734
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:20,760
Hey, at least I'm trying. Aren't I?
I'm trying my best. So don't be like that.

735
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,710
Ugh, you're creeping me out, Bumsang.

736
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:24,790
Hey!

737
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:30,310
So it's like that, huh?
You don't want to get fired?

738
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:34,420
So that's your goal? To get me fired?

739
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:38,690
I won't while we're looking for
the “Bihaedangjib,” so relax.

740
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:46,750
Let's meet up tomorrow at
Mr. Son's store at 10 am. Got it?

741
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:50,560
Don't be late. I'm off.

742
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:51,760
Hey...

743
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,340
What?

744
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:57,540
I can't stand seeing
a woman get wet in the rain.

745
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,670
Here, use this. See you tomorrow.

746
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:10,790
What's up with him? Is this his chivalrous act?

747
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:20,500
I should have known
you'd give me something like this.

748
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,660
Hello, Chief.

749
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:39,460
The Kangheung Lee family's village was robbed again? What's missing?

750
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:44,780
The “Myungshimbogam.”
That's it for today.

751
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,570
Thank you for your effort.

752
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:53,670
It's pretty clear that's the only book missing, so let's head back.

753
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,420
Yes, let's. We shouldn't be wasting time here when we've lost track of Mr. Kim.

754
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,590
It's so strange how the same book
keeps getting stolen.

755
01:01:02,590 --> 01:01:06,370
Let's leave after we find out if any other household still has their copy.

756
01:01:09,370 --> 01:01:11,660
You pouring salt on the wound?
How can you be so tactless...

757
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:12,750
...when you know
he's in a foul mood about Mr. Kim?

758
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,730
I'm in a foul mood, too.

759
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:17,750
I thought we'd be able to
kick back without Chief Noh...

760
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,540
...but here we are toiling away.

761
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,720
So how did he manage to lose Mr. Kim?

762
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:23,590
What?

763
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:29,480
It's weird. Chief Kang's not
the type to easily lose a suspect.

764
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:33,570
That's what I'm saying.
The thing is...

765
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:40,750
That Mr. Kim is a slippery fella.
You know how he is, how fast he is.

766
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:49,500
I'm sorry I can't join you, Chief. Yes, yes. Call me when you get back. Okay.

767
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,620
That's so strange.

768
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:56,430
Why does the “Myungshimbogam”
keep getting stolen?

769
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:05,570
[I'm already here. If you're even
a minute later, you're dead!]

770
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:11,670
Did I exploit the recording too much?

771
01:02:16,650 --> 01:02:22,540
As descendants of Hyunro Lee
of the Kangheung family branch...

772
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:31,680
As descendants of Hyunro Lee
of the Kangheung family branch...

773
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:36,730
Prince Ahnpyeong's tactician
Hyunro Lee split it into two volumes...

774
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:38,650
...and hid them before his death.

775
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:44,660
Hyunro Lee. Hyunro Lee?

776
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:52,350
Are you sure I'm not going to
end up a scapegoat?

777
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:56,730
Don't worry, I tell you. I've got your back.

778
01:02:58,490 --> 01:02:59,760
Hey! Why are you so late?

779
01:03:00,730 --> 01:03:06,540
Hey, Bumsang. You said that Hyunro Lee split the “Bihaedangjib” into two, right?

780
01:03:06,540 --> 01:03:08,620
He did, right? You're absolutely sure?

781
01:03:08,620 --> 01:03:10,770
Yes. Why do you want to know?

782
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:14,700
Hyunro Lee split
the “Bihaedangjib” into two.

783
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:18,460
The “Myungshimbogam” keeps going missing in the village...

784
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:20,460
...where Lee's descendants live.

785
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:22,430
What do you think this means?

786
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:26,740
Then the men who are stealing
the “Myungshimbogam” are after...

787
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,780
We have to hurry down
to the Kangheung village.

788
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:34,770
I have to check something.

789
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:36,790
There's no need.
We have to go to the CHA.

790
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:38,660
What are you talking about?

791
01:03:38,660 --> 01:03:41,390
Remember the book
I restored last time?

792
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,310
The day you got
the letter of appreciation?

793
01:03:43,310 --> 01:03:45,520
The pages were hidden in a copy of
the “Myungshimbogam.” Get in.

794
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,730
Chief, this is the only house
that wasn't robbed.

795
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:57,620
Sir, may we ask you some questions?

796
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:03,580
Why are you CHA fellas here again?

797
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:07,730
How did you know
we were from the CHA?

798
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:13,610
I distinctly rememberly
how you mistreated me.

799
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:16,770
Have you forgotten already?

800
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:20,320
Mistreated?

801
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:26,560
So what do you want? Is this about
the “Myungshimbogam” again?

802
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,660
And how did you know that?

803
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:33,750
How many times do I have to
repeat myself? It's at the CHA.

804
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:37,540
I keep telling you that it wasn't robbed...

805
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:41,570
...because it's safe at the CHA,
thanks to Mr. Bumsang Kim.

806
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:45,710
This is the first time we've heard this. What do you mean you keep telling us?

807
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:49,530
Goodness, are you pulling
an old man's leg?

808
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:55,530
You sent some men this morning, and they asked me questions about my copy.

809
01:04:55,530 --> 01:05:00,690
So why do you keep showing up
and asking the same questions?

810
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:07,300
Sir, wait a moment. A CHA employee came by? This morning?

811
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:07,630
Yes.

812
01:05:15,550 --> 01:05:17,540
They're not picking up at the Preservation Science Lab?

813
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,570
Yah, maybe they're out for lunch.

814
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:26,370
Yes, Chief. I was going to call you
and tell you something.

815
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:32,790
What? The men who stolen the books are targeting the CHA?

816
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:35,550
I'll give you the specifics later.

817
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:38,430
First check up on the book.
Hurry. Go to the CHA. Hurry.

818
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:52,330
Bumsang, how long
until we reach the CHA?

819
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:54,500
Ten minutes if you're willing to
pay the speeding ticket.

820
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,710
Okay, step on it.

821
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:17,700
No one's in?

822
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,550
Let's call security.

823
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:23,340
What's going on?

824
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:32,610
Yes, yes, I understand.

825
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:35,780
The museum sent someone.

826
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:39,460
Security at the museum will be tighter, so it'll be safe there.

827
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:44,750
Is this really an authentic work by Prince Ahnpyeong?

828
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:51,520
See this seal that reads “Cheongji?”

829
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:53,440
It's the penname
that Prince Ahnpyeong used.

830
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,760
It's definitely the “Bihaedangjib.”

831
01:06:55,410 --> 01:06:58,660
Oh my, then it'll be designated
a national treasure in no time.

832
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:01,370
To think I was the one who restored it...

833
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:11,760
Now that we've seen it,
we should get going.

834
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:17,600
Excuse me?

835
01:07:18,330 --> 01:07:19,500
How can I help you?

836
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:23,650
I'm from the museum.

837
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:24,600
Ah, yes.

838
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:26,680
Then, we'll be off.

839
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:38,430
Is the “Bihaedangjib” a family heirloom of yours? Why are you so deeply moved?

840
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:39,770
I'm not.

841
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:44,790
I saw everything.
You were on the verge of tears.

842
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:50,340
Where does this bottomless affection
for cultural assets come from?

843
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:54,690
What? Are you picking a fight again? Huh?

844
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:57,590
You're so clearly overreacting,

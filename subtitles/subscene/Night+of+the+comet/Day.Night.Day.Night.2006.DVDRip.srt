That's OK. though.

162
00:36:44,082 --> 00:36:46,534

in the toes of the shoes.

163
00:36:46,634 --> 00:36:48,643

Hold out your hand.

00:41:16,837 --> 00:41:18,789
Hold out your hand.

225
00:41:19,891 --> 00:41:21,809

226
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:24,109
No. it didn't hurt.

227
00:41:24,209 --> 00:41:26,129
What about that?

228
00:41:27,198 --> 00:41:29,448
What about that?

229
00:41:29,548 --> 00:41:31,047
- Did that hurt?
- No.

230
00:41:31,147 --> 00:41:32,614
- No. what?
- It didn't hurt.

231
00:41:32,714 --> 00:41:34,588
It didn't hurt. OK.

232
00:41:34,688 --> 00:41:40,060
That's all you're gonna feel. It's like...
like a bug bite. right? A mosquito bite.

233
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,272
You've been bitten by a mosquito.
It doesn't hurt. right?

234
00:41:47,518 --> 00:41:52,305
It's gonna be over so fast. you won't
have a chance to see or hear anything.

235
00:41:52,405 --> 00:41:56,019
- OK?
- OK.

236
00:43:28,219 --> 00:43:30,949
All right... just lift up. Thanks.

237
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:36,372
OK?

238
00:43:36,472 --> 00:43:38,485
- Thank you.
- OK.

239
00:43:40,298 --> 00:43:42,081
You OK?

240
00:43:42,181 --> 00:43:44,134
All right.
Watch your head.

241
00:43:48,139 --> 00:43:50,164
Keep going.

242
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:53,893
Keep going.

243
00:43:53,993 --> 00:43:56,897
- Thank you.
- Keep going.

244
00:43:56,997 --> 00:44:00,929
Step. Step.

245
00:44:01,029 --> 00:44:03,600
Step.

246
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,237
Step. Step.

247
00:44:07,337 --> 00:44:09,141
Step.

248
00:44:09,241 --> 00:44:18,535
Step. Step.

249
00:45:15,826 --> 00:45:18,043
Could you let us know what's going on?

250
00:45:18,143 --> 00:45:22,429
Yeah. we were just saying that this one
fits well. That this fits well.

251
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:29,696
- How's that?
- Good.

252
00:45:35,479 --> 00:45:38,107
We're just gonna shorten the straps a bit.

253
00:45:51,595 --> 00:45:55,531
We can add a strap around the waist
between these two straps here.

254
00:46:01,572 --> 00:46:04,491
It's up to her.
Would you like a strap around the waist?

255
00:46:04,591 --> 00:46:06,634
No. no. it's OK.

256
00:46:11,182 --> 00:46:14,049
Can you just walk back and forth?

257
00:46:18,456 --> 00:46:20,841
Yeah. That looks quite natural.

258
00:46:20,941 --> 00:46:24,383
She's pretty.
That's good. Walk a bit more.

259
00:46:27,932 --> 00:46:33,585
If you shift your weight a little bit forward.
it will help with your lower back.

260
00:46:33,685 --> 00:46:39,621
And you can also hook your hands up
underneath here.

261
00:46:39,721 --> 00:46:41,507
Good.

262
00:46:44,815 --> 00:46:48,182
- How's it feel? Is it too heavy?
- No. it's OK.

263
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:53,772
It's about 30 pounds.
but most of the weight is in the nails.

264
00:46:53,872 --> 00:46:58,295
- We can take some out if you like.
- No. you can put more in if you want.

265
00:47:12,309 --> 00:47:14,334

266
00:47:20,684 --> 00:47:22,709

267
00:47:47,845 --> 00:47:51,212
These don't work.
so you can wear them around your neck.

268
00:47:59,356 --> 00:48:03,074
It's very easy.
This switch locks it.

269
00:48:03,174 --> 00:48:07,080
And you just flip it to unlock it
and press this button.

270
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:12,282
- OK. It's this button here?
- That button. The other buttons don't work.

271
00:48:12,382 --> 00:48:15,187
You just flip it to unlock it
and press this button.

272
00:48:15,287 --> 00:48:18,400
Go ahead. try it.
It's not connected now.

273
00:48:20,878 --> 00:48:22,641
Try it a few more times.

274
00:48:32,156 --> 00:48:34,681
One more time before we connect it.

275
00:48:53,344 --> 00:48:56,359

276
00:48:56,459 --> 00:48:58,938

277
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,058
- Hi.
- Hi.

278
00:50:21,532 --> 00:50:23,693
It's a different color.

279
00:50:24,902 --> 00:50:28,497
The car - it's a different color.

280
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:57,667

281
00:52:13,343 --> 00:52:15,607
Thank you.

282
00:52:40,337 --> 00:52:42,362

283
00:52:53,951 --> 00:52:54,940
Thank you.

284
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:10,896

285
00:53:19,176 --> 00:53:22,077

286
00:53:24,214 --> 00:53:27,115

289
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:29,979
Thank you.

290
00:54:30,914 --> 00:54:32,461
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

291
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:34,608
- Thank you.

292
00:54:56,239 --> 00:54:58,207

293
00:55:07,217 --> 00:55:10,103
Excuse me.

294
00:55:10,203 --> 00:55:13,404
Straight up and make a left

295
00:55:13,504 --> 00:55:16,391

300
00:56:58,907 --> 00:57:00,487
OK.

301
00:57:03,233 --> 00:57:04,825
I'm sorry. I can't.

302
00:57:09,406 --> 00:57:11,738

303
00:57:20,183 --> 00:57:22,879

01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:40,801

313
01:03:57,514 --> 01:03:58,503

314
01:03:59,816 --> 01:04:02,410

315
01:04:04,354 --> 01:04:06,754

316
01:04:15,532 --> 01:04:17,022
Ooh!

317
01:04:17,532 --> 01:04:19,022
Are you alright?

318
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:24,167
- You need help?

319
01:04:24,532 --> 01:04:26,622
You OK?

320
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,905
Alright...
Be careful - your Walkman.

321
01:04:34,951 --> 01:04:37,215

322
01:05:24,667 --> 01:05:26,965
Julissa. can I use your phone?

323
01:05:31,908 --> 01:05:35,693
it's like.'Oh. she was so sweet.'

324
01:05:35,793 --> 01:05:41,099
I want all the flowers. Whoever doesn't
see me. I'll come and haunt them.

325
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:44,604
- Now I know.
- You better come and bring a lot of flowers.

326
01:05:44,704 --> 01:05:47,201

327
01:05:47,301 --> 01:05:49,270
- I don't know.
- Tu tienes algo ahi negro.

328
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:52,340
Sacamelo entonces.

329
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,110
- Fix it!
- Don't poke my eye out!

330
01:05:54,210 --> 01:05:55,513
Well. fix it!

331
01:05:55,613 --> 01:05:57,516

01:05:57,616 --> 01:06:01,852
- Julissa. what are you doing in there?
- You do not need to know!

333
01:06:01,952 --> 01:06:03,405
What you want?

334
01:06:06,776 --> 01:06:08,403
Where's my lighter?

335
01:06:16,986 --> 01:06:20,012
You better go to Julissa's
or Jennifer's house or something.

336
01:06:26,129 --> 01:06:30,347
I'd rather be thrown in some ocean.
in Hawaii or something.

337
01:06:30,447 --> 01:06:33,129
Ya yo veo

01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:37,035

347
01:11:49,185 --> 01:11:52,301

348
01:11:52,401 --> 01:11:55,289

349
01:11:57,860 --> 01:11:59,885

350
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:05,997

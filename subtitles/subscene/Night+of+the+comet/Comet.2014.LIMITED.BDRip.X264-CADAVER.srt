<i>This is not a dream.</i>

00:00:26,292 --> 00:00:29,261
<i>This is not a dream.</i>

4
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:31,497
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

5
00:00:51,485 --> 00:00:54,453
This is not a dream.

6
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:56,455
This is not a dream.

7
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,722
This is not a dream.

8
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,124
Not a dream.

9
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,973
How did I get here?

10
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:51,143
I don't know. Somebody
just transferred me here.

11
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:53,178
I don't wanna give you
my information again.

12
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,780
I just told someone 5 times.

13
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:58,083
Can one of you behave like
a real person, please?

14
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,186
I'm calling about...

15
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,422
Right, yes, I'm her son.

16
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:08,160
What kind of cancer are we talking about?

17
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:10,762
What are our options?

18
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:13,632
What about a liver transplant?

19
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,033
Why not?

20
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:17,169
Ask about her Child-Pugh score.

21
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:18,971
Trust me.

22
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:21,306
What's her Child-Pugh score?

23
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:23,242
B. Uh...

24
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:24,776
What about her bilirubin levels?

25
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,513
If they're low enough,
they might consider yttrium-90.

26
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:29,715
Hold on. You have
really bad social skills.

27
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:32,017
Can you pretend to not
listen to my conversation?

28
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,785
Nobody likes that guy.
Don't be that guy.

29
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,954
Eyes on the prize. Yeah.

30
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,324
What about yttrium-90?

31
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,593
Her bilirubin levels are too high.

32
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:43,896
Okay, listen. I'm gonna get on a
flight in the morning.

33
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,697
Uh, so I should be at the hospital by 3.

34
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,934
Just have her call me tonight,
so I know I'm wanted.

35
00:02:48,936 --> 00:02:50,002
Thanks.

36
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,004
Fuck.

37
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:55,207
- This is about your mom?
- Yeah.

38
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,808
How long are they giving her?

39
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,877
I don't know, a few years.

40
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,313
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

41
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,417
What are you doing?

42
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,720
I gotta roll a joint before
the meteor shower starts.

43
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,189
Why?

44
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:14,693
We're about to watch
a fucking meteor shower. "Why."

45
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:15,894
Oh, here.

46
00:03:17,565 --> 00:03:19,364
That's for when you apply
to college in a few years.

47
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,367
Use me as a reference.

48
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:23,569
You're a postdoctoral scientist

49
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:25,437
at Tristana Pharmaceuticals.

50
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,706
- Yup.
- So you already knew...

51
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,108
Oh, that cancery stuff, yeah, I did.

52
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,578
Anyway, I should be able to help you

53
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,781
get you into a top ten
pre-med in a few years.

54
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:37,816
What makes you think I wanna go pre-med?

55
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:39,651
Well, other than the fact that

56
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:41,453
you know what yttrium-90 is

57
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,089
when most of your peers are still battling

58
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:47,292
to crack the mysteries of parallel parking.

59
00:03:47,294 --> 00:03:48,660
That's just because my mom...

60
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,696
Your mom died of
liver cancer. Yeah, I know.

61
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:52,731
Your book bag has a cancer ribbon pinned to

62
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:55,033
what could only be a picture of your mom.

63
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,301
She fits the age range.

64
00:03:56,303 --> 00:03:58,337
And you guys have the same nose bridge.

65
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:01,206
Makes sense you wanting to become
a doctor that saves people.

66
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:04,076
Right? To make up for the doctor
that couldn't save your mom.

67
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,279
Then, with time,
those good intentions will fade

68
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,847
and it'll become about the
money like it always does.

69
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,250
And you'll become bitter,
like everyone always becomes.

70
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:15,487
And then you die, probably from cancer.

71
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,290
You know, because that's ironic.

72
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:19,825
Is there something wrong with you?

73
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,893
Probably, yeah.

74
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,795
<i>Don't worry, I'm working on it.</i>

75
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,631
<i>I just fired my therapist.</i>

76
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,466
<i>She was such an idiot though.</i>

77
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:28,634
She diagnosed me with

78
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:31,503
narcissistic personality disorder.

79
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,505
She said I'm under the grand delusion

80
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,587
that I'm the smartest person in the world.

81
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,946
To which I responded,
"What if I really am?"

82
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:44,349
- You know?
- Hey, over here.

83
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,817
Watch out!

84
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,598
You okay?

85
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,874
You alright?

86
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,278
This... this doesn't feel real.

87
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,346
What?

88
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,783
I feel like my life just flashed

89
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:27,486
before my eyes, you know, like in a movie

90
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:29,621
where the main character
dies in the beginning

91
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:33,158
but he keeps going,
not realizing he's dead.

92
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,460
Hey, what's that movie I'm talking about?
You know what I mean.

93
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,462
It's like, um...
What is it? It's...

94
00:06:37,464 --> 00:06:39,364
Oh, um, sure, uh, yeah.

95
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:41,533
Like, uh, Bruce Willis
in "The Sixth Sense?"

96
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:43,235
Exactly. Yeah.

97
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,570
Wait, no. You know what,
I never saw that. Shit.

98
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,606
That's the twist that
everyone was talking about?

99
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:50,175
Bruce Willis dies in the
beginning of that. That sucks.

100
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:52,244
Ah, I really wanted
to see that. Fuck.

101
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,349
I'm sorry. I guess I just
thought everyone had seen it.

102
00:06:57,351 --> 00:07:00,452
No, don't worry.
Now, I'm not that mad.

103
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:03,355
I mean I am, but I'll get over it.

104
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:04,689
That's a lie.

105
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:07,259
I'll probably harbor this
for a few months at least

106
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:09,828
and then, you know, we'll see.

107
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,363
See what happens.

108
00:07:11,365 --> 00:07:13,698
Oh, that's cute.
Do you have an eating problem?

109
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,036
Oh, not like...

110
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:19,638
Sorry. I shouldn't
have said that.

111
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,474
Dude, come on, you do realize my date

112
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,743
isn't the one with the
eating problem, right?

113
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:27,712
Oh.

114
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,251
Wha...
Uh-oh, Kimberly's annoyed.

115
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,838
Kimberly.

116
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:00,779
Kimberly.

117
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,684
Hey.

118
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,122
- How do you do that?
- What?

119
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,924
I haven't seen you in a year

120
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:15,894
when I was literally
just thinking about you.

121
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:18,930
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. Because of that song.

122
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:22,200
I was listening to it as
I was walking here.

123
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:25,136
It reminded me of the hotel.

124
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:27,939
The one we stayed at for my
friend's wedding in Paris.

125
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,941
Yeah, yeah, Paris.

126
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,677
City of Lights and pretension as I recall.

127
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,914
We had one of our biggest fights.

128
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,216
And that was your friend's
wedding from Wisconsin, right?

129
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:40,652
What was her name, Lenora or Lee Anora?

130
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:43,555
- Sarah? Right.
- I remember that wedding.

131
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:45,857
I remember that was the one where the DJ

132
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,626
played that Montell Jordan song twice.

133
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:50,195
I remember,
the first time we thought it was ironic

134
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,237
then we realized he just liked the song.

135
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,267
Definitely our biggest fight.

136
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:56,835
The beginning of the end, really.

137
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:57,903
Yeah.

138
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,305
Yeah.

139
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,674
Look, It's like the Beatles, right?

140
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,544
I mean, I liked them when I was 5.

141
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:07,297
But at a certain point,
you just want something

142
00:09:07,323 --> 00:09:08,647
with a little more nuance, you know?

143
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:11,082
Don't get me wrong. I could
handle them a little better

144
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,184
when they had Pete Best to ground them

145
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:16,288
but past that, I don't know,
they just got so pedestrian.

146
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:21,626
- Do you come here a lot?
- Do I come to the cemetery?

147
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:24,195
I like cemeteries.
You know, they're romantic.

148
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,530
Especially this one.

149
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:28,066
Soccer is by far the most elegant sport.

150
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,969
Yeah, I read somewhere it's gonna overtake
football in America in the next 2 years.

151
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:33,071
- Really? 2 years?
- A friend of mine described it.

152
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,573
Clock's ticking.

153
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:37,943
He blogged, "Soccer's...
soccer's chess on a field."

154
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:41,181
Do you have a vomit bag...
vomit bags on you?

155
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:43,081
I'll send you the link.

156
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:44,883
I guess we could just...
I'd hate to throw up on a grave.

157
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:47,452
Why didn't you just go to the
Griffith Park Observatory

158
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:48,787
then to watch the meteor shower?

159
00:09:48,789 --> 00:09:50,622
Oh, they have assholes
there too. Trust me.

160
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,023
There're assholes all over the city.

161
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,859
But rarely do you get to be
next to one so spectacular.

162
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:57,662
The only knock on him though, I have
to say, is that he's from New York.

163
00:09:57,664 --> 00:10:00,265
I can't stand that place.
Seriously. It's so overrated.

164
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,702
Why? Because of all the bridges and the
culture and the history they have?

165
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:06,271
Who needs it?
I'll take Orlando any day.

166
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,073
They got so many
more T.G.I. Fridays.

167
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:11,676
Do I love L.A.? You know, Los
Angeles is just more modern.

168
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:13,478
It has a certain relevancy about it.

169
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,013
New York just doesn't have anymore.

170
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:17,682
Kimberly, I was wondering if
I could have your number?

171
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,752
- What?
- Your phone number?

172
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,090
Dude... she's with me.

173
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,025
No.

174
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:30,028
- Uh, yeah, she is.
- No, she's not.

175
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,597
Not yet anyway.
At best, this is a first date.

176
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:34,132
And I'm shocked that that even happened.

177
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,868
I have nothing against you.
You might not be a bad guy.

178
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,671
Most likely you are but maybe
not. You're incredibly handsome

179
00:10:39,673 --> 00:10:41,640
and you were probably very
handsome when you were a kid, too.

180
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,309
I think that explains your lack
of substance and personality.

181
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,344
Only because nobody's ever
really challenged you before.

182
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,913
So now as an adult
you think everything you say

183
00:10:48,915 --> 00:10:50,782
means something,
but it means nothing actually.

184
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,450
You don't know what you're talking about.

185
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,020
And it's really upsetting. And I think
she probably sees through that.

186
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:57,422
You're very pretty,
but you're shallow beyond belief.

187
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:03,395
Anyway, can I have your number?

188
00:11:03,397 --> 00:11:05,697
- Okay, okay.
- What are you doing?

189
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,332
You just said all that shit.

190
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:10,068
Yeah, but it was just an observation.

191
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,906
And you ask my girl out in front of me?

192
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,310
Oh, shit. Sorry, my mistake.

193
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:22,080
I see that now. I shouldn't have done that.
She's way too beautiful.

194
00:11:22,082 --> 00:11:23,181
What?

195
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,983
No. I just should be
more of a realist.

196
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,351
I should know that I'm a C, maybe a C plus

197
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,286
in the winter time when
I can cover up my body more.

198
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,488
And even though you're a douche bag,
you're still incredibly attractive.

199
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,450
So maybe it's only fair you two pair.

200
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,662
- What? It rhymed.
- She's right, it rhymed.

201
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,497
Let's...
Can you just put me down?

202
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,866
This is embarrassing now for everyone.

203
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,702
Okay. Come on, Josh.
The line's moving.

204
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,471
- Let's... Let's just go. Come on.
- Oh, yeah...

205
00:11:46,473 --> 00:11:48,473
Gotta get a good seat.

206
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:53,845
The only thing wrong with you

207
00:11:53,847 --> 00:11:56,548
is you're chicken shit.
That's all.

208
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,084
- That's not the only problem.
- Let's go. Excuse me.

209
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:01,086
- Excuse me.
- One of many.

210
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,522
- You okay?
- Yeah.

211
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:07,158
I shouldn't have talked.
That's when I get into trouble.

212
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,495
I'm sorry I made fun of your
sandwich bag. I didn't mean to.

213
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,497
Actually, that's not true, I did.

214
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:16,000
Sorry. I'm really nervous.

215
00:12:16,002 --> 00:12:18,436
It's okay.
I'm sorry he bothered you.

216
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,572
I was not nervous because of him.

217
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,611
Okay. Bye.

218
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,718
She is so...

219
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,122
<i>Beautiful.</i>

220
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:43,762
<i>Kim, come on, the wedding's in an hour.</i>

221
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:46,631
<i>You gotta get ready.</i>

222
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:51,269
So... have you ever
dreamt about me?

223
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,438
- Dreamt about you?
- Yeah.

224
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,107
You know, in the 700 plus days we've dated.

225
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,744
You ever dreamt about me?

226
00:12:59,746 --> 00:13:02,280
So... Yeah, of course.

227
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,716
Oh, yeah? Like, uh, sex dreams?

228
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:08,086
At first, but then we had sex,
and that went away.

229
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:11,289
Ha. Is that how you
really wanna say that?

230
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,591
So I was all hot to trot for you

231
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:14,859
or whatever in the beginning.

232
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:17,896
And now, you know, reality has set in.

233
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,430
But that's not what I meant.
I meant like...

234
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:23,168
A dream, like ambiguous depictions

235
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,703
of what we are or were, or could be.

236
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:26,805
Stuff like that.

237
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,307
Can you stop already? I got it.

238
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,843
- Why, I oughta...
- Oh, hey, whoo.

239
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,645
Put that down.
You're gonna hurt yourself.

240
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:35,947
- What are you doing?
- I'm a give you what for.

241
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,282
Oh, yeah?

242
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:39,450
Yeah.

243
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,054
You good?

244
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:47,926
Okay. Okay.

245
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,260
That was fun.

246
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,830
Does it bother you that
you don't make me happy?

247
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,565
- Always with the jokes.
- I'm serious.

248
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:56,134
Seriously? You went from sex
dreams to not being happy?

249
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:58,469
False. I wasn't talking
about sex dreams, you were.

250
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:00,772
And secondly, I'm a girl,
so yes, we non-sequitur.

251
00:14:00,774 --> 00:14:04,809
- That's a little cliched.
- I want a baby.

252
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:05,977
Point taken.

253
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:09,047
Seriously.
Don't you want a baby?

254
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,851
Someday, sure.

255
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:16,321
But let's burn that bridge
when we get to it, okay?

256
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:19,157
See? Not making me happy.

257
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:22,026
How do you do that?
How do you do that?

258
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,835
Oh, my God. She's beautiful.

259
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:33,171
She's beyond beautiful.

260
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,306
And she's real.

261
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,876
She seems funny, too.

262
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:41,679
And there's a hint of crazy, I can feel it.

263
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:43,581
Beautiful, crazy, and funny.

264
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,483
Jesus Christ. She's perfect.

265
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,819
It's really annoying. Really...

266
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:56,094
That's two near collisions
for you now in a row.

267
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,430
Well, at least this one's nonfatal.

268
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:03,768
Okay.

269
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,874
- Okay.
- Okay.

270
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,316
- Bye.
- Uh, yeah.

271
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,754
What the fuck was that?

272
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,314
Wait. Wait.

273
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,552
What are we doing?

274
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,223
Are we in a chase scene now?
What are we doing?

275
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:02,894
Wait, just stop for a second.

276
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,333
So I thought I saw somebody,
a friend of mine

277
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:09,600
behind you coming over.

278
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,270
So that's why I turned around and waited.

279
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,372
So what's the big deal?

280
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,240
It wasn't because you were watching me?

281
00:16:16,242 --> 00:16:18,543
Because it looked like
you were kinda watching me.

282
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:20,812
No, it was because of a friend

283
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:22,447
that was behind you.

284
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:25,516
So they're not there now obviously.

285
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,318
Besides, you were being weird.

286
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,421
You were talking to yourself.

287
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,689
What were you saying anyway?

288
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,791
You say "so" a lot.
It's really annoying.

289
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,293
So...

290
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:37,095
Are you trying to make this awkward now?

291
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:39,430
- It feels awkward now.
- Awkward feels good to me.

292
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,366
And awkward feels awkward to me.

293
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:44,002
That's a little on the nose,
don't you think?

294
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,138
I'm not trying to fuck you.

295
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,641
If that's what you're
worried about, I mean.

296
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:53,978
I'm not gonna ask you out because
I don't believe in love.

297
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,080
I think all relationships
deteriorate into hate

298
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:59,150
indifference or...
Well, yeah, those two things.

299
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,352
My parents have been together for 32 years.

300
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,255
- And they're happily in love.
- No, they're not.

301
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,857
- Yes, they are.
- No, they're not.

302
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,392
If they haven't divorced by now

303
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:08,926
probably means they've just
surrendered to the fact

304
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,795
that being apart isn't much
better than being together.

305
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,563
You know, the lesser of two evils.

306
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:15,133
Trust me, it's like an emotional holocaust
between your parents right now.

307
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:17,602
They probably have lukewarm
feelings about you too.

308
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,003
I'm Dell, by the way.

309
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:24,042
So, no offense, but I have
a-a thing about shaking hands.

310
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,944
Oh, my God.
You are a little crazy.

311
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,580
That's great.

312
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:31,749
- You're not impressing me.
- I disagree.

313
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:34,318
You know, you should stop trying
to sound so smart all the time.

314
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,387
You just wind up sounding really dumb.

315
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,423
It's just I realized why
you date guys like that.

316
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,758
You have terrible taste in men
because you're superficial.

317
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,326
You're fooling yourself in the hopes

318
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,694
of finding something redeemable.

319
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,930
It's because of love.
That's your blind spot.

320
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,598
You gotta give up on that.

321
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:52,370
Wow. Okay.

322
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,405
Well, I thank you for
your insight, stranger

323
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:58,676
but I actually believe love is real.

324
00:17:58,678 --> 00:17:59,744
I'm gonna go now.

325
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:00,812
Wait.

326
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,981
Can I still get your...

327
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,257
- Hello, boyfriend.
- Hey.

328
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,626
Hey, listen, Roxette's on,
and the good part is coming up.

329
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,361
Can I call you back?

330
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,397
Wait-wait, I just have to tell you
something more important really quick.

331
00:18:19,399 --> 00:18:22,200
You know that book I've been reading,
"The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins...

332
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:27,572
♪ <i>Leave the winter on the ground</i> ♪

333
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:29,740
There's this fascinating part
I just read about memes.

334
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:33,511
He basically says that ideas are like
genes that self-replicate and mutate

335
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:35,947
like a cultural form of evolution...

336
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:40,751
♪ <i>Touch me now, I close my eyes...</i> ♪

337
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:42,787
I was thinking how that
applies to us, you know?

338
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,890
The idea of us, how we've
really mutated and evolved...

339
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:50,928
♪ <i>And it's a hard winter's day...</i> ♪

340
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,098
Right? Because you think about it, we were
just dumb, young kids when we first met.

341
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,167
And then we broke up, got back together,
blah blah blah.

342
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:59,804
And now,
we're this really mature, loving couple

343
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:01,639
who's grown respect and
admiration for each other.

344
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,374
You know what I mean?

345
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,277
Kimberly?

346
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,281
You hung up on me, didn't you?

347
00:19:10,283 --> 00:19:13,184
♪ <i>But it's over now</i> ♪

348
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:16,020
♪ <i>From the moment we touched</i> ♪

349
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:19,557
♪ <i>Until the time had run out</i> ♪

350
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:23,060
♪ <i>Yeah</i> ♪♪

351
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,771
Well, maybe you could.

352
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,844
Well, because I'd like her
to be at the best place.

353
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,647
Well, then maybe you can
introduce me to the head guy

354
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,515
at the cancer immunology lab.

355
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,118
Because I've taken an interest, that's all.

356
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,920
Yes, mom, I meditated.

357
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:51,722
I meditate before every date,
but it didn't help.

358
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,325
Face facts, no one thinks
I'm special but you.

359
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,095
Well, I'm still technically on it.

360
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:01,966
But it's not working out, trust me.

361
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:04,969
He called himself a Bob Dylan song

362
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:08,773
and then proceeded to call
me a Britney Spears song.

363
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:11,576
I don't know what it means
either, but it sounds insulting.

364
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:15,680
No, not him. Uh, the one
with glasses, mustache.

365
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:17,815
Looks like a child trafficker.

366
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:21,485
Yeah, yeah, that's the one.

367
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:23,521
Well, if I...

368
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:28,926
I gotta go. I gotta go.

369
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:36,133
Can I ask you a serious question?

370
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:39,437
Do you think I have terrible taste in men?

371
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,582
Okay, I'm back. Uh-huh.

372
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,521
- Well, I'm at...
- I have to talk to you.

373
00:20:57,523 --> 00:20:59,523
- I'm on the phone.
- No, it's really important.

374
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,792
- Really important.
- I'm on the friggin' phone.

375
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:05,329
Have you ever cried at one of
these things? I was wondering.

376
00:21:05,331 --> 00:21:09,133
Mom, I have to go.
Something weird is happening.

377
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:12,370
- One of what things?
- These meteor shower things.

378
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:13,804
Cried?

379
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:16,140
Yeah, you know,
like tears of joy, that kind of thing.

380
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:19,644
No. I've never cried
at one of these things.

381
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:21,445
Neither have I. Ever, ever.

382
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,481
In fact, I don't understand people that do.

383
00:21:23,483 --> 00:21:25,783
It's kind of bullshit,
happy crying is, isn't it?

384
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,119
What are your thoughts on that?

385
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:31,022
So I was on the phone.

386
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:33,391
So, yeah, you were on the phone.

387
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:35,459
Sorry. Was it important?

388
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,028
More important than your question?

389
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,730
- Yes.
- Yes.

390
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:42,266
My mistake. Sorry.
I'll never interrupt you again.

391
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:44,001
- Thank you.
- Okay.

392
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,303
Well...

393
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,372
I should get back to my date.
He's probably...

394
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:49,907
But I just wanna keep talking to you.

395
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:51,542
- What?
- I wanna keep talking to you for multiple reasons.

396
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,678
I mean, you're beautiful, but
it's more than that. I promise.

397
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,614
That's very nice, but I should go.

398
00:21:56,616 --> 00:21:58,883
Maybe I'll see you in the
winter when you're a C plus.

399
00:21:58,885 --> 00:22:01,919
See? I knew it. I knew you
were superficial. I told you.

400
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:04,322
The only reason that you're talking
to me is because you think I'm hot.

401
00:22:04,324 --> 00:22:06,624
Yeah, but the only reason why you
won't is because you think I'm not.

402
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:08,659
Fine. Give me a reason
why I should?

403
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,698
I was saying, "Don't miss her."

404
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,600
Earlier, when you saw me talking to myself.
I was saying, "Don't miss her."

405
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:19,403
I'm always so afraid I'm gonna
miss the important things in life.

406
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:22,073
Something about you has given me a
heightened curiosity to know you better.

407
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:23,831
And that is a near impossible
feat when it comes

408
00:22:23,857 --> 00:22:25,443
to me because
I hate getting to know people.

409
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:27,812
But I can tell you're not like the others.

410
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,914
- What others?
- People.

411
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,849
People?
You can tell I'm not a person?

412
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,217
Yeah, you're not phony like them.

413
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:36,554
Also, I didn't say you were hot.
I said you are beautiful.

414
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,061
When is this dumb thing gonna happen?

415
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,201
It's a beautiful night though.

416
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,573
What?

417
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,875
I never know what that
means when people say

418
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:01,345
that it's a beautiful night?
What does it mean?

419
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:04,982
So... well, to me

420
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:09,787
means it's comfortable, familiar...

421
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,522
Yet deeply moving.

422
00:23:11,524 --> 00:23:13,124
Right, no... I feel you

423
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:17,995
like, uh, like getting stoned
and listening to Steely Dan.

424
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,530
No. Nothing at all like that.

425
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:21,899
No... I know. More like...

426
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,267
Yeah, like...

427
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:26,170
Floating down a serene lake in a rowboat

428
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:29,240
when the sun is setting
or rising... or when the sun is

429
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:30,508
being a part of nature.

430
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,143
- Stop speaking.
- Okay.

431
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:36,080
It's beautiful when the
weather is not hot or cold.

432
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:39,517
Kinda like you don't notice it.

433
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,586
Kinda like it's perfect because
everything is so balanced.

434
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,922
You don't even feel it.

435
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:48,292
And while you're feeling that non-feeling

436
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:50,961
you look up in the sky

437
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:55,199
and you almost think that's why.

438
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:59,737
Because how everything is right
now, all the stars and planets

439
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:04,141
and us and the ground,
and the cells and molecules

440
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:09,613
right now... is exactly
the reason

441
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:12,316
why now is comfortable.

442
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:15,119
- You're a now person.
- True.

443
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,821
Yeah, see, I'm a 5-minutes-from-now person.

444
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:19,924
Because 5 minutes from now,
a gust of wind could come in

445
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:22,159
and blow H1N1 in everyone's eyes.

446
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:24,795
Right. Except
that's highly unlikely.

447
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,097
Or 5 minutes from now,
an earthquake could erupt

448
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,933
and swallow us all whole.

449
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:30,801
Right. Except that...

450
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,436
No, shit, that could actually happen.

451
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:34,238
Yeah. The point is I'm way too
anxious about what could happen

452
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,807
5 minutes from now to be content with now.

453
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,409
Can't do it.

454
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:40,978
What if something good
happens 5 minutes from now?

455
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,781
- Can't that happen?
- No.

456
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:45,583
What did you think was gonna happen

457
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:47,585
5 minutes before you met me?

458
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,361
I'm just really paranoid I'm gonna miss it.

459
00:24:57,363 --> 00:24:59,830
I miss things a lot.

460
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,866
I don't care if I miss it because...

461
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,868
You're a now person. Got it.

462
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:10,307
So another weird thing.

463
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:11,642
I don't mind your pessimism

464
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:14,345
as much as I usually mind pessimism.

465
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:18,349
That's great. I hate people
who think I'm too negative.

466
00:25:18,351 --> 00:25:20,351
Also, I like your hat.

467
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:24,555
Yeah, I'm probably gonna
fall in love with you.

468
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,430
Wow.

469
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,702
That's it?

470
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,638
What were you hoping for?

471
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,339
I'm going to fall in love with you, too?

472
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:45,609
No, but... Well, yeah.

473
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:48,012
So all that stuff about not
believing in relationships...

474
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:49,934
Oh, that's just a pick-up line.

475
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,384
Do we have a deal then?

476
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:54,919
<i>Cause you said you believe in love.</i>

477
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,954
I don't.
Let's put it to the test.

478
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:58,489
Date each other. Me and you.

479
00:25:58,491 --> 00:26:00,991
In a relationship. Let's do it.

480
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,075
Why the hell am I shaking your hand?

481
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:21,645
I should be scared to death
of who you are as a person.

482
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:24,181
Instead, I'm scared to death of weddings.

483
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:25,583
Death. Literally.

484
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:27,251
I'd probably have a coronary

485
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,053
right as I'm walking up the aisle.

486
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:31,088
Oh, God, please invite me to your wedding.

487
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,257
I would love to see that.

488
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,595
Well, that's morbid and telling.

489
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:39,697
Yeah, well,
if snuff films were readily available

490
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:41,699
I'd probably watch them, not gonna lie.

491
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:43,701
Is that a deal breaker for you?

492
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:45,336
No, because for some reason

493
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:47,638
I still happen to be in love with you.

494
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,374
No, it's because you didn't think
that you'd be the one marrying me.

495
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:52,509
You don't smoke weed. What are you doing?
Don't do that.

496
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:54,511
<i>So do you still love me?</i>

497
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:57,314
I tell you all the time,
if you died right now

498
00:26:57,316 --> 00:27:00,517
I'd visit your grave every single day.

499
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:03,554
Not every day, that's crazy.

500
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:06,790
<i>That doesn't answer the question.</i>

501
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,792
Of course, I love you.

502
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,901
<i>It never sounds real when you say it.</i>

503
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,506
<i>Like it doesn't exist.</i>

504
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:54,104
So what are you doing here?

505
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:56,740
- Going up north.
- Why would you do that?

506
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,809
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

507
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:02,379
I'm... I'm kidding.
I'm going to meet someone.

508
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,785
So right, okay.

509
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,691
- How's your mom doing?
- She's actually fine.

510
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,793
I can't believe
I haven't talked to you this long.

511
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:18,295
Yeah, turns out her
doctors are huge idiots.

512
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:19,697
So I kinda took matters in my own hand.

513
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:21,365
I figured out a way to dose her
with that experimental drug

514
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,900
we've been developing in our lab.

515
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:25,402
Wait.
Are you allowed to do that?

516
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,438
No.

517
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,541
Wasn't that extremely dangerous?

518
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:33,010
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- She's fine now?

519
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:36,046
Yeah, completely.
She's in remission. So...

520
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,781
- Dell, that's great.
- Yeah.

521
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:39,249
I mean, other than the

522
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:41,785
totally-unethical-recklessly-
risking-your-mom's-life part.

523
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:44,922
That's... that's,
You... you saved her.

524
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:46,190
Yeah, I guess.

525
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:48,559
We should probably keep that
between us... by the way.

526
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:51,962
Because there's a good chance
what I did was illegal... ish.

527
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:54,732
Right.

528
00:28:56,602 --> 00:28:58,969
- Oh.
- All aboard.

529
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:01,805
Right. We should probably...

530
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:03,807
Okay, right.

531
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:05,976
Well, still, wow.

532
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,945
I can't believe you're curing cancer now.

533
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:09,747
Does that mean you've
stopped hating people?

534
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:10,814
Not at all.

535
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,485
Kill Zelda Fitzgerald.

536
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,254
Right?

537
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,857
Who is that?

538
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:21,658
- Really?
- I don't know who that is.

539
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:25,162
F. Scott Fitzgerald's
annoying... wife.

540
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:26,230
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

541
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:27,598
Oh.

542
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,901
I'd definitely marry Rita Hayworth.

543
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:32,503
Great hair.

544
00:29:32,505 --> 00:29:35,439
Hair, right. Guys love her hair.

545
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:39,977
I definitely have to shit out of this one.

546
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:42,579
Olga Kordinstitch? Who is that?

547
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:45,382
I don't know. I've just
always wanted to fuck an Olga.

548
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:48,519
I would definitely marry Tupac.

549
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:50,754
Kimberly Shakur.

550
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:53,557
It's got a good ring to it.

551
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,593
I would definitely
"F" Edward R. Murrow.

552
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:59,163
I picture him starting up sex with.

553
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:01,965
"Good night, and good luck."

554
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:10,808
I'd probably laugh so much

555
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,143
that I'd have an orgasm
right then and there.

556
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,182
From the laughter, you know?

557
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:21,385
I lied about not seeing
"The Sixth Sense."

558
00:30:21,387 --> 00:30:24,421
Of course I saw it. Everybody saw it.
It's amazing.

559
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:26,790
Who didn't see
"The Sixth Sense?"

560
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,159
Why would you lie about that?

561
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:33,564
I read in a woman's magazine
that every relationship

562
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:35,599
whether it be short term, or long term

563
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:37,901
there's usually, like, one big lie
relative to that relationship

564
00:30:37,903 --> 00:30:41,338
and I just... I wanted to get
mine over with, I guess.

565
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,408
Why would you want to get a
jump start on the lying?

566
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,475
Because...

567
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:47,211
Because of five minutes from now.

568
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:49,246
Well, yeah...

569
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:51,782
You're assuming that
we're in a relationship

570
00:30:51,784 --> 00:30:54,651
or going to be when
I'm still technically on a date

571
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:56,086
with someone else.

572
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:58,121
Which I should probably be
getting back to. By the way.

573
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:00,490
What about the handshake? We shook hands.
You can't do that.

574
00:31:00,492 --> 00:31:02,626
I was leading you on.

575
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,928
That's really fucked up.

576
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,763
That's the business.

577
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,131
Well, what about a friendship?

578
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,666
Actually, what am I talking about?

579
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,969
I definitely don't want
to be friends with you.

580
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:18,575
I was raped. In high school.

581
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:22,012
By the quarterback...
of the football team.

582
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:24,248
Jesus.

583
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,849
I know.

584
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:28,385
That is a terrible lie.

585
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,420
Hey! How do you know
that's a lie?

586
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:31,989
You were raped in high school

587
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:33,790
by the quarterback of the football team?

588
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,626
I don't think after-school
specials are that cliched.

589
00:31:35,628 --> 00:31:38,395
You couldn't have gone with, like,
a cornerback or defensive end

590
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,897
or something?

591
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,499
Well, I was just trying
to get mine over with.

592
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,534
- Get what over who?
- My lie to you.

593
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:45,969
- You can't.
- Why can't?

594
00:31:45,971 --> 00:31:49,673
Because I saw it coming,
because we just talked about it.

595
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:52,743
You've got to wait until I'm in a
completely vulnerable position

596
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,912
where I'd really fall for it.

597
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,380
That sounds really dangerous.

598
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:58,115
Oh, yeah, that's the problem
with relationships.

599
00:31:58,117 --> 00:31:59,283
Danger?

600
00:31:59,285 --> 00:32:00,984
- Or worse.
- Worse?

601
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,921
You could change the other person.

602
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:06,189
You're a very broken man, Dell.

603
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:07,424
In theory.

604
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,862
Speaking of broken men,
your goateed Philistine

605
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:13,463
<i>is sashaying towards us.</i>

606
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,201
- Run!
- What?

607
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:19,236
- Run!
- What?

608
00:32:19,238 --> 00:32:20,470
<i>Run!</i>

609
00:32:36,021 --> 00:32:37,454
Well, that's settled.

610
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,224
Wanna hit?

611
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:45,095
No way. It has a weird
effect on me.

612
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:48,598
For some reason, when I'm high,
I think people can't hear me

613
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,801
and I start speaking really loudly.

614
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:56,873
Do you remember memorizing phone numbers?

615
00:32:56,875 --> 00:33:00,277
I don't remember the last time
I memorized a phone number.

616
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,512
I don't either, actually.

617
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:05,082
Remember checking the newspaper
for movie showtimes?

618
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,683
Remember that?

619
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:09,653
Or writing people those notes in
those, like, folded-up triangles

620
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,655
and then putting them in their lockers.

621
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:15,692
Do you think kids still do that?

622
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:17,561
As opposed to just e-mails or texts?

623
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:20,197
No way. It's all about e-mails and texts

624
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:22,366
with those goddamn hugs and kisses.

625
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:24,334
I hate those things.

626
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,169
Whenever anybody e-mails me hugs and kisses

627
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,412
I wanna just e-mail them back
oral and penetration.

628
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:34,811
Are we old? Are we
talking like old people?

629
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:39,249
Are we on the verge of joining
the sweatpants culture?

630
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,458
Was I just saying something?

631
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,795
What? Was I?

632
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:53,030
Give me that.

633
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:54,798
- Why?
- Give me that.

634
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,466
Okay, that's it for you.

635
00:33:57,735 --> 00:34:01,405
I think you should start
drinking some coffee.

636
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,640
Okay?

637
00:34:03,642 --> 00:34:05,809
See, that's why I hate time.

638
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:00,497
I believe I want to have sex with you now.

639
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:02,632
I believe I share in that belief.

640
00:35:24,722 --> 00:35:28,458
Hey, uh, uh... Okay.

641
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,161
We gotta get ready. Come on.

642
00:35:31,163 --> 00:35:33,763
What the F? I thought
we were gonna make it!

643
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,699
I know, but we gotta go, Kim.

644
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:37,100
Really.

645
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,538
What's that?

646
00:35:45,244 --> 00:35:46,710
What is that?

647
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:58,421
<i>You ordered Chinese food? Who
orders Chinese food in Paris?</i>

648
00:35:58,423 --> 00:36:00,891
Kim, they're going to have
dinner at the wedding, you know?

649
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:03,326
<i>The wedding that we're supposed
to go to in half an hour.</i>

650
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,729
<i>And you just ate lunch.
You're not full?</i>

651
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:07,831
What does that have to do with anything?

652
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,199
Oh, Jesus.
This is the pot talking.

653
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:11,868
You shouldn't have smoked.
I knew it. You gotta get ready.

654
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,237
What are you doing?
You made me promise

655
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:15,939
to get you down there
on time no matter what.

656
00:36:15,941 --> 00:36:17,874
You warned me you would do this.

657
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:21,845
See, this is why I hate time.

658
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:24,514
I can't enjoy my sesame
chicken because of it.

659
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,715
Kim.

660
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:28,618
<i>Wish I could just stop it or something.</i>

661
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,955
Or at least just make it
pause when needed, like now.

662
00:36:31,957 --> 00:36:34,624
Or better yet,
just get rid of it altogether.

663
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:37,427
You wanna get rid of time?
How would you do that?

664
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,362
<i>You know how there's time-based art?</i>

665
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,998
Movies, music, plays,
it's all time-based art.

666
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,668
There's a beginning,
and a middle and an end.

667
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:47,571
You have to see it from
the beginning to the end.

668
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:49,539
You're restrained to that timeline...

669
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:52,142
<i>That way of experiencing it.</i>

670
00:36:52,144 --> 00:36:54,678
But then there's paintings.

671
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:58,515
No beginning, no middle, no end.

672
00:36:58,517 --> 00:37:01,952
You see what you want to see
when you want to see it.

673
00:37:01,954 --> 00:37:05,355
No restrictions, it's just there.

674
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:10,260
Okay, so you want life to be
a painting? Great.

675
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:22,239
What?

676
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,579
Thanks.

677
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,715
So, do you know you really love me?

678
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,524
So, what's in your pocket?

679
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,360
My wallet.

680
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:45,395
It's stuffed with our
saved movie ticket stubs

681
00:37:45,397 --> 00:37:46,930
because I'm a romantic like that.

682
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:48,231
Can you please get ready?

683
00:37:48,233 --> 00:37:51,234
Shhh! Can't you see,
I'm trying to touch my toes?

684
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:53,570
I really don't want to be that couple
that's always late for things.

685
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:55,872
Can we please not be that couple?

686
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:58,541
At least for the tenure
of our relationship? Please.

687
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,579
You did it again!

688
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:05,482
What? What, I'm just saying
I want us to respect time.

689
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:07,717
<i>Not that.</i>

690
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:11,521
Okay, what then? What did I do that
I did twice now and still not know?

691
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:13,523
You said "the tenure
of our relationship."

692
00:38:13,525 --> 00:38:16,259
You keep speaking about our
relationship as if it's ending.

693
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:18,962
Okay. You see how this
relates to the time thing?

694
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:21,264
Why don't you take your own
advice and instead of seeing

695
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:25,302
a beginning, middle, and end,
just see it as a painting.

696
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:28,305
Kimberly! What are you doing?
We're going to be late!

697
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:31,107
And I'm gonna somehow get
blamed for it, I know it.

698
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,319
What are you reading?

699
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:44,254
Roald Dahl short stories.

700
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,193
So, is it about a girl?

701
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:51,961
Is it about a new girl
you're going up north?

702
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,229
A new girlfriend you're not telling me

703
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:56,433
because you think it'll make it awkward...

704
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:58,468
Yeah.

705
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:02,572
So, right. Okay.

706
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,908
New girl.

707
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,544
I love Roald Dahl.
He's the best.

708
00:39:07,546 --> 00:39:09,546
Which one are you reading? And
are you sleeping with anyone?

709
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:12,782
The one about Hitler. And yes.

710
00:39:12,784 --> 00:39:14,250
Shit.

711
00:39:15,587 --> 00:39:17,821
I didn't know he wrote one about Hitler.

712
00:39:17,823 --> 00:39:20,256
Uh... kind of.
It's about this doctor

713
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:21,858
that saves this woman's life.

714
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,060
<i>She's on the verge of death
through the whole delivery.</i>

715
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:27,464
And this doctor is so determined
to save this woman's life

716
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:29,265
and the life of her unborn child, right?

717
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:32,402
But, it turns out that the child is Hitler.

718
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:33,803
Okay, uh...

719
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:35,839
Did you just give away the ending?

720
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:37,393
How was I supposed to
tell you what the story

721
00:39:37,401 --> 00:39:38,775
was about without giving away the ending?

722
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:40,777
What are you talking about?
Just say...

723
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:43,346
It's a story about a
doctor who saves a woman

724
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:44,914
from a potentially fatal pregnancy?

725
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:46,516
- Because that's what the story is about.
- It is.

726
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:48,685
False, birdbrain. That is not
what the story is about.

727
00:39:48,687 --> 00:39:51,588
It's about the irony
that the baby's Hitler.

728
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,123
- Okay, you're mad.
- I'm not mad.

729
00:39:53,125 --> 00:39:55,959
- You're mad 'cause of the girl.
- I'm seeing a guy. Jack.

730
00:39:55,961 --> 00:39:57,694
You're seeing a Jack?

731
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,362
<i>He's an executive at MTV.</i>

732
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:02,365
Looks like a cross between
Salvador Dali and Dwayne Wayne

733
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:05,101
from "A Different World," which is hot.

734
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:07,003
That's a weird combination.

735
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,877
I gotta go to the bathroom really quick.

736
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,388
Well, that... fucking...

737
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,223
Hurt.

738
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:29,025
What?

739
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,860
You hung up on me.
What happened?

740
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:32,328
Because.

741
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:35,131
Okay, you realize that's not
an answer to my question, right?

742
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,200
What is it that I can help you with, sir?

743
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:40,870
I don't know. Have I told you how much New
York reminds of why I hate L.A. so much?

744
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:43,840
No, please do, because the
New Yorker who opines

745
00:40:43,842 --> 00:40:46,776
the inferiorities of Los Angeles
is bursting with originality.

746
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,111
<i>I'm serious, Kimberly</i>

747
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,580
we gotta move here, it is the fucking best.

748
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:52,515
It's enough already with L.A.

749
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:54,651
It's like a mix of moral
nihilism and Disneyland.

750
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:56,553
So are you.

751
00:40:56,555 --> 00:41:01,057
Hey, did I tell you the proof of concept
on our drug passed with flying colors?

752
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,393
There's actually a bidding war
between a few pharmas right now.

753
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:06,475
Looks like we could be licensing
it for close to 25 million.

754
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:08,598
Money for soul seems like...

755
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,668
An even swap, yes,
it's not like I'm not happy for you

756
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,571
but you did already tell me this
all this morning, remember?

757
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,339
- Did I really?
- Uh-huh.

758
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:19,209
Oh shit, my short-term memory must be shot.

759
00:41:19,211 --> 00:41:21,110
What with the smoking pot and whatnot.

760
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:23,213
I'm your new second-term girlfriend, man

761
00:41:23,215 --> 00:41:25,248
aren't you supposed to be,
like, impressing me still?

762
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,816
Your second-term boyfriend just told you

763
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,552
he made his bosses close to
25 million dollars today.

764
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:32,322
I'm not materialistic.

765
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:34,691
I know that, but 25 million dollars

766
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:37,961
sort of, I don't know,
makes that sound retarded.

767
00:41:37,963 --> 00:41:40,563
Okay, seeing as there's no
new information in this call

768
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:43,700
I am going to go.
I'm almost at the gun range.

769
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:46,603
Hey, don't you think it's cute that you
own a gun card and I own a pot card?

770
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:48,938
<i>Now you sound retarded.</i>

771
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,940
Listen, we should probably
stop saying retarded.

772
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:52,475
I'm starting to feel like an asshole.

773
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:54,444
Oh, is that just now starting?

774
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,283
What's going on? You sound off.

775
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:01,851
You're off.

776
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:04,087
<i>No, no, no, I'm serious.</i>

777
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:06,256
<i>Your cadence is all over the place.</i>

778
00:42:06,258 --> 00:42:08,057
You sound a little like Miss Teschmacher

779
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:10,059
when she betrayed Lex Luthor.

780
00:42:10,061 --> 00:42:11,861
Something's wrong, I can tell.

781
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,566
What's going on?

782
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,236
Oh, God, this is gonna blow.

783
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:21,905
What's going on?

784
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,241
Oh, shit, this is bad, isn't it?

785
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,845
This is like infidelity bad.

786
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:34,183
I definitely heard a silence just now!

787
00:42:34,185 --> 00:42:36,119
What is going on?!

788
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,625
You okay?

789
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:43,993
Yeah, you okay?

790
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:48,264
So... it's been a while.

791
00:42:48,266 --> 00:42:49,866
Yup.

792
00:42:51,635 --> 00:42:54,304
- I'm glad you're finally here.
- Yeah, me too.

793
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:03,212
I've been trying to get a hold
of you for a long time now.

794
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:06,683
Do you want a tour of the place?

795
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:07,884
No.

796
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:09,285
Oh, okay.

797
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,422
Seriously?

798
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:15,545
Oh, yeah. You know I don't care
about stupid shit like that.

799
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:22,165
<i>Right, sorry,
I've adjusted to normal people</i>

800
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:24,233
so your presence is gonna
take some realignment.

801
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:25,835
You moving?

802
00:43:25,837 --> 00:43:29,539
Uh, no, kind... kind of.

803
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:32,775
Um, do you want anything,
by the way? Like, uh...

804
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,277
I want to talk.

805
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:49,325
What?

806
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,864
Nothing, for a second I...

807
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,800
I forgot what you looked like.

808
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,908
For the record,
I've never forgotten what you looked like.

809
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,346
Okay, chill out, okay.
I didn't sleep with anyone!

810
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:13,950
Okay, did you see and/or touch
another man's penis in any way?

811
00:44:13,952 --> 00:44:16,019
<i>Really? Out of all the
things you want to know</i>

812
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:17,854
<i>this is what you wanna ask me the most?</i>

813
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:20,790
What kinda question is that. Of course
that's what I want to know the most!

814
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:22,592
No. Penises were not involved.

815
00:44:22,594 --> 00:44:24,360
Were your boobs and/or vagina...

816
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:29,365
No. It was texts.
That's all it was.

817
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:32,101
I should never have gone
against my own advice.

818
00:44:32,103 --> 00:44:34,604
I should always be the better
looking one in the relationship

819
00:44:34,606 --> 00:44:35,972
but I just sort of hit an impasse on that.

820
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:38,307
Honestly, gosh, Dell,
do you really think that that...

821
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:39,776
<i>Who was it?</i>

822
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,852
It was my in-between ex... Jack.

823
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:53,456
Jack, the MTV exec?
Are you fucking serious?

824
00:44:53,458 --> 00:44:55,191
I thought you hated MTV!

825
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,993
Isn't he short?

826
00:44:56,995 --> 00:44:58,661
He's not tall.

827
00:44:58,663 --> 00:45:00,463
Wha... Are you seriously
defending him?

828
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:03,099
You can't call him short, you
have to go with "not tall?"

829
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:05,468
Jesus, you like him?
Why the fuck are you being

830
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:07,336
<i>so sangfroid over this shit?</i>

831
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:09,405
<i>You're being way too easy on yourself!</i>

832
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:15,378
You should know I'm standing in the
middle of a monsoon right now.

833
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,381
Well... so, maybe I should
let you go then?

834
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:20,550
Why? Because I'm standing
in the middle of a monsoon?

835
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:23,319
No, because you...
Yes, because you're standing

836
00:45:23,321 --> 00:45:24,987
in the middle of a monsoon!

837
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:30,893
Um...

838
00:45:35,499 --> 00:45:36,999
Are you okay?

839
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:38,701
What are you staring at?

840
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,375
<i>Oh, my thesis.</i>

841
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:53,382
<i>That reminds me. I've been
keeping articles about you.</i>

842
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:56,018
<i>They said that your drug
led to major breakthroughs</i>

843
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:59,622
<i>in cancer treatment.
It's amazing, Dell.</i>

844
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:01,924
Your mom, especially, must be proud.

845
00:46:06,663 --> 00:46:08,431
- That's me and...
- Jack.

846
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:13,536
How long have you guys been engaged?

847
00:46:13,538 --> 00:46:16,005
So... what are you
talking about?

848
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:18,608
You've boxed up a lot of old
kitchen appliances over there

849
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,109
which means you've either declared a fatwa

850
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,411
on General Electric or you're
wedding registering the fuck

851
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:23,946
out of your friends and family.

852
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:26,983
You've been fidgeting with
your ring finger non-stop.

853
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:28,785
You're also giving me that look
like you're trying to think

854
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:30,453
of a lie real quick.

855
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,423
I might beat the shit out of you.

856
00:46:35,926 --> 00:46:37,927
The wedding's in a few weeks.

857
00:46:39,062 --> 00:46:40,942
Question is, where's the ring?

858
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,166
It's getting sized.

859
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,101
Huh?

860
00:46:45,103 --> 00:46:47,170
Question number two,
why didn't you tell me?

861
00:46:47,172 --> 00:46:48,704
I was going to tell you

862
00:46:48,706 --> 00:46:50,506
before you did your whole
annoying MacGyver thing.

863
00:46:50,508 --> 00:46:52,842
I don't think that's the
reference you're looking for.

864
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:54,710
Does Jack even know I'm here?

865
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:56,846
Trust me, he knows you're here.

866
00:46:56,848 --> 00:46:59,315
What does that mean?
Why did you scoff?

867
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,617
What scoff? I didn't scoff.

868
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:02,885
You scoffed.

869
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,867
You guys fought about me coming.

870
00:47:07,925 --> 00:47:10,760
I'm actually kind of flattered,
didn't know yours truly

871
00:47:10,762 --> 00:47:13,129
could threaten the evil
prince of the MTV generation.

872
00:47:13,131 --> 00:47:15,064
First of all, Jack's leaving MTV.

873
00:47:15,066 --> 00:47:17,366
His article in Esquire was
optioned by George Clooney.

874
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:19,468
Yeah, well,
I won my fantasy baseball league last year.

875
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:21,237
Let's not talk about Jack, okay?

876
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:24,373
I'm happy to not talk about Jack.
What's the smoking rule in here?

877
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:28,177
Is he making a face? Is that...
That's just how he looks.

878
00:47:30,547 --> 00:47:35,284
So, I had a very vivid dream
the other night about us.

879
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:39,922
A vivid dream? What was
it about, this vivid dream?

880
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,392
<i>It was a dream of memories.</i>

881
00:47:43,394 --> 00:47:45,795
<i>'Uh, conversations
that we've had.'</i>

882
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:49,365
<i>'I saved your life.'</i>

883
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:52,568
You owe the person that saved you,
don't you think?

884
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:56,572
You had a dream that was
really a series of memories

885
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:58,608
of conversations we've had?

886
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:01,210
Yeah, don't hurt yourself,
it's not that complicated.

887
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:02,879
<i>Cause to the brain,
there's no difference between</i>

888
00:48:02,881 --> 00:48:04,747
reality and dreams.

889
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:07,083
They were just memories
of us over the years.

890
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:09,819
What if I don't subscribe

891
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:11,854
to a culture of indentured servitude?

892
00:48:11,856 --> 00:48:16,359
You can't unsubscribe.
It's a thing of nature

893
00:48:16,361 --> 00:48:18,060
it's here to stay.

894
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:19,695
They weaved in and out of each other

895
00:48:19,697 --> 00:48:22,098
like those M.C. Escher drawings.

896
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,133
So, one second I'd be on that train

897
00:48:24,135 --> 00:48:27,570
that time we got back together
after our first breakup

898
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:30,172
another second
I was on the phone in New York.

899
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,812
The last time we ever talked to each other.

900
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:39,482
But they blended together like a...

901
00:48:39,484 --> 00:48:41,083
<i>Painting?</i>

902
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:43,019
I saved your life.

903
00:48:43,021 --> 00:48:45,354
If it weren't for me,
you would have been run over

904
00:48:45,356 --> 00:48:46,923
by that car.

905
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:48,758
<i>You would have been splat</i>

906
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,727
just like my timeless life painting thing.

907
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:55,698
And they were all real...

908
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,768
But there was one moment in
the dream that was, um...

909
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:01,938
Well, it... it...
it was one we never had,

910
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,407
it was the only one.

911
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:07,209
<i>What was it about?
This made-up moment?</i>

912
00:49:07,211 --> 00:49:10,212
It's gonna sound weird,
but it was us talking

913
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:13,249
after not having talked for however long.

914
00:49:13,251 --> 00:49:15,484
<i>So, wait, I'm confused.
It was...</i>

915
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:18,955
This moment. This moment
that we're having right now.

916
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:21,590
So me coming over, seeing your
apartment, your life with Jack

917
00:49:21,592 --> 00:49:23,225
and reconnecting...

918
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:34,403
Oh, God, I feel sick.
I blame L.A. for this.

919
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:37,526
This is what happens when you fall
in love in Los Angeles. Fuck!

920
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:42,578
So, what is this? Are you
breaking up with me?

921
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,113
<i>I don't want to, no.</i>

922
00:49:44,115 --> 00:49:46,549
But you like this Jack guy, right?

923
00:49:46,551 --> 00:49:49,251
Do you realize Jack Tripper was one of
my favorite characters in all of fiction

924
00:49:49,253 --> 00:49:51,754
and you've forever ruined his good name?

925
00:49:51,756 --> 00:49:53,022
Shit! Can I...

926
00:49:53,024 --> 00:49:55,157
Shit, I can't even order
a Jack and Coke anymore!

927
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,926
A vodka soda!

928
00:49:56,928 --> 00:49:59,695
A vodka soda? My life is ruined!

929
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:02,164
Okay. We should just
get off the phone, okay.

930
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:06,002
You're mad, and any words we exchange
now are gonna be bleak at best...

931
00:50:06,004 --> 00:50:08,637
I can't believe this. You used to
never want to get off the phone.

932
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:11,440
No, I used to want to get off
the phone, I just used to not.

933
00:50:11,442 --> 00:50:13,142
And now you can't<i> wait
</i> to get off the phone.

934
00:50:13,144 --> 00:50:15,511
<i>I don't even know what we're
fighting about anymore, okay.</i>

935
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:17,646
If you wanna yell at me about
Jack, fine, but I'm too tired

936
00:50:17,648 --> 00:50:20,049
for another one of your meta arguments.

937
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:22,418
I don't deserve to be treated like this.

938
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,453
<i>I thought you were supposed
to be my indentured servant?</i>

939
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:26,055
<i>Whatever happened to that, huh?</i>

940
00:50:26,057 --> 00:50:27,923
So, what are you talking about right now?

941
00:50:27,925 --> 00:50:30,459
<i>I'm talking about that-that
prescription to life thing.</i>

942
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:33,529
Right, except it's subscription to nature.

943
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:34,864
Whatever.

944
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:37,266
No, you have this backwards,
kid, I saved your life.

945
00:50:37,268 --> 00:50:38,968
<i>But then I saved your life.</i>

946
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:41,537
When were on the train, we ran into
each other, and we got back together.

947
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,873
You mean, when you stalked and
followed me onto the train?

948
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,508
<i>I saved your life because
you got off at Chico.</i>

949
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:46,642
<i>You weren't supposed to get off at Chico.</i>

950
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:47,943
You were supposed to go on to Portland,

951
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:49,645
but because of me you got
off at Chico instead

952
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:51,168
and you weren't on the
train when it derailed.

953
00:50:51,194 --> 00:50:51,847
You could have died.

954
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:53,716
<i>No one died, Dell.</i>

955
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:54,884
The point remains...

956
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:56,652
No, that's not the same, okay.

957
00:50:56,654 --> 00:50:59,221
You would absolutely have
died had I not saved you.

958
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:02,591
Plus, I saw that car coming. I knew it
was going to hit you, and I saved you.

959
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:04,260
I knowingly saved you.

960
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:07,430
Yeah, well, that's starting to
feel like a minus, not a plus.

961
00:51:07,432 --> 00:51:09,732
Be that as it may,
you didn't know you were saving me.

962
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:11,534
You were just trying to
get back in my pants.

963
00:51:11,536 --> 00:51:14,136
No! I was trying
to get you back!

964
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:16,072
Which just happens to include
getting into your pants.

965
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:19,108
So yours was a sinister doing,
mine was pure altruism.

966
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:21,510
But I knowingly saved you too.

967
00:51:21,512 --> 00:51:23,412
We just went over this, pothead...

968
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,881
You were supposed to get off
at Portland to meet Jack

969
00:51:25,883 --> 00:51:28,084
but I knowingly saved you from him.

970
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,154
Except I didn't, did I?

971
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,733
Fuck!

972
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:55,077
I should have told you I loved you more.

973
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:57,446
When we were together, I mean.

974
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:59,915
<i>I was also such a dick to you</i>

975
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:01,717
but I thought you'd find it
endearing for some reason

976
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:06,455
like... like people feel about
Don Rickles or Mussolini.

977
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:09,525
It's not an excuse, it's just a reason.

978
00:52:09,527 --> 00:52:11,193
Anyway, I'm sorry, okay.

979
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,104
I need a drink. In a bad way.

980
00:52:22,106 --> 00:52:25,174
There's a bar car here,
they sell drinks. Let's go.

981
00:52:25,176 --> 00:52:28,711
No, doesn't that mean we have
to walk in between the cars?

982
00:52:28,713 --> 00:52:30,246
No, I can't do that while
the train's moving.

983
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:32,615
- Oh, don't be such a pussy.
- Said the dick.

984
00:52:32,617 --> 00:52:34,416
Besides, the world's at war right
now, so I think we should...

985
00:52:34,418 --> 00:52:37,253
We should take every little opportunity
to put ourselves in harm's way.

986
00:52:37,255 --> 00:52:39,054
Alleviate some of the guilt, you know?

987
00:52:39,056 --> 00:52:42,791
No, no, there's all the scary
noises that the train makes

988
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:44,226
and what if I fell?

989
00:52:44,228 --> 00:52:46,095
I don't have the best
relationship with gravity.

990
00:52:46,097 --> 00:52:48,330
Put your iPod on and play something calming

991
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,632
that'll drown out the sound,

992
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:52,935
and I'll hold your hand.
So you don't fall.

993
00:52:52,937 --> 00:52:56,105
Come on. Come on.

994
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,189
I won't let you go. I promise.

Have you ever tried asking someone.

1006
00:55:02,933 --> 00:55:06,368
"Where's my fucking money?"
You ever done that?

1007
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:09,071
You mean, at random,
or when I'm actually owed money?

1008
00:55:09,073 --> 00:55:10,539
No, at random obviously.

1009
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:12,641
Right, I don't know what I was thinking.

1010
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,810
It's fun, you should
try it. Ask me.

1011
00:55:17,248 --> 00:55:19,415
Ask me where's my fucking money?

1012
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,087
Where's my fucking money?

1013
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:26,889
Where's my fucking money?

1014
00:55:26,891 --> 00:55:30,592
Oh, no, motherfucker.
Where's my fucking money!

1015
00:55:30,594 --> 00:55:33,162
If I don't get my fucking
money right fucking now...

1016
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:37,032
Where's my goddamn money, you motherfucker?

1017
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,336
What the fuck?

1018
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:46,141
Jesus.

1019
00:55:47,577 --> 00:55:49,211
That was really fun.

1020
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:56,785
Wait. It's just that...

1021
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:59,822
Say what you were going to say,
and then, after you say it

1022
00:55:59,824 --> 00:56:01,957
maybe we should, like,
not talk for a minute.

1023
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:05,227
You know, like, let a whole minute
pass by without saying something.

1024
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:07,093
But go ahead and say
what you were gonna say

1025
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:08,774
and then we can start right after that.

1026
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:12,901
I'm really gonna miss you tomorrow.

1027
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:48,837
So, wait, you're saying you
dreamt this conversation?

1028
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:50,939
A conversation that didn't
take place until now?

1029
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:53,542
I'm saying I dreamt a bunch of
conversations, including this one

1030
00:56:53,544 --> 00:56:57,146
which led me to come here,
because it made me think

1031
00:56:57,148 --> 00:56:59,181
about how much I regretted...

1032
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:03,419
Do you regret meeting me, Dell?

1033
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:07,156
No, of course not.

1034
00:57:07,158 --> 00:57:10,192
I'm glad we dated.
I needed to date you.

1035
00:57:10,194 --> 00:57:13,362
Before you, I only dated guys
that looked good on paper.

1036
00:57:13,364 --> 00:57:15,097
Yeah.

1037
00:57:16,132 --> 00:57:17,499
Wait, what?

1038
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:19,835
You were really, really smart,

1039
00:57:19,837 --> 00:57:23,138
but also selfish, crass...

1040
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,574
Not always in an
entertaining way, mind you.

1041
00:57:25,576 --> 00:57:28,243
You hated your job and life

1042
00:57:28,245 --> 00:57:31,313
and you were completely
comfortable being miserable.

1043
00:57:31,315 --> 00:57:34,883
You're horrible on paper.
And I loved you.

1044
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:39,721
Being with you made me realize it...

1045
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:42,658
Doesn't have to look good
on paper to feel good.

1046
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,638
- What kind of sandwich...
- PB and J.

1047
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,140
Of course.

1048
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:03,045
- What's your favorite word?
- Comet.

1049
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:06,348
- "Comet?"
- Right.

1050
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:13,689
Not like "proliferate," "ensconce"

1051
00:58:13,691 --> 00:58:16,625
"kerfuffle," or "serendipity."

1052
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:18,827
"Comet?" Like...

1053
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:24,466
"comet?"

1054
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:26,969
Yeah. Exactly like that.

1055
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:31,373
What about your least favorite word?

1056
00:58:31,375 --> 00:58:34,276
I don't strongly dislike any word.

1057
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:36,879
I sort of have a love-hate
relationship with the word

1058
00:58:36,881 --> 00:58:39,781
"fingerfuck," but that's
technically two words

1059
00:58:39,783 --> 00:58:42,184
and I like each one separately.

1060
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:52,394
So, do you ever wish you could,
like, control society

1061
00:58:52,396 --> 00:58:54,062
for a couple of minutes?

1062
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:56,732
Like make them all hate MTV or something?

1063
00:58:56,734 --> 00:58:59,868
I don't think MTV is as
important as you think it is.

1064
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:05,007
You're so wrong.
MTV is so manipulative.

1065
00:59:05,009 --> 00:59:08,143
It's like a drug which you
get hooked on at age twelve

1066
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:11,480
that you can't wake up from until
you're probably, like, thirty

1067
00:59:11,482 --> 00:59:13,849
when you finally realize
how awful it really was.

1068
00:59:13,851 --> 00:59:15,584
But by then, it's too late.

1069
00:59:15,586 --> 00:59:17,386
They've, like, won.

1070
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:18,820
You've watched all their commercials

1071
00:59:18,822 --> 00:59:20,389
during their week's sweep.

1072
00:59:20,391 --> 00:59:22,024
I believe it's "sweeps week."

1073
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:27,930
You don't deserve me.
I can tell.

1074
00:59:27,932 --> 00:59:30,399
That's perfect.
I want someone I don't deserve.

1075
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:35,070
You think you've won me.

1076
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:39,107
I can't believe you think
you've won me already.

1077
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:42,578
Are you kidding?
You ditched a much prettier man

1078
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,013
to stay with me.
I've definitely won you.

1079
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,851
You're so wrong, my friend.

1080
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,341
Holy shit.

1081
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:16,011
You are so easily amused.

1082
01:00:16,013 --> 01:00:20,148
<i>Cause of the boots, huh?
Sarah's stupid idea.</i>

1083
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:23,285
Louis L'Amour is her favorite
novelist, so, here we are.

1084
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:27,956
You know I just realized. I
don't even know why we're here.

1085
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,858
I don't even like Sarah.

1086
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:32,127
Fire.

1087
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:34,763
Just let me have this, and then we'll go.

1088
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:44,840
What are you doing?

1089
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,154
This feels like a dream...

1090
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:18,607
I love it when you look out windows.

1091
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,048
Sir...

1092
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:28,410
Did you damage the bathroom
about thirty minutes ago?

1093
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,156
Well, I'm obviously going
to tell you that I didn't.

1094
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:39,461
- Sir.
- What?

1095
01:01:39,463 --> 01:01:42,798
I'm gonna have to ask you to
get off at the next stop.

1096
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:45,167
Don't let me find you on here after Chico.

1097
01:01:45,169 --> 01:01:46,802
Okay.

1098
01:01:46,804 --> 01:01:49,271
- You got me?
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

1099
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,243
I don't even wanna ask.

1100
01:01:55,245 --> 01:01:57,679
Looks like our little
tryst is about to end.

1101
01:01:57,681 --> 01:02:00,248
Get off at Chico with me, please. We
can have an hour to two hour talk.

1102
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,050
And then if you want, I'll get
you another ticket to Portland.

1103
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:05,187
An hour to two hour talk?
That's a long time, Dell.

1104
01:02:05,189 --> 01:02:07,589
Well, I'm not meeting anyone so.

1105
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:11,059
Wait, what?

1106
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:14,196
There's no... girl.

1107
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:17,833
So, wha... what was this?

1108
01:02:17,835 --> 01:02:20,402
Just another one of your
stupid mind games, Dell?

1109
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:23,705
Why did you lie? And what
happened to your hand?

1110
01:02:23,707 --> 01:02:26,508
You're always hiding things!
I'm sitting somewhere else.

1111
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:28,510
Now, listen, wait...
No, no. Stop, stop, stop.

1112
01:02:28,512 --> 01:02:31,313
I'm sorry. I lied because I thought
it'd make it easier, okay?

1113
01:02:31,315 --> 01:02:32,948
- You thought it'd make it easier?
- Yeah.

1114
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:35,150
You thought it'd make what easier exactly?

1115
01:02:35,152 --> 01:02:37,452
- Talking to you.
- Why would it make it easier?

1116
01:02:37,454 --> 01:02:40,856
Because I didn't think you'd talk to me
if you knew I was trying to get you back.

1117
01:02:40,858 --> 01:02:44,226
So what was this?
Is this a plan to win me back?

1118
01:02:44,228 --> 01:02:46,828
Yes, it was. It was a whim
that turned into a plan.

1119
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:49,131
How did you even know I was on this train?

1120
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:51,600
Because I've... I've...
I've stalked you.

1121
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:57,139
You could've called, Dell.

1122
01:02:57,141 --> 01:03:00,075
- You haven't talked to me in a long time.
- I know.

1123
01:03:00,077 --> 01:03:02,110
You have my phone number,
you have my e-mail

1124
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,679
but you haven't contacted me once,
not once in months.

1125
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:07,282
Just... Look, I know a great
public library in Chico

1126
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,317
where we can talk.
We can talk about all of this.

1127
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:11,686
You wanna go to a public library to talk?

1128
01:03:11,688 --> 01:03:12,821
That seems counter-intuitive.

1129
01:03:12,823 --> 01:03:14,623
Well, they have a talking area.

1130
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:17,793
You happen to know of a public library
in Chico with a talking area?

1131
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:19,494
Yeah.

1132
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:24,399
First, answer my question.

1133
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:26,535
How come you never proposed?

1134
01:03:26,537 --> 01:03:28,436
Come on, Kim, you broke up with me.

1135
01:03:28,438 --> 01:03:29,671
How come you didn't fight for me?

1136
01:03:29,673 --> 01:03:31,239
It felt like the end of days when you left.

1137
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:32,541
I ate Ramen for months.

1138
01:03:32,543 --> 01:03:34,743
I had a huge sodium imbalance.
I barely got through it.

1139
01:03:34,745 --> 01:03:37,813
I didn't think I could do it again. Felt
like my fucking world was gonna blow.

1140
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:40,182
So me leaving you constitutes
your world blowing up?

1141
01:03:40,184 --> 01:03:41,516
Yes. It does actually.

1142
01:03:41,518 --> 01:03:42,884
<i>Next stop, Chico.</i>

1143
01:03:42,886 --> 01:03:45,187
Please, come on.

1144
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:48,990
I want you to do this.

1145
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:56,898
Why wouldn't you want this forever?

1146
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,702
I'd like for once to understand

1147
01:04:00,704 --> 01:04:03,238
why you wouldn't want this always.

1148
01:04:04,774 --> 01:04:06,775
It's always as scary.

1149
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:10,312
There's a finality to it.

1150
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:15,717
I just don't ever want you
to feel like a limitation.

1151
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:21,122
Okay, let me go a different way with it.

1152
01:04:21,124 --> 01:04:23,024
Why are girls so scared of cockroaches?

1153
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:25,727
<i>Cause you think they're gonna
hurt you even though they can't.</i>

1154
01:04:25,729 --> 01:04:27,629
Just like I'm afraid "always" will hurt me.

1155
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:29,898
- They're both irrational.
- False on so many fronts.

1156
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,199
Why?

1157
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:32,601
Girls are afraid of cockroaches

1158
01:04:32,603 --> 01:04:33,735
because they're gross

1159
01:04:33,737 --> 01:04:36,037
and they carry disease,
proven by the fact that

1160
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,906
they were one of the biblical plagues.

1161
01:04:37,908 --> 01:04:40,575
Also, they also love to
lay eggs in your vagina.

1162
01:04:40,577 --> 01:04:42,711
Secondly, it's not irrational to think that

1163
01:04:42,713 --> 01:04:45,280
commitment can hurt you...

1164
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:46,848
Because it can.

1165
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:58,793
Know that when a steal a girl's twenties...

1166
01:04:58,795 --> 01:05:00,829
It's dangerous business, buster.

1167
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,970
You're officially
on notice, Mr. Pink Lighter.

1168
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:14,743
- Duly noted, Mrs. Pink Lighter.
- Nope, can't call me that.

1169
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,812
You don't want to marry me, remember?

1170
01:05:17,814 --> 01:05:19,981
I didn't say that.

1171
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:23,118
Where's my phone?

1172
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:26,321
Where's my phone?
Where's my fuckin' phone?

1173
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:42,037
Why don't I call it?

1174
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,706
Why are you acting like that?

1175
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:47,642
- Like what?
- Uncomfortable.

1176
01:05:47,644 --> 01:05:49,244
In the two years we've known each other

1177
01:05:49,246 --> 01:05:50,912
I've rarely seen you uncomfortable.

1178
01:05:50,914 --> 01:05:53,181
<i>I... I'm not.</i>

1179
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:55,450
You are.

1180
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:56,952
You're hiding something from me.

1181
01:05:56,954 --> 01:05:59,387
<i>Ah, God, you just got too stoned, Kimberly.</i>

1182
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:01,089
<i>And I thought we were going
after your last cigarette.</i>

1183
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:02,757
- <i>What're you doing?</i>
- What're you hiding?

1184
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:05,260
- You know something?
- <i>There's no "something."</i>

1185
01:06:05,262 --> 01:06:06,695
<i>You just got too high.</i>

1186
01:06:06,697 --> 01:06:08,196
You best motherfucking
believe there's a something.

1187
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:09,531
There's always a something.

1188
01:06:09,533 --> 01:06:11,566
Okay? This is not the first
time I've felt that.

1189
01:06:11,568 --> 01:06:13,168
- <i>Felt what?</i>
- You...

1190
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:14,703
Saying something like you've slipped.

1191
01:06:14,705 --> 01:06:16,071
<i>I didn't slip...</i>

1192
01:06:16,073 --> 01:06:18,640
Like a cartoon character on a banana peel.

1193
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:20,576
<i>You know what? You're actually
starting to freak me out.</i>

1194
01:06:20,602 --> 01:06:21,476
<i>There's nothing going on.</i>

1195
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,345
Well, it's about time you're freaked.

1196
01:06:23,347 --> 01:06:26,881
Okay. I hate always feeling like
the freak in this relationship!

1197
01:06:26,883 --> 01:06:28,283
<i>Why're you doing this?</i>

1198
01:06:28,285 --> 01:06:30,518
Because there's something
you're not telling me.

1199
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,088
Okay. I know you, and I know
when you get uncomfortable.

1200
01:06:33,090 --> 01:06:34,889
And it's so rare that I've formed

1201
01:06:34,891 --> 01:06:37,392
an acute discomfort detector on you.

1202
01:06:37,394 --> 01:06:39,594
Now, are you gonna tell me what it
is or are you going to force me

1203
01:06:39,596 --> 01:06:42,030
to be late to my own annoying
friend's Louis L'Amour

1204
01:06:42,032 --> 01:06:45,333
goddamn western-themed wedding?

1205
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:54,142
Kimberly, let's not do this.
This is paranoia.

1206
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:09,357
Hey. Kim.

1207
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:14,662
Look at me.

1208
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:16,931
Keep looking.

1209
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,741
You're right. You're right.

1210
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:29,177
There is something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1211
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:37,719
In the dream,
I told you I wanted to be with you.

1212
01:07:37,721 --> 01:07:40,161
I wanted you to leave Jack and
to walk out the door with me.

1213
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:45,794
Wow.

1214
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:52,267
- Do you feel that?
- What?

1215
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:57,472
<i>Okay, calm down.
Maybe you just need some air.</i>

1216
01:07:57,474 --> 01:07:59,908
<i>Let's go up to the rooftop.</i>

1217
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:01,743
So, what else happens in this dream?

1218
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:04,212
Do I... Do I go with you?

1219
01:08:04,214 --> 01:08:06,247
All happily ever after and the like?

1220
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:09,484
Or do I slap you and tell you to be gone.

1221
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:11,853
I don't know, actually.
We were looking at each other

1222
01:08:11,855 --> 01:08:13,788
and I went to kiss you

1223
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:16,191
and before our lips touched, I woke up.

1224
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:20,762
<i>What?</i>

1225
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:25,934
<i>Maybe I never saved you that night we met.</i>

1226
01:08:25,936 --> 01:08:28,636
<i>Maybe you did die, hit by that car.</i>

1227
01:08:28,638 --> 01:08:31,439
And this is just some afterlife fantasy

1228
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:33,308
playing out in your head.

1229
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:36,511
- What?
- Something feels weird.

1230
01:08:39,748 --> 01:08:42,317
Remember how I used to love
flipping the pillow over

1231
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,952
to feel the cold side?

1232
01:08:43,954 --> 01:08:45,854
Yeah.

1233
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:49,791
That's what our relationship felt like.

1234
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,660
Constant tossing and turning

1235
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:54,829
looking for that perfect balance.

1236
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:58,700
Sometimes it was there, and other times...

1237
01:08:58,702 --> 01:09:00,602
I know, I know.

1238
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:06,241
You always expected us to break up.

1239
01:09:06,243 --> 01:09:07,642
Why was that?

1240
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:10,004
Is that because of your dumb
five-minutes-from-now rule?

1241
01:09:11,714 --> 01:09:13,281
You know, after we stopped talking

1242
01:09:13,283 --> 01:09:14,816
the five-minute rule started shrinking.

1243
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:19,120
It went to four minutes,
to three, then two, then one...

1244
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:24,792
Let's go up to
the rooftop. Come on.

1245
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:29,330
I thought my unconscious was trying
to tell me something, you know.

1246
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:31,666
By dreaming that dream a few nights ago.

1247
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:33,635
Coming here, talking to you.

1248
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:36,905
That might close the gap, that last minute.

1249
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:42,410
Or...

1250
01:09:42,412 --> 01:09:44,812
Or none of this is really happening.

1251
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,385
This could still be your dream.

1252
01:09:50,387 --> 01:09:52,220
♪ <i>Dum dum dum</i> ♪♪

1253
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,792
Fuck!

1254
01:09:57,794 --> 01:09:59,460
What? What happened?

1255
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:02,397
<i>Fuckin' bird carcass on my windshield!</i>

1256
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:05,400
What? Okay. Slow down,
tell me what's going on.

1257
01:10:05,402 --> 01:10:06,968
I'm saying a fucking bird just

1258
01:10:06,970 --> 01:10:09,804
committed suicide on my windshield!

1259
01:10:09,806 --> 01:10:13,841
<i>What? In the middle
of our conversation?</i>

1260
01:10:13,843 --> 01:10:16,411
What is our conversation
have to do with anything?

1261
01:10:16,413 --> 01:10:18,146
It must mean something.

1262
01:10:18,148 --> 01:10:19,948
It must mean
that the... that the...

1263
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:22,350
Maybe the bird was
commenting on our situation.

1264
01:10:22,352 --> 01:10:23,885
Commenting?

1265
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:25,688
You think this is commentary?

1266
01:10:25,689 --> 01:10:28,089
Definitely, I mean,
it's something, the universe

1267
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:31,392
cosmos, all that,
via the bird, sent us a signal.

1268
01:10:31,394 --> 01:10:32,827
Yeah.

1269
01:10:32,829 --> 01:10:34,462
Okay.

1270
01:10:34,464 --> 01:10:37,332
I want you to listen to me
very, very carefully. Okay?

1271
01:10:37,334 --> 01:10:39,267
Okay, you're gonna be mean.
Aren't you?

1272
01:10:39,269 --> 01:10:42,036
On this already horrible call,
you're gonna be mean on top of it.

1273
01:10:42,038 --> 01:10:45,440
<i>You are very, very, very...</i>

1274
01:10:45,442 --> 01:10:47,609
You know what?
I can't even say "very" enough

1275
01:10:47,611 --> 01:10:50,645
so just imagine an infinite
number of "verys." Okay?

1276
01:10:50,647 --> 01:10:52,747
Well, I don't have that
kind of imagination.

1277
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,716
I barely picture odd numbered things.

1278
01:10:54,718 --> 01:10:56,351
Well, freakin' try, okay?

1279
01:10:56,353 --> 01:10:59,220
<i>Cause that number of "verys" precedes sick.</i>

1280
01:10:59,222 --> 01:11:01,756
Sick. S-I-C-K.

1281
01:11:01,758 --> 01:11:03,558
Told you you were gonna be mean.

1282
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,427
And condescending,
as if I didn't know how to spell sick.

1283
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:09,330
You are not being a nice person right now!

1284
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:26,881
So, I'm at the gun range.

1285
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:31,819
This is a nightmare.

1286
01:11:31,821 --> 01:11:35,657
Sartre was right,
"Hell is other people."

1287
01:11:35,659 --> 01:11:38,860
I should go, I've got my goggles on.

1288
01:11:38,862 --> 01:11:40,895
<i>You did this on purpose, didn't you?</i>

1289
01:11:40,897 --> 01:11:44,365
You wanted me to find out when
I was three thousand miles away.

1290
01:11:44,367 --> 01:11:45,967
You were telegraphing all the signs

1291
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:47,669
like you were Samuel fucking Morse.

1292
01:11:47,671 --> 01:11:51,472
You wanted me to know. That's
the part that hurts the most.

1293
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:53,241
<i>Why would I want that?</i>

1294
01:11:53,243 --> 01:11:55,677
Because maybe your
feelings for him are real.

1295
01:11:59,648 --> 01:12:01,716
How long has it been going on?

1296
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,855
- About a month.
- <i>A month! Oh shit!</i>

1297
01:12:07,857 --> 01:12:09,991
<i>I'm so sorry for interrupting
the honeymoon period.</i>

1298
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:12,560
I hear those are the best
parts of a relationship.

1299
01:12:12,562 --> 01:12:15,129
I-I'm gonna go, okay,
I've got my goggles on...

1300
01:12:15,131 --> 01:12:17,932
Yes, I fucking heard you.
Enough with the goggles already!

1301
01:12:17,934 --> 01:12:20,234
Jesus Christ! How're you
gonna get off the phone

1302
01:12:20,236 --> 01:12:22,036
and just go about your day after this, huh?

1303
01:12:22,038 --> 01:12:23,839
Because I don't think all
of our conversations

1304
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,840
need to necessarily feel good.

1305
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:27,175
<i>They should feel bad then?</i>

1306
01:12:27,177 --> 01:12:29,577
They should be whatever the
conversation should...

1307
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:32,246
I don't know. Why are you
analyzing this so much?

1308
01:12:32,248 --> 01:12:33,815
<i>Oh, I'm not analyzing you yet.</i>

1309
01:12:33,817 --> 01:12:35,950
I'm just giving you my
initial gut reaction.

1310
01:12:35,952 --> 01:12:38,286
Can I please get off the phone with you

1311
01:12:38,288 --> 01:12:39,654
and not feel like shit...

1312
01:12:39,656 --> 01:12:41,489
You hurt me!

1313
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:48,062
You really hurt me this time, Kimberly.

1314
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:59,407
I wanna break up with you.

1315
01:12:59,409 --> 01:13:01,275
I don't love you.

1316
01:13:01,277 --> 01:13:04,512
Dell, that's not what you want to say...

1317
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:10,451
That is what I want
to say actually. I don't...

1318
01:13:10,453 --> 01:13:12,453
I don't love you, Kimberly.

1319
01:13:12,455 --> 01:13:15,790
Honestly,
I don't know if I ever really did.

1320
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:17,759
<i>And you definitely didn't.</i>

1321
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:20,061
If you're capable of making
choices that knowingly hurts

1322
01:13:20,063 --> 01:13:22,997
the other person, that's not love.

1323
01:13:22,999 --> 01:13:25,433
Okay, you're mad, you're mad...

1324
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:30,571
How can you say that?

1325
01:13:30,573 --> 01:13:32,607
<i>Reality is I could have
met any number of girls</i>

1326
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:34,475
<i>to be with for a few years.</i>

1327
01:13:36,546 --> 01:13:38,913
That was your lie. Alright?

1328
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:40,515
<i>Texting Jack behind my back.</i>

1329
01:13:40,517 --> 01:13:42,383
<i>It came when I least expected it.</i>

1330
01:13:42,385 --> 01:13:44,585
I fell for it hook, line and sinker

1331
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:46,387
and it fucking hurts.

1332
01:13:46,389 --> 01:13:48,489
That was your lie.

1333
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:50,792
- Bravo.
- <i>Okay, fine.</i>

1334
01:13:50,794 --> 01:13:52,894
You wanna hurt me?
You wanna be right?

1335
01:13:52,896 --> 01:13:54,996
Fine, go ahead. Be right.

1336
01:13:54,998 --> 01:13:56,798
All I ever wanted was the truth.

1337
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,866
No, no, you wanna be right.

1338
01:13:58,868 --> 01:14:00,501
<i>No. Truth is not
what you're after.</i>

1339
01:14:00,503 --> 01:14:03,070
<i>Because if you wanted the truth,
then you would have to accept</i>

1340
01:14:03,072 --> 01:14:04,153
<i>the fact that I do...</i>

1341
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:20,354
Who is this?

1342
01:14:20,356 --> 01:14:22,490
<i>I'm sorry, is this Dell?</i>

1343
01:14:22,492 --> 01:14:25,426
- Who's this?
- <i>Yes, hi. This is Nancy.</i>

1344
01:14:25,428 --> 01:14:28,830
<i>I'm your mother's nurse.
We met a few times.</i>

1345
01:14:28,832 --> 01:14:30,565
Yeah.

1346
01:14:30,567 --> 01:14:34,068
<i>I'm really sorry to have to tell you this.</i>

1347
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:36,003
<i>Your mother passed away.</i>

1348
01:14:37,339 --> 01:14:39,407
What? That's impossible.

1349
01:14:39,409 --> 01:14:41,242
She's been okay for years now.

1350
01:14:41,244 --> 01:14:43,244
Her cancer's been in remission.

1351
01:14:43,246 --> 01:14:46,013
<i>She had a heart attack.</i>

1352
01:14:46,015 --> 01:14:48,349
Heart attack? Why?

1353
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:52,620
<i>Sometimes these things just happen.</i>

1354
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:01,529
<i>This feels strange.</i>

1355
01:15:03,031 --> 01:15:06,300
<i>Not what I expected my train
ride to feel like at all.</i>

1356
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:11,205
What were you expecting?

1357
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:17,945
I was expecting to read that short story.

1358
01:15:17,947 --> 01:15:19,113
The Roald Dahl one?

1359
01:15:19,115 --> 01:15:21,148
You already read it though.

1360
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:23,851
You know the ending.

1361
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:28,556
Sometimes it's not about
knowing the ending.

1362
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:40,067
It can't be the same like
it was the last time.

1363
01:15:40,069 --> 01:15:42,403
It has to be different or we'll
wind up right where we started.

1364
01:15:42,405 --> 01:15:45,206
I know. I know.

1365
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:47,975
I promise you a change.

1366
01:15:47,977 --> 01:15:49,944
I promise, okay?

1367
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:57,785
You know,
I'm falling out of love with you, right?

1368
01:15:57,787 --> 01:16:00,254
Just shut up for a second, please.

1369
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:05,259
What do you wanna tell me, Dell?

1370
01:16:05,827 --> 01:16:07,962
Kimberly...

1371
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:14,035
I used to find it annoying when
you said "so" all the time.

1372
01:16:14,037 --> 01:16:16,837
It bugged the shit out of me.

1373
01:16:16,839 --> 01:16:19,373
And I love it.

1374
01:16:19,375 --> 01:16:21,342
I love it now.

1375
01:16:21,344 --> 01:16:23,844
After we have sex and you
shrug your shoulders

1376
01:16:23,846 --> 01:16:25,947
and you say,
"I'm here all week."

1377
01:16:25,949 --> 01:16:27,715
I love that.

1378
01:16:27,717 --> 01:16:29,817
I love that a single strand
of your hair can fall

1379
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:32,453
so perfectly to the side,
and you don't even know.

1380
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:37,792
I love the little blue
veins behind your eyes.

1381
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:40,995
I love your eyes.

1382
01:16:40,997 --> 01:16:42,663
Knowing you goes down as easily

1383
01:16:42,665 --> 01:16:45,900
the best thing that's ever happened to me.

1384
01:16:45,902 --> 01:16:48,135
Easily.

1385
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:50,705
If I were a restaurant, you'd be my special

1386
01:16:50,707 --> 01:16:52,273
but nobody could order you

1387
01:16:52,275 --> 01:16:56,711
because I'd just want you to be mine,
just all mine.

1388
01:16:56,713 --> 01:16:59,080
Not in the biblical, slavery-owning sense

1389
01:16:59,082 --> 01:17:02,283
or, uh, the pimp-prostitute dynamic of,

1390
01:17:02,285 --> 01:17:05,953
"You be mine, bitch!"
but... but, just in that...

1391
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:09,924
You're my love. You're my love.

1392
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,794
But my favorite thing of all.

1393
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:18,199
I like you because you like me.

1394
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,336
I think that says a lot about

1395
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:24,179
how great you are as a person.

1396
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:34,715
<i>So, um...</i>

1397
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:39,754
<i>Dell.</i>

1398
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:48,029
Believe me.

1399
01:17:48,031 --> 01:17:50,264
Believe me when I say...

1400
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,035
You almost had me.

1401
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,832
<i>'Is that weird to imagine that one day'</i>

1402
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:26,675
<i>'this will all be old to us?'</i>

1403
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:34,642
This walk, us meeting.

1404
01:18:34,644 --> 01:18:36,844
It'll just be an old memory.

1405
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:40,881
That sounds...

1406
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,751
Sad.

1407
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:11,779
Hey, I gotta ask you a really big question.

1408
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:14,821
I don't know if you can handle it.
It's... It's really big.

1409
01:19:18,186 --> 01:19:20,154
What?

1410
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:27,687
Forget it. It's stupid.

1411
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:30,231
- What?
- <i>Forget it.</i>

1412
01:19:30,233 --> 01:19:31,932
It's a stupid joke. You'd probably
even figure it out by now.

1413
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:33,701
- Why would I know the joke?
- Because I've already said it.

1414
01:19:33,703 --> 01:19:35,536
- When?
- Earlier in the conversation.

1415
01:19:35,538 --> 01:19:37,905
When? Hey, come on.
I'm so confused!

1416
01:19:37,907 --> 01:19:39,673
Sometimes I wanna stop
people on the streets...

1417
01:19:39,675 --> 01:19:41,275
Who? - Anybody, from
all walks of life.

1418
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:43,310
On their way to work,
to the gym, to school!

1419
01:19:43,312 --> 01:19:45,846
- I wanna stop them all, grab them like I'm grabbing you right now.
- Right now?

1420
01:19:45,848 --> 01:19:47,114
Right now.
I wanna look right into their eyes

1421
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:50,184
and I wanna ask them one simple question.

1422
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:54,355
Where's my fucking money?

1423
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:20,214
I think I'm going to fall
in love with you too.

1424
01:20:20,216 --> 01:20:22,149
- Are you crying?
- Shut up.

1425
01:20:46,608 --> 01:20:48,542
<i>There's still my theory...</i>

1426
01:20:48,544 --> 01:20:52,947
<i>that this is just
part of that strange dream.</i>

1427
01:20:52,949 --> 01:20:54,882
<i>And so...</i>

1428
01:20:54,884 --> 01:20:57,518
<i>even if we do kiss,
you'll just wake up</i>

1429
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,853
<i>and it'll all be over.</i>

1430
01:21:01,223 --> 01:21:03,090
This can't be a dream.

1431
01:21:03,092 --> 01:21:04,992
What if it is?

1432
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:15,402
What're you doing?

1433
01:21:15,404 --> 01:21:17,771
Something's wrong.

1434
01:21:17,773 --> 01:21:20,307
I know it, Kimberly, I know you.

1435
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:22,443
You have circles under your eyes.

1436
01:21:22,445 --> 01:21:25,346
You were the type of girl that
could sleep through wars.

1437
01:21:25,348 --> 01:21:27,781
And despite that,
you're still looking so beautiful.

1438
01:21:27,783 --> 01:21:29,917
More beautiful than ever, in fact.

1439
01:21:29,919 --> 01:21:32,219
It's usually a sign you wanna remind
the world that you're a sexual being

1440
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,521
because your man's not
picking up the signal.

1441
01:21:34,523 --> 01:21:36,991
You've checked out of this
relationship, haven't you?

1442
01:21:36,993 --> 01:21:38,859
You're not happy.

1443
01:21:38,861 --> 01:21:40,661
Also, you're listening to Roxette.

1444
01:21:40,663 --> 01:21:42,963
I know that means the beginning of the end.

1445
01:21:42,965 --> 01:21:45,165
And let's get real for a second
about the ring, alright.

1446
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:46,934
You're not having it sized.

1447
01:21:46,936 --> 01:21:49,203
I'm sure you had your ring-size
burned into Jack's memory years ago.

1448
01:21:49,205 --> 01:21:51,538
Fuck, I still remember it, 4.5.

1449
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:54,341
You didn't wear the ring because
you didn't want me to see it.

1450
01:21:54,343 --> 01:21:57,978
Don't marry him, okay.
I want you back.

1451
01:21:57,980 --> 01:22:00,547
I know you want me back too.
That's why I'm here.

1452
01:22:00,549 --> 01:22:03,617
That's what you've been wanting
to say to me this whole time...

1453
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:05,719
- Dell.
- What?

1454
01:22:08,857 --> 01:22:10,257
I'm pregnant.

1455
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:15,696
What?

1456
01:22:15,698 --> 01:22:18,365
Morning sickness has been keeping me up.

1457
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:20,734
I just really love Roxette.

1458
01:22:22,337 --> 01:22:25,406
And I dressed this way not to
announce to the world anything.

1459
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:28,142
It was you.

1460
01:22:28,144 --> 01:22:30,277
I wanted to look good for you.

1461
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,647
Because no matter how bad
our relationship got

1462
01:22:33,649 --> 01:22:37,318
I wanted to say thank you from
the bottom of my heart for it.

1463
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,586
Because I needed it.

1464
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:43,691
I needed you in this life.

1465
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:47,795
That's what I wanted to say.

1466
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:55,069
I gotta... I gotta sit down.

1467
01:23:04,746 --> 01:23:06,413
I'm sorry.

1468
01:23:09,217 --> 01:23:11,719
I'm not leaving Jack.

1469
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:14,588
I love him.

1470
01:23:20,428 --> 01:23:22,563
Wow. You're pregnant.

1471
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:27,334
I didn't see that coming.

1472
01:23:28,269 --> 01:23:30,337
Do you know what it is yet?

1473
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:33,607
Not yet. Hoping it's a girl.

1474
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:44,818
Uh, I almost proposed to you, you know?

1475
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:51,925
When we were in that hotel room in Paris.

1476
01:23:51,927 --> 01:23:54,028
I even picked out the ring.
I had it with me.

1477
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:57,431
I was about to give it to you,
and then I took it

1478
01:23:57,433 --> 01:24:00,334
and I flushed it down the toilet.

1479
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:05,706
I keep replaying that moment
over and over again in my head.

1480
01:24:09,077 --> 01:24:11,545
Why are you crying?

1481
01:24:15,016 --> 01:24:17,818
I'm just happy to see you.

1482
01:24:18,987 --> 01:24:21,555
And it's such a beautiful night.

1483
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:30,731
I feel like I'm in the wrong world.

1484
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:35,969
<i>Cause I don't belong in a world where
we don't end up together. I don't.</i>

1485
01:24:35,971 --> 01:24:39,406
There are parallel universes out
there where this didn't happen.

1486
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,975
Where I was with you, and you were with me.

1487
01:24:41,977 --> 01:24:43,277
And whatever universe that is

1488
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:45,319
that's the one where my heart lives in.

1489
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:52,719
I wanted so badly to go back into
that dream I had the other night.

1490
01:24:52,721 --> 01:24:55,722
I tried so hard... to go
back to sleep.

1491
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:06,733
You know, I never thought
love was real. I didn't.

1492
01:25:06,735 --> 01:25:09,169
And now I think life isn't real without it.

1493
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,973
That sounds like a really
bad greeting card...

1494
01:25:12,975 --> 01:25:15,709
Don't. Don't make it a joke.

1495
01:25:20,748 --> 01:25:22,816
Truth?

1496
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,854
I think you always believed in love.

1497
01:25:26,856 --> 01:25:28,822
This is so stupid.

1498
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:32,059
So irrational.

1499
01:25:32,061 --> 01:25:34,361
Why am I so hell-bent on getting you back?

1500
01:25:34,363 --> 01:25:36,830
You fucking hate Pixar
movies for crying out loud.

1501
01:25:36,832 --> 01:25:38,365
You still have an AOL account.

1502
01:25:38,367 --> 01:25:41,168
I don't wanna be with a person like that.

1503
01:25:44,873 --> 01:25:48,475
Why does it feel so
impossible to let you go?

1504
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:53,981
It's an addiction, you know.
That's all it is.

1505
01:25:53,983 --> 01:25:57,618
It's a biochemical addiction.
It's so stupid.

1506
01:25:57,620 --> 01:25:59,052
If you think about it

1507
01:25:59,054 --> 01:26:00,787
relationships are all totally narcissistic.

1508
01:26:00,789 --> 01:26:02,823
Basically, you're just looking
for someone who'll love you

1509
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:04,358
as much as you love yourself.
That's all it is.

1510
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:06,093
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

1511
01:26:06,095 --> 01:26:08,162
No, it's not.

1512
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:14,301
No, it's not.

1513
01:26:16,437 --> 01:26:18,906
I don't know anything anymore.

1514
01:26:20,408 --> 01:26:22,976
But I know I do love you.

1515
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:32,719
- Dell...
- Just give me a minute, okay.

1516
01:26:32,743 --> 01:26:48,743

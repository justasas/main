over and over.

434

My dad was magic too.

435
00:44:33,237 --> 00:44:35,569

Where's your friend?

451
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:57,480
Willie was a greedy turd.

452
00:45:57,521 --> 00:45:58,852
He always got a double act.

What about Shay?

756
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:57,472
It's just you and me now.

757
01:16:57,512 --> 01:16:59,036
She's my friend.

01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:17,990
No.

761
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:22,830
I can't.

762
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:28,002
Tell me it wasn't all an act.

Drive,
or I'll fucking kill you!

770
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:41,848
Come on!
Step on the fucking peddle.

771
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:43,824

01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:31,538
Okay.

784
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:33,063
Holly.

[sirens wailing in distance]

790
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:21,649
It's just a scratch.

791
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:23,885
You're still beautiful.

792
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:27,454
What time's your flight?

793
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:32,428
I'll never make it now.

794
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,526
You've got to try.

795
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:38,064
I'll call Harry.

796
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:41,271
Who?

797
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:43,641
The taxi driver.

798
01:19:43,678 --> 01:19:45,543
He's also an escape artist.

Yeah.

821
01:25:22,984 --> 01:25:25,976

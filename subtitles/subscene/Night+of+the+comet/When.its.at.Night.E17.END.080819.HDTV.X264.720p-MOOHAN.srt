1
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,560
<i> Cultural assets and individuals in this
program have been altered fictionally.

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,730
<i> They have no real-life
associations with this drama.

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:19,790
Cultural assets cannot and should not
be owned by a single person.

4
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,960
They are sacred.

5
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:34,980
The “Geumdongdae” incense burner
and Duryang Kim's “Sansu” painting?

6
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,560
Is it too much?

7
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,900
I think it's quite a bargain.
Are you going to refuse?

8
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,600
Of course not.
Fine, I'll give them to you.

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:56,550
But keep in mind that you'll regret
touching my things someday.

10
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,600
Your things?

11
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,970
Cultural assets, moreover national
treasures, belong to the country, no?

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,760
That sounds more like you.

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,930
Who cares if they're
national treasures or stolen goods?

14
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,740
I paid good money for them,
so they belong to me.

15
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,510
Chairman Ohseong Jang,

16
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,710
you're under arrest for attempting
to smuggle abroad cultural assets.

17
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,780
W - what? Smuggle abroad?
This is ridiculous.

18
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,880
Don't bother denying it.

19
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,870
We not only found all the items,
but Iwazaki confessed at the airport.

20
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,610
You guys are behind all this?

21
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,640
I warned you last time
that you'd better brace yourself.

22
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,690
Just one picture.
One shot, that's it.

23
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,810
<i> Final Episode

24
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,960
Hold on!

25
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,860
Please leave.

26
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,670
How's Chairman Jang doing?

27
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,590
We're in the middle of investigating.
We don't know anything yet.

28
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,590
Please wait for
the official press release.

29
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,890
Later. Leave.

30
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,970
Just one comment, please!

31
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,880
Chairman Jang is a big catch, isn't he?

32
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,750
The reporters are gathering
like a pack of hungry wolves.

33
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,970
I know. It's going to be
a hassle dealing with them.

34
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,630
I wonder how Chief's
handling things in there.

35
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,860
He needs to get a full confession
and get promoted.

36
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,540
I dunno.
Chairman Jang won't give in easily.

37
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,790
Iwazaki testified you were very eager
to help smuggle the celadon abroad.

38
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,870
Nonsense.

39
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,860
All I did was
lend him a truck to use.

40
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:11,670
I didn't know he disguised
the celadon as plain pottery.

41
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,920
Fine, we can always confirm
the details with Iwazaki later.

42
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:24,810
Another major charge against you
is the murder of Taesoo Heo.

43
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,610
Can you prove it?

44
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,640
A case can be made against you
with just indirect evidence.

45
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,700
The fact that Mr. Kim
worked for you seven years ago,

46
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,840
and that you had all seven
national treasures Taesoo Heo stole.

47
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,880
Still gonna plead innocent?

48
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,860
As I said before,
I know nothing about Taesoo Heo.

49
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,990
You think you'll get off easy
as long as Mr. Kim isn't caught?

50
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:58,610
You're not listening.
I told you I know nothing.

51
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,670
I know your defense attorneys
are quite impressive.

52
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,640
But let me tell you that
this time it won't be so easy.

53
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,670
Then let me tell you
something as well.

54
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,900
Keep in mind that libel and
defamation are serious charges.

55
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,740
Not as serious as murder.

56
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,770
Chairman Jang must be
sweating it right now.

57
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,510
How humiliating for him.

58
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,780
I'm worried because
he won't be easy to interrogate.

59
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,570
Leave that to the investigations team. This is your cue to step away.

60
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,910
Step away?

61
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,690
It's time for you to fulfill
your duties as my girlfriend.

62
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,950
We've got a full schedule,
watching movies and eating good food.

63
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,990
So you wanna go for a drive?

64
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,660
Right now?

65
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,770
I can't.
I'm working late tonight.

66
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:53,900
Again?

67
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,810
Yeah.

68
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,580
Then let's eat before
you start working late.

69
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,570
Sorry, but I have to go
research some material.

70
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,830
Why is work always your first priority?

71
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,770
I'm really sorry.

72
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,800
Don't sulk, please.
I'll call you later, okay?

73
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,770
Hey!

74
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,880
You want me to eat alone?

75
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,880
Hey!

76
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,980
Man, I can't believe her.

77
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:28,770
Mr. Nah, check the distribution routes
to find where Iwazaki bought the celadon.

78
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:31,870
All by myself?

79
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,540
We have no choice.

80
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:36,710
The investigations team
is busy with Chairman Jang.

81
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,910
Yes, sir.
Orders are orders.

82
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,980
Chief, what should I do?

83
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:51,540
Joohyun, what got into you?
Since when do you volunteer for work?

84
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,580
Mr. Nah!
That's offensive.

85
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,690
Who found the hidden camera,
the key to Chairman Jang's arrest?

86
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,970
It was me.
Did you forget?

87
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,990
How could I?
You found it by dumb luck.

88
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,980
What did you say?

89
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,870
Both of you stop.

90
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,500
Joohyun, help Chohee find evidence
for Chairman Jang's illegal deals.

91
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,570
Okay.

92
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:22,730
Now, let's turn in for the night.
You guys must be tired.

93
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,540
Yes, sir.

94
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,590
[Your call has been transferred...]

95
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,600
Why isn't he picking up?

96
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,850
Chohee!

97
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,880
Hey, Joohyun.

98
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,820
Where were you?
You even skipped the meeting.

99
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,840
Oh, Chief didn't say anything?

100
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,660
I was preparing some material
to give to Chief Kang.

101
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,600
You have to give
what to Chief Kang?

102
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,600
This material. Why?

103
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,650
Nothing, just asking.

104
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,750
Chohee, what do you
think of Chief Kang?

105
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,680
Chief Kang?

106
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,850
I think he's a great person.

107
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,540
That's it?

108
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,680
What do you mean,
“that's it?”

109
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:20,990
Never mind.

110
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,620
Oh, right.
I forgot you have Bumsang.

111
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,530
I'll give this to Chief Kang for you.

112
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,780
Sure.

113
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,830
And Chohee, treat Bumsang well.

114
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:40,900
You were busy chasing Chairman Jang,
and now you're busy indicting him.

115
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,500
He's probably frustrated
because you're so busy.

116
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,720
Why are you suddenly so concerned
about our relationship?

117
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,930
Just ‘cause.

118
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,780
Anyway, I'll take this
to the investigations team.

119
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,890
Have fun with Bumsang. Bye.

120
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:58,880
Okay.

121
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,790
Anyway, why isn't he picking up?

122
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,750
[If you don't pick up,
I'm never talking to you again.]

123
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,840
What do you want?
You found the time to call me?

124
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,860
What?

125
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:42,690
I realized that yesterday
we agreed to eat something good.

126
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,770
I'm here to keep my promise.

127
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,690
Try some.

128
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,510
I didn't even eat anything
because I wanted to eat with you.

129
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,960
Then knock yourself out.

130
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,730
I'll get indigestion eating
with a busy person like yourself.

131
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,880
Are you still sulking?

132
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,960
At least try some
since I bought them anyway.

133
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:12,960
Don't wanna.

134
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,750
Don't be like this.

135
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,930
I came all the way over here.
What does that make me?

136
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,690
Then give me a piece.

137
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,950
What?

138
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,890
You want me to handfeed you?

139
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,730
Not if you don't wanna.
Not gonna eat then.

140
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:41,560
Fine, I can feed you one.

141
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:43,710
Here.

142
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,780
Is it good?

143
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,830
I can't tell after one piece.
Give me some of the sausage.

144
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,790
Jeez. Fine.

145
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,900
Here!

146
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,950
It's good.

147
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:11,970
Here!

148
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,710
That's a good boy.

149
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:23,540
Ow, my neck.
Man, it hurts.

150
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,590
There's nothing worth
anything in these files.

151
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,960
By the way,
I saw on the news earlier

152
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,560
that Chairman Jang's defense team set
up camp in the hotel across the street.

153
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,500
They're going to prepare
their defense all night.

154
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,590
Of course they're going
to pull all the stops.

155
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:48,870
We have to catch Mr. Kim.
He's irrefutable evidence.

156
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,710
Right.

157
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,880
Chief!

158
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,990
Joohyun, what brings
you here at this late hour?

159
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:59,520
Chohee wanted me
to give this to you.

160
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,570
Thanks.

161
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:04,800
And, tada!
Have some of this.

162
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:10,840
Hey, it's sushi rolls.
You bought these for us?

163
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,950
You guys are working late,
so I specifically bought eel rolls.

164
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:15,930
Enjoy.

165
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,500
I've been craving eel these days.

166
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,900
You really know how to hit the spot.

167
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,960
Totally.
Thanks a lot, Joohyun.

168
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,630
Chief, please have some.

169
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,810
I don't really like eel.
And I'm not very hungry.

170
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,830
I went out of my way to buy it.
Can't you eat just a little?

171
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,700
Thanks.
It's as good as eaten.

172
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,790
Officer Cho, prep for another
interrogation at midnight.

173
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,730
Yes, sir.

174
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,700
Chief!

175
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,680
Joohyun, it's so good.
Have a seat and have some.

176
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,970
I'm fine.
Please help yourselves.

177
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,850
Joohyun!

178
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,670
It's delicious.

179
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:23,800
Hey, how'd it feel
to arrest Chairman Jang?

180
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,800
How'd it feel?
Well, a little strange.

181
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:36,920
I thought I'd feel
completely relieved.

182
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,850
But strangely I feel empty
and mixed up inside.

183
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,720
Maybe because Gyoon isn't here?

184
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:51,920
Yeah, that could be it.
Speaking of Gyoon, I miss him.

185
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,850
Why do you miss my brother?

186
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,740
He's practically my brother.

187
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,820
You really think that?

188
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:03,620
Of course.
I was always envious of you guys.

189
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:10,860
And since he always called me bro,
it felt like I was family.

190
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,880
It felt good.

191
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,800
It feels good to hear you say that.

192
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,790
Here, cheers.

193
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,780
Yeah.

194
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,950
<i> Chairman Jang arrested
for illegal smuggling

195
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:28,740
Yonggu, we're saved.

196
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,610
What?

197
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,930
The investigations team
arrested Chairman Jang.

198
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,680
Then can we go home now?

199
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,920
Idiot.
How can you be so clueless?

200
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:53,840
The only way we'll survive is
by leaving the motherland.

201
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,880
Leave the motherland?

202
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,610
And go where?

203
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,990
Let's go to China.

204
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:08,700
Let's start from scratch
on the plains of Manchuria.

205
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,920
China?

206
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,790
How are we gonna get there?
The fuzz are everywhere.

207
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:23,730
I've got a plan.
But first we need some dough.

208
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,650
Dough?
How? How?

209
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,960
Are your eyes for
decorative purposes only?

210
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,600
Follow me.

211
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,770
I got it.
I got it, so let go.

212
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,690
Jeez.

213
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,640
Let go. It hurts.

214
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,750
Hurry up already.

215
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,780
This white and blue porcelain...

216
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,740
This'll bring in some cash.

217
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,610
Boss, how are we gonna steal it?

218
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,810
The security looks loose.

219
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,830
The “Sosangpalgyeong” painting,
the “Bukgwandaecheopbi” copy,

220
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,550
the “Pyeongyangseong” painting,

221
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,850
and the commemorative
photo album of King Kojong's family.

222
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,630
Let's wrap them all
in newspapers and walk out.

223
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,680
Boss!

224
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,740
Is he onto us?

225
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,860
He's coming this way.

226
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,960
They can never stand
to cut us a little slack.

227
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,820
Let's retreat for now.

228
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,740
Excuse me, but are you...

229
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,830
[Wanted]

230
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,750
So Mr. Kim used Taesoo Heo's
counterfeit passport?

231
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,740
Then Gyucheol Seo probably
used a counterfeit passport, too.

232
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,940
Pretty much.

233
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,980
That's awfully bold.

234
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,880
Fine, it's obvious that Mr. Kim and
Yonggu Lee's only option is to stow away.

235
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,910
Where will they go?

236
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,950
China? Japan? Hong Kong?
The Philippines? Taiwan? Where?

237
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:02,910
I - I - I have no idea.

238
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,860
If you don't,
you'll take the fall.

239
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,540
Where?

240
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,570
Officer Cho!

241
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,670
We have a tip from
the Incheon City Museum.

242
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:17,570
Two men suspected to be
Mr. Kim and Yonggu Lee were spotted.

243
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,550
Yeah?
Then we should go.

244
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,700
Let's hurry.

245
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,860
I'll see you later.

246
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,740
I hope Boss isn't caught.

247
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,890
Come in.

248
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,730
What's up?

249
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,740
Here are the items to appraise.
Report to Mr. Nah when you're done.

250
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,510
- Okay?
- Okay.

251
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,580
Bye.

252
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,760
Hey, Chohee!

253
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,680
Yeah?

254
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,760
Don't you have anything to say?

255
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,770
Say what?

256
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,690
You really don't?
I think you do.

257
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:00,560
I don't.
I'm busy so let's talk later.

258
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,560
Hey, hold up.

259
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,600
What?

260
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,940
I have something to say.

261
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,880
What is it?

262
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,710
What do you think?

263
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,710
Hey!

264
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,820
Bumsang, excuse me -

265
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,660
I didn't see anything.

266
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,690
Oh dear...

267
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,530
Chief!
What are you doing here?

268
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:40,730
Mr. Nah, do Chohee and Bumsang
really like each other?

269
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,510
Did you think they didn't?

270
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,530
How strange.

271
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:58,920
Oh my god, what are you doing?
Chief Noh saw everything!

272
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,760
Why so embarrassed?
It's natural for us to kiss.

273
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,900
He'll understand.

274
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,720
This is the workplace.
I'm so embarrassed.

275
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,640
I'd kiss you on a crowded
street if you wanted.

276
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,940
I'm wasting my breath here.

277
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:22,980
And it's natural for lovers to want
to touch each other and stuff.

278
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:29,970
Sorry if I embarrassed you.
Go back to work.

279
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,970
Are you mad again?

280
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:57,560
Hello, Chief Noh.

281
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:00,690
Tired?
You don't look too good.

282
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,790
Is Chairman Jang giving you hell?

283
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,620
A bit.
What brings you here?

284
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,710
The prosecution informed me
that Iwazaki recanted his confession.

285
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,720
Initially he blamed
Chairman Jang for everything.

286
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,570
Now he claims he didn't know
the pottery was really celadon.

287
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,570
They matched their stories.

288
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:23,580
What if we end up losing both?

289
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,970
The warrant has to be
issued by tomorrow afternoon,

290
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,760
but we have no other way
besides catching Mr. Kim.

291
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,700
Think we can catch him?

292
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,950
Officers Park and Cho went to Incheon,
so let's keep our fingers crossed.

293
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,610
Jeez, it's hot.
I'm back.

294
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,990
So was it
Mr. Kim and Yonggu Lee?

295
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,580
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.
What were they doing at a museum?

296
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,560
Punk, why else
would a thief go in there?

297
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:03,960
They couldn't have left the area
because of the search we set up,

298
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,760
so they're somewhere
here in Incheon.

299
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,620
Then let's scour the harbors first.

300
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,680
If we poke around,
they're bound to show up.

301
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,710
Let's go.

302
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,910
Man, we're in trouble
if they stow away.

303
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,960
Because of Chairman Jang,
no one's willing to talk.

304
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:32,600
Looks like Insa-dong won't pan out,
so let's go find private owners.

305
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,710
It's really too much.

306
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,730
It is, isn't it?

307
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:41,650
How could this happen?
This is unheard of!

308
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,990
You're going a little overboard here.

309
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,740
I went there with eel sushi rolls.

310
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,950
But he said
he didn't like eel and left.

311
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,650
He didn't even acknowledge
that I found the necktie clip.

312
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,710
How could Chief Kang do this to me?

313
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,880
Chief Kang?

314
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:03,900
Ah, you were talking
about him all this time?

315
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,840
Whom did you think
I was talking about?

316
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,540
Oh!

317
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,710
Joohyun, where are you going?

318
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,880
Oh, oh!

319
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,590
This color and design
are totally his style.

320
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,690
Chohee, let's go in for a sec.

321
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,760
Joohyun!

322
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,770
Jeez, she's driving me nuts.

323
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,540
I like this one and this one.
What to do?

324
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,540
Don't just stand there.

325
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,690
Pick out something for
your brother and Bumsang.

326
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,720
A lot of clothes here
would look good on Bumsang.

327
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,800
He's picky, so he won't
wear something I pick out.

328
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,590
No, no~
You're wrong.

329
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,890
No one dislikes a gift.
He'll like whatever you give him.

330
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,640
Are you picking out men's clothes?
For whom?

331
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,640
Chief Kang?

332
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,510
You're as perceptive as ever.

333
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:14,890
I was picking out clothes
for not only Chief Kang,

334
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,770
but also Officers Cho and Park.

335
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:22,880
The three men who are working hard
to lock up Chairman Jang.

336
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:27,850
Yeah, sounds like a good idea.
They'll really like it.

337
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,770
I agree.

338
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:33,640
Choose something for Bumsang.
I'll be choosing for the officers.

339
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,520
Okay.

340
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,950
Oh, cute, totally cute.

341
00:23:54,550 --> 00:24:00,730
We have motorboats and freighters.
We even have fishing boats.

342
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,780
Yonggu, choose one.
Which one do you like?

343
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:13,620
A passenger ship like the Titanic.

344
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,720
I wish I could send you off
on a shrimping boat.

345
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,570
You said I could choose.

346
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,750
I'm hungry.
How much you got?

347
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,670
Can I take your order?

348
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,930
Two bowls of rice.

349
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:53,860
Excuse me?

350
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,620
Give us two bowls of rice.
We'll eat it with water.

351
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,590
You can't just order rice.

352
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,870
So you're refusing to serve us?

353
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,610
Coming right up.

354
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,950
Boss, I'm so embarrassed.

355
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,820
It's so hot.

356
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:36,750
Where is Mr. Kim?
There's not a hair in sight.

357
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,670
That's what I'm saying.

358
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:44,630
If he wants to stow away, he has
to use this harbor or the docks.

359
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,520
Let's hurry up and eat,
and give it another go.

360
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,530
Okay.

361
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:49,790
Can I take your order?

362
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,910
What shall we have?

363
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,770
Give us the lunch set.

364
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:54,800
Sure.

365
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,640
Isn't that an article
about Chairman Jang?

366
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,800
So it is.

367
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,610
I wonder what nonsense
the reporters wrote this time.

368
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,960
Excuse me, sir!
Can I borrow your newspaper?

369
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,580
What do we do?

370
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,750
Shut up.

371
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,700
No.

372
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:26,660
Just lend me the outer page.

373
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,870
No.

374
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,730
Jeez.
What a cheapskate.

375
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,770
Leave him be.
He doesn't want to give it.

376
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,730
With what right?
Looks like it belongs to the restaurant.

377
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,560
Hold on.

378
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,920
Sir?

379
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,960
Lower the newspaper for a sec.

380
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,780
No.

381
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,700
Then lift it up.

382
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,750
Long time no see, Officer Cho.

383
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,790
Run!

384
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,650
Bastard, stop right there.

385
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:28,790
Boss, why are we
always running away?

386
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,720
It's the downside of being a thief!

387
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,850
Bleach Head!

388
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,500
Bleach Head.
Come over here.

389
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,730
Boss.

390
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,820
All for one and one for all.

391
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:13,710
Stop the bluff
and just let me go.

392
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,590
You have an innocent man locked up
without evidence or witnesses.

393
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:23,580
You're wasting my time here.
This isn't right.

394
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:29,710
Until your forty-eight hours are over, you're still a suspect for murder.

395
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:33,540
Why don't you just sit tight
until three o'clock tomorrow?

396
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:37,980
You've got a lot of nerve for
someone on pins and needles.

397
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,970
Not bad.

398
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:45,580
By the way, didn't you
receive a call from above?

399
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,510
He said he'd call you.
Not yet, huh?

400
00:28:56,820 --> 00:29:00,630
Go ahead.
No need to be polite.

401
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,630
Just answer it.

402
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,640
Hello, this is he.

403
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,850
What?

404
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,770
I understand.

405
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,920
I guess I have no other choice.

406
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:24,950
Okay.

407
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,980
Why the heavy sigh?

408
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:38,510
Sir.

409
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,770
Mr. Kim was arrested.

410
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,770
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

411
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:46,920
What?

412
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,620
On the way here, he confessed
that you were behind everything.

413
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,790
I think getting a warrant
will be no problem.

414
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,720
[Chairman Ohseong Jang
was arrested today for murder

415
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,580
and for violating the
Cultural Properties Protection Act...]

416
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,790
Well, that's a wish fulfilled.
You wanted to catch that guy.

417
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,630
I did.

418
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,910
It turned out for the bestl.

419
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:15,830
For Chohee and for Gyoon,
and I have no more regrets.

420
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,540
Yeah, Taesoo can rest in peace now.

421
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,660
Probably.

422
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,580
That poor bastard.

423
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:36,840
All that's left is your retirement.
What's after that?

424
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:38,770
Why?

425
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,730
You have something in mind?

426
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:46,620
Yeah.
Wanna be my driver?

427
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:53,950
If an ex-middleman and an ex-regulations
chief joined forces, we'd be invincible.

428
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,890
Shouldn't we marry Chohee off first?

429
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,520
With whom?
That Chief Kang dude?

430
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,810
That was my original plan,
but she already has a guy.

431
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:15,990
Bumsang Kim.
You saw him before.

432
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,550
That guy?

433
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,520
Chohee has great taste in men.

434
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,720
I liked him from the moment
I laid eyes on him.

435
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:35,530
Let me make it clear that
I'm going to walk her down the aisle.

436
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,730
Don't even think otherwise.

437
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,800
We'll see when the time comes.

438
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,930
It's nearly over.
You just need to come home.

439
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,770
Sis.

440
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:02,970
When you come home,
let's go see Dad first.

441
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:12,880
And then we'll move Mom
so that she's by Dad's side, okay?

442
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,920
Okay, let's do that.

443
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:23,750
And let's go to Yongin, too.

444
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,960
Why there?

445
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:30,970
I think we were happiest
when we lived there.

446
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:37,730
That was the best time
for you, me and Dad.

447
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:41,600
You're right, it was.

448
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:46,570
It was fun back then,
burying a time capsule with Dad.

449
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,900
Time capsule?
What's that?

450
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,560
You don't remember?

451
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,650
I'm not sure.

452
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:56,860
You can't remember
when it was your idea?

453
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,660
You saw it on TV and
suggested that we try it.

454
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:07,850
We put in our treasures and
vowed to open it in the 21st century.

455
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,870
What's your treasure, Chohee?

456
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,910
Oh, right.
I remember now.

457
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,620
I had forgotten all about it.

458
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:38,950
Now you remember?

459
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,580
Do you think it's still there?

460
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,640
No way.
It's been over twenty years.

461
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,960
You're probably right.

462
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:56,960
I don't remember exactly
but I think I put in a doll.

463
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,540
I'm not sure.

464
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:03,590
I don't remember either.

465
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,570
Go look for it with Bro.

466
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,620
With Bumsang?

467
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:16,570
And if you find it,
tell me what my treasure was.

468
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,740
Okay, I'll do that.

469
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:30,800
So you're giving us
each a shirt, but why?

470
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,960
You know what?

471
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:36,690
It's the first time I've received
a pretty shirt in my five years as a cop.

472
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:38,600
It's not such a big deal.

473
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,600
You guys don't go home much
and don't get to change much either.

474
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,740
So they're for the sake
of your personal hygiene.

475
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,830
Everyone knows about
the sad state of our hygiene

476
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:53,500
and that we don't go home much.

477
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,900
But thanks anyway.
I'll wear it well.

478
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,940
Thanks so much.
I'll wear it well, Joohyun.

479
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:06,700
What about you, Chief?
Why so quiet?

480
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:09,960
This is just so unexpected.

481
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:16,600
I guess it is unexpected
from a beauty like myself.

482
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,720
You've got a point.
Anyway, Joohyun, thank you.

483
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:35,540
I knew you'd look better in
a V-neck collar than a rounded collar.

484
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:38,700
No one has my good taste.

485
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:45,690
Then please enjoy the shirts,
and I'll be going then.

486
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:52,720
I assume you know that you must
dry clean it on the first wash.

487
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,790
Then, bye.

488
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,530
What's up with her?

489
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:02,750
Who knows what
goes on in her head?

490
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:08,920
Anyway, it feels good.
Don't you agree, Chief?

491
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,790
Yes.

492
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,890
Joohyun!

493
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,590
Yes, Chief?

494
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,580
Going back to the office?

495
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,720
Yes, why?

496
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:27,870
I have an engagement,
but I can stop by the CHA first.

497
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,540
What engagement?

498
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,590
A date with my favorite
person in the world.

499
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,730
Is that so?

500
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,590
Thank you for the offer,
but that sounds important.

501
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:43,990
It's okay.
I'll go on my own.

502
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:48,870
Um, it's my daughter.
I promised to play with her.

503
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,760
Your daughter?

504
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,700
Yup.

505
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,770
I have to get back on her good side
by playing with her today.

506
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,780
Where are you going?

507
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:04,540
I didn't think about it yet.
Maybe the children's museum.

508
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:09,720
You know what?
I was gonna go to the museum, too.

509
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,970
Then shall we go together?

510
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,980
Sure, let's go together.

511
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,820
How old is your daughter?

512
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,800
Jiyoon is six.

513
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,740
Her name is Jiyoon?

514
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,840
Jiyoon.
Jiyoon Kang.

515
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:35,990
Is this Jiyoon?
She's so adorable.

516
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,680
Is this the first time
you've seen her picture?

517
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,550
Yeah, it is.

518
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,720
That's strange. You've ridden
in my car loads of times.

519
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,600
This picture was always here.

520
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,730
Was it?

521
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,630
I guess it's because back then
I was too focused on work.

522
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:58,850
I focus so well that
I hardly notice anything else.

523
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:03,620
Is that so?
You're similar to Jiyoon.

524
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:08,890
I am?
In what way?

525
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:14,900
She focuses so well that once she grabs onto a mirror, she doesn't let go.

526
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,700
You like mirrors, too.

527
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,640
Chief!

528
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,580
Just kidding.

529
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,700
Jonggyu, are you that bored?
Why do you keep coming by -

530
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,570
Tada!

531
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,700
What's this?

532
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,510
This? A bribe.

533
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:50,770
A bribe to make you feel better
since you're mad at me.

534
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,910
When was I mad?

535
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:59,680
Man, I was all worried for nothing.

536
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:05,840
But at least you're not sulking.
It's not much, so try it on later.

537
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,950
Okay, thanks.
I'm almost done.

538
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,510
It's an iron sword.

539
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,590
Yeah.

540
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:21,500
My dad stole a ton of these
back in the day.

541
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,920
Your father ended up a really
dark cloud in your life, didn't he?

542
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:42,840
I understand how you feel,
but isn't it time to let him go?

543
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:49,570
I know my line of work
is restoring cultural assets,

544
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:55,940
but sometimes the rotting
and aging state can be beautiful.

545
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,700
Restoration isn't always
the best way to love cultural assets.

546
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,700
Watching them fade away
is another form of love.

547
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,910
What's your point?

548
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:15,930
That sometimes
what's natural is the best.

549
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,890
Whether we're talking
about relics or people.

550
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,510
That was longwinded.
Hold on, I'll wrap things up.

551
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:32,830
Um, there's somewhere I want to go.
Can you go with me?

552
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:58,720
So this is where you used to live?

553
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:05,700
I think so, but I'm not sure
because it changed a lot.

554
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,790
No way it would stay
the same for twenty years.

555
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,540
Still, I feel disappointed.

556
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:17,880
There should be a good-luck pole
my father made somewhere nearby.

557
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,720
A good-luck pole?

558
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,780
Yeah.

559
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:27,660
Every time we moved, Dad set up
a good-luck pole at the entrance.

560
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,580
But it's gone.

561
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:34,870
Hey, there's one over there.

562
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:36,700
Where?

563
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,710
It's still here.

564
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:55,510
I'm so proud for
finding it in one try.

565
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:00,940
I don't know if the treasures
are still here, like Gyoon said.

566
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,840
Treasures?

567
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,850
Yeah.

568
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:10,830
A long time ago, we buried
our treasures in a time capsule.

569
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,900
So you came here
on a treasure hunt.

570
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:20,650
You brought me
here to dig, didn't you?

571
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,940
Aw man, I knew it.

572
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,660
Hurry up and dig.

573
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,990
Whereabouts?

574
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:30,500
You have to point out
the general area.

575
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,790
I think it's over there.

576
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,540
- Here?
- Yeah.

577
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,520
Put more power into it.

578
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,810
Hey, it's really here.

579
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,680
What's your treasure, Chohee?

580
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,530
I'm not gonna show you.

581
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,520
Let me have a peek.

582
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,940
I shouldn't...

583
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:22,820
Wow, is this me?

584
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,880
You drew it well.

585
00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:28,740
Don't you have a treasure?

586
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:32,560
Treasure?
Of course I do.

587
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:32,990
What is it?

588
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,510
What is it!

589
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,940
Well, my treasure is...

590
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,730
A secret.

591
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:41,880
No fair.

592
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,530
Well, too bad.

593
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,600
Let's put them in.

594
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:58,710
Now let's put on the cover.

595
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,560
Cover it with plastic.

596
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:48,520
Daddy, when are we
gonna open this up?

597
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:52,750
When do you think we should?

598
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,620
How about when Chohee's
about to get married?

599
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:57,780
But I'm not gonna get married.

600
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,740
You're really not going to marry?

601
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:03,580
But a wonderful prince will come
sweep you off your feet.

602
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,930
I drew this a long time ago.
Wanna see?

603
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,830
This was my treasure.

604
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:30,600
Your taste then
was as bad as it is now.

605
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:37,880
Hey.

606
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,920
What is it?

607
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,700
[Dear Chohee and Gyoon.]

608
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:52,580
[You'll probably be all grown up
by the time you open this up.]

609
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,740
[How beautiful did
Chohee turn out to be?]

610
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:02,820
[How handsome did
Gyoon turn out to be?]

611
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:07,920
[And how old have I grown?]

612
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:15,600
[But Chohee and Gyoon,
no matter how much time passes,

613
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:21,610
you will always be
my dearest treasure.]

614
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,600
I miss him so much.

615
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,510
Hello.

616
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,570
Chief Kang!

617
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,990
Hey, Joohyun.

618
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:05,640
Did you get home
all right last night?

619
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:12,970
Chief, that fantastic shirt
looks strangely familiar.

620
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:17,740
You bought this for me.
Don't you remember?

621
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,650
Of course I do.
How could I forget?

622
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,980
I'll wear it well.
Thanks.

623
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,770
It's not a big deal.

624
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,870
If you're so grateful,
you should buy dinner.

625
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:31,720
Not in the cafeteria,
but in some fancy restaurant.

626
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,530
Okay, I'll buy you dinner
in a fancy restaurant.

627
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:36,650
Satisfied?

628
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:38,740
Really?
You promised.

629
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,720
Chief Kang, Joohyun.
Did you hear the news?

630
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,920
What's up?

631
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:48,600
Chief Noh's retirement
date has been set.

632
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:50,630
Really?

633
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:10,810
Hey, where did everyone go?

634
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:11,770
Chief!

635
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,820
This is not good at all.

636
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:20,540
Just because I'm retiring,
am I already a lame duck?

637
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:24,950
Why are you already retiring, Chief?
You said it would be in the fall.

638
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,950
September first is in the fall.

639
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:29,940
Still.

640
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:32,810
I did all that I could.

641
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:38,850
And it's time for me to relax
with my annual pension.

642
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:43,950
Out with the old
and in with the new.

643
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:48,650
I know that you're sorry to go.

644
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,760
I do have a lot of regrets.

645
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:58,860
I really regretted letting
you join the regulations team.

646
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:09,560
But that was also the best decision
in the past thirty years of my life.

647
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,950
Chief.

648
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:16,570
You started this work
because of your father,

649
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:19,910
but if you keep going,
you'll find a greater objective.

650
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:25,810
That's how life works.

651
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,990
Go find everyone
for the morning meeting.

652
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:36,610
Tell them I'm not cutting them
any slack until the very last day.

653
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,970
Yes, sir.

654
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:59,980
We acknowledge your contribution
to the Cultural Heritage Administration.

655
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:02,730
From Director Changhyun Kang.

656
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,650
Chief Noh, thank you
for all your hard work.

657
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:09,770
Thank you.

658
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,930
Now we'll listen to Chief
Jeongpil Noh's farewell speech.

659
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,720
I'm not really good with words.

660
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:42,840
It has been exactly thirty years
since I began protecting cultural assets.

661
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:50,730
I cannot tell you that I've never
once been shaken in my resolve.

662
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:58,520
There were times I wanted to quit
and times the dark side tempted me.

663
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:08,610
But I plowed forward because of
the pride I had in protecting our history.

664
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,760
Our work is not simply
protecting cultural assets.

665
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:23,770
We are protecting the history, pride and
memories that our children will inherit.

666
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:30,580
Memories become history, and
a history full of pride becomes the future.

667
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:38,810
Cultural assets are not just antiques,
but our memories, history and future.

668
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:45,840
I will now pass on this serious
responsibility to you guys.

669
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,510
But I will always
be here with you in spirit.

670
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:56,940
Thank you for listening to me,
though I am not good with words.

671
00:51:57,670 --> 00:52:02,520
When it comes time for me to officiate
Chohee and Bumsang's marriage,

672
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,980
I will be better prepared
for public speaking.

673
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:08,640
Thank you very much.

674
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:25,810
(Excuse me a sec.)

675
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,920
Is this an international number?

676
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,500
Hello, this is Bumsang Kim.

677
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:48,890
Hello, who is this?

678
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:51,810
Thank you for all your hard work.

679
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:55,720
Chief, I am so sad.

680
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,760
Chief, I already feel empty inside.

681
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:02,860
Thanks.

682
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,980
Chief, the last silver dust I'll give you.

683
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:11,670
You're going to come visit us, right?

684
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:13,750
Why would I when
I'm not even getting paid?

685
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,680
Chief Kang, you did well.

686
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,760
Chief...

687
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:26,930
Take care of your health.

688
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,970
I'll leave the regulations team
in your hands, Chief Nah.

689
00:53:30,850 --> 00:53:31,810
What?

690
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,930
Didn't I tell you?

691
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:38,640
You're being promoted to chief.

692
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:40,540
Are you serious, Chief?

693
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:41,720
Oh no!

694
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,840
I will do my very best.
Thank you.

695
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:58,750
I didn't want to see
Hwang walk you down the aisle,

696
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:02,780
but I'd rather officiate
than have him do it.

697
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,930
Uncle...

698
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:14,610
Hey, where did Bumsang go?

699
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:17,890
Yes, yes.

700
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,510
What are you doing?
Chief is waiting for you -

701
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:27,560
I understand. Goodbye.

702
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,650
A Japanese person?
Who was it?

703
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:36,570
It was Tanaka.
Ichihiro Tanaka.

704
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,680
Tanaka?

705
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,920
The yakuza Ichihiro Tanaka?

706
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:44,940
Why would he call you?

707
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:53,560
Who stopped Chairman Jang
from smuggling items abroad?

708
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,730
It was me, Daegil Nah.

709
00:54:55,730 --> 00:55:02,590
After I unveiled our country's
richest man to be the filth he really is,

710
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,510
it was obvious
I would become chief.

711
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,740
Where are we eating dinner?
We have to have at least sirloin.

712
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,690
Let's all have some silver dust...

713
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:14,700
I can only take this to mean
you're all green with envy.

714
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,770
Fine.

715
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:19,620
At times like these,
I need Sangho by my side.

716
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,730
Sangho!

717
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:24,570
Mr. Nah, I have something
urgent to discuss with you.

718
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:27,620
Chief Kang!
No, no~

719
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:29,710
I'm Chief Nah now.

720
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:33,500
That's my catchphrase.
No, no~ That's how you do it.

721
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:35,740
Chohee, what's taking you so long?

722
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:39,630
Mr. Nah -
That's not important right now.

723
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:42,960
I just learned the Makddae Family
is contacting Daishokumi clan.

724
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,610
Dai -
I've heard that name somewhere.

725
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:51,920
Th - th - that's the clan of that dude
in Japan, what's his name?

726
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,690
Tanaka!

727
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,570
He's the boss, right?

728
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:56,580
Right.

729
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:58,800
Why is Tanaka coming here?

730
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,880
Okay, I'll tell them.

731
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,510
Chohee wanted me to tell you.

732
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:07,560
He's coming to buy the “Geumsagyeong”
through the Makddae Family.

733
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:08,970
And how does Chohee know?

734
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:12,770
Tanaka asked Bumsang
to appraise the “Geumsagyeong.”

735
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,810
They're meeting this weekend.
What do we do?

736
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:19,520
What do you think?

737
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,590
It's time to show them what
Chief Daegil Nah of the CHA is made of.

738
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,640
Where is the meeting place?

739
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,850
Man, they're fast.
Of course they should be.

740
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,550
Be ready!

741
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:40,620
This is Eagle.

742
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:44,790
Everything's in place.
All we need is for Turtle to appear.

743
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,600
Roger.

744
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:51,840
Gotcha.
Come in, Sparrow.

745
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,720
This is Sparrow.

746
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,720
Nothing unusual here.
Call me when Turtle crawls into view.

747
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,900
Do not get distracted
and do your very best, over.

748
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,500
Stop overdoing your job, over.

749
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:05,630
Are you messing around?
At this important time?

750
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,950
Stop messing around
and stay sharp, over.

751
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:13,960
Chief Nah's spirit
is poking at the clouds.

752
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,630
Just like this tower.

753
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:21,510
Why can't anyone
do their job right?

754
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:25,510
Hey, Chief Kang!
Are we set?

755
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:28,730
Yes, just in case,
the riot police is standing by.

756
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:31,570
Good.
Chohee and Bumsang?

757
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:33,710
Chohee's here,
but I haven't seen Bumsang.

758
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:37,640
How can he be late
on this important day?

759
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,730
I swear,
there's no one I can trust.

760
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:48,590
Okay, so we'll stay hidden and wait
until Bumsang and Chohee meet Tanaka.

761
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,670
Then we'll close in on them, okay?

762
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:53,760
Did you get it or not?

763
00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:57,690
What are you doing?
Move, move.

764
00:57:57,690 --> 00:57:58,800
Okay...

765
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,910
Mr. Nah - I mean, Chief Nah
is too inflated today.

766
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:07,590
Since when did he work so hard?

767
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:09,700
You know he always
has to be in charge.

768
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,950
And the seat really
does change the man.

769
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:15,720
Oh, by the way,
will Chohee be all right?

770
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:20,820
She's the only one experienced
enough to handle this job.

771
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:22,930
And she's also fluent in Japanese.

772
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:26,940
Chief, I happen to be
quite good at Japanese.

773
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:30,530
Oh, right. I forgot.

774
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:35,940
How can you be so indifferent?
I'm disappointed in you.

775
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:37,920
Joohyun!

776
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,520
Chief.

777
00:58:41,590 --> 00:58:46,570
I know you want to tell me
you're actually interested in me,

778
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:47,950
but this isn't right.

779
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:53,890
We need to go this way.

780
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:56,760
Let's go.

781
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,610
J - Joohyun.

782
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:10,500
Chohee said the key to going
undercover is a believeable front.

783
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:14,740
If we act like lovers, we'll do our part
without getting discovered.

784
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,880
Now, let's go.

785
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:35,510
Tanaka already knows her by sight.
Why does she insist on doing this?

786
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,840
Yo.

787
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:50,950
Hey!

788
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:52,930
You...

789
00:59:54,650 --> 00:59:55,930
Why?
Is it too much?

790
00:59:56,930 --> 01:00:01,700
It's okay, it's a little
conspicuous as a disguise.

791
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,890
It is conspicuous, isn't it?
I was thinking that, but...

792
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,790
Hey, did you get
another call from Tanaka?

793
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:10,950
Yeah, he's waiting near the tower.

794
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:16,600
The thought of meeting Tanaka
is making me nervous.

795
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,770
You? Nervous?

796
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:23,560
Remember Japan? What if
he brought all his yakuza cronies?

797
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:27,720
I never thought I'd see
the great Bumsang all nervous.

798
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:32,700
I'll give you a present
to ease your nerves.

799
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,920
A present?
What is it?

800
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,940
Now don't be nervous.

801
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,520
I'm off.

802
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:54,690
Yeah, let's do this.

803
01:01:04,670 --> 01:02:25,520

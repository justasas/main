<i> Episode 2</i>

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,200
Chohee, good job.
You must be bushed.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,110
Not at all.

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:28,960
I didn't expect you to come
all the way to Japan.

7
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,900
How could I not when I sent you
into the battlefield completely unarmed?

8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,100
So you're saying you
didn't think I could handle it.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,170
Why are you twisting my words around? I meant that I was worried about you.

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,210
I was very worried, so I'm very relieved that you're safe and sound.

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,040
You're going straight home, right?

12
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,120
Nope. I still have some
unfinished business to take care of.

13
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,320
Unfinished business?

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,910
Chief Kang!

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,260
Chief Noh,
what are you doing here?

16
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,080
Where is it?
Where's the item?

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,140
What item?

18
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,940
The porcelain bowl!
Where is it?

19
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,050
It'll be arriving real soon.

20
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,020
What in the world is going on?

21
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,270
Bumsang Kim! Over here!

22
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,220
What led to your success
in bringing it back?

23
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,160
How do you feel about
finding the national treasure?

24
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,300
I'm Chohee Heo from the
Cultural Heritage Administration.

25
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,240
I sincerely thank you
for restoring a national treasure.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,010
Restoring?

27
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,980
What the - you little!

28
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,290
Sir, let me take
the national treasure.

29
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,160
H - hold on a sec.

30
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,380
Sir.

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Sir, everyone's watching you.

32
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,140
- Sir.
- I'll give it, hold on.

33
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,230
Excuse me!

34
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,220
Mr. Kim, a word, please.

35
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,270
One moment.

36
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,150
National treasure. Like the name implies, it belongs to the country.

37
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:01,370
As a citizen of this country,
I did what I had to do.

38
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,270
Can you look over here, sir?

39
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:19,120
Amazing, Bumsang.
You're truly amazing.

40
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,910
Smiling when you're clearly pissed.
Not anyone can pull this off.

41
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,910
This is art in its own right.

42
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,940
Ugh, my head hurts.
You know how much it costs?

43
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,180
How much - ugh, my head...

44
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,300
What can you do?
The train has left the station.

45
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,170
Hey, forget about it.

46
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,940
I'll put it on display in a special room
at my museum, so come visit it.

47
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,900
You're pouring salt on the wound!

48
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,990
Ugh, my head.

49
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,100
I knew that Chohee Heo woman was trouble the moment I set eyes on her.

50
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,150
And this is how she screws me over?

51
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:03,920
Do you know how much it's worth?
Ugh, my head. My poor head.

52
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,100
Bumsang,
my grandmother used to say...

53
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,090
“Eating the easy piece of cake
causes indigestion.”

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,960
Things that come along too easily are nothing but trouble, so forget about it.

55
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,050
You think that's
as easily done as said?

56
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,110
Yes, sir.

57
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,900
You've accomplished quite a feat.

58
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,170
I thought you were coming back empty-handed. I should've known better.

59
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,050
I never imagined you'd come back
with such a priceless item.

60
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,940
Sir, let me explain what happened.

61
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,140
I don't know how you
ended up with the bowl...

62
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,360
but it was a smart choice
to donate it to the country.

63
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,930
But the smarter choice
would have been to bring it to me.

64
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:16,150
Then I could have done more than appoint you as a professor. What a pity.

65
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,020
Sir, the thing is...

66
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,120
We're done.

67
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,220
Yes, sir.

68
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,130
It's all Chohee Heo's fault!

69
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:40,980
I'll get her back, I will.

70
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,140
What about it?
Why is it my fault?

71
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,390
You think it's okay to wash
the lights and the darks together?

72
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,940
Take a look!
Everything's mottled!

73
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,170
You never do the laundry,
so what gives you the right to complain?

74
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,260
Just wear them.

75
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,930
You think that's your only offense?

76
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,110
Now what?

77
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,950
How could you make the front page,
and not say a word to me about it?

78
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:16,310
Let me see. It's not such
a big deal to make the front page.

79
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,150
How is it not? You were photographed together with Bumsang Kim.

80
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,160
This is a crowning moment
for our family.

81
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,260
What?

82
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,030
Whenever I watched
“"Discovering Cultural Assets"...

83
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,260
I knew he'd create
quite a stir someday.

84
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,150
Bumsang Kim,
you are the man.

85
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:40,360
Now that's a true patriot
for you. Definitely.

86
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:48,970
Patriot, my butt. Do you know
what this man's really like?

87
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:57,360
He's two-faced and a total pervert,
and he's extremely pathetic.

88
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,100
You don't know anything.

89
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,290
Who isn't pathetic to you?

90
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,220
Of course,
I'm the most pathetic of all.

91
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,090
Totally two-faced...

92
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,190
Yes, Chief?

93
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,370
The director's going to give you
a letter of commendation tomorrow.

94
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:47,930
A letter of commendation? Why not a cash bonus? It'll help with the rent.

95
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:53,240
You went on a paid trip and got to see Japan. What more do you want?

96
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,100
It wasn't a vacation. I nearly died
in a yakuza member's house.

97
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,280
How did it feel to go back
to Japan after all this time? Good?

98
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,210
No, not really.

99
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,990
I think things were a lot better
when I used to live in Japan.

100
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,220
I don't doubt it.
You had your father then.

101
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,100
Let's take another shot, Chief.

102
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,020
- Chief! I'm here.
- There you are. Have a seat.

103
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,120
What were you talking about?

104
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,900
Nothing in particular.
Let me pour you a drink.

105
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,900
Sure.

106
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,200
I didn't know you
invited Chief Kang, too.

107
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,230
Yeah, I'm creating an opportunity
for you young singles to mingle.

108
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,980
- What?
- What?

109
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,050
Chohee, I know you're
secretly interested in Chief Kang.

110
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:02,250
You weren't going to dip your feet
in the water, so I'm throwing you in.

111
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:08,030
Chief! What are you saying?
Who's interested in whom?

112
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,350
I never...
Don't assume things, sir.

113
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,340
Hey, kid, where are you going?

114
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,060
The bathroom.

115
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:23,100
Oh my god, so humiliating. Chief must be getting senile, completely senile.

116
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,280
So embarrassing.

117
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,100
I was just joking, but her reaction
is a little too exaggerated.

118
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,190
Maybe she was really
secretly interested in you.

119
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,110
How can you say that when
you saw how offended she was?

120
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,120
Why would she be offended?
You're quite the catch.

121
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,380
Chief, I'm a widower with a kid
and she's a single woman.

122
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:53,300
You're going to
make me the bad guy here.

123
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,260
Since we're on the topic, do you
want me to play matchmaker seriously?

124
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,920
It's about time you met someone.

125
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,110
Until when are you going
to leave Jiyoon to your mother?

126
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,990
It hasn't been very long
since my wife passed away.

127
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,370
I feel bad for Jiyoon, but as of yet
I still feel worse for my wife.

128
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,900
Yes, sir, I turned it in.
Don't worry.

129
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:53,210
Lucky Chohee.

130
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,050
She caught Mr. Kim and
retrieved the national treasure.

131
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:58,030
On top of that, she's receiving
a letter of commendation.

132
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,060
I envy her. I really do.

133
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:06,140
So what? She didn't solve
the Mr. Kim case on her own.

134
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:11,370
Why aren't we getting something?
Did we do nothing? Did you? Did you?

135
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,970
Now that you mention it. It was unfair the way she was chosen to go to Japan.

136
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,130
Joohyun should've gone, but Chief Noh used his influence to send her instead.

137
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,010
Joohyun, aren't you upset?

138
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,340
Since she supposedly lived for a while in Japan, it makes sense that she went.

139
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:35,920
More importantly, at this rate don't you think she might become the next chief?

140
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,310
What? Chief?

141
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:49,050
I mean, Chief Noh's retirement isn't far off, and if she continues scoring honors.

142
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:55,030
Mr. Nah, you may be older, but Chohee is your match in years of experience.

143
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,940
Right! On top of that,
she's Chief Noh's mistress –

144
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,070
I mean,
he completely adores her.

145
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:05,990
That's nonsense! She can't upset
the natural order of things.

146
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:08,220
In this land of upright citizens,
such a thing mustn't happen!

147
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:11,150
Whatever others may say,
the next chief should be...

148
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,160
How about discussing changes in political power later and getting to work?

149
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,930
Yes, sir.

150
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,000
Excuse me.

151
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,920
Are you all right?

152
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,250
By any chance...

153
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,910
are you Mr. Bumsang Kim?

154
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,950
That would be me.

155
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,350
I get why you're getting an award,
but I don't see why I'm getting one.

156
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:55,020
Ditto. I couldn't even retrieve the items Mr. Kim smuggled, so why celebrate?

157
00:12:55,390 --> 00:13:00,060
I know. If we don't get those items, the prosecution against him won't stand.

158
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,900
This uniform is uncomfortable.
It's been so long since I wore it last.

159
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,920
Here.
Let me do it for you.

160
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,110
Thanks.

161
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,030
You're welcome.

162
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:22,210
Bumsang Kim?

163
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,050
What's he doing here?

164
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,150
Didn't you hear? He's getting
a letter of appreciation with us.

165
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,210
What?

166
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,230
Why do you think
the reporters are here?

167
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:39,210
We're more like the garnish
to his steak. He's the man of the hour.

168
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,150
Hello, Chief.

169
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,270
Let me introduce you to Chief Shiwan Kang of the investigations team.

170
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,220
He constantly works hand in hand with the Cultural Heritage Administration.

171
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,240
Ah, we've met previously.

172
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,240
Congratulations.

173
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,970
And you already
know Chohee, right?

174
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,260
I know her extremely well.

175
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:21,230
So we meet again, Ms. Hanako Shizuki.
I mean, Ms. Chohee Heo.

176
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,110
“Chohee Heo.”

177
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,910
Seeing how you're named
after a historically famous artist,

178
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,230
your father must be
quite the scholar.

179
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,350
I guess sometimes the apple
does fall far from the tree.

180
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,380
If you're here to accept an award,
just accept it quietly.

181
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,100
Why are you
picking a fight? Huh?

182
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,980
Hey, government underling.
You really don't know why?

183
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,180
How can you
be so self-righteous...

184
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,140
after robbing a citizen
of his personal property?

185
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:57,250
I made you into a national hero.
Isn't that enough?

186
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:02,200
Begging on your knees wouldn't
get you forgiven at this point.

187
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,110
You're not really in a position
to be so self-righteous yourself.

188
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,240
Why? And what did I do?

189
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,260
- What did you do?
- Yes, what?

190
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,950
Was it the chairman of
Dongsang Group or Hyunjae Group?

191
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,340
Or maybe it was
the chairman of Ohsung Group?

192
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,940
Wh - what in the world
are you babbling about?

193
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:21,220
Who in this small country is capable of sending you to retrieve a priceless item?

194
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,910
It definitely has to be
one of those three men.

195
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,300
You shouldn't be so proud
of playing lackey a filthy rich man...

196
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,330
only to trick someone
out of his cat's food bowl.

197
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,330
There's a limit to
how much I'll take.

198
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,930
What about you?

199
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,340
You accused an upright citizen
of being a thief and tricked him...

200
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,110
spied on him and covertly
investigated him against his rights.

201
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,010
How are you going
to compensate for that? How?

202
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,320
Do you feel wronged?

203
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,020
Of course I do.

204
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,130
Then sue me.

205
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,050
What?

206
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,080
Where are you going?
We're not done talking yet.

207
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,030
Let go.

208
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,210
No way.

209
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,080
I said, let go!

210
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,300
And I said, no way!

211
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,210
Let go.

212
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,900
I already got hit once,
I'm not about to turn the other cheek.

213
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,080
Let go already!

214
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,330
Why so startled?

215
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,900
I do, after all..

216
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,020
have extremely high standards.

217
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,170
Mr. Kim! It's time!

218
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,900
I'm coming.

219
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,240
The crazy look fits you.
The flower looks good.

220
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,110
What's about his get-up?

221
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,910
Decked out in white. Who does
he think he is, a pimp? Crazy bastard.

222
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,070
Letter of appreciation, awarded to Bumsang Kim of Hanguk University.

223
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,160
In recognition of instilling
within our citizens an interest...

224
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,030
in our beautiful cultural heritage
and for retrieving a lost cultural relic.

225
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:05,060
On behalf of the entire nation, we award this letter of appreciation to you.

226
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:10,010
June 20, 2008. Signed by
Director Changhyun Kang of the CHA.

227
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:24,280
They're popping my eardrums. He looks like a total fop. What's the big deal?

228
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,170
Why were we told
to show up today?

229
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,380
Isn't it obvious?
We're the garnish!

230
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,060
In recognition of
instilling within our citizens...

231
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,970
an interest in
our beautiful cultural heritage...

232
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,070
What's with him?

233
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,260
Leave him be.

234
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,950
Hey, if dinner tonight isn't
choice meat, I'm skipping out.

235
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,200
No one's stopping you.

236
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,120
I'm staying to eat!

237
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:09,230
If Chohee really becomes chief,
I'm resigning! Resigning, I tell you!

238
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:15,900
Excuse me,
may I ask you something?

239
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,200
And so we conclude
the ceremony. Thank you.

240
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,270
Director Changhyun Kang of
the Cultural Heritage Administration.

241
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,990
Good work.

242
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:33,060
‘The director of the CHA...'

243
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,390
This is Namyoung Ko, head curator
of the National Central Museum.

244
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,270
Good job.

245
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,050
‘Head curator of the
National Central Museum...'

246
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,380
Congressman Junpil Lee,
three-time Congressman...

247
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,170
and chairman of the National Assembly's Cultural Assets Bureau.

248
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,290
‘Three-time Congressman...'

249
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:54,130
Lastly, Joongho Hyun,
president of Hanguk University.

250
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,100
Ah, sir.

251
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:59,080
You're Bumsang Kim of our Department of Art History and Archeology, right?

252
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,020
Yes, sir.

253
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,310
I've heard a lot
about you from the dean.

254
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,050
It's an honor
to finally meet you.

255
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,330
Same here.

256
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:09,090
Let's head over to my office
to talk over tea.

257
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,190
Sure.

258
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,160
Let's go.

259
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,920
Come on.

260
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,050
Oh man, I have to impress them.

261
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:21,240
What was the title
of the TV show you're on?

262
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,060
“Discovering Cultural Assets.”

263
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,220
“Discovering Cultural Assets,” huh?

264
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,290
I watch it quite regularly. You've accomplished quite a feat this time.

265
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:34,200
Please stop it, sir! I've already told you I'm a member of the regulations teams.

266
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,080
I'm not an
appraiser of old books.

267
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,180
Tsk, tsk. That man doesn't even know how to properly treat an old man.

268
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,240
There's something strange
about this book!

269
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,240
I think you're the strange one here.
Just leave already.

270
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,270
Please go on ahead.

271
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,000
Is something wrong?

272
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,200
I want to take a look at the book.
I'll be right there.

273
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,100
Will you leave already?

274
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:02,170
He's quite courteous, unlike
most young people these days.

275
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,030
So he is.

276
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,340
- Leave, please!
- Wait.

277
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,200
One moment, please.
Sir, may I take a look?

278
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,020
Here you are.

279
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,100
Where is the
Preservation Science Laboratory?

280
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,310
Preservation...?

281
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,160
Please wrap everything up.

282
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,160
Yes, ma'am.

283
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,350
Can't believe they gave a letter of appreciation to that loser. Unbelievable.

284
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,250
Joohyun, what's going on?

285
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:05,320
Something big is going on at the Preservation Science Lab! C'mon!

286
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,090
How awesome.

287
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,900
So handsome.

288
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,100
He looks like a celebrity.

289
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,340
So cool.

290
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,970
He's really skilled.

291
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,910
We'll begin the cleaning process
after taking some pictures first.

292
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,390
But isn't the cellulose
damage too extreme?

293
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,280
We'll have to separate the sheets
using a reinforcing agent.

294
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,090
Please prepare the reinforcing agent and material necessary for cleaning.

295
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,200
Yes, sir.

296
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,190
Let's begin.

297
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,280
Okay, take the picture.

298
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,380
We can't be sure
until further examination...

299
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,000
but seeing how the sheets were stuck
so meticulously into the binding...

300
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,090
it appears to be a banned book
from the Joseon Era.

301
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:20,180
If that's true, it's a rare book that's priceless, historically speaking.

302
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,290
Yes, I'd say there's
a good chance it is.

303
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:28,110
And to find it like this.
I'm amazed by your ability.

304
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:32,140
You flatter me, sir.
Luck was on my side.

305
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,060
Mr. Kim, may I make a request?

306
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,130
Of course, anything at all.

307
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,060
Right now the world is overrun by thieves who are better appraisers than experts.

308
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:52,010
We need a man of your untainted patriotism and natural caliber...

309
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:56,340
in order to purge our society
of the crimes against cultural assets.

310
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,380
I'm not quite so qualified,
but I'll help in any way I can.

311
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:10,060
Please become an advisory member
of our regulations team.

312
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,230
Excuse me?

313
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,970
With the CHA's intelligence capabilities and the investigations team's mobility...

314
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:21,150
we have nothing to fear
if we add the expert ability...

315
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,140
of an academic like yourself.

316
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:30,930
What do you say?
Will you become an advisory member?

317
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,290
That's impossible!
Absolutely impossible!

318
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,050
Chohee, what did you say?

319
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,930
(What are you doing?)

320
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,320
She said it was impossible.

321
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,010
Are you out of your mind?

322
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,390
What do you have against Bumsang Kim to say something like that?

323
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,930
I said it before
I could stop myself...

324
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,180
Do you think it's easy
to recruit a man of that caliber?

325
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,920
Think a little before you act!

326
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,370
He may have the ability, but he doesn't have the constitution to do our work.

327
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,930
And how do you know that?

328
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,100
Besides, did you think that was
the time and place for you to speak up?

329
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,220
How could you do that
in front of the director?

330
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,310
I'm sorry.

331
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,030
Fine, get back to work.

332
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:53,000
She won't get away with that ridiculous behavior in front of the director.

333
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,040
A written apology is a given
and a salary reduction is a possibility.

334
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:00,140
Even Chief Noh's coddling
won't save her butt this time.

335
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:06,170
Why does Chohee deem
Bumsang Kim to be so unworthy?

336
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,950
Does she consider anyone worthy?

337
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,120
Nope.

338
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:21,100
I'm sorry for all
the dissension I caused.

339
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,980
What do you mean?
I should be the one apologizing.

340
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:27,390
Don't pay any attention
to what she said.

341
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:34,210
And could you reconsider my offer?

342
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,080
I would love to become
an advisory member...

343
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:46,280
but I don't want to cause
discord within the CHA.

344
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:51,180
Harmony in the organization
is critical, isn't it?

345
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,980
Mr. Kim...

346
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:59,930
You offered me a chance to work for the country, so it breaks my heart to refuse.

347
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,920
Please take care, Director.

348
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:18,060
I never thought she'd do me a service, but that Chohee Heo woman saved me.

349
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,300
If it wasn't for her, I would
have been helpless to refuse.

350
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,110
Just the thought of it
gives me the chills.

351
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:31,160
Of course I can't forgive her for cutting me down in front of all those people.

352
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:38,950
But everyone already knew of my noble character so they didn't believe a word.

353
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,930
She probably got quite
an earful from her superiors.

354
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:47,200
So the director offered you
the advisory position, but you refused?

355
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,240
Right.
I refused quite graciously.

356
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,920
Why would I want to work for the Man? It's a thankless job with little pay.

357
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,050
You idiot!

358
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:58,100
Why?

359
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,350
Know what you just refused? That's the highway to the CHA committee position.

360
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:08,130
And it pays a lot. The lecturer job and that TV show gig don't even compare.

361
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:14,240
You go in as a committee member,
rub elbows with the influential...

362
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,210
and who's to say you won't be
the director someday?

363
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,910
Director of the CHA?

364
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:24,240
Yes, idiot. If you were so clueless,
you should have asked me for advice.

365
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:28,340
You're still on your high horse
even after losing the professorship.

366
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:38,390
It doesn't make sense to lose someone like Bumsang Kim because of Chohee.

367
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:41,900
Shouldn't we apologize
to him and bring him in?

368
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:44,140
Do you think she'll apologize?

369
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:52,110
I'll go in her stead. I'll go apologize sincerely and ask him once more.

370
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,080
Think that'll convince him?
He doesn't need us.

371
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:59,240
We need an advisory member immediately, so find some candidates.

372
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,230
Professors or section chiefs
at museums are good.

373
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,340
That Chohee screws up everything.

374
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:20,040
Chief, an accomplice of Mr. Kim's just confessed what the smuggled item is.

375
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,080
Really?

376
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,150
Yes.

377
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,080
What's the item?

378
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,190
I'm not sure.
Let's go.

379
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,000
All right.

380
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,070
Joohyun, you, too.

381
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,950
This is the “Naegeumgang,”
painted by Kyeomjae Jeongsun...

382
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,260
the authority of real-life landscape paintings of the later Joseon era.

383
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,310
The owner was Mr. Park of Namwon
in the Northern Cholla Province.

384
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:38,240
In July of 2005, after it was designated a national cultural asset, it was stolen.

385
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,000
It was smuggled into Japan by Mr. Kim, but the yen currency dropped in value.

386
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,170
We suspect it was smuggled back
when its value skyrocketed here.

387
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:50,220
So we don't know
who received it from Mr. Kim?

388
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,190
Officer Cho.

389
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,370
Yes, the thing is, that is everything
the accomplice Piljoong Park knew.

390
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:03,920
With Mr. Kim refusing to acknowledge all this, it'll be hard to get a confession.

391
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,950
Still so incompetent at your work
after how many years as a fuzz?

392
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:09,390
Well, about fifteen...
Hey!

393
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,120
So we have no choice other
than to sniff around here and there.

394
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,010
We'll take
Insa-dong and Jangan-pyeong.

395
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,380
We'll investigate the smuggling
routes within the country.

396
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,210
Then let's go to our respective
areas and scope things out.

397
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,100
- Yes, sir.
- Good work.

398
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,190
Don't call me a fuzz.

399
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,920
That's what you are.

400
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,040
Go ahead.

401
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,220
You fuzz!

402
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,960
I'm sorry.

403
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,350
Go first.

404
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,200
No, you first.

405
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,270
[Briefing Room]

406
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,950
Lady Luck's on your side today.

407
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,310
Still under sixteen.

408
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,040
Hit me, hit me.

409
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,160
I'm almost out.
Let's stop.

410
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,200
Hit me!

411
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,050
Don't you think
you're pushing your luck?

412
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:14,360
After all those black jacks,
you still want to risk it all?

413
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,240
Stop while you're ahead!

414
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,980
Hit me, hit me!

415
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,260
What?

416
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,350
Behind you...

417
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,070
We're under attack!

418
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,260
Hello.

419
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,990
You startled me!

420
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:07,120
I was more startled. Why did
you start running? C'mon.

421
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,190
Did you eat?

422
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,120
I'm starving.

423
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:19,090
How much did you make?
This is all? Pathetic.

424
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,300
Stop, stop.

425
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,910
You should've called first.
I nearly had a heart attack.

426
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,910
And how would
I know your latest number?

427
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:40,020
If people find out we're close, that'll
be the end of me in this line of work.

428
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,960
Then quit.

429
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:46,350
Thievery's all I'm good at,
so how can I quit?

430
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:54,330
You're the one who should quit.
You're the daughter of an art thief.

431
00:34:54,330 --> 00:35:01,200
It's ridiculous that you work for the man who always stuffed your dad into prison.

432
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,030
Uncle...

433
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:08,220
I know you joined that regulations team to find your dad, but it's time to stop.

434
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:12,120
Seven years of no news
means he's a dead man.

435
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:18,090
If he were alive, that jerk Noh would've stuffed him into prison a long time ago.

436
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,030
So...

437
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,970
If he's alive,
I'll be the one to catch him.

438
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:31,200
Before Chief Noh can catch him,
I'll catch him and lock him up myself.

439
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,180
That is, if he's alive...

440
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,090
You impertinent punk.

441
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:54,360
Oh, by the way, there's a new item
on the market these days, right?

442
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,330
Dunno.

443
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,110
Kyeomjae's “Naegeumgang.”
Who has it?

444
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:02,030
I seriously don't know.

445
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:04,280
You're the regulations team,
I'm a middleman.

446
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,900
If we share information, that's an infraction of the unspoken rules.

447
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:13,320
We have to uphold the codes
of our respective spheres.

448
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,160
Shut up and foot the bill.

449
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:21,260
How come I paid everything?

450
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:26,220
This is my number for the time being,
so tell Gyoon I want to drink with him.

451
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:28,010
- This number?
- Yeah.

452
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,150
All right.

453
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,980
Oh, by the way...

454
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,130
What is it?

455
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,980
This.

456
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,050
What is that?

457
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,970
What do you
think you're doing?

458
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,930
- Take it!
- What are you doing?

459
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:43,210
Please, take it.

460
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:47,130
Soyeon's starting school, right?
Buy her a new backpack.

461
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:55,200
And don't work too hard. I don't
want to be the one to catch you, okay?

462
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,300
Then I'm off.

463
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,240
I don't want to get
caught by you, either.

464
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,270
Do you know
what you just refused?

465
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:16,300
That position is the highway to becoming a CHA commissioner. And it pays a lot.

466
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:20,220
You go in as a committee member,
rub elbows with the powerful...

467
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,270
and who's to say you won't
be the director someday?

468
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:29,340
Argh, I'm such an idiot. It was a golden opportunity to enter into public office.

469
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,230
Ow, my head...

470
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:41,910
Wait a moment. Should I
just go and say I reconsidered?

471
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,920
No, no. I have to
save face. Can't do that.

472
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,950
<Teaching Assistant's Office>

473
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:01,100
You don't have to submit
curricula for these two courses.

474
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:07,170
Why? I can't just recycle last semester's. I bulked it up so submit this copy.

475
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,910
That's not it. Um.

476
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:13,160
Professor Yongchul Gong
will explain things to you.

477
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,120
I'm teaching those courses.

478
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,140
What?

479
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:24,940
I have to fulfill some mandatory credits as professor. I'm incredibly sorry.

480
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:31,070
Don't be. I was gonna cut back on some lectures since I'm so busy these days.

481
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,310
That's a relief.

482
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:38,010
Ah, I heard you were checking out professorship positions at other schools.

483
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,340
How's that going?

484
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,360
Something'll come up.

485
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,310
I'm sure. But do you think other
schools will be easier to penetrate?

486
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:53,280
After all, most professors hate
TV personalities like yourself.

487
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,240
And you're a graduate
from a different school.

488
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:59,040
Isn't that enough to get you
dropped in the initial interview?

489
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:07,000
Oh man, look at the time.
I need to attend a professors' meeting.

490
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:16,350
If you look in the countryside, I'm sure someone will take you. Good luck.

491
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:22,310
What? Ugh,
I wanna just kick his -

492
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,080
Hello, this is Bumsang Kim.

493
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:35,150
Who?
Joohyun Wang of the CHA?

494
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,310
‘Here about
the advisory position?'

495
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,250
'Of course it's their loss
to lose a talent like me.'

496
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:52,080
‘Give it your all to convince me.
I'll pretend to give in reluctantly.'

497
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:57,120
You were offended by
Chohee yesterday, weren't you?

498
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,990
Don't worry about it.

499
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,100
No, I know you were offended.

500
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:06,910
Reputation and pride are crucial
for an academic like yourself.

501
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,310
That slanderous attack
must've been hurtful.

502
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:14,090
Thank you for your
sincere consideration.

503
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,310
I spent all night wondering...

504
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:21,210
if I was right in refusing
the position for the sake of my pride.

505
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,130
Perhaps it was a narrow-minded decision on my part...

506
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,920
Narrow-minded!

507
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,310
It's not narrow-minded at all.

508
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:34,270
I feel bad for making you
come all this way.

509
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:37,180
Though of course
I'm glad to see you again.

510
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:44,390
There's no need to feel bad.
Everything worked out for the best.

511
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,240
Really?

512
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:53,220
The newly instated Professor Yongchul Gong agreed to take the position.

513
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,970
Wh - what?

514
00:40:55,230 --> 00:41:01,390
At first I thought it absolutely had
to be you. But I realized I was wrong.

515
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:05,920
Someone of your caliber
shouldn't be tied down to the CHA.

516
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,100
You should do bigger
and better things than that.

517
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,310
Wait, so, Joohyun...

518
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:18,920
Of course there will be people at the CHA who will resent you for refusing.

519
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:26,170
But they're small fry that don't know the importance of pride, so ignore them.

520
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,130
Look here, Ms. Joohyun Wang... Then why did you come to see me today?

521
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:33,930
What?

522
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,050
Oh, of course to apologize
for yesterday's occurrence.

523
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:53,320
I sincerely apologize on behalf
of Chohee Heo and the CHA. I'm sorry.

524
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,380
Drink up. You must
be thirsty. You talked a lot.

525
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,230
So why isn't
Chohee Heo here herself?

526
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:17,180
Of course she should be here,
but she's not the type to apologize.

527
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,000
She's so into scoring honors...

528
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,370
she's probably sweeping the streets
for the item this very moment.

529
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:25,020
What item?

530
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:35,040
I trust you, but it's
a matter of strict confidentiality.

531
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,990
Then, I should get going.

532
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,300
I'll see you again sometime.

533
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,250
Yes, see you again.
Thank you for that.

534
00:42:55,370 --> 00:43:00,010
Why are all the CHA women weird?
Are they all jinxed?

535
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:04,260
So Chohee Heo is looking
for an item, eh?

536
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:14,990
I really don't know.
Really.

537
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:18,340
I gave up that life
a long time ago, so don't ask me.

538
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,080
I know it hasn't been that long
since you were released from prison.

539
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:28,080
The CHA's information network
is slower than I thought.

540
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:36,260
I went in for adultery. Got into
a bit of trouble thanks to the wife.

541
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:42,910
Sorry I'm not much help.

542
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:51,380
I sincerely thank you
for cooperating.

543
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:57,120
If you have any information,
please contact me at the CHA.

544
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:18,220
I really don't know!

545
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,370
Hey, it's the national hero!
What brings you here?

546
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:33,950
Cut the crap. What item
was that woman looking for?

547
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:39,960
The regulations team is looking for it, which means it's tainted.

548
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,000
There's no point
in fishing for it now.

549
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,110
I have my reasons.
What's the item?

550
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:49,210
Kyeomjae's “Naegeumgang,”
I think she said?

551
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,100
“Naegeumgang?”

552
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:59,220
So, who's the specialist
fisherman these days?

553
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,310
Jongtae Lee of Cheongyecheon.

554
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:03,280
Third-time offender of trafficking stolen goods. And he's an expert of paintings.

555
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,980
Can't be him. He doesn't have the funds. How about Chulyong Uhm of Daegu?

556
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:13,270
Chulyong Uhm? Probably not him. He repented and attends church religiously.

557
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:14,290
Dari Jong of Daegu.

558
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:15,990
Didn't he stow away to China?

559
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:18,010
Jongtaek Go of Insa-dong.

560
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:19,390
He followed Dari Jong.

561
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:21,010
What the...

562
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:22,330
Jichul Kim of Hwanghak-dong.

563
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:25,120
Right! Kim's good
at fishing the big ones.

564
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,280
He's in prison right now.

565
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,910
Giljin Nah of Dapship-ri.

566
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:28,970
Inchool Park of Andong.

567
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:29,990
Jongtaek Go of Insa-dong.

568
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:32,150
We already
mentioned Jongtaek Go!

569
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:34,100
Yonggu Lee of Uijongbu.

570
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,080
Old habits die hard, right?

571
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:41,120
That also goes for dancing, right?

572
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,170
Welcome.

573
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,370
Welcome.

574
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:12,240
Sis, some well-mannered and good-looking guys are interested in you.

575
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:16,220
I don't see any.

576
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,210
You have high standards.

577
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:22,290
All right, I'll make sure you
have love and pleasure tonight.

578
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,380
Tell me what type
of man you want.

579
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,260
There is a type...

580
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,340
Who, who?
I'll set it up right away.

581
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,970
Let me see...

582
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:46,200
Am I seeing things? You're not the type to grace these halls, yet here you are.

583
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,040
I heard you're fishing for something different these days, not your usual item.

584
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,300
News travels fast.
How'd you hear?

585
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:55,070
If you're dipping your feet into
a new pond, keep it on the down low.

586
00:46:55,070 --> 00:46:56,240
Why are you
trailing dirt everywhere?

587
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:01,110
Aw, man.
If you're interested, just say so.

588
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:05,900
Lord, no. Why would I want
something that already stinks?

589
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,300
What the...
What do you mean it stinks?

590
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:13,030
See that over there?
She already caught scent of the stink.

591
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,090
Ah, there he is.

592
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,050
Oh, excuse me.

593
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:35,250
Look who it is.
It's Chohee Heo from the CHA.

594
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,210
Bumsang Kim?

595
00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:40,030
I never imagined
I'd meet you in a place like this.

596
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:42,270
I don't want to deal with you
right now, so get out of the way.

597
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,340
We should have a drink together
when we met so coincidentally.

598
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:47,070
Get out of the way!

599
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:51,100
You shouldn't be so rude
to someone who's being considerate.

600
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:51,970
Let go!

601
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:57,960
Wait, wait. If you don't feel like
drinking, shall we dance instead?

602
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,070
Oh my!

603
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,290
Let go already!

604
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,350
It common courtesy
to dance at least one song.

605
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:28,380
Oh yeah?

606
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:47,140
What a complete weirdo!

607
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,200
Excuse me.

608
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,210
Where did he go?

609
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:10,050
What was
Bumsang Kim's problem?

610
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:22,130
Is she gone?
Whew, that was a close shave.

611
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,230
Mr. Kim, thanks a lot.

612
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:29,200
No need to thank me.

613
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:34,280
See how it stinks? The “Naegeumgang.” What are you going to do with it?

614
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,220
Oh, Gyoon? What's up?

615
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:58,180
<i> What do you mean, “What's up?”
Do you know what time it is?</i>

616
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,140
<i> Are you coming home or not?</i>

617
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:11,020
Um, I'll be home soon. Yeah.

618
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,350
Hello, this is
Chohee Heo of the CHA.

619
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,170
Hello?

620
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,930
What did you say?

621
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,900
[Office]

622
00:50:48,910 --> 00:50:51,240
Honey, it's your phone.

623
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:54,170
Who is it?

624
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:02,930
Chief, the item is on the move.

625
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:04,910
What?

626
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,360
Where's the location?

627
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,240
The entrance to
Mt. Jangyong in Okcheon.

628
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:23,120
And the investigations team?
Did you call them?

629
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,020
Yes, we agreed
to meet at the tollgate.

630
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:27,960
All right. Let's meet up
at the Okcheon tollgate.

631
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,110
Yes, sir.

632
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:35,320
Why can't the item move
during broad daylight?

633
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,390
Why in the middle of the night?

634
00:51:37,390 --> 00:51:39,070
That's what I'm saying.

635
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,980
Joohyun, what's wrong?

636
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:46,900
Yes?
Nothing. Go, go.

637
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,040
Chief?

638
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,220
Yes?

639
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:05,100
My gut tells me
something's wrong.

640
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:12,170
Night runs like this
always have a bad feel.

641
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:15,270
Did you ever even have a good
feeling about anything before?

642
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:20,920
Chief, that's not fair at all.

643
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:26,080
It sounded like you were dismissing
my intuition, am I wrong?

644
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,950
Yes, you heard wrong.

645
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:32,230
Okay, we're off!

646
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:37,030
By the way, what is the item?

647
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,900
<i> Mt. Jangyong</i>

648
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,950
Hey, do you have kimchi on you?

649
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:31,990
Why would I have kimchi?

650
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,010
Mr. Nah! Mr. Nah!

651
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,110
Is the item safe?

652
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:57,070
We know that
you're just a delivery boy.

653
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:01,120
We won't arrest you,
so just hand the item over.

654
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,170
Hey, stop!

655
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:26,090
Take me with you!

656
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:41,900
There's a car! Careful!

657
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,130
Hey, look!

658
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,360
Chohee!

659
00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:00,230
Where's the item? Stand up!
Where's the item? Where is it?

660
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:01,250
I don't know.

661
00:56:01,250 --> 00:56:02,260
Where is it?

662
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:06,130
Where is it?
Where's the item, you punk?

663
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:13,030
I really don't know.
All I did was ride the motorcycle.

664
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:47,190
Ah, it's beautiful.
The “Naegeumgang.”

665
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:54,360
I wonder if Chohee Heo
enjoys the butt of the joke?

666
00:56:55,300 --> 00:57:01,130
Tell Chairman Jang that I want twenty smackers. Then I'll hand it over.

667
00:57:01,130 --> 00:57:05,020
A tainted piece like this
is hard to handle.

668
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,100
The regulations team
is already on your tail.

669
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,380
Aw, man.
Then what should I do?

670
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:16,220
If there's no use in holding onto it,
isn't there just one possibility?

671
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:20,910
Darnit.

672
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:32,260
Chohee, did you get
the location and time right?

673
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:33,960
Yes.

674
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:38,280
Are you sure
it wasn't a prank call?

675
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:44,160
It wasn't. The person
knew the “Naegeumgang” well.

676
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:49,090
So what? If he wasn't planning to
move it, it was essentially a prank call.

677
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:53,380
My car... darnit, Chohee!

678
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,900
Let's call it a night.

679
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:08,040
What? What are we doing
here in the middle of the night?

680
00:58:11,290 --> 00:58:14,170
I knew this mission
had a bad feeling.

681
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:18,930
Next time you wanna go on a
wild goose chase, go by yourself, okay?

682
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:29,320
I understand that you want to earn
more honors, but go a little easy.

683
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:35,290
Haven't you considered the idea that something like this is a nuisance to all?

684
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,380
Then again...

685
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:46,200
if you were the type to consider that,
this would've never happened. Goodbye.

686
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:57,340
Don't worry about it, Chohee.
It could happen to anyone.

687
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:01,100
Come on, let's grab some breakfast.
I'll buy you some hot soup.

688
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:58,360
You're going to send me
to an early grave, I swear.

689
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:04,160
What woman says she'll come right home and doesn't show up ‘til dawn?

690
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:09,250
Was your finger broken? Why couldn't you call me? It's common courtesy...

691
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:15,900
Then again, there are times
when you just can't call.

692
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:20,210
I'm not curious at all.

693
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:29,080
Gyoon, there's
this person on my team.

694
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:36,990
Thanks to him, we spent the entire night driving around a mountain on a fake tip.

695
01:00:36,990 --> 01:00:42,210
That jerk! So did
he apologize to everyone?

696
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:44,920
No.

697
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,060
How could he not?

698
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:53,200
It's obvious he's apologetic.
Does he have to put it into words?

699
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:57,270
He should say it all the more
because it's obvious.

700
01:00:57,270 --> 01:01:01,270
If you don't put things into words,
people will never know.

701
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:09,970
Sis, when you get to work tomorrow, advise him to apologize to everyone.

702
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:18,040
You do the dishes today.
Thanks for the food.

703
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:24,120
Ah, what am I
going to do with her?

704
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:32,110
I'm really sorry about
what happened last night.

705
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:35,010
I'm sincerely sorry.

706
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:43,060
I'm sorry about
yesterday. I'm sorry.

707
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,070
My bad.

708
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:49,940
Darnit.

709
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:14,150
What are you looking for?

710
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:19,350
Mr. Nah, where is everyone?

711
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:23,330
Didn't you hear?
Joohyun found the “Naegeumgang.”

712
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:24,920
What?

713
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:34,160
Sucks to be her. Ow.

714
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:42,260
“Naegeumgang.”
I knew you'd make us proud.

715
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:51,240
Joohyun, how did you find it?

716
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,210
You've got
your priorities all wrong.

717
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:59,150
Having caused all of us so much trouble yesterday, you should apologize first.

718
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:04,250
I don't even expect an apology.
Take some lessons from Joohyun.

719
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,960
She finds things without
causing us trouble. Isn't it great?

720
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:13,050
What are you all doing here?
Let's start the morning meeting.

721
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:14,920
Yes, sir.

722
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:22,260
Does it really matter
who found it and how?

723
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:28,980
What matters is this valuable cultural asset is back in our country's care.

724
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:38,390
Ah, but since you're
dying of curiosity, I'll tell you.

725
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:44,970
Mr. Kim helped me.
Bumsang Kim.

726
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:51,110
“Bumsang Kim?”

727
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:57,930
Bumsang Kim helped her?

728
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:00,200
Hold on.

729
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,370
It's Chohee Heo.

730
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:05,180
I never imagined
I'd run into you here.

731
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:10,140
Bumsang Kim!

732
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:30,350
What is the busy government
employee doing here?

733
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:35,070
Ah, you want to thank me for helping
to find the “Naegeumgang,” right?

734
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:36,980
Hey.

735
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:43,290
Was it you?
Did you plan the whole thing?

736
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:48,090
Isn't this a bit
rough for a thank you?

737
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:50,080
Your innocent act
isn't fooling anyone!

738
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:53,210
You hid the “Naegeumgang”
to screw me over!

739
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:59,920
Got proof? Do you?
Ms. Heo, let me give you some advice.

740
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,370
Get rid of that bad habit of accusing people without evidence. Bye.

741
01:05:04,370 --> 01:05:06,120
How immature.

742
01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:12,120
Was it fun playing
a joke like that? Was it?

743
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:16,140
If you're going to play a joke,
you should've just done it to me.

744
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:20,370
Why does my entire team have to stay up all night and suffer on your whim?

745
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:22,050
Why?

746
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:28,930
I found an item you guys couldn't. Shouldn't you be thanking me?

747
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:32,190
You're pretty darn transparent, you know?

748
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:39,060
We nearly had it, and so it was useless
to get a hold of it. So you gave it up.

749
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:44,340
Otherwise, after your joke, you would've handed it over to some chairman.

750
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,260
Am I wrong?

751
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:52,050
Think what you will.
But you think people will believe you?

752
01:05:53,310 --> 01:05:57,390
I don't care if they don't.
Because I'll remember it.

753
01:05:58,980 --> 01:06:04,060
And let me give you some advice.
Keep your nose clean.

754
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:09,210
If I so much as get a whiff of stolen goods near you, I'll bring you down.

755
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:18,110
If you don't want any regrets, then don't get your hands dirty, all right? Got it?

756
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,370
You're the one who's going
to have regrets, not me.

757
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:46,150
That jerk. If I catch another toe
out of line, I won't restrain myself.

758
01:06:53,090 --> 01:06:58,980
The following items were retrieved from the Hayeon Gallery robbery of April 21st.

759
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:06,020
This book is the single item
we couldn't retrieve.

760
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:09,230
According to the Cultural Properties Research Facility the book title is...

761
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:13,100
Ah, excuse me for a moment.

762
01:07:20,190 --> 01:07:22,340
The title is “Tonggamjeolyo.”

763
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:25,220
That's the “Tonggamjeolyo?”

764
01:07:32,910 --> 01:07:35,210
The “Tonggamjeolyo” was printed
by a wooden press...

765
01:07:36,110 --> 01:07:39,020
but this was definitely
printed by a metal one.

766
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:42,130
Bumsang Kim?

767
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:45,220
That's not “Tonggamjeolyo.”

768
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:47,300
It's “Songjopyojeonchongryu,”
which was printed...

769
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,380
during Taejong's rule
with the gyemi print type.

770
01:07:56,030 --> 01:08:03,080
Mr. Kim, I'm not sure why you're here, but this is none of your business.

771
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:08,330
Chohee, you're being rude.

772
01:08:09,110 --> 01:08:12,300
How can you disregard
the opinion of our advisory member?

773
01:08:13,060 --> 01:08:14,030
Committee member?

774
01:08:16,150 --> 01:08:17,250
Please be the bigger person.

775
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:24,170
Let me make a formal introduction.
It took a lot of effort to recruit him.

776
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:31,940
This is the new advisory member of
our regulations team, Bumsang Kim.

777
01:08:41,910 --> 01:09:49,350

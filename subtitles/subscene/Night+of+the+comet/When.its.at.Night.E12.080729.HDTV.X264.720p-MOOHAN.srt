<i>Episode 12

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,600
Hey, this is Bumsang.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,650
[Bumsang?
Why would you call me?]

6
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:25,510
I have something to ask you.
Are you free right now?

7
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,790
[Now? I'm at home.]

8
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,970
I'll head over there, then. Yeah.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,780
‘Yongcheol wouldn't get specific,
but I think it's a statue of Buddha.'

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,980
‘Taesoo stole seven national treasures.'

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:47,590
Take out the returned “Sowonhwagae” scrapbook, the “Chochung” collection...

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,560
and the “Maejukmun” vase,
and there are four remaining.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,560
They are Duryang Kim's “Sansu” painting,
the “Gimainmul” double goblets...

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,560
the “Geumdongdae” incense burner, and
the “Geumdongyeorae” standing Buddha.

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,680
The “Geumdongyeorae”
standing Buddha statue...

16
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,820
Why does Bumsang want
to come over at this hour? Jeez...

17
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,930
The minister and madam said
they're going to be late tonight.

18
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:16,740
Then just go on home.

19
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,710
Okay.

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,630
Bye, Mary. See you tomorrow.

21
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,700
What a nice house
Yongcheol lives in.

22
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,810
Robin Hood?

23
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,800
Are you Taesoo Heo?

24
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,600
So why didn't Robin Hood show up?

25
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,950
He seemed to know like a bloodhound
when to steal Chairman Jang's items.

26
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,820
Why else?
He knew it wasn't a stolen good.

27
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,990
How is it that your intelligence
capabilities fall short of a thief's?

28
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,780
How tactless...

29
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,840
Shouldn't we charge him with
attempting to smuggle items abroad?

30
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,820
You idiot.

31
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,830
How can we when he just showed it
to Iwazaki or whatever his name was?

32
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:00,730
This is all your fault. You prodded us
into action with false information.

33
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,630
Fine, it's all my fault.

34
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,910
It's my fault we gave Chairman Jang
something to find fault in.

35
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:11,500
Chief, what should we do now?

36
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,540
The milk is already spilt.
We'll just have to settle the matter well.

37
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,880
Everyone must be tired.
Let's wrap things up here and leave.

38
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,760
Jeez, no one's even offering
to take responsibility.

39
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,540
- Stop it already.
- The next meal's on you.

40
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,980
Chohee!

41
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,610
Yes, Chief?

42
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,520
Are you headed home?

43
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,780
I thought about buying dinner
to make it up to everyone.

44
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,690
But I wasn't sure I could
keep a smile on my face.

45
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,670
And I didn't want to sit there
all sullen, so I'm just going home.

46
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,940
Rough day, wasn't it?

47
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:06,910
No. I just feel bad for causing
everyone so much trouble.

48
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,860
Everyone's just doing their jobs. Besides,
you're the one who's most disappointed.

49
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,770
The raid failed so we might
as well console ourselves.

50
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,800
We probably shouldn't drink.
What should we do?

51
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:25,890
It's okay, Chief. You don't need
to force yourself for my sake.

52
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,710
It's not because of you,
but because I'm really depressed.

53
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,710
But I know how you really feel.
There's really no need to pretend, Chief.

54
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,910
And tomorrow's another day.

55
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,810
Thank you for caring.

56
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,770
Okay then. Go home.

57
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,930
Okay, bye, Chief.

58
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:40,640
Gyoon.
Gyoon? I'm home.

59
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,740
Hey, Sis.

60
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,620
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

61
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,750
No, I'm just tired from
working my part-time job.

62
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,500
I thought I told you not to work.

63
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,550
Jeez, how can I slack off
when you're working so hard?

64
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,970
Why are you so late?
Did you have a raid today?

65
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,610
For the Robin Hood case.

66
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:10,860
Bro, I mean, Bumsang told me
you guys think Dad is Robin Hood.

67
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,720
You think so, too?

68
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,930
All the evidence points to him.

69
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:28,600
Maybe he thinks he can come back if
he's Robin Hood and not General Shovel.

70
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:29,840
Sis.

71
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,860
Gyoon, only he knows the truth
so I'll find him quickly.

72
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,870
Let's ask him then, okay?

73
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,940
It wasn't Taesoo Heo.
It was a young man.

74
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,760
So who could it be?

75
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,930
Did something happen between
you and Yongcheol last night?

76
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,870
Oh, right. I forgot about
meeting Yongcheol last night.

77
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:29,600
He called me at dawn saying some
gibberish about you being Robin Hood.

78
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,500
Me?

79
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,700
Why is everyone accusing me
of being Robin Hood?

80
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,960
Who else thinks so?

81
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,750
What's going on?

82
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,780
It's probably Robin Hood again.

83
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,680
Robin Hood?

84
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:51,760
Happens so often that the shock factor's
gone. I wonder what came today?

85
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,930
The “Geumdongyeorae” standing statue.

86
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:59,600
How'd you know that?
Are you really Robin Hood?

87
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,700
Joohyun, what happened?

88
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,820
Same method as before. Bumsang
verified that it's General Shovel's -

89
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,780
Mr. Heo's stolen item,
the “Geumdongyeorae” standing statue.

90
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,800
It seems he stole it yesterday
while we were chasing the wrong rabbit.

91
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,700
The first thing we need to do
is find out who was robbed.

92
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,500
It was stolen from
Professor Yongcheol Gong's home.

93
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,570
His father is Minister Jintae Gong.

94
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,730
I believe Chairman Jang
recently sent it to him as a bribe.

95
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,790
Oh my god...

96
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,970
Chohee.

97
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,500
We need to talk.

98
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,510
Chohee.

99
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,960
Yes, Chief?

100
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,960
It's not a big deal. I just wanted to tell
you about the afternoon schedule.

101
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,920
Can we discuss that later?

102
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,560
Sure.

103
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,570
Let's go.

104
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,680
Notice the cold war between them?

105
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,740
It started a few days ago,
and I don't know why.

106
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,570
What is it you want to talk about?

107
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,550
What else?
Look, I'm sorry.

108
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,760
I'm apologizing for misunderstanding
and saying things carelessly.

109
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,640
The reason I got so mad was...

110
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,510
The reason why isn't so important.

111
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,990
I acted in a way that would cause
misunderstanding, so I'm sorry, too.

112
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,580
Are we done?

113
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:45,570
I don't know what to tell you, Minister
Gong. It was a gift with good intentions...

114
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,670
Yes, yes.
I'll pay you a visit next time.

115
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,750
The whole thing ended up putting you
in an awkward position.

116
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:04,620
I know. Only my items are getting
robbed. It seems I'm being targeted.

117
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:08,640
It definitely has to be Taesoo Heo.

118
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,680
What happened with Chairman Iwazaki?

119
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,550
He returned to Tokyo today.

120
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:21,560
Seeing how he didn't take the pottery,
he was very angry. What should we do?

121
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,720
Ohseong Group's fate lies in
Iwazaki's hands so we must take action.

122
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,730
Look into the matter.

123
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,920
Yes, sir.

124
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,800
When will the landscaping
project be done?

125
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,960
This chaotic atmosphere
is only adding to my stress.

126
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,830
Today's the last day, sir.

127
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,760
Okay. Leave.

128
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,840
Are you done?

129
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,840
Yes, we just have
to make some final touches.

130
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,830
Thank you for working hard
in this hot weather.

131
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:02,980
Here.

132
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,820
Thank you.

133
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,560
Then please wrap things up.

134
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,800
Yes, sir.
Call us for any future jobs.

135
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,770
Sure.

136
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,740
Hey, boy!

137
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,560
That's enough.
Let's wrap things up.

138
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,650
Here.

139
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,820
Thank you.

140
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,920
You're quite good at this.

141
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,930
Sis!

142
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,720
Why did you want
to meet here of all places?

143
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,740
I wanted to buy
my big sister some clothes.

144
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,660
And where would
you get the money for that?

145
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,560
I got paid today.

146
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,540
Jeez, you should
just use it for yourself.

147
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,500
Shall we take a look?

148
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:06,550
Oh, this is hot. This one.
What do you think? It's perfect for you.

149
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,680
You want me to wear this thing?

150
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,510
I think Bro would really
enjoy seeing you in this.

151
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,900
“Bro” again.

152
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:18,760
Sis, let's buy some clothes, go out to eat
and watch a movie. It's all on me.

153
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,520
I can have dinner,
but I can't watch a movie.

154
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,520
Another item arrived at the museum.

155
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,830
I think Dad intends to return
all the items before coming back to us.

156
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,760
Sis...

157
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,530
But at least he's alive, right?

158
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,750
Can I choose what I want?

159
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:54,680
Man, I'm full. It was even more
delicious since my brother's buying.

160
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,970
Was it good, Sis?

161
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,610
Yeah, it was really good.

162
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,810
What's this?

163
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,910
This? It's for Dad.

164
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:09,900
I realized I never gave
Dad any gifts before.

165
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,880
I just said things like I hate you.

166
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,590
So I bought this to give to him
when he comes back.

167
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,990
So it's for Dad?

168
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,790
Yeah. Wanna see?

169
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:29,510
He always wore a hat, remember?
So I bought this hat and some shirts.

170
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,860
And I even bought
some underwear for him.

171
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,990
Sis, what are you going to do
if he doesn't come back?

172
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,830
Gyoon.

173
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:45,610
If Dad doesn't come back after you do
all this, what are you going to do?

174
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,950
He's alive so don't worry about it.

175
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:55,770
And I just told you, another item
came to the museum this morning.

176
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:04,930
I don't know where he is but he's alive,
and we'll get to see him again.

177
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,730
That's Robin Hood's doing! Why do
you keep insisting Dad is Robin Hood?

178
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:15,510
Don't tell me you believe he's alive
because you think he's Robin Hood.

179
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,690
Not exactly,
but I still think Dad is...

180
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,660
Why would Dad do that?
Dad isn't Robin Hood!

181
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,740
If that's your reason for believing
he's alive, then he's dead.

182
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,580
Then Dad is definitely dead!

183
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,510
What? What did you just say?
What did you say!

184
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,730
Think about it, Sis.

185
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,550
If he were alive, why didn't
he come find us? Why didn't he call?

186
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,980
If he's such a coldhearted person,
he should've died a long time ago!

187
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,920
He should be dead!

188
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,790
What did you just say?
You wish he's dead?

189
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,710
How could you say that?
How could you say something like that?

190
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,770
Everyone's waiting for you
at the pub nearby. You know why?

191
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,550
To comfort me for the
disciplinary action I received?

192
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:34,870
Yes. Our regulations team
is known for our loyalty.

193
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,660
I've been thinking.
Chohee's being really rude.

194
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,840
Why?

195
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:48,990
I mean, you received a three-month
salary reduction for yesterday's mishap.

196
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,870
But she hasn't even called to console
you. How can she be so indifferent?

197
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:57,640
She's suffering the most right now.

198
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,620
Compared to that,
my punishment is nothing.

199
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,620
But Chief.

200
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,720
How do you understand
Chohee's feelings so well?

201
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,940
Do you like her?

202
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,830
No way. You're not
the type to cheat on me.

203
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:29,570
Anyway, Chief, I can't stand
the humiliation you had to go through.

204
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,710
Speaking of which,
about Chairman Jang...

205
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,920
Revenge? The badger game?

206
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,620
How'd he know?

207
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,990
Chief, you are clairvoyant!
Oh, Bumsang!

208
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,830
We're going for a drink.
Want to come?

209
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:54,880
No, I have something
to discuss with Chief Kang.

210
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,810
You saw Robin Hood?

211
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,720
I heard Minister Gong received
a present from Chairman Jang.

212
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,660
I ran into him when I went to check
if the gift was one of Heo's items.

213
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,590
And?

214
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:15,520
If Chohee's father were Robin Hood,
he'd be close to sixty now.

215
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,990
The person I ran into
was a young man.

216
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,920
A young man?

217
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:26,980
From what I could tell from his physique
and his movement. I'm positive.

218
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,830
Then Robin Hood is not Taesoo Heo.

219
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,830
I'm telling you this because
I thought you should know. Then...

220
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,650
Bumsang, you didn't tell
Chohee this, did you?

221
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,900
No. I only told you.

222
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,510
You're the one who can find
Taesoo Heo the quickest.

223
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,840
Thank you.

224
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,910
You're welcome.

225
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,960
[Your call has been forwarded...]

226
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,820
Why isn't he picking up?

227
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,560
It's already late in the night.

228
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,840
Is that you, Gyoon?

229
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,920
Bumsang.

230
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,850
Gyoon isn't home yet?

231
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:51,690
Yeah.

232
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:54,790
That kid.
He shouldn't stay out too late.

233
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,680
What brings you here?

234
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:03,940
The thing is... well...

235
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,750
Let's make up.

236
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:09,670
Make up?

237
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:14,880
We already apologized to each other,
so why are we making up again?

238
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,730
But you're not over it yet.
You're still upset with me, right?

239
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,750
I don't know about you,
but I can't stand this anymore.

240
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:32,890
I hate you giving me the stiff shoulder
and ignoring me. So let's make up.

241
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,780
Let's make up!

242
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,770
Did you come here to
yell at me or make up with me?

243
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:42,920
So do you want to make up or not?

244
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,610
Jeez, why are you yelling?
This is my house.

245
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,630
So you wanna make up, right?

246
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:53,970
Depends on your future behavior.

247
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:59,720
I'll be good.
You should've said so earlier.

248
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,790
Man, my throat hurts after yelling.
Get me something to drink.

249
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:05,650
What?

250
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:08,820
Something cold. It's hot today.

251
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:23,850
Just tell me to leave, instead of looking
at your watch every two seconds.

252
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:26,660
That's not it...

253
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,550
Fine, I'm leaving!

254
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,850
Hold on.

255
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,500
Hello, Uncle. By any chance...

256
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,850
You're with Gyoon?

257
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,990
Thank god.
Please comfort him well, Uncle.

258
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,870
Yes. Okay, Uncle.

259
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,550
Goodness...

260
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,960
You fought with Gyoon?

261
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,900
Yeah.

262
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,950
How could you fight with him
when he cares for you so much?

263
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,940
We didn't exactly fight.

264
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,900
He told me that you're all he has.

265
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,980
He did?

266
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,710
I was jealous. It must be good
sometimes, just the two of you.

267
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:27,760
But you have grandparents. I was
so jealous when I met them last time.

268
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:34,530
Yeah, I guess you'd be jealous of that.
Then this unwanted guest is leaving.

269
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,570
You're leaving?

270
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,910
Yeah. Bye.

271
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:49,760
Are you going to be okay
with Gyoon gone?

272
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,580
Jeez, of course I'll be okay.

273
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:57,910
Lock the door and check the windows.
Just in case, keep your cell nearby.

274
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,680
Jeez. No one's gonna
kidnap me, you know.

275
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:07,530
Who's worried about you? I feel bad for
Gyoon who constantly worries about you.

276
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,800
Go home and get some rest.

277
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,800
Okay, bye.

278
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,630
Lock the door.

279
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,890
All right, go on then.

280
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:31,930
Sleep tight.

281
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:40,770
Robin Hood is one thing,
my life is another.

282
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:46,720
I can't give up my vacation
to catch a thief, right?

283
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,920
Of course.
Where do you plan to go?

284
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:54,540
Guam, Saipan, Boracay, Bali?

285
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,750
Bali!

286
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,670
Bali?

287
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,900
Si.

288
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,820
Speak in Korean.

289
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,680
Joohyun, where do you want
to go for your vacation?

290
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:14,810
Well, let me tell you that where
isn't important, but with whom.

291
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:20,520
Are you saying you have
someone you want to go with?

292
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:26,760
Let me just say that
it's definitely not you two.

293
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:31,990
Hello.

294
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:34,890
Look who's here.
You're Chohee's brother, right?

295
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,970
What was your name?
Gyoon Heo... Gyoon Heo, right?

296
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,950
Yes.
My sister isn't in?

297
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,910
Chohee's away from the office
and at the museum.

298
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:50,650
Ah, is that so?
Thank you.

299
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,980
Hey, Gyoon!

300
00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:02,990
Isn't he being a little strange? So young
and yet he's as listless as a sick puppy.

301
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,630
Yeah, strange.

302
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,830
Lil' Bro! Gyoon!

303
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:14,970
Here.

304
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,500
Thanks for last time.

305
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,770
What?

306
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,900
Sending your sister
to my alumni reunion.

307
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,770
We had a good date thanks to you.

308
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,720
Right...

309
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,890
Why are you so listless?
Because you fought with your sister?

310
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,530
How'd you know?

311
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,770
Gyoon.

312
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,880
No matter how upset you are at your
sister, you shouldn't stay out all night.

313
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,790
Your sister is a woman,
and it's your job to protect her.

314
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:49,790
Yeah, I shouldn't have done that.

315
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:52,780
Yeah. Apologize to her later.

316
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,840
Um, Bro?
Can I ask you something?

317
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,570
Shoot.

318
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,520
Do you think that
my father is Robin Hood?

319
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:15,510
Well, truthfully speaking, no.

320
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,850
Then who do you think it is?

321
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:25,550
I have no idea.
But I'm really curious.

322
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,630
If it's not your father...

323
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:35,580
who's returning the items
he stole to the museum? And why?

324
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,610
Isn't it weird?

325
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,960
I guess.

326
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,990
Then again, that's not
something I should ask you.

327
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,630
I'm at the CHA, and I have
things to discuss with Chief Noh.

328
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:54,880
It'll take about two hours. Okay.

329
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,930
Chief! I'm glad I ran into you.
Please come with me, hurry!

330
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,900
Why?

331
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,950
This is urgent! Please hurry!

332
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:08,650
I was working on a word document and had just reached the fifteenth page...

333
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,500
when it suddenly shut down.

334
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,730
And you lost your file?

335
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:15,940
Yes. Chief, can you help me?
I absolutely need that file.

336
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,980
Sure. I'll look if there's
a back-up file, so hold on a sec.

337
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,520
Let's see, what's the file name?

338
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,810
It's CPLJH.

339
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,520
CP... and then?

340
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:36,960
CPLJH. Cute, pretty,
lovely Joohyun. CPLJH.

341
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,830
Why are you laughing?

342
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,890
No reason.

343
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:58,680
So Chief, how's the search
for Chohee's father going?

344
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,530
Well, we're completely in the dark.

345
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:05,730
I was thinking over
the matter earlier while eating...

346
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,820
and I realized there's an inconsistency
about this Robin Hood case.

347
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,640
What's that?

348
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:15,810
Honggildong, Iljimae,
Janggilsan, Imggeokjeong.

349
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:19,640
If you look at Korea's good thieves,
they all have some things in common.

350
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,860
Great martial art skills,
preternatural swiftness.

351
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,820
In the movies,
they fly all over the place.

352
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:27,880
So?

353
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:34,510
So Chohee's father
must be quite old by now.

354
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:37,830
So can he jump over
walls like in the movies?

355
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,530
Why are you looking at me like that?

356
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:50,590
You know what? You have the potential
to be a great regulations team member.

357
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:58,540
Chief, what do you mean? Are you
implying I'm not a great member yet?

358
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:04,550
No. No,
that's not what I meant...

359
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,870
Here it is. Is this it?

360
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,900
Yeah, it is.
Chief, thank you so much!

361
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,820
So what's so important
that you'd write fifteen pages...

362
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,570
Wait, it's...

363
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,530
Your summer vacation plans?

364
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:40,940
Yeah. I can't spend my precious
vacation in just any way.

365
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,580
You're going to all these places?

366
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:51,800
Chief, why are you so interested
in my summer vacation?

367
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,670
You're not interested in joining
me on my vacation, are you?

368
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,950
Ah, no. That's not...

369
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:07,640
If so, I'm very flattered
but I want to tell you, in your dreams.

370
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,970
Your sister should be coming back soon.
Why don't you wait and go with her?

371
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:21,990
It's okay.

372
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:25,920
I'm going home to cook something good
and practice begging for forgiveness.

373
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,870
Hey, that's too spineless.

374
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,510
Is it?

375
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,790
She's here. Chohee!

376
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,680
Gyoon.

377
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,900
Do you know how long
he waited for you?

378
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,630
Why did you show up
without calling ahead?

379
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,650
Just ‘cause... I was hoping
you'd appreciate the surprise.

380
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:51,780
Gyoon knows how to handle women.

381
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,740
Why don't we just have dinner together?
It's time to head out anyway.

382
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,930
That's okay.

383
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:58,510
Bro.

384
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,920
Are you gonna keep calling him that?

385
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:03,530
Oh ho.

386
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,510
The “Geumdongyeorae” standing statue
was stolen from my house?

387
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,940
Who dares to say such nonsense?
Who dares to slander our family!

388
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,560
You just need to simply say yes or no
to whether you were robbed.

389
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,710
I told you,
we weren't robbed of anything.

390
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:28,770
As I'm sure you know well, my father
is a minister of the government.

391
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:31,760
As a government employee,
he would never touch a stolen good.

392
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,590
This is a conspiracy!

393
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,750
I see. Anyway, thank you
for your cooperation.

394
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,990
Are you guys even attempting
to arrest Robin Hood?

395
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,660
What do you mean?

396
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,960
I have a suspect in mind.

397
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:49,940
Who is that?

398
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:54,530
There's only one person
who could plot this. Bumsang Kim.

399
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,870
He lost his marbles after
becoming a national hero.

400
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,880
I'm positive my guess is right.

401
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,530
What a headache case this is.

402
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,780
Chief!

403
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,770
A cell phone registered
in Taesoo Heo's name has appeared.

404
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:17,610
Really? It's not just
someone with the same name?

405
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:22,730
Same ID number as Chohee's father.
It was registered in Incheon.

406
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,950
First, submit a request for
permission to track that number.

407
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:29,900
And don't tell Chohee before we're
absolutely sure about his location.

408
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,910
That's a given.

409
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,620
Bro, thank you
for the delicious meal today.

410
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,520
No problem. I had fun.

411
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,820
Since you're already here,
come in for another drink.

412
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,800
Another drink? That's enough.

413
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,550
Why?

414
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:58,860
Thanks for today.
Go on home, then.

415
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,520
I'm leaving, already.

416
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:05,770
And if you ever have another fight
with your sister, come to my place, okay?

417
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,830
I'll feed you and
give you a place to sleep.

418
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,590
Then where will you sleep?

419
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:15,900
I can curl up wherever. My place may
be small but it's big enough for you.

420
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,890
You call that small?

421
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,860
What?

422
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:28,570
Ah... I mean, I would never
imagine you to live in a small place.

423
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,950
I see.

424
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,890
Hurry on home.

425
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,700
Okay, see you tomorrow. Bye.

426
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:35,840
Bye.

427
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,900
- Let's go in.
- Okay.

428
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:57,940
I give up trying to stop you
from calling him “Bro.”

429
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:03,920
What's wrong with it?
It's starting to roll right off my tongue.

430
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,750
You should stop while I ask nicely.
Want me to kick your butt?

431
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,930
Sis, Bro seems like
a really good person.

432
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:17,690
I more or less agree that he's
a good person, but he's not your “Bro.”

433
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,580
So stop calling him that,
even as a joke.

434
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:22,610
Fine, fine.
I really like Bro...

435
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:29,970
I mean, Bumsang, but at the
same time I feel bad towards him.

436
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,550
You feel bad about what?

437
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:36,890
Huh? Just...
The point is that I like him.

438
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,710
How lame...

439
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:47,800
And I'm sorry about yesterday.
I shouldn't have said that about Dad.

440
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,520
I'm sorry, Sis.

441
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,710
So you know what you did wrong?

442
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,570
Did it hurt?

443
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,700
It's okay.

444
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,730
I'm sorry, too.

445
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,890
Hey, we're even now, okay?

446
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:11,880
I'm going to go change.
You should go wash up.

447
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,670
Go on.

448
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:23,550
'My place may be small,
but it's big enough for you.'

449
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,560
You call that small?

450
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:27,990
What?

451
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:35,860
Ah... I mean, I would never
imagine you to live in a small place.

452
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,860
I can't help thinking it's strange.

453
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,870
How can he just say that casually
when he's never been over to my place?

454
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,560
What the...

455
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,940
No way Gyoon is...

456
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,720
How's the Robin Hood
investigation going?

457
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,630
What?

458
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,570
Who does the regulations team
think is Robin Hood?

459
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,510
Robin Hood?

460
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,980
Do you think that
my father is Robin Hood, too?

461
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,630
Truthfully speaking, no.

462
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,880
Then who do you think it is?

463
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,670
Dongpal, answer me truthfully.

464
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:52,760
Do you remember me telling you seven
years ago to take care of Taesoo Heo?

465
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,820
I remember.

466
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:02,550
So is he sleeping
with the fishes or not?

467
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:06,990
Um, the thing is...

468
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,500
Did you take care of him or not?

469
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:14,740
I'm thinking they
probably did a clean job?

470
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,540
“They probably did?”
What do you mean?

471
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:27,800
The truth is, I ordered some
ambitious kids to take care of it.

472
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,540
They're known for their good work
so I'm sure things were taken care of -

473
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:39,510
Idiot! Why'd you make someone else do
the job when I told you to do it yourself?

474
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:44,580
You made me do it even though
Chairman Jang told you to do it yourself.

475
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:49,890
I was a fool to have trusted
you the responsibility.

476
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,870
I'm a fool, right?

477
00:40:54,810 --> 00:41:00,930
Sir, shouldn't we find out what happened
before Chairman Jang kills us?

478
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:06,700
You think I don't know that?

479
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:12,950
Go bring me the guys
who did the job last time.

480
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:15,800
What do you plan to do?
They're gonna kill me.

481
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:21,690
I'm going to confirm things myself.

482
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,560
Alrighty! We're about
to leave right now.

483
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,760
Chief.

484
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,560
Yes?

485
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,820
Mr. Nah is nagging us to hurry and come
to the Youngbuk-dong excavation site.

486
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,940
As soon as I put this away.

487
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,630
Must we do this when the ground's
all muddy from the monsoon rain?

488
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,560
- Let's go.
- Chief!

489
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:47,700
We received permission to track Taesoo
Heo's phone. He's in Seogyo-dong.

490
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,660
Seogyo-dong?

491
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,540
Yes.

492
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,820
Then let's head there.

493
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,840
When can you get here?

494
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:08,950
The ground didn't fall in due to the rain.
Seems someone dug it.

495
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:14,910
Those bloodhounds. How'd they
know about this new excavation site?

496
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,810
When is the investigations
team getting here?

497
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:20,550
Okay. They said
they can't make it today.

498
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,580
What?

499
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,770
They said they're busy and
to take care of things ourselves.

500
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:28,840
Those jerks. What about Bumsang?
Why isn't he here yet?

501
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,530
I'll give him a call.

502
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,880
Hey, it's me.
Didn't you hear about the case?

503
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,920
What case?

504
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,700
Ah, I completely forgot.

505
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:55,890
You forgot? How can you skip out
on an excavation theft case?

506
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:59,520
Sorry, but I'm going to
need a couple more hours.

507
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,740
I have some important business.

508
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:01,940
Okay.

509
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:03,660
[I'll be there as soon as I'm done.]

510
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:05,760
All right, then. Hurry and come.

511
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,560
I wonder what he's up to now?

512
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,590
Come sit down.

513
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:09,530
Okay.

514
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,780
Have a drink.

515
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,770
You haven't been around much
these days. Have you been well?

516
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:20,960
I know. I thought you threw in
the towel and gave up on learning.

517
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:26,680
Threw in the towel?
I still have much to learn from you guys.

518
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:31,780
The guy who specializes in safes
seems to be missing in action.

519
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:40,570
Him? His wife's in the hospital
and he's nursing her. Isn't that sad?

520
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:45,560
He is? We should go on
a hospital visit sometime.

521
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:50,740
You're so considerate
for a young man.

522
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:56,710
Completely different from other
young people. Here, have a drink.

523
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:05,650
Um, Chohee?

524
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,800
Yeah?

525
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:13,540
It seems nothing important was stolen,
so can we leave after a cursory look?

526
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:17,560
Yeah, I think that could work.

527
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:22,520
Chohee, so you do
know how to cut corners.

528
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,870
But shouldn't we at least wait
for the excavation team?

529
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:31,750
I already gave the museum
and the CHA research team a call.

530
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:34,880
Wow, that was
unusually efficient of you.

531
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:36,720
- Let's go.
- Okay.

532
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:41,910
What is it?

533
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:45,500
It's nothing. Let's go.

534
00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:00,830
That was a good meal.

535
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,500
Let's go for another round. It's on me.

536
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:11,550
I can't. I have an important customer
coming later. How about you, Mister Kim?

537
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:16,550
Sure, I want to learn how to identify
signatures and seals from Mr. Jeong.

538
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,740
Of all the things
to get passionate about!

539
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,800
If you had decided to study academically,
you could've ended up a judge.

540
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,630
Bye. Let's go! Let's go!

541
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,680
You nearly gave me a heart attack.
What are you doing here, Bumsang?

542
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:40,720
We need to talk.

543
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:45,730
Ugh, I'm wiped out.
I'm so dead tired.

544
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:47,950
Why are you complaining?
We didn't even go very far today.

545
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:51,510
And you were so excited earlier today
about filling Chief Noh's shoes.

546
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:56,740
Things would be different if
it were official. If I were really chief...

547
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:03,560
In my opinion, I think Chohee
should be chief rather than you.

548
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:04,810
What!

549
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,510
Joohyun, what are you saying?

550
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,720
Take today, for example.

551
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:15,920
We came back early thanks to Chohee's
efficient decision-making and judgment.

552
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:21,750
Whichever way you see it,
Chohee should be the next chief.

553
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:26,740
Joohyun Wang! What did you say?
Chohee should what!

554
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:28,510
Calm down.

555
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:31,720
Chohee, did I say something wrong?

556
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:35,620
Ah, the thing is...
Let's discuss this later.

557
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:39,970
We should call the investigations team
and set a meeting time for tomorrow.

558
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:42,580
Okay, I'll give them a call.

559
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:51,580
Mr. Nah, your expression...
You're not mad, are you?

560
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,730
No. I'm not mad at all.

561
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:01,940
Why didn't those jerks in the
investigations team show up today?

562
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:04,980
They're tracking Taesoo Heo.

563
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:12,660
Chief, what did you just say?

564
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:18,730
His cell phone showed up on the radar in
Seogyo-dong. Chief Kang is tracking him.

565
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:29,950
This shows that he's definitely within a
200m radius, but how will we find him?

566
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:32,610
We have to try.

567
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:39,500
Hi, Chohee.

568
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,800
Chief, what's going on?
Did you find my father?

569
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,540
We're trying to right now.

570
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:46,790
Where are you?
I'll head over right now.

571
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,850
I understand how anxious
you must be, but leave this to us.

572
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,740
Chief.

573
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:55,950
We have enough men here,
so don't worry. Just prepare yourself.

574
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,840
Chief!

575
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,550
The back-up is here.

576
00:49:01,550 --> 00:49:02,590
Okay.

577
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:04,910
I have to go.
I'll call you later.

578
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,710
Name's Taesoo Heo.
In his late fifties.

579
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:11,590
About five-seven in height
and always wears a hat.

580
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:16,750
He's within a 200m radius, but since
he's mobile, we need to find him quickly.

581
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:18,810
Here.

582
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:25,820
Chohee, just go home.

583
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,920
No, I'm fine.

584
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:34,510
Stop being stubborn and go home.

585
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:40,510
I'll drop you off.
Go home and calm your nerves.

586
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:58,780
Do you think this time it's really him?

587
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,830
Why is my heart pounding?

588
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,870
I hope it's him.

589
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,770
'Who are all those people?'

590
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:17,520
Who do you think?
All the men of our trade.

591
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,540
Middlemen, ex-thieves,
lock experts, safe experts.

592
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:26,880
And men like me who do legitimate work.
It's just a friendly get-together.

593
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,670
And who's the young guy? Who's he?

594
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:32,970
Who? Oh, Mister Kim?

595
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:34,960
Mister Kim?

596
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:41,710
We just call him that. You know we
don't customarily ask for real names.

597
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:48,540
He's a sharp kid who wants to join the
trade and diligently follows us around.

598
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:51,980
You teach him one thing and he figures
out ten. Everyone's amazed by him.

599
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:55,880
He's good enough to follow
in General Shovel's footsteps.

600
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:58,880
Why do you ask about him?

601
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:06,650
Are you okay?

602
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:14,620
I'm not sure.
I'm nervous and excited.

603
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,990
Want me to stay with you?

604
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:22,710
No, it's okay. I called Gyoon
so he should be home soon.

605
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:28,960
You've been through
a lot of heartache.

606
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,960
It wasn't that bad.

607
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:39,640
When I finally meet him,
I have so much I want to say.

608
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,540
I have so many questions, too.

609
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:48,800
But when I actually meet him,
I don't think I'll remember any of it.

610
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:50,710
Yeah.

611
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,570
Um, Chief?

612
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:55,960
Yeah?

613
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:03,900
If Chief Kang finds Dad today,
will he be immediately arrested?

614
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:05,970
Why do you ask?

615
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:11,680
I was hoping he'd be able
to come home for a warm meal.

616
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:18,990
I don't ask for anything else.
I just want to cook a warm meal for him.

617
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:28,660
I'll talk to Chief Kang.
Wait for my call.

618
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,630
No need to walk me out.

619
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:19,930
Did you see this man?

620
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:22,560
I'm not sure.

621
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:23,830
Thank you.

622
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:34,720
Chief!

623
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,620
He's not near the subway station.
We should head in the opposite direction.

624
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,660
He doesn't seem to be moving much,
so let's sweep the area one more time.

625
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,700
Dear lord. Okay.

626
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,970
Hold on, Officer!
Isn't that the man?

627
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:09,710
Hey, Gyoon. Where are you?

628
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:15,930
No, no news yet.
Yeah, hurry home.

629
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:29,630
What brings you here?

630
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,820
Is Gyoon home yet?

631
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:33,820
No. Why do you ask?

632
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:38,610
I just have some business with him.

633
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:41,870
Hey, your hand...

634
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,790
Oh, this?

635
00:55:48,910 --> 00:55:51,850
I'm here from the museum.
We heard some relics were found.

636
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:58,630
Ah, yes. We're finding mostly pottery
and bowls. Shell we head over to the site?

637
00:55:58,630 --> 00:55:59,700
Sure.

638
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,800
Why are the police here?

639
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,720
Some human remains were found.

640
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:08,980
- Really?
- Yes.

641
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:43,570
If he used Heo's information to make
a false account, where's the real Heo?

642
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:45,540
I've got bad vibes about this.

643
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:49,740
What if in addition to
a false cell phone account...

644
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:53,660
a fake passport was also used?
And that explains the entrance records?

645
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,800
It's possible.

646
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,680
Then the real Taesoo Heo
could be dead...

647
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,890
Jinguk, don't say that.

648
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,540
Look, let's not be pessimistic.

649
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:12,550
Let's start by finding out how that
man came to use Taesoo Heo's name.

650
00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:13,570
Okay.

651
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:14,850
- And Officer Park, you...
- Yes?

652
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:16,650
Hold on.

653
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,700
This is Shiwan Kang.

654
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:31,870
You're meeting your father
for the first time in seven years...

655
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:34,550
with a band-aid on
your finger. How clumsy.

656
00:57:36,630 --> 00:57:37,740
You're that excited?

657
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:42,750
I'm a bit antsy and nervous and stuff.

658
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:45,760
Everything will be fine, right?

659
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:49,500
Of course. Congratulations.

660
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:52,610
You're congratulating me
when I haven't even met him yet?

661
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:57,870
What should I do? The food's getting cold.
Should I clear the table?

662
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:07,780
[Chief Kang]

663
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:13,890
Yes, Chief?

664
00:58:25,790 --> 01:00:24,770

00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,060
This is exactly what I was afraid of if I asked you out

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,980
that I would end up either broken or broken-hearted.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,140
I just never imagined it would be both, Sonny.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,980
- Sonny?
- What Sonny?

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:21,810
- You said Sonny.
- I don't think so.

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,020
The patient is critical.
We need to get him to the operating room Chad!

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,080
- Chad?
- Huh?

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,170
I didn't say Chad.

10
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:34,759
I said stat, as in we need to get him
to the operating room Chad!

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,960
Mmn, you did it again.

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,199
Um, no I don't think so.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,620
I heard it too.

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,620
Even the dead guy heard it.

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,100
Okay, you know what?
This is ridiculous.

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,450
You people are hearing things.

17
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:49,500
- I did not say Chad.
- I did not say Sonny.

18
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,240
So what do you think was up with the
slip of the tongue this morning?

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,130
- They're watching.
- Yeah, I know. Act natural.

20
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,880
- Good call. Just follow my lead.
- OK

21
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,450
What say you, good woman?

22
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,680
Were these apples freshly picked this fine morn?

23
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,390
I said act natural, not amish.

24
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,900
This is silly.
Why don't we just tell people we have a date tonight?

25
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,479
No no, bad idea.

26
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,510
You know how much our shows hate each other.

27
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,599
If they find out we're going on a date,
they may think it's okay for them.

28
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,890
And then...

29
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,230
You don't think those guys like each other, do you?

30
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,209
Hmm, maybe.

31
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:32,569
I mean, look at them trying to act all discreet.

32
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,190
Well, I happen to be a keen reader of lips. So?

33
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,330
Whatever Chad and Sonny are saying, they
might as well be saying it right to me.

34
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,970
- So Chad?
- No brat.

35
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,909
- What's the plan?
- Well, I'm getting a limo.

36
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,330
Apparently, he's getting a pillow.

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,310
- To take us...
- To stake plus...

38
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,470
- ..at 8:00...
- He ate a sock...

39
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,690
- ..To a nice dinner.
- And a rice dinner.

40
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,700
Read my lips.

41
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,270
You're a dope.

42
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:17,140
Terra's pope.

43
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,550
So, um, I'll see you tonight.

44
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,220
Can't wait.

45
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,150
Me neither.

46
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,360
- Ready to give them what they want?
- Bring it on.

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,419
Oh, do you really have to touch
all the fruit?

48
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,579
Oh!

49
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,290
Oh, look at that! Well!

50
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,649
Maybe someone should go find their apples elsewhere.

51
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,090
Maybe I will.

52
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,330
- Fine.
- Fine!

53
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:43,720
- Good.
- Good!

54
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,259
That's the Sonny and Chad we know.

55
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,120
Yup.
Looks like we were worried for nothing.

56
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:52,309
Oh, this is interesting.

57
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:55,570
I just read the lunch lady's lips
and apparently

58
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,770
she just peed in the food.

59
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:08,959
Okey-dokey, mom, lucky outfit #13 is on.

60
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,310
Tell me what you think.

61
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,010
Oh, that's the one.

62
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,230
- Are you even looking?
- Not since lucky outfit #7.

63
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,229
Mom, this is important.

64
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,579
Honey, you have looked great in
everything that you have tried on.

65
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,820
Just pick one and feel beautiful in it.

66
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:29,729
I just want this to be perfect.

67
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,789
This is my first date with Chad.

68
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,090
I need it to say "sophisticated, but not stuck up

69
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,830
cute, but still serious; interested but not too interested.

70
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,460
Wow. When I was your age, my clothes just said: "Be home by ten."

71
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,830
Which if you listen closely, yours are saying too.

72
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,609
A little fancy for pizza night, aren't you?

73
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,009
I'll call you later.

74
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,680
- Is pizza night tonight?
- Hello, we do that after every show.

75
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,460
Yeah. What's the matter, Sonny?

76
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,630
You got something better to do?

77
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,470
Either your closet finally barfed up all this
stuff or you're getting ready for a date.

78
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,780
You know what?

79
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,140
It is a sad day when a young lady

80
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,470
can't try on 12 or 13 outfits

81
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,730
without being accused of going on a date.

82
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,400
You people should be ashamed of yourselves.

83
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,970
Shame on you!

84
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,300
Yes, Grady?

85
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:38,160
So at the risk of further shame, um, are
you going to be joining us for pizza?

86
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:41,270
You're in charge of the coupons.

87
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,649
No, I will not be joining you.

88
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,950
Aha!

89
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,230
Not because I have a date or anything,

90
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:52,420
but because I will be helping my mother

91
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,040
who has a sprained ankle from doing things

92
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,750
with that ankle and her foot that she should not have been doing.

93
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,319
Are we buying this, guys?

94
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,859
You know, I have a full drawer of coupons right over there.

95
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,460
- So knock yourselves out.
- Oh!

96
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:12,030
- Hey, sorry we doubted you.
- Shame!

97
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,770
I know this is hard for you.

98
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,520
It's just been you and me for so long.

99
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,730
Tonight I'm seeing someone new and
you're gonna have to learn to share me.

100
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,390
Please don't cry.
If you start cry, I'm gonna start cry.

101
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,090
Now look away so I can get dressed.

102
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,280
Too bad Sonny's got to miss pizza night.

103
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,520
Yeah.
Pizza just won't taste the same without her.

104
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,160
Yes it will!

105
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,650
On the upside, at least we don't have to get pineapple on pizza.

106
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,110
Oh yeah.
Who does that?

107
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,720
- Uh, lots of people.
- They're wrong!

108
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,070
What's wrong with you?

109
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,960
Hello, boys.

110
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,000
It's show time.

111
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,800
Hello, girls.

112
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,260
It's toe time.

113
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,030
We've had some good times.

114
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,050
But you're new.

115
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:16,690
You've got something to prove.

116
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,040
Nah.

117
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,500
Nah.

118
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,210
Nah.

119
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,879
This would be so much easier if I was a dude.

120
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,940
This would be so much easier if I was an average dude.

121
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,650
- Good.
- Too preppy.

122
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,230
- Better.
- Trying too hard.

123
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,270
Rockin' it.

124
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,840
Not trying hard enough.

125
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,660
- Perfect.
- Too Nico.

126
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,520
Too Grady.

127
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,850
Too Tawni, but very comfortable.

128
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,949
Hey, Chad, it's me.

129
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,180
Please call me back.
I've been ready for half an hour now.

130
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,400
Listen, I can't wait to see you.

131
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:03,860
It's gonna be perfect.

132
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,830
It's wrong!
It's all wrong!

133
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,900
Chloe, if we're going to do this, -nobody can find out.

134
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,000
Our secret will stay safe with me.

135
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,940
Then let's polka.

136
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,720
Oh, they make me wanna polka.

137
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,869
Hey, kids.
This is a surprise.

138
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,780
You brought pizza.
Come in.

139
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,750
Oh no, the poor woman's writhing in pain.
It's worse than we thought.

140
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,630
What are you guys doing here?

141
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:45,020
Well, doing pretty well for someone with sprained ankle.

142
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,060
- The sprained ankle?
- That's what Sonny said.

143
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,620
- Sonny said that?
- Uh-huh.

144
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,620
Are you sure she didn't say
sprayed uncle?

145
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,390
Cause he's in really bad shape.

146
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,430
The gig's up, toots.
Where's Sonny?

147
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,090
Well, she's not with Chad. I tell you that!

148
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,240
She's with Chad!

149
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,540
Hello! Who's really for a date?

150
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,850
- Sonny?
- I'm not snoring, I'm not...

151
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,630
Oh hey. I'm so sorry. I...

152
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,080
- I must have josed off.
- I'm sorry. I'm late. I..

153
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,190
Wow. I thought I looked good.

154
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,420
Really?

155
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,750
I just threw this on...

156
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:42,180
Yeah. Me too.

157
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:46,640
- So?
- So?

158
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,900
Well..

159
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,860
- Shall we?
- We shall.

160
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,869
After you, m'lady.

161
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,010
Oh. "M'lady"? That's cute.

162
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,860
Wow, I can't believe we're finally doing this.

163
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,160
- Neither can I.
- Imagine how we feel!

164
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:24,550
How could you? And on pizza night too!

165
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,850
We... Well. Hey guys!

166
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,829
What are you guys doing here?

167
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:35,310
- You two are on a date!
- Oh. Shame on us?

168
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,230
Shame on you!

169
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,740
A date?

170
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,779
What makes you guys think we're on a date?

171
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,099
- What?
- I don't know.

172
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,809
You're wearing what you think is a nice outfit.

173
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,390
And you're not at home taking care
of your mom's fake sprained ankle.

174
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,530
She was faking?

175
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,329
And she was doing the polka.

176
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,720
I'll never be able to un-see that.

177
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:08,380
She must be watching this week's episode "
spoiler alert: The accordion player did it.

178
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,460
Aw, thanks man!
I that saved!

179
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,589
Admit it.
This is a date.

180
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,839
W-what-- you know what?

181
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,619
- It is a sad night.
- Sad.

182
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,180
...When a young lady and her
smartly-dressed gentleman companion

183
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,780
Thank you.

184
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:29,400
..Can't be seen in a limo together
without people thinking they're dating.

185
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,500
That's right.

186
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,790
We just so happen to be on our way ..

187
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,130
- To a dinner.
- Yeah.

188
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,199
...For my celebrity tennis tournament.

189
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,850
Mm-hmm.

190
00:11:41,851 --> 00:11:47,160
And you know what? We felt bad that you guys weren't invited

191
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:53,000
So we decided to be good friends and keep it a secret from you.

192
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,479
Are we buying this, guys?

193
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,129
I'd buy it more if we could get some
free drinks and nuts out of it.

194
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,670
- Oh yeah!
- Well, you know what? Here you go.

195
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,750
- Yay!
- Here you go.

196
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,930
What are you doing?
That's expensive!

197
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,180
I mean, fine.
Each of you take what you can carry.

198
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,719
You grab the TV.
I'll grab the magazine rack.

199
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,209
- Mm-hmm.
- Wait, no.

200
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,360
Let me see that TV.
Is that a flat-screen?

201
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,150
Flat-screen!

202
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,789
Wow, this place is amazing, Chad.

203
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,919
So private.

204
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,009
Well, I wanted to bring you someplace special.

205
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,919
Yoshi here is the best sushi chef is Hollywood.
Yoshi, my man.

206
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,680
Jellyfish, jellyfish, jellyfish.

207
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,170
Oh, that's cute.
Yoshi, shark.

208
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,550
Shark shark shark.

209
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,380
Man, her shark is so much cooler than my lame jellyfish.

210
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,179
- I'm an idiot.
- I'm such an idiot.

211
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,220
Why did I do the shark?
The jellyfish was adorable.

212
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,670
He's adorable.

213
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,490
She's adorable.

214
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,650
Oh, my palms are sweating.
Just be cool.

215
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,600
So-- whoa!

216
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,989
Chad, are you okay?

217
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,349
I'm good. I'm good.
I'm cool.

218
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,460
I'm so not cool.
Water. I need water.

219
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,460
Ah! This isn't making me any cooler, although it is refreshing.

220
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,759
You know, this all looks so great.

221
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,230
Why don't you order since you know so much about sushi?

222
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,579
Oh my gosh. I forgot everything I know about sushi!

223
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,359
Keep drinking. Keep drinking!

224
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,050
Maybe she'll stop asking.

225
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Oh my gosh.
I'm boring him so much he's trying to drown himself.

226
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,470
- Chad?
- Uh, yeah?

227
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,590
- Do you want to order?
- She touched my hand.

228
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,470
I was supposed to touch her hand first.
What kind of man am I?

229
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,669
He's not even looking at me.

230
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,090
Do I have something in my teeth?

231
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:48,010
Of course I don't have anything in my teeth.
I haven't eaten in hours.

232
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,919
I'm starving!

233
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,599
Why won't he order?

234
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,190
Quit drinking.
You're gonna explode!

235
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,300
Just tell her she makes you nervous.
She'll understand.

236
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,660
Uh, Sonny, I need to tell you something.

237
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,890
Yes, Chad?

238
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,259
Oh, stop it, please!

239
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,590
No!

240
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:27,939
Oh my gosh!
I can't believe he just did that!

241
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,599
Why am I saying this to myself?!

242
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,620
Oh my gosh!
I can't believe he just did that!

243
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,560
Ew!

244
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,170
Hey, guys, what's going on?

245
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,529
Oh, I don't know.
Just reading the news.

246
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,000
Let's see.
"Celebrity kitten caught in tree".

247
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,250
Ooh and look at this: "Chad Dylan Cooper blows his cool on date."

248
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,059
I guess there's no hiding that.

249
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,080
A date with Chad Dylan Cooper?!

250
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,000
Is that all you guys care about?

251
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,750
What about this? Poor little kitten!

252
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,900
Ohh.

253
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,750
Okay, you know what?
You're right.

254
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,810
I lied to you and I'm sorry. But...

255
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,020
My date with Chad was a big mistake
and it's never gonna happen again.

256
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,050
So? Last night's tennis dinner went pretty well.

257
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,419
Yeah.

258
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,170
Apparently, you made a big splash.

259
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,850
You told them?

260
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,420
She didn't have to.
You're all over this issue Tween Weekly.

261
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,310
Gimme that.

262
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,600
I don't have to explain anything to you people.

263
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,690
No, but you have some explaining to do to me.

264
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,340
Can I talk to you over there?

265
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,560
Take a rain coat, Sonny.

266
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,660
Yeah, 'cause a date with Chad's like going to Aquaworld

267
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,290
the first four rows will get wet.

268
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,320
Sittin' in the splash zone, sucka!

269
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,860
All right, I know you're upset.
And I'm sorry.

270
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:11,590
How do you think I feel?
I wanted this date to be perfect.

271
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:15,420
- What are they saying?
- "I wanted this date to be perfect."

272
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,590
oh, now he's just speaking gibberish!

273
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,719
I got a limo.
I spent three hours getting dressed.

274
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,360
I got a private room with my favorite chef.

275
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:27,010
Then there you are looking all beautiful with your great smile

276
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:30,549
- and those big brown eyes and..
 - Aww.

277
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,600
--And you just ruin everything.

278
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,350
What?
How do I ruin everything?

279
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,980
When I was with you in that restaurant,
I turned from this very cool guy on page 17

280
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:46,380
riding his horse through Malibu canyon
to this idiot on the cover who threw up on his date!

281
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,360
Whose fault is that?

282
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:50,260
Yours.

283
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,010
Chad, I was nervous too.

284
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,790
Not throwing-up- on-my-date nervous,
but, I mean, I had butterflies.

285
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:03,120
But your butterflies aren't news while
my butterflies end up on the cover!

286
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,850
I've got an image to protect, Sonny.

287
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,200
What are you getting at?
You don't want to see me anymore?

288
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,320
Of course I want to see you.
I just don't want to be seen with you.

289
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,390
I'm thinking date #2 should be someplace a little less public.

290
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:19,509
- What, like a cave?
- That could be romantic.

291
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:21,270
Or an abandoned warehouse?

292
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,899
Oh, you know what?
I got it! perfect.

293
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,529
The best way to keep us a secret is for there not to bean us.

294
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,740
Ooh, I like this.

295
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,520
Wait, no.
I don't like this.

296
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:34,590
- Bye, Chad.
- But Sonny...

297
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,530
Honey, I got you a little something that's gonna cheer you up.

298
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,660
Ta-da!

299
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:49,110
Mom, I'm not gonna throw up over a guy,
especially one that threw up over me.

300
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,840
Watch.

301
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:54,560
"MacKENZIE FALLS" Season 1?

302
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,810
Done.

303
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,780
Season 2?

304
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,860
Adieu.

305
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,920
You want to try?
Feels good.

306
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,360
Season 3?

307
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
What is he doing here?

308
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,679
No no, honey.
The rhyme is the fun part.

309
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,560
No. Chad.
What is he doing here?

310
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,580
Open the window!

311
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,210
Open the window!

312
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,699
Chad, what are you doing?

313
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,459
Orman wouldn't let me in.

314
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,900
Which means he's doing his job.

315
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,800
Sonny, he's on a rope, and appears to be slipping.

316
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:34,900
Fine.

317
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,180
Ah.

318
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,670
Thank you.
Thank you.

319
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,670
I'm good.

320
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,449
It's a little chilly out there.

321
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,670
Trust me.
It's colder in here.

322
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,890
Am I right?
Up top.

323
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,470
See, I told you.

324
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,410
Okay, I'll just leave you two alone.

325
00:18:57,850 --> 00:18:59,540
Sonny, please.

326
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,290
I've been thinking about what you said and you were right.

327
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,570
You-- you threw away season 3?

328
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,249
I got a tweople's choice award for season 3.

329
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,000
That was my finest-- wait. it's not about me.

330
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,499
- It's not about me.
- You know what? it is.

331
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,989
It's always about you and how cool you are and how you look.

332
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,949
That's never gonna change.

333
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,110
It is.

334
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,010
It already has.

335
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,610
You know what, Chad?
Why don't you just leave the way you came in?

336
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,880
Fine.

337
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,400
But if you don't mind, I think I'll take this window.

338
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,310
Oh my gosh.

339
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,710
"Chad is a fool for Sonny"?

340
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,360
I wanted the world to know.

341
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,090
I want you to know that I want to be seen with you

342
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:51,580
anywhere, anytime, no matter how
goofy your big brown eyes make me.

343
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,850
Wow.
I don't know what to say.

344
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,340
How about yes?

345
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,250
To what?

346
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,750
To giving our first date a second chance.

347
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,390
Oh, just say yes already!

348
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,680
Yes.

349
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:11,800
- Shall we?
- We shall.

350
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,870
This table okay, m'lady?

351
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,770
Yeah, it's great.

352
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,160
- But it is a bit drafty.
- Ooh, here.

353
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,300
Yoshi, my man.

354
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:45,939
This is the coolest second first date I've ever been on.

355
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,720
Well, I'm glad you like it.

356
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,880
But it's not perfect yet.

357
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,960
It's not perfect?
What do you mean it's not perfect?

358
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:56,089
Well, the stars are out, which is nice.

359
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,600
The view is amazing, which is great.

360
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,770
And you're here, which makes me happy. But...

361
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,740
I don't know.
Something's just missing.

362
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,540
What is it? What's missing? Oh no!

363
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,569
Well-- okay, relax.

364
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,570
Easy on the water.

365
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,990
You know? I just thought if you're
not afraid of how the world sees you

366
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,350
then I shouldn't be afraid of how my friends see me.

367
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,440
What are they doing here?

368
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,670
- What are they doing here?
- I texted them.

369
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,760
Worst pizza night ever!

370
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,300
Show's over, kids.

371
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,840
To us?

372
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:36,970
To us.

373
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,799
He's adorable.

374
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,850
I'm back, baby!

375
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,230
We will never be cool with this!

376
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,280
Ever!

377
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,650
Good good good!

378
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,839
Now he really looks like a fool.

379
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,460
Yeah.

380
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,350
Hey, geniuses, isn't that the whole point of this sign?

381
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,069
Hey, guys, you made it even better.

382
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,829
Ooh, let's get out of here.

383
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,750
What?

384
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,580
What is this?

385
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,220
It's the bill for their date.

386
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,370
Who's the fool now, suckas?

387
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,370
Hey, Sonny?
Would you have any coupons for this?

388
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:38,460

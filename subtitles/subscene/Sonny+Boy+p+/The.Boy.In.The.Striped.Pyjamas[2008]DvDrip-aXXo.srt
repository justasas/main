1
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,909
- Move!
- Move it!

2
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,995
Move!

3
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,315
Move!

4
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,635
Now!

5
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,315
It's me home.

6
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,078
- Bye, Bruno!
- Bye, Bruno!

7
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,599
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Mum, what's going on?

8
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,590
- We're celebrating.
- Celebrating?

9
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,551
Your father's been given a promotion.

10
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,478
- That means a better job.
- I know what promotion is.

11
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,351
So we're having a little party
to celebrate.

12
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,675
He's still going to be a soldier though,
isn't he?

13
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,429
Yes, my lamb.
Yes, just a more important one now.

14
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,237
There's some even more exciting news,

15
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,636
but I think Dad wanted
to tell you about that himself.

16
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,436
- Moving? Where to?
- To the countryside.

17
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,232
That's miles away.
What about Karl and Leon and Martin?

18
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,713
Sweetheart, I know it's hard,

19
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,230
but we're all having to say goodbye
to our friends for the time being.

20
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,748
Anyway, we'll make new ones
where we're going. Won't we?

21
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,951
Of course you are.
You'll make lots of new friends.

22
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,675
Bruno, you can have your friends
around in the morning before we go.

23
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,190
Think of it as an adventure,
like in one of your books.

24
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,229
But this is the best house ever.

25
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,349
Well, you never know. The house
we're going to might be even better.

26
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,436
Dad says it's got a garden.

27
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,199
Look, the thing is, Bruno,
the thing about being a soldier,

28
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,312
is that life is not so much about choice,
it's more about duty,

29
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,397
so if your country needs
you to go somewhere, you go.

30
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,637
Now, of course, going somewhere else
is much easier

31
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,434
when you know that your family
are so delighted to go with you.

32
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,793
Bruno! You're getting bigger
every time I see you.

33
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,910
It's only been a week, Nathalie.

34
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,838
Well, perhaps it's me
that's getting smaller.

35
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,073
So, you two,

36
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,953
well, what do you think of all this?
Moving out of Berlin?

37
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,071
Well, Mummy and Daddy say
it's a good thing,

38
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,031
so I suppose it must be.

39
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,036
Children, be angels, will you?
Pass some food around.

40
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,038
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

41
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,632
Congratulations.

42
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,110
- Doesn't he look wonderful?
- Absolutely.

43
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,155
I'm so proud of you, my boy.

44
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,913
Oh, dear. I sometimes wonder
if this is all down to me,

45
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,078
making you those costumes
for your little plays when you were tiny.

46
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,795
- You used to adore all that dressing up.
- Nathalie...

47
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,912
Does it still make you feel special,
Ralf dear?

48
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,313
The uniform and what it stands for?

49
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,989
Mother, it's a party.
Let's not spoil things.

50
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,436
Me, spoil things?

51
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,792
You should be careful.

52
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,912
Airing your views so publicly
could land you in trouble.

53
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,393
You know that.

54
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,437
So, how long are we losing you for,
my boy?

55
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,750
- Until the war is won, I would think.
- Well, not so long then.

56
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,708
Bruno!

57
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,111
All right, Bruno. Time to say goodbye.

58
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,431
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye!

59
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,709
"Time has come for me to sleep
Lord, I thank Thee for Thy keep

60
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,070
"Watch this night well over me
And teach me, Lord, to trust in Thee

61
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,476
"Care for children, sick and poor
Grant them, Lord, Thy blessing more

62
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,876
"And this I pray in Jesus' name
Care for my family just the same"

63
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,955
Amen.

64
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,799
Children, look. Look! Our new home.

65
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,349
I have some business to take care of.
I'll see you shortly.

66
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,436
Well, what do we think?

67
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,236
Come on. It's lovely.

68
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,636
You two choose your rooms.
I'll have Maria come

69
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,032
and help you unpack.

70
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,030
What do you think of it, Maria?
The new house.

71
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,871
It's not for me to say.

72
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,878
But it won't feel like home
until we make it feel like home, will it?

73
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,678
Is he already up?

74
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,119
Who was that?

75
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,720
One of your father's soldiers,
I suppose.

76
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,719
- He looked very serious.
- Well, they are, aren't they?

77
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,673
- Why are we whispering?
- I don't know.

78
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,275
- And play with who?
- The children over on the farm.

79
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,278
Farm? I didn't see a farm.
And that one, too.

80
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,595
You can only see it from my room.

81
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,877
And there are some children there?

82
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,673
- Yes, quite a few.
- That's good.

83
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,679
- So, I'll be able to play with them.
- I don't see why not.

84
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,508
I'll wait a little bit,
just to see what they're like,

85
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,757
- because they look a bit strange.
- The children do?

86
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,312
- Well, and the farmers.
- What sort of strange?

87
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,273
I'm sorry.

88
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,639
Vegetables.

89
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,069
There.

90
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,918
Bruno, have you unpacked everything?

91
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,509
Because I think you should
go back upstairs and finish off.

92
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,198
Thank you, ma'am.

93
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,349
Bruno.

94
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,990
- I told you they were strange.
- Who?

95
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,873
The farmers. They wear pyjamas.

96
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,279
Bruno, I was just
coming to look for you.

97
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,636
Well, thank you for that.
That was extremely useful.

98
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,070
<i>- I'll be over to see you later.
- Of course, Herr Kommandant.</i>

99
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,508
Come in.

100
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,598
Sit down, sit down.

101
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,631
Well, what do you think?

102
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,828
Oh, dear.

103
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,112
I want to go home.

104
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,588
You are home, Bruno.
Home is where the family is.

105
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,232
Isn't that right?

106
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,233
Bruno, you have to at least
give the place a chance.

107
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,918
I promise you,
it won't be long before you...

108
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,431
Why do the farmers wear pyjamas?
I can see them from my window.

109
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,272
The thing is, Bruno, those people...

110
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,952
Well, you see,
they're not really people at all.

111
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,633
Bruno, who told you it was a farm?

112
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,955
- Was it Maria?
- No.

113
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,877
It is a farm, isn't it?

114
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,475
Yes.

115
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,029
Is it to do with your new job?

116
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,753
All you need to know
about my work here, Bruno,

117
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,475
is that it's very important
to our country and to you.

118
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,549
We're working very hard
to make this world a better place

119
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,828
for you to grow up in.

120
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,838
But you're not a farmer.
You're a soldier.

121
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,031
Bruno, can you come and help me
finish sorting out in the kitchen?

122
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:08,629
I can still play with them, though?
The children.

123
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,789
I don't think so, Bruno. No.

124
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,230
Like you say, they're a bit strange.
A bit...

125
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,191
Well, they're different.

126
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,309
Don't worry, my darling.
We'll find you some new friends,

127
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,999
but they won't be the ones
from the farm.

128
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,509
Ralf, you promised.

129
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,915
- You said it was miles away.
- It is.

130
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,349
How was I to know he could see it
from the bedroom window?

131
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,914
There was one of them in our kitchen.

132
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,199
- Master Bruno, how are you today?
- Fed up.

133
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,393
You said the same thing
every day for two whole weeks.

134
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,352
- It's true.
- Well, you should be out playing.

135
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,472
- Playing with who?
- I don't know. Gretel?

136
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,436
- Well, you can make your own fun.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

137
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,674
One thing's for sure,

138
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,395
sitting around being miserable
won't make things any happier.

139
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,233
- Bruno, what are you doing?
- Exploring!

140
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,397
No! No, not in the back.
I told you, it's out of bounds.

141
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,318
- Explore at the front.
- But I've explored it all.

142
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,193
- Well, find something else to do.
- Like what?

143
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,037
Come back in now,
and we'll think of something.

144
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,271
So, children,
what are you doing today?

145
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,515
- Same as yesterday.
- And what was that?

146
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,791
- Same as the day before.
- Except you went exploring.

147
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,394
- I like exploring.
- Where did you go?

148
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,115
I wanted to look in the back garden,
but Mum wouldn't let me.

149
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,792
The back garden?

150
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,038
Well, God forbid.

151
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,036
I expect you'll be missing
those friends of yours.

152
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,672
I even miss school.

153
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,398
Well, I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

154
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,998
Anyway, you won't be missing it
for long.

155
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,430
- Really?
- I've arranged a tutor for you both.

156
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,873
<i>A Herr Liszt
will be visiting twice a week.</i>

157
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:47,273
So we're not going to school?

158
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,951
School's coming here?

159
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,355
On an old bicycle, I gather.

160
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,990
It's a bird without the...

161
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,356
Good morning, little man.
And how are you this morning?

162
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,038
- Can I ask you a favour?
- Well, you can ask.

163
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,874
Are there any spare tyres around?

164
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,309
An old one
from one of the trucks or something?

165
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,113
Well, the only spare tyre
I've seen around here

166
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,435
belongs to Lieutenant Meinberg.

167
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,316
- Well, is he using it?
- Yes, he's very attached to it.

168
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,873
Stop it. He doesn't understand.
He's only eight.

169
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,356
You're only 12,
so stop pretending you're any older.

170
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,118
What do you want a tyre for, anyway?

171
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,152
- I want to make a swing.
- A swing?

172
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,156
That does sound exciting.

173
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,195
You!

174
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,153
Here, now.

175
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,675
Move!

176
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,512
Take this boy to the outhouse
in the back garden.

177
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,391
There are some tyres in there.
He will select one.

178
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,591
You will carry it where he asks.
Do you understand?

179
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,473
Well, little man,
what are you waiting for?

180
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,072
How about this one?

181
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,272
Where's my mum?

182
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,393
She's out.

183
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,514
- When is she back?
- Soon, I expect.

184
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,312
But don't worry.

185
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,390
- But I might bleed to death.
- No, you won't.

186
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,671
- Will I need to go to hospital?
- No. It's only a small cut.

187
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,870
Come on. It's not that bad.

188
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,951
There, all better.

189
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,990
- What's your name?
- Pavel.

190
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,952
Now, you've got to sit still
for a few minutes

191
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,914
before you start
walking around on that again.

192
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,394
Will you tell my mum what happened?

193
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,193
I think she's going to see it for herself.

194
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,594
She'll probably take me to a doctor.

195
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,472
I don't think so.

196
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,712
- It could be worse than it looks.
- It isn't.

197
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,513
How would you know?
You're not a doctor.

198
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,274
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

199
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,438
You peel potatoes.

200
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,716
I practised as a doctor.

201
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,393
Before I...

202
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,192
Before I came here.

203
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,354
You couldn't have been much good
then, if you had to practise.

204
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,911
Now, what are you going to be
when you grow up?

205
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,918
I know. An explorer.

206
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,432
How do you know that?

207
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,437
Is it nice on the farm?

208
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,480
Bruno. Bruno, what happened to you?

209
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,149
I made a swing,
but I fell off it and cut my knee.

210
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,715
But Pavel here, he carried me in
and put a bandage on it.

211
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,477
- Go to your room.
- But Pavel says I...

212
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,715
Don't argue. Go to your room.

213
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,999
Thank you.

214
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,960
It's not fair, you having this view.

215
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,877
Well, I'm not swapping.

216
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,597
I think school's here.

217
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,435
No, I mean more recent history.

218
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,109
- Are you interested in current affairs?
- Yes, very.

219
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,789
So, you'll be aware of the situation

220
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,035
in which our great nation
presently finds itself.

221
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,398
Yes. I read newspapers whenever I can
and one of Father's men

222
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,396
keeps me up to date
on everything that's happening.

223
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,877
Good. And you, Bruno.
Have you been reading newspapers?

224
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,950
- Have you been reading anything?
- Books.

225
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,031
Good. What sort of books?

226
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,951
Adventure books, mainly.

227
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,915
You know, knights in shining armour,
exploring strange lands and stuff,

228
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,630
and silly princesses
always getting in the way.

229
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:46,152
Well, this is why I'm here to help.
You're how old now, Bruno? Eight?

230
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,831
Time to get your head
out of those fiction books

231
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,916
and start learning about fact.

232
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,509
Time, I think,
to turn your mind to the real world,

233
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,472
and I believe
this would be the perfect start.

234
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,919
Die, die!

235
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,596
Die, die.

236
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,149
Hello.

237
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,433
I'm exploring.

238
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,793
- What are you doing?
- We're... We're building a new hut.

239
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,919
Have you got lots of friends over there?

240
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,280
A few. But we fight a lot.

241
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,998
That's why I like being out here.
I can be on my own.

242
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,279
- I'm Bruno.
- Shmuel.

243
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,995
- Sorry?
- I'm Shmuel.

244
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,949
That's your name? Never heard
of anyone called that before.

245
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,230
I've never heard
of anyone called Bruno.

246
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,114
But Shmuel. No one's called Shmuel.

247
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,995
I live in the house, back there.

248
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,753
- Have you got any food on you?
- No.

249
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,593
Are you hungry?

250
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,072
How old are you?

251
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,955
- Eight.
- Me, too!

252
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,509
It's not fair,
me being stuck over here on my own,

253
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,279
while you're over there,
playing with friends all day.

254
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,153
- Playing?
- Well, that number.

255
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,750
- Isn't it a part of a game or something?
- It's just my number.

256
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,870
Everyone gets given
a different number.

257
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,396
Right. Then what happens?

258
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,914
- I have to go back now!
- Really?

259
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,109
Yeah.

260
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,318
It was nice to meet you, Shmuel.

261
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,556
And you, Bruno.

262
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,955
Bye.

263
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,391
Mum, I can't find my football.

264
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,590
Well, it'll be
in one of your cupboards, sweet.

265
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,437
It isn't. I've looked.

266
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,389
Can I have a piece of chocolate?

267
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,433
A piece. Yes.

268
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,234
Bruno?

269
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,071
- Have you looked in the cellar?
- The cellar?

270
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,478
For your football.

271
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,275
Damn.

272
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,511
- Gretel, I've just seen all your...
- All my what?

273
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,752
All your dolls, down in the cellar.

274
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,711
Dolls are for little girls.

275
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,399
It's not right to play with silly toys

276
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,069
while people are away
risking their lives for the Fatherland.

277
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,119
- "My people's density is my density."
- Destiny.

278
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,115
"lts struggles and its sorrows,
its joys and its miseries are mine.

279
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,675
"I must work and create
for the resurrection of my Fatherland.

280
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,234
"The history of my people
is great and glorious."

281
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,759
And it's 12:00.

282
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,752
- I'm sorry?
- Isn't that when we finish?

283
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,792
The termination of the lesson
is for the tutor to decide, Bruno,

284
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,673
not the pupil.
Now, will you please continue.

285
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,037
Bruno, there you are.

286
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,195
I'm just going into town for an hour.
Do you want to come?

287
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,510
You be careful on that thing.

288
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,994
Thank you.

289
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,436
Can I ask you something?

290
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,319
Why do you people
wear pyjamas all day?

291
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,151
- They're not pyjamas.
- Well, those.

292
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,918
We have to.
They took all our other clothes away.

293
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,757
- Who did?
- The soldiers.

294
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,438
The soldiers? Why?

295
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,953
I don't like soldiers. Do you?

296
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,837
I do, quite. My dad's a soldier,

297
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:05,637
but not the sort that takes
people's clothes away for no reason.

298
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,238
What sort, then?

299
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,599
Well, he's the important sort.

300
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,110
He's in charge of making
everything better for everyone.

301
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,708
- So is your dad a farmer?
- No, he's a watchmaker.

302
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:26,318
Or was. Most of the time now,
he just mends boots.

303
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,196
It's funny how grown-ups
can't make their minds up

304
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,232
about what they want to do.
It's like Pavel.

305
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,669
Do you know him? Lives over there.

306
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,669
He used to be a doctor,
but gave it all up to peel potatoes.

307
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,552
Can I ask you another question?

308
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,875
What do you burn in those chimneys?

309
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,469
I saw them going the other day.
Is it just lots of hay and stuff?

310
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,478
I don't know.
We're not allowed over there.

311
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,670
Mama says it's old clothes.

312
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,359
Well, whatever it is, it smells horrid.

313
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,636
I wish
you'd remembered the chocolate.

314
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,272
Yes, I'm sorry.

315
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,198
I know! Perhaps you can come
and have supper with us sometime.

316
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,754
I can't, can I? Because of this.

317
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,874
But that's to stop
the animals getting out, isn't it?

318
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,151
Animals?
No, it's to stop people getting out.

319
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,476
Are you not allowed out?

320
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,955
- Why? What have you done?
- I'm a Jew.

321
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,356
I think I should go now.

322
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,514
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- I'll try.

323
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,154
- Goodbye, then!
- Bye.

324
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,436
Little present, sweetheart.

325
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,478
Thank you, Mummy.

326
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,350
- Have you seen Bruno?
- Outside on his swing, I think.

327
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:35,909
Yes, Thursday's perfect.
I'll have a car come to collect you both.

328
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,190
Are Grandma and Grandpa coming?

329
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,597
Hey, did you smell
that horrible smell the other day?

330
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,473
- Coming from the chimneys.
- What sort of ill?

331
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,276
The day I fell off the swing.

332
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,354
- Did you smell it, Mum?
- Father.

333
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,993
Mum.

334
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,352
Let me speak to her.

335
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,277
Yes, she is. I can hear her.

336
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,194
Yes. We look forward to it. Goodbye.

337
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,630
- Is Grandma not coming?
- No.

338
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,516
She's poorly, apparently,
but Grandpa's coming.

339
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,590
- Did you smell it, Dad?
- What?

340
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,996
That horrid smell from the chimneys.
What is it?

341
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,830
I think they just burn rubbish
there sometimes.

342
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,552
- Look.
- What?

343
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,958
- Hey!
- Gretel.

344
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,279
Hey, that's not fair!

345
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,799
- Gretel.
- What?

346
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,912
It's only a game.

347
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,349
Ralf, this tutor you brought in,

348
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,149
does he usually teach children
as young as Gretel and Bruno?

349
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,312
I believe so. Why?

350
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,237
Well, do we know
what he's teaching them?

351
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,077
Gretel seems to have become so...

352
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,588
They're being taught what all children
are being taught at the moment.

353
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,632
They mustn't get left behind.

354
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,874
Come on.

355
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,352
Let's get to bed.

356
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,239
"The Jew slandered us
and incited our enemies.

357
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,589
"The Jew corrupted us
through bad books.

358
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,915
"He mocked
our literature and our music.

359
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,235
"Everywhere, his influence
was destructive,

360
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:33,113
"the eventual result of which
was our nation's collapse,

361
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,037
- "and then..."
- Yes, Bruno.

362
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,595
I don't understand.

363
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,552
A nation's collapse
is all down to this one man?

364
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,990
The Jew here
means the entire Jewish race.

365
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,951
If it had been just one man,

366
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,468
I'm sure something
would've been done about him.

367
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,592
There is such a thing as a nice Jew,
though, isn't there?

368
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,269
I think, Bruno,
if you ever found a nice Jew,

369
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:01,193
you would be
the best explorer in the world.

370
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,912
Continue, Gretel.

371
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,752
"The aim of the Jew
is to become the ruler of humanity.

372
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,314
<i>"The Jew is not creative,
but destructive.</i>

373
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,794
"He is the enemy of culture.

374
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,071
"Thousands of Germans
have been made poor by the Jew."

375
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,319
Master Bruno.

376
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,715
What are you doing? You've just
had your lunch, haven't you?

377
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,469
I was going for a walk,
and I thought I might get peckish.

378
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,239
But don't make a mess of your satchel.
Bring it here.

379
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,637
- I'll wrap it properly for you.
- No. It's none of your business.

380
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,352
Bruno, what is it?

381
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,515
What are you doing with your satchel?

382
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,156
<i>Herr Liszt gave us some books.
I'm going out on the swing to read.</i>

383
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,476
- Let me see.
- What?

384
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,114
- The books.
- No.

385
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:08,914
<i>Bruno, I just want to see
what books Herr Liszt has given you.</i>

386
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,156
- I told a lie.
- What?

387
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,878
I've just got

388
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,758
adventure books.

389
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,631
Go on. Off you go, then.

390
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,630
Now, Maria,
there's two extra for supper tonight.

391
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,829
<i>The Kommandant's father will be here,</i>

392
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,155
and I believe
Lieutenant Kotler is joining us.

393
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,155
Here.

394
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,758
What's the matter?

395
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,038
- Don't throw it back.
- What? Why not?

396
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,436
- It's dangerous.
- Dangerous?

397
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,436
It's just a ball. Come on.

398
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,831
Do you not like playing?

399
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,833
- Just not ball games?
- Not here.

400
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,509
- Tell me how the number game works.
- I told you, it's not a game.

401
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,516
We just all have numbers.

402
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,228
Shmuel!

403
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:09,431
Bruno! What are you doing?

404
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,117
My ball went over.
I was just getting it back.

405
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,273
They smell even worse
when they burn, don't they?

406
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,389
What?

407
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,238
But, surely you...

408
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,868
Elsa, I was sworn to secrecy.

409
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,956
- From your own wife.
- Yes.

410
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,078
I took an oath upon my life.
Do you understand?

411
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,360
Elsa, you believe in this, too.

412
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:23,035
- You want this country to be strong...
- No, Ralf, no! No, not that!

413
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,953
How can you...

414
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,592
- Because I'm a soldier.
- How can you...

415
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,313
- Soldiers fight wars.
- That isn't war!

416
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,158
It's a part of it! It's a vital part of it!

417
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,279
The Fatherland we all desire,
all of us, you included,

418
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,153
cannot be achieved
without work such as this!

419
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:51,874
- Elsa. Elsa.
- Get away from me! Get away from me!

420
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,199
Grandpa's here.

421
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,800
- I don't believe this.
- Grandpa's here.

422
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,270
We'll be through in a moment.

423
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,676
Who told you about this?

424
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,713
How's Grandma?

425
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,589
She's a bit under the weather,
I'm afraid.

426
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,599
It's a shame, she was so much
looking forward to seeing you.

427
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:58,996
- Perhaps next time, if she feels up to it.
- Absolutely.

428
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:09,997
You know, Ralf,
your mother really is sick.

429
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:13,275
She's been talking about this visit
for weeks.

430
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,675
Maybe that's what's made her sick.

431
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,790
So, your father tells me
that you've got a tutor.

432
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,070
Yes. He's nice.

433
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,353
But he won't let us read
any adventure books.

434
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:33,915
All we do is boring, old history.

435
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,510
Let me tell you something, young man.

436
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,758
If it wasn't for history, we wouldn't
all be sitting around this table.

437
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,360
The work your father is doing here,

438
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,197
history in the making.

439
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,989
When I was your age, history was
my favourite subject by miles,

440
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,310
which obviously
didn't please my father.

441
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,679
Why not?

442
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,598
Well, he was a professor of literature
at the university.

443
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:09,916
Really, does he still teach?

444
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:16,110
- I don't really know.
- You don't know?

445
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:23,436
We're not in touch, my father and I.
He left the country some time ago.

446
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,359
Really, when?

447
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,836
<i>About four years ago,
Herr Kommandant.</i>

448
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:40,432
But surely he can't be very old.
What is he, still in his 40s, late 40s?

449
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,758
Where did he go?

450
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,112
Lieutenant Kotler,

451
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,909
your father, the professor of literature,
where did he go?

452
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,318
<i>I believe it was Switzerland,
Herr Kommandant.</i>

453
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,869
How strange that he should choose
to leave the Fatherland

454
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,399
at the very moment it needed him most.

455
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:13,159
Just when we're all required
to play our part in the national revival.

456
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,519
More wine!

457
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:19,513
What reason did he give?
Was he tubercular?

458
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,912
Did he go there to take the air?

459
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,112
<i>I'm afraid I really don't know,
Herr Kommandant.</i>

460
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,071
You'd have to ask him.

461
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,759
Well, that would be rather difficult,
wouldn't it?

462
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,950
With him being in Switzerland.

463
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:36,868
Come on!

464
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,468
What's the matter with you tonight?

465
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,956
Yes, perhaps that was it.
Perhaps he was ill.

466
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,280
Unless, of course,
he had disagreements.

467
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,750
- I mean, with government policy.
- One hears of such men.

468
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,069
Disturbed, most of them,
or just plain cowards.

469
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,551
- Even so, all of them traitors.
- Absolutely right.

470
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,118
Presumably,
if that was the case with your father,

471
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:18,755
you will have informed your superiors,
as is your duty.

472
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,239
Lieutenant Kotler!

473
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,433
You cretin Jew! Filth!

474
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,239
Ralf!

475
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:44,869
Jew!

476
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,430
- But Dad just sat there.
- What did you expect him to do?

477
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:51,472
The Jew deserved it.

478
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,396
Can I ask you something
about the farm?

479
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:07,032
Bruno, you don't still think it's a farm,
do you?

480
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:27,752
It's a camp. What's called a work camp.

481
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,596
For Jews, obviously.

482
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,793
Just Jews?

483
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,389
Because they're the best workers?

484
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,836
They're not in there
because they're good, silly.

485
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,598
They're no good at anything.

486
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,358
They're in there because they're evil.

487
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,516
- They're the enemy.
- The enemy?

488
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,835
- But I thought we were fighting...
- They're evil, Bruno.

489
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,757
Evil, dangerous vermin.

490
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,033
They're the reason
we lost the Great War.

491
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,914
<i>Haven't you been listening to anything
Herr Liszt has been telling us?</i>

492
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,439
No. Not really.

493
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:04,470
Dad's not horrible, is he?
He's a good man.

494
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:08,274
- Of course, he is.
- But he's in charge of a horrible place.

495
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,275
It's only horrible for them, Bruno.

496
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,754
We should be proud of Dad,
now more than ever before.

497
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,268
He's making the country great again.

498
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:09,477
<i>Like you say, they're a bit strange.
A bit...</i>

499
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,555
<i>Well, they're different.</i>

500
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,431
<i>They're the enemy, Bruno.</i>

501
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,391
<i>Evil, dangerous vermin.</i>

502
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,432
<i>Well, you see,
they're not really people at all.</i>

503
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,790
What are you doing here?

504
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:46,879
They wanted someone with tiny fingers
to clean all these.

505
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,078
We're not supposed to be friends,
you and me.

506
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:05,078
We're meant to be enemies.
Did you know that?

507
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,438
Do you want some?

508
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,074
- What's your dad like?
- What's he like?

509
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,072
Is he a good man?

510
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,115
You've never thought he wasn't?

511
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,591
And you're proud of him?

512
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,831
Aren't you proud of yours?

513
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,991
Is it really horrible in the camp?

514
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,155
How dare you
talk to people in the house.

515
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,838
How dare you!

516
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:56,033
Are you eating?

517
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,596
Have you been stealing food?

518
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,915
- Answer me!
- No, sir. He gave it to me.

519
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,878
He's my friend.

520
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,835
What?

521
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,913
Little man,

522
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,756
do you know this Jew?

523
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,199
Do you know this Jew?

524
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,232
No, I just walked in,
and he was helping himself.

525
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,234
I've never seen him before in my life.

526
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,274
You, finish cleaning the glasses.

527
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,152
When I come back,
we'll have a little chat

528
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,909
about what happens to rats who steal.
Come away.

529
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,799
<i>New arrivals here are happy
to discover that life in the camp</i>

530
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,159
<i>is not all work.</i>

531
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,873
<i>And that there's
ample opportunity for leisure also.</i>

532
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:33,356
<i>At the end of their day
at the ironmongery</i>

533
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,073
<i>or the build or boot factory,
the workers can enjoy</i>

534
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,351
<i>the many forms of pastime
that the camp has to offer.</i>

535
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,839
<i>Organised sport is very popular.</i>

536
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,872
<i>Those that don't play
certainly enjoy watching.</i>

537
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,239
<i>At the end of the working day,</i>

538
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,589
<i>the centrally located café
is the ideal place</i>

539
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:56,077
<i>for friends and families to join together
for a hearty and nutritious meal.</i>

540
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,759
<i>The children, in particular,
enjoy the pastries and cakes on offer.</i>

541
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,434
<i>In the evenings,
the occasional music concerts,</i>

542
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,438
<i>either by visiting orchestras
or, indeed, by talented musicians</i>

543
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,233
<i>from within the camp itself,
are always well attended.</i>

544
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,709
<i>Other recreations include
reading in the library,</i>

545
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:24,517
<i>pottery, cookery, art and horticulture
for adult and child alike.</i>

546
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,599
<i>Almost any activity one could wish for
is available within the camp.</i>

547
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:35,355
Splendid.

548
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,430
- Bravo. Excellent.
- Thank you.

549
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,712
Goodbye, little man.

550
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,397
Shmuel! Shmuel!

551
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,790
I don't understand.

552
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,229
I saw a film about the camp,

553
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,397
and it looked so nice.

554
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,396
I don't know why I did it.

555
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,473
Gretel and everyone
were saying all these things,

556
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,636
and that soldier's so scary.

557
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,195
Been coming here for days,
but you were never here.

558
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:11,916
I thought maybe
we weren't friends any more.

559
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:24,232
Shmuel, I'm really sorry for what I did.
We are still friends, aren't we?

560
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:57,716
Where's Kurt these days?
I haven't seen him for ages.

561
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:02,431
- Who's Kurt?
- Lieutenant Kotler.

562
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,590
He's been moved to the front.

563
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,671
It was felt that
his youth and enthusiasm

564
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,358
would be put to better use there.

565
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,436
<i>Herr Kommandant, telephone.</i>

566
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,709
In actual fact, Gretel, he was sent there

567
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,512
because he failed
to inform the authorities

568
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,869
of his father's
lack of loyalty to the Party.

569
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,717
Which was his duty, I might add.

570
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,796
- Which was his bad luck.
- Bad luck?

571
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:27,799
Well, bad luck that it was his father
who was disloyal, and not his mother.

572
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,479
One presumably
doesn't have to report one's mother.

573
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,797
- What?
- When will Pavel be back?

574
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,274
- Mum?
- Never, stupid.

575
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,189
It's Father. They've been bombed.

576
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,038
Grandmother's dead.

577
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,995
"...the victory
which You have obtained for us

578
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:45,270
"and for all who sleep in Him,

579
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:48,790
"keep us who are still in the body
in everlasting fellowship

580
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:51,070
"with all that wait for Thee on earth,

581
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,475
"and with all that are around Thee
in heaven,

582
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,795
"in union with Him
who is the resurrection

583
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:59,435
"and the life, who liveth and reigneth
with Thee and the Holy Ghost,

584
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,438
"ever one God, world without end.
Amen."

585
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,916
He can't have that on there.
She wouldn't have wanted it.

586
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,308
He does.

587
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,634
"Almighty God, who by the death of..."

588
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,079
<i>Have you ever been to a funeral?</i>

589
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:43,150
My grandma and grandpa both died
just after we got here,

590
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,430
but there weren't any funerals.

591
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,836
That one there to there.

592
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,155
They both died at the same time?

593
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:56,828
What of?

594
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,309
I don't know.

595
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:03,069
Papa said they must have caught
something on the way here.

596
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:06,192
They had to go to a hospital
as soon as we arrived.

597
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:08,231
We didn't see them again.

598
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,559
This is fun.

599
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:18,116
Wish we could do something
a bit more exciting, though.

600
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,276
- That one there to there.
- This one?

601
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,991
- This one?
- No, that one.

602
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,477
- This one to here?
- No, there!

603
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:34,511
- To here?
- No.

604
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,278
- Here?
- No.

605
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:48,760
- I don't want you to go away again.
- No. Neither do I.

606
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:17,916
You can't behave like this!

607
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,711
- You're questioning my behaviour?
- It can't continue!

608
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,309
I know.
I can't stand this any more, Ralf.

609
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,669
I can't stay here and be a part of this.

610
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,712
Don't you think there will be questions?

611
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,159
- Questions?
- Well, now, what does it say

612
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:35,716
about my ability to carry out my work
if I cannot control my own family?

613
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:38,593
- Work? Is that what you call it?
- Pull yourself together, woman.

614
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,358
Right. Just ignore it. Ignore it.

615
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:44,029
Ignore the fact
that the man I married is a monster!

616
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,880
Even your own mother
couldn't love you.

617
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,918
Are you happy here?

618
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:00,912
Yes. Very.

619
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,592
And you, Gretel?

620
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:12,434
Well, I was, but I do miss home.
I miss my friends.

621
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:17,870
Yes, I'm sure. And you, too, Bruno.
You must miss those friends of yours.

622
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,428
No. Not any more, really.

623
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:38,153
I suppose the real question is,
if the opportunity arose,

624
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:41,715
would you prefer
to live somewhere else?

625
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,514
- Back home?
- No. Not Berlin. Not yet.

626
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,915
Somewhere safe, say Aunt Lottie's
in Heidelberg, for example.

627
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:54,196
All of us? You as well?

628
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:58,431
No. That won't be possible just yet,
I'm afraid.

629
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:01,040
I must stay
and complete my work here.

630
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:06,835
See, at the moment,
your mother is finding it...

631
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,033
She just feels right now you need
to spend some time elsewhere.

632
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,832
Would you like that?

633
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:29,713
I'm afraid, Bruno, in life, we often
have to do things we don't want to do.

634
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,354
The important thing is
your mother does not feel

635
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,198
that this is an appropriate place for you
to be spending your childhood,

636
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:38,755
and the more I think about it, the more
I realise she's very probably right.

637
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:40,233
- But, Dad...
- No!

638
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,270
It's time for you to move away.

639
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,316
Is everything all right?

640
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,951
We can't find Papa.

641
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,560
He went on a different work duty
with some of the men,

642
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,670
and they haven't come back.

643
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:36,955
I've got some bad news, too.
I'm going away.

644
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,477
How long for this time?

645
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,276
That's why it's bad. It's forever, I think.

646
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:49,518
Mum says this is no place for children,
which is just stupid.

647
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:53,032
- When do you go?
- Tomorrow. After lunch.

648
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:58,710
So, I won't ever see you again?

649
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,439
Yes, you will. You can come on holiday
to Berlin if you like,

650
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,597
when everybody's getting on
with each other again.

651
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:15,033
I wish I could've helped you
find your dad.

652
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,916
I really want to make up
for letting you down like I did.

653
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:21,872
That would have done it, wouldn't it?
Helping you find your dad?

654
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,673
Would've been great.
Like a secret mission.

655
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:32,551
- I could dig under.
- What? With that?

656
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:36,673
- No, but I could bring something.
- You don't want to come over here.

657
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:41,109
Look.

658
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,597
- I could come through to your side.
- What's the point in that?

659
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,438
Your dad's not going to be over here,
is he?

660
01:12:53,960 --> 01:12:57,794
But I'd stick out though, wouldn't I,
if I came through?

661
01:12:57,840 --> 01:12:59,637
I don't look like you.

662
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,276
You could look like me, though.

663
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:07,595
If you dressed like me
and shaved your hair off.

664
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,676
I'm not shaving my hair off.

665
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:13,999
- You could cover it with a cap.
- My pyjamas are a different colour.

666
01:13:14,040 --> 01:13:17,669
I could bring some.
There's a hut full of them,

667
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:20,280
thousands of them.
Would you do it, though?

668
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,470
- I want to do it.
- Would you dare do it, though?

669
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,034
- I want to help you find your dad.
- I've got to go.

670
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:28,356
Tomorrow, then?
I'll bring an extra-big sandwich.

671
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,516
And don't forget the pyjamas!

672
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,069
Bruno?

673
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,275
Mum, can I go and play on the swing?

674
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:40,399
- Bruno...
- It's my last chance.

675
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:44,551
All right. Go on then.

676
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:18,398
- I thought you weren't coming!
- I'm sorry. It wasn't easy to get away.

677
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,989
I'm not meant to be out here today.
You forgot the pyjamas!

678
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:26,792
- Did you bring the sandwich?
- Would I let you down?

679
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:51,874
Shmuel.

680
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:01,355
Here.

681
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:17,959
How do I look?

682
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,877
Right. Let's get going.

683
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:43,589
Bruno?

684
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,359
That's enough.

685
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:17,430
Let's go and find your dad.

686
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,754
Come on!

687
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:25,793
Master Bruno?

688
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:09,874
Shmuel.

689
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,833
- Can we go to the café or something?
- Café?

690
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:19,912
- Maybe I should go home.
- What about Papa?

691
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,149
Yeah.

692
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,436
We'll check our hut first.

693
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:40,674
Bruno?

694
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:48,948
Come on.

695
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:02,795
Papa?

696
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,155
Up! Up! Get up!

697
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,156
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

698
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,952
We go on marches sometimes.

699
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,911
Move! Up, up!

700
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,718
Move, move!

701
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:28,279
Bruno!

702
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:32,472
He must still be
outside somewhere, ma'am.

703
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,319
Bruno!

704
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,194
Bruno?

705
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,072
- Move!
- Quickly!

706
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:08,388
Get up!

707
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,552
Get up. You must!

708
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,119
Move them out!

709
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,475
...which means that
our weekly capabilities

710
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:30,033
would be almost tripled,

711
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,275
so, therefore,
by the end of the summer...

712
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,312
- Ralf.
- Elsa, I'm in a meeting.

713
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:37,472
Bruno's missing.

714
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:44,239
Come on!

715
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,238
Wait here!

716
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,919
Come on!

717
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:07,993
Move! Move!

718
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,192
Join the queue!

719
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,479
Come on, you!

720
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:36,673
Bruno!

721
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,828
Move it!

722
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:42,834
Go on.

723
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:45,708
Bruno!

724
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:59,750
It's all right. I think we're just waiting
in here until the rain stops.

725
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,153
Clothes off!

726
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,916
Where are we going?

727
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:17,151
No, it's just a shower.

728
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:20,039
A shower?

729
01:23:06,960 --> 01:23:09,599
Open the gates! Open the gates!

730
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,155
Move!

731
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,916
Bruno!

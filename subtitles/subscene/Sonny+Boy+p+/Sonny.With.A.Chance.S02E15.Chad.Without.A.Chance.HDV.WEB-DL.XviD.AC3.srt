00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,360
Are you ready to get
<i>"so random!"?</i>

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,530
Hello! I'm sicky vicky.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,010
And welcome to "how to have
fun when you're sick."

4
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,040
Today I've got pinkeye.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,640
I got it from alice mazarski.

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,680
Because she came to school with pinkeye.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,180
Not cool.

8
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,990
And she also rubbed it with my pink eraser.

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,720
And then I chewed on my eraser.

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,720
And now I've got pinkeye.

11
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,460
I've also got pink eraser
stuck in my teeth.

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,260
But you can still have fun with pinkeye.

13
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,130
You can make it a whole pink day.

14
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:38,000
You can have a pink pillow.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,070
You can drink pink lemonade.

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:45,240
And you can make.

17
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,480
Pinky puppets!

18
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,410
Ben feldman made a foot puppet at camp,

19
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,650
But that's 'cause he has
a really giant big toe.

20
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,020
That kinda looks more
like a finger than a toe.

21
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,560
I like to call it
a finger-toe.

22
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,400
Not cool.

23
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,730
But I still have a crush on him.

24
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,540
You can also make neat eye patches.

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,110
To cover your pinkeye

26
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,610
'cause it can look
really really really gross.

27
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,880
You can make pretty ones.

28
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,180
Or you can make ones
that look like a pirate.

29
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,250
Arrrrgh!

30
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:25,420
Dominique rombado
went as a pirate for Halloween.

31
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,630
And he had a real parrot on his shoulder,

32
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,100
But it pooped.

33
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,200
Not cool.

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,870
And he had
to trick-or-treat all night.

35
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,000
With bird poop down his back.

36
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,840
Well, that's it for today.

37
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,580
I'm sicky vicky.

38
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,180
Uh-oh.

39
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,520
This looks like an itchy red dot.

40
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,490
Looks like next week I'll be showing you.

41
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,160

Thank you.
Sonny's mine!

57
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,960
All right!
Everybody! Everybody!

58
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,190
Hey hey!
Calm down!

59
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,230
Okay, sonny's got just
so many hours in a day.

60
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,970
So be patient.
She's gonna help us all.

61
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,900
- He's trying to go first!
- Hey!

62
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,900
No, I'm not!

63
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,670
No, I'm not, okay?

64
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,610
Now let's figure this schedule
out one person at a time.

65
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:12,510
- Zora?
- Thank you.

66
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,010
Sonny promised to help me
prepare for my karate test.

67
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,850
- Hai!
- Oh!

68
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,690
But I just found out that I have
a conflicting kickboxing test.

69
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,790
Huh!

70
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,360
So I'm gonna need to switch my
1:00 slot with grady's 10:00.

71
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,330
- Oh, hey hey!
Get your hands off... - Hai!

72
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,430
Hey hey hey hey!

73
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,230
Don't touch my 12:00!

74
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,500
I have a lunchtime appointment with
sonny that I can't reschedule.

75
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,970
You know what else can't be rescheduled?

76
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,670
My emotions.
Mm-hmm.

77
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,010
I'm not giving up my special
talk time with sonny.

78
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,550
Know what, guys?

79
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,510
I'm very good at scheduling, okay?

80
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,520
Let me just see if I can help, okay?

81
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,880
- All right.
- Okay, but just don't move my 12:00.

82
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,550
There, everybody happy?

83
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,260
Hey! Awww.

84
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,930
Is there trouble in the funny hut?

85
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,430
What do you want, chad?

86
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,100
I'm looking for sonny.
She's supposed to be.

87
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,600
Helping me hang my new "mac falls" posters.

88
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,040
Really? Because I don't
see your name.

89
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,340
- On the sonny scheduling board.
- Yeah.

90
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,740
Well, you wouldn't 'cause now
that sonny and I are dating...

91
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,880
Every time!

92
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,350
Still so gross!

93
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,680
...She has a very special
chad scheduling board.

94
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,880
And it's, uh...
it's right there.

95
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,690
- Oh.
- No you didn't.

96
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,250
- So disgusting.
- Oh my god.

97
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:32,660
Yeah. Uh-huh.
That bugs you, doesn't it, randoms?

98
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,760
You know what?
Get used to it!

99
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,660
'cause now that sonny and I are dating,

100
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,030
It's time for you to start
calling chaddy daddy.

101
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,400
As in who's yo chaddy?

102
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,970
Who's yo chaddy?

103
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,080
Oh. Hey, babe.

104
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,710
Oh, don't you babe her.
She's our babe.

105
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,580
Yeah! Hey, babe.

106
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,450
Okay, all right.
Stop arguing.

107
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,050
I'm gonna settle this right now.

108
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,660
Nobody gets to call me babe.

109
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,890
In your face, <i>chaddy.</i>

110
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,930
Mmm! Hey!

111
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,660
Okay, you know what?
You guys arguing.

112
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,300
Is really starting to get old.

113
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,130
You know what else is getting old?

114
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,570
The sicky vicky voice.
Rehearsal's over.

115
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,740
I'm not doing a voice.
I'm sick.

116
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:21,810
- Oh, really?
- Aww.

117
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,280
Then get away from me.
Oh, but not too far.

118
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,940
Because I still need you to help me.

119
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,010
Hey!

120
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,920
Hey! Hey!

121
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,850
Can't you people see
my lady's not feeling well?

122
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,860
You people disgust me.

123
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,320
Almost as much as the snot rocket.

124
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,130
That just came out of my lady's nose.

125
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,200
It's okay. Come on.
Let's go get you some tea

126
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,030
'cause you're sick.

127
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,630
Lovesick.

128
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,940
Stop it!

129
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,910
You know, I'm really disappointed.

130
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,880
I thought once we started dating you guys
would figure out a way to get along.

131
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,150
And I thought once we started
dating you'd stop talking to them.

132
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,790
I am just as disappointed as you are.

133
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,120
Oh, you really are sick.
You should go home and get some rest.

134
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,160
I can't. I have a whole
list of things I've gotta do.

135
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,960
I know. The demands the randoms
put on you... they are horrible.

136
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,830
I'd never pressure you like that.

137
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,840
So I'm thinking I only need you
to hang 50 of these babies.

138
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,140
- You're so good to me.
- Oh, I know.

139
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,280
- You're not good to me!
- Hey! Careful!

140
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,280
If you were good to me, you wouldn't
be asking me to hang your posters.

141
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,450
You'd be offering to help me with my list.

142
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,380
What, you mean the list of things.

143
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,520
That help the randoms?

144
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,990
Wow.
How sick are you?

145
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,760
You know what?
You're right.

146
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,960
It must be the fever talking.
'cause if I wasn't sick,

147
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,700
Clearly I'd know that you
could never handle this list.

148
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,070
Really?

149
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,600
- Really. - 'Cause I'm pretty
sure I can handle a day.

150
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,540
Of babysitting your little fun hut buddies.

151
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,740
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- I know so.

152
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,380
- Really? Good.
- Really. Good..

153
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,280
- Fine. Going home.
- Fine. Feel better.

154
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,650
- Thanks.
- Miss you.

155
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,310
Miss you too.

156
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:20,360
My name is chad dylan cooper.

157
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,000
Substitute sonny.

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,730
Now I'm sick.

159
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,830
So, uh, how sick does this make you?

160
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,640
Now listen, you clowns.

161
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,310
I took over the list of things.

162
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,480
That sonny was supposed to do for you.

163
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,210
So if you need any help with one
of your stupid little problems,

164
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,720
There is a new sonny in town.

165
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,690
So you think you can just.

166
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:52,160
Waltz on in here
and put your name on the board.

167
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,230
And that's all it takes
to replace sonny, huh?

168
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,030
Pretty much.

169
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,670
I'll get you first.

170
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,970
It was hard to choose who goes first,

171
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,840
But you were very persuasive.

172
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,650
- It's all there.
- Ya-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop.

173
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,280
99, 100... okay.

174
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,120
So how may I be of sonny to you?

175
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,650
This is a list of guys I've dated.

176
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,520
Broken down into two categories...

177
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,890
The absolutelys and the absolutely nots.

178
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,330
And I'm here because?

179
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,830
Sonny always breaks up
with the rejects for me.

180
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,700
She's got a more gentle touch.

181
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,900
When it comes to dumping.
You'll see.

182
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,800
When sonny breaks up with you, you'll say,

183
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,110
"huh, that was gentle."

184
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,910
And when she doesn't you'll say,

185
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:46,410
"huh, I was wrong.
Sonny digs chad."

186
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,180
Chad's awesome.
Chad's the best.

187
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,520
"Everybody loves
some chaddy."

188
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,890
Okay, just put an x by anyone who cries.

189
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,460
Yeah, right.
Like I'm gonna deal with that.

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,200
I knew you could never handle this list.

191
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,830
- Fine.
- Fine.

192
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,670
- Good.
- Good.

193
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,910
See?
I'm doing it.

194
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,840
You happy now?

195
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,710
Who am I talking to?

196
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:22,180
Hello, is this isaac?

197
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,550
How do you think that date
with tawni hart went?

198
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,590
Really? Wow.

199
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,460
Now divide that by three, subtract two...

200
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:33,960
Uh-huh.

201
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,430
Good. And as long as we're
talking about numbers,

202
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,930
Lose tawni's!

203
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,870
Oh, this is fun.

204
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,400
I know it's hard to hear,

205
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,640
But tawni's breaking up with you.

206
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,680
Oh. Well, when your
big brother gets home,

207
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,110
Pass this message along, okay?

208
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,980
Thanks, sport.

209
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,080
Hey, is this bennett?

210
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,020
Nah, chad dylan cooper here.

211
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,290
I'm good, I'm good.

212
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:02,220
- Chad?
- Hold on, buddy.

213
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,290
Is it my special talk time
with substitute sonny yet?

214
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:07,090
It's not your time.

215
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,430
Okay.

216
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,730
Sorry about that.
Yeah.

217
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,800
It's not your time either, bennett.

218
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,570
Yeah, tawni hart's cutting you loose,

219
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,300
Kicking you to the curb,
giving you the old heave-ho.

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,670
She's breaking up with you.

221
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:24,540
Still not getting it, huh?

222
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,510
I have broken up with a lot of guys today,

223
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,880
But you by far are the dumbest.

224
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,520
Oh!

225
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,350
Bennett's a crier!

226
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,420
All right, you got me for 20 minutes.

227
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,020
- What do you need?
- Her.

228
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,630
Sonny was gonna help me
break the ice today.

229
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,300
Dude, she's here for massage Monday.

230
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,970
You want to meet the girl,
go get your back cracked.

231
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,270
Oh no.

232
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,700
Nobody's cracking anything on me.

233
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,140
Okay? That's what you're
here for, substitute sonny.

234
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,270
You take the pain, I get the gain.

235
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,380
It's true.
I take the pain, he gets the gain.

236
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:02,480
Get! Get!

237
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,380
Fine.

238
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,250
You are here for your massage, ja?

239
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,520
Uh, ja.
You bet he is.

240
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,290
Uh, so tell me,

241
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,220
What is your specialty?

242
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,430
We take his unhappy spine.

243
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,660
And we make it happy like this.

244
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,130
That sounds great.

245
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,870
That sounds crippling.

246
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:25,240
- I don't want to do that.
- Sonny would.

247
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,810
Ja, I would.

248
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,610
Fine.

249
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,650
Sorry, I'm late.
I had a personal matter to deal with.

250
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,550
You know, I think I'd prefer that ja girl.

251
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:44,460
- Relax.
- Oh!

252
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,320
I spent the last two hours.

253
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,060
Consoling my heartbroken son.

254
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,800
Who was brutally dumped over the phone.

255
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,470
And she didn't even have
the courage to call herself.

256
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,770
He was dumped by some jerk.

257
00:11:57,770 --> 00:11:59,940
Named chad...

258
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,670
Dylan cooper!

259
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,010
You go now?

260
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,610
Ja, I go now.

261
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,200
I can't...
I can't feel my arm.

262
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,470
My little boy can't feel his heart.

263
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,970
Oh, bennett, how are you?

264
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,580
I still can't feel my heart, mama.

265
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,880
Oh.

266
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,750
Wait, you're bennett the crier?

267
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,350
You're chad the dumper?

268
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,720
- You know what I'm gonna do to you?
- What?

269
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,660
I'm gonna cut you loose,
kick you to the curb,

270
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,160
- Give you the old heave-ho.
- Okay, I see what you're doing there.

271
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,360
You're using all those words
I wish I hadn't said.

272
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,260
Pretty smart for a dumb guy.

273
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,100
Another thing I wish I hadn't said.

274
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,130
Oh, excuse me.
One little call.

275
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,200
Just take like one sec.
I'll be right with you.

276
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,840
- Hello, sonny!
- Hey, chad.

277
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,570
How's it going with the randoms?

278
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,010
Just swell.

279
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,050
That's my girlfriend.
I gotta take this.

280
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,480
You know how girlfriends
are, right? Am I right?

281
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,650
- Yeah.
- I wouldn't know.

282
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,720
Oh, that reminds me.

283
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,860
Oh, what?
Why am I running?

284
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,290
I just can't wait to get
to the next thing on my list.

285
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,400
Whoo.
Safe and sound.

286
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,300
Well, my arm's feeling better.

287
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,010
Things are looking up for chaddy.

288
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,070
- Hai!
- Ow!

289
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,680
Where did you come from?

290
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,410
Look at the board.
2:00, martial arts with zora.

291
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,350
- Hai!
- Ow! What...

292
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,920
- Ow! - I'm in a match with
someone three times my size.

293
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,990
To qualify for my black belt.

294
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,920
So sonny was going to spar with me.

295
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,520
While wearing a fat suit.

296
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,530
Put this on.

297
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,290
- I'm not putting that on.
- Hai!

298
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,230
- Ah! - Come on, man,
defend yourself.

299
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,370
It's the only way I'm gonna
get ready for my test.

300
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,100
Ah, crane!

301
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,770
Would you quit it?!

302
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,810
- I got a phone timeout.
- Paralyzing death blow.

303
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,610
Cut it out.

304
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,780
- Hi.
- Hi.

305
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,610
Is everything okay?

306
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,450
All of a sudden I heard screams
and then the phone went dead.

307
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,950
- <i>( zora grunts )</i>
- <i>( Chad screams )</i>

308
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:09,250
- <i>( dial tone blares )</i>
- Kind of like that.

309
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,850
You broke my phone!

310
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:15,620
Are you ready for my special talk time?

311
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,530
I was hoping there might be a cancelation.

312
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,200
<i>Hai!</i>

313
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,540
What did you do?

314
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:36,380
I wrote on the wall with crayons, mommy.

315
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,810
- Chad, it's me.
Get up. - Huh?

316
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,450
Did you break up with
this side of the list?

317
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,220
Yes. Yes.
The absolutely nots.

318
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,420
That was absolutely not as in you should.

319
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,320
Absolutely not break up with them!

320
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,890
- Absolutely.
- Who speaks like this?

321
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,760
Sonny would've understood this.

322
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,100
Absolutely.

323
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,100
Now you've broken me up
with the smartest guy.

324
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,140
- I've ever gone out with!
- Wow.

325
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,320
Worst day ever.

326
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,720
I mean, I feel like
I'm an interesting person.

327
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,390
And I contribute to society,

328
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,860
But sometimes it feels like

329
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,660
I'm talking and talking.

330
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,960
And nobody's listening.

331
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,600
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, I do. I do.

332
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,900
Lies!

333
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,870
You are seven minutes late!

334
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,540
I'm sorry.
But in my defense,

335
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,970
I was unconscious for five of them.

336
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:45,010
What usually happens during
your special talk time?

337
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,350
I'm not going to get bruised
or broken in any way?

338
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,850
No no no.

339
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,750
It's a time for me to reflect.

340
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,150
The people I work with,
the friendly atmosphere.

341
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,820
It's kind of like thanksgiving every week.

342
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,960
Whoo, what a relief.
I was worried.

343
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,760
You were gonna unload
a bunch of issues on me.

344
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,000
Like what?

345
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,660
Well, like, um...

346
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,870
Oh! The way nico's
always ready to ditch you.

347
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,730
For some pretty girl.

348
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,640
- Doesn't that bug you?
- I don't know. Should it?

349
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,910
Well, it would bug me.

350
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,310
- Oh, you know what else would bug me?
- What?

351
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,680
The way zora acts all smarter than you.

352
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,580
Why... why would
that bug you?

353
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,650
What bugs me is that it
doesn't bug you. Come on!

354
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,220
You don't have to yell at me.
It bugs me a little.

355
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,520
What else bugs you that doesn't bug me?

356
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,420
Mmm, well... and maybe
it's just me...

357
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,530
- <i>Yeah?</i> - What about
the way tawni treats you?

358
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,100
Should it bug me?

359
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,630
Only if you don't care.

360
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,630
That you're less important
to her than her shoes.

361
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,740
And her handbags and that yappy little dog!

362
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,340
Yeah, that dog!

363
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,170
- Oh, man, I hate that dog.
- <i>Right?</i>

364
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,810
And... and her shoes.

365
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,980
And the shoes she makes that dog wear.

366
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,040
Oh, man, that bugs me.

367
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:56,010
Whoa, calm down, mr.
Angry pants. What happened?

368
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,250
I thought this was supposed to
be "thanksgiving every week."

369
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,120
Well, it's time to take
the turkey out of the oven.

370
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,490
- <i>( timer dings )</i>
- Yeah, grady!

371
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,790
Take that turkey out of the oven.

372
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,960
You show 'em who's boss, yeah!

373
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,060
Oh, there's an actual turkey.

374
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,730
Now that that's done,

375
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,870
I'm gonna have a word with my friends.

376
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:16,670
- Get 'em, grady. Yeah!
- Is chad in there?

377
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,470
- Do you have an appointment?
- No.

378
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,910
Well, we finished early, so we
can probably squeeze you in.

379
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,880
- That's very generous of you.
- After you.

380
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,540
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

381
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,050
No!

382
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,950
Turkey's done, and so are we.

383
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,790
What are you talking about?

384
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,890
Oh, you people with your girlfriends.

385
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,560
And your smarts and your little dog.

386
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,990
Your <i>shoes.</i>

387
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,690
You think that doesn't bug me?
Well, it does.

388
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:44,860
It bugs me bad.
And I'm bugging out, people!

389
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,900
What's going on with you, man?

390
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,070
You... you just came
from special talk time.

391
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,040
You always come from there with
a turkey and a happy face.

392
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,440
Yeah, since when you do you come out angry?

393
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,240
Since chad told me all the things.

394
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,410
That bug me about you.

395
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:01,040
- And you believed him?
- Yeah, well...

396
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,150
Don't you see what's going on here, g?

397
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,180
He ruined special talk time.

398
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,550
He broke me up with the
smartest guy in hollywood.

399
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,260
Thanks to him, I...

400
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,160
I cried in front of that hot girl I like.

401
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,930
Yeah, and I blew my karate test.

402
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,860
Because chad didn't train me correctly.

403
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,730
- Now look at this. Ya!
- Ooh.

404
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,230
Nothing.

405
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,200
- All because of...
- Chad...

406
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,440
- Dylan...
- Cooper.

407
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:29,980
Hey, y'all, have you seen a very tall,

408
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,180
Very wide, angry man looking for me?

409
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,610
- Oh, you've got smaller...
- Skinnier...

410
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:36,480
- Angrier...
- Prettier...

411
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,050
Problems to deal with.

412
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,080
Guys, whoa whoa whoa.
Sonny would not approve.

413
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,620
We-e-e-ell,

414
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,120
- Sonny's not here now, is she?
- Mm-mmm.

415
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,390
No, she's not.
You know why?

416
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,930
'cause she's sick.

417
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,700
Any of you think to call her today, huh?

418
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,100
See how she was doing?
Did you?

419
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,840
No!

420
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,040
You were too worried about
your own petty problems.

421
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,780
You know what, guys?
Chad's right.

422
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,720
- I'm gonna go call sonny.
- No no, I'm gonna call her.

423
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,450
Why should you two call her?

424
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,250
- I care way more about sonny.
- What?

425
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:15,490
Whoa! Time out!

426
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:18,260
As adorable as it is,
I'm gonna get her on the phone.

427
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,090
- On your phone...
- Oh!

428
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,030
'cause I am her sweet sweet sugar chaddy.

429
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,070
Quiet, I'm on the phone!

430
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,870
Hello. Oh, hey,
miss munroe.

431
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,670
Yeah, it's chaddy...

432
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,240
Uh, chad, ma'am.

433
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,480
I'm just calling to check
on my l... your daughter.

434
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,510
What?!

435
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,920
You... you're kidding me.

436
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,150
Well, okay.
Thanks.

437
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,150
- What is it?
- Is she all right?

438
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,820
We need to go see her...

439
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,420
Right away.

440
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,730
Uh, excuse me, you're blocking my...

441
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,500
<i>sun... hey.</i>

442
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,770
Look at all you guys
going to the beach together.

443
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,600
- Shut it.
- Okay, how did you find me?

444
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,610
- We followed the trail of lies.
- Lies!

445
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,940
Why did you fake being sick, sonny?

446
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,280
I hate to say it, sonny,
but I am on the same page.

447
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,320
- As the randoms on this one.
- Thank you. Yeah.

448
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,380
- We're a super team right now.
- Yeah, chad agrees with us.

449
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,950
Then I guess that means my plan worked.

450
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,420
What plan?

451
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,020
Well, ever since chad and
I started going out,

452
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,860
You guys have been fighting more than ever.

453
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,590
I just thought that if I could get.

454
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,360
My work family and my boyfriend...

455
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,930
We were just on the same page, come on.

456
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,470
If I could get the most
important people in my life.

457
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:38,240
To spend some quality time together,

458
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,440
Then maybe they could get along.

459
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,740
Well, that's a very noble,

460
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:46,080
Beautiful dream, sonny.

461
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,920
But wake up, girlfriend.
This is reality.

462
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,820
Nice try, sonny.
But we're out of here, okay?

463
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,760
There's nothing this guy can do for us.

464
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,090
Randoms.

465
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,830
Well, it's just a day
full of surprises, sonny.

466
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,600
And you were right.

467
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,430
I couldn't handle the list.

468
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,070
I can't believe what you do for those guys.

469
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,140
You're... you're
a pretty amazing friend.

470
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,110
Thanks. And that
was really sweet.

471
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,880
- What you did for me.
- Well...

472
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,640
- Even though I had to
trick you into it. - Whoa.

473
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,550
You didn't trick me into it.

474
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,680
Aww, it's cute that you think that.

475
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,520
But seriously, you have
a lot in common with them.

476
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,290
Really, like what?

477
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,260
Well, you're both easy to trick.

478
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,290
You both have no idea when
you're being tricked.

479
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,730
And you both need a lot of work.

480
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,530
But you're worth it.

481
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,370
Thanks.

482
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,370
You should really put some sunscreen on.

483
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,340
I want your face to stay perfect.

484
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,210
- <i>That's disgusting!</i>
- <i>( All shouting )</i>

485
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,480
Get used to it, randoms!

486
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,510
Here. Call him and end it.

487
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,670
- Are you sure? - Yes.

488
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,590
I am so over him.

489
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,670
Okay.

490
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,550
Hi, yes.I'm calling for tawni hart.

491
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,080
This isn't going to be easy.

492
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,040
But on a scale of one to 10, how do you think it went with tawni?

493
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,040
I know where this is going.

494
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,110
Look, chad, she just doesn't want you doing a break up anymore

495
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,740
no no, but I can change.

496
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,740
Chad, it's over.

497
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,800
You said she'd be gentle.

498
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,470
Ooh. Crier

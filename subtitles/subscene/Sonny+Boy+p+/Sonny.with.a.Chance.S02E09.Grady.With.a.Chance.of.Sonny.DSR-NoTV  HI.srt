00:00:04,425 --> 00:00:07,060
When are they gonna finish
filming this vampire movie?

3
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:09,596
I'm so sick of finding
fangs in my soup.

4
00:00:09,597 --> 00:00:13,400
Oh my gosh, those could be
blake radisson's fangs.

5
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:16,236
I loved him
in the "tridark" movies.

6
00:00:16,237 --> 00:00:18,772
Well, I hope you love him
eating fish sticks because...

7
00:00:18,773 --> 00:00:22,075
He's eating fish sticks.
Oh my gosh, hide me.

8
00:00:22,076 --> 00:00:23,843
Talk to him.

9
00:00:23,844 --> 00:00:25,145
I can't.

10
00:00:25,146 --> 00:00:27,714
It's blake radisson.

11
00:00:27,715 --> 00:00:30,283
Hey, blake!
You're welcome.

12
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:33,420
Hot.
I mean, hi.

13
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:35,488
I mean,
how's it going?

14
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:36,489
This--

15
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,491
I love you as frederick,
by the way.

16
00:00:38,492 --> 00:00:40,293
- See you, frederick.
- Thanks, I--

17
00:00:40,294 --> 00:00:42,562
And by the way,
I love vampires
way more than werewolves.

18
00:00:42,563 --> 00:00:44,931
I mean, what's with
the ah-ooh!

19
00:00:44,932 --> 00:00:47,067
Less howl,
more flirty.

20
00:00:47,068 --> 00:00:49,602
Right.

21
00:00:49,603 --> 00:00:51,738
So did you know

22
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:54,941
That when bats
fly out of a cave,
they always turn left?

23
00:00:54,942 --> 00:00:56,409
I hadn't heard.

24
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,511
Oh, it's true.
Just check "tridarkipedia."

25
00:00:58,512 --> 00:01:01,314
Have you ever
flirted before?

26
00:01:01,315 --> 00:01:03,516
Not with a vampire.

27
00:01:03,517 --> 00:01:08,021
Your fish sticks
look a little dry.

28
00:01:08,022 --> 00:01:09,722
Blargh!

29
00:01:09,723 --> 00:01:12,725
Oh my gosh, blake,
I'm so sorry.

30
00:01:12,726 --> 00:01:14,060
I didn't mean--

31
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:16,596
But it looks good
on you.

32
00:01:16,597 --> 00:01:19,999
Okay, bat leaving
the cave.  Bye.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,434
Go left.

34
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:25,705
( phone ringing )

35
00:01:27,108 --> 00:01:29,709
<i>âª off to the races,
I'm going places âª</i>

36
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,712
<i>âª might be a long shot,

37
00:01:32,713 --> 00:01:37,317

00:01:37,318 --> 00:01:39,686

41
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:49,395

50
00:02:17,057 --> 00:02:18,558
- Anxious?
- Yeah.

51
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:20,560
Me too.
What are you pacing about?

52
00:02:20,561 --> 00:02:23,530
Well, I'm expecting a call
from my brother grant.

53
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:26,366
- Oh.
- Yeah.  You?

54
00:02:26,367 --> 00:02:28,401
I put ketchup
on a vampire.

55
00:02:28,402 --> 00:02:30,703
- Ooh.
- A totally hot vampire.

56
00:02:30,704 --> 00:02:32,105
Oh.

57
00:02:32,106 --> 00:02:34,741
- ( computer bleeping )
- ohh!

58
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:39,212
Don't let grant get to you
like he always does, okay?

59
00:02:39,213 --> 00:02:42,248
You know what?
You're right.

60
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:44,250
Not this time.
I'm feeling good.

61
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:46,452
I'm feeling good.
I'm feeling strong.

62
00:02:46,453 --> 00:02:47,654
Ha ha!

63
00:02:47,655 --> 00:02:49,189
Hello.

64
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:51,457
He-hey, gravy!

65
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:53,626
I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

66
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:55,195
<i>- Well, I mean--
- of course not,</i>

67
00:02:55,196 --> 00:02:56,829
Because that would mean
you had a life.

68
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,832
Grady, don't just take that.
Give it back to him.

69
00:03:01,035 --> 00:03:03,636
No life, huh?

70
00:03:03,637 --> 00:03:06,372
So true.

71
00:03:06,373 --> 00:03:08,074
How can you
not have a life?

72
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:09,475
You're on
a t.V. Show, man.

73
00:03:09,476 --> 00:03:12,879
- Have you seen it yet?
- No.  I have a life,

74
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,481
Filled with girls
and more girls, bro.

75
00:03:15,482 --> 00:03:19,018
But you wouldn't know
about that.

76
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:20,954
I've had girlfriends.

77
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:23,323
Hermione doesn't count.

78
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:26,459
Grady's got no lady.
Grady's got no lady.

79
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,329
Oh, yeah?
Grady's got a lady,

80
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,397
- And you're looking at her.
- What?

81
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:34,334
You mean, you didn't tell
your brother about us?

82
00:03:34,335 --> 00:03:37,937
Uh, well, it's just
it's all so new.

83
00:03:37,938 --> 00:03:42,342
Speaking of new,
the shirt I bought you
looks great on you.

84
00:03:42,343 --> 00:03:44,344
I thought mommy
got you that shirt.

85
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:47,547
Mm-hmm, mommy did.

86
00:03:47,548 --> 00:03:49,515
Bye.

87
00:03:49,516 --> 00:03:52,952
Am I a good friend
or what?  Or what?

88
00:03:52,953 --> 00:03:55,154
A little love up top
right there,
right there.

89
00:03:55,155 --> 00:03:56,689
What did you do?

90
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,292
Grant is flying out
to visit tomorrow.

91
00:03:59,293 --> 00:04:01,194
This is not good.

92
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:03,763
- Oh.
- Yeah, "oh."

93
00:04:03,764 --> 00:04:06,599
'cause when he finds out
you're not really
my girlfriend,

94
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,669
I will never hear
the end of this.

95
00:04:11,138 --> 00:04:13,706
Don't worry, grady.
You know what?

96
00:04:13,707 --> 00:04:16,309
I'm officially
your girlfriend--

97
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,911
Officially
your fake girlfriend.

98
00:04:18,912 --> 00:04:20,613
Oh, really?

99
00:04:20,614 --> 00:04:23,449
Well then,
make me a sandwich.

100
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:26,619
I'm just messing around.

101
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,855
I'll go make you
a sandwich.

102
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:35,161
So look at us

103
00:04:35,162 --> 00:04:38,131
Having breakfast together
without grady and sonny.

104
00:04:38,132 --> 00:04:40,933
Yeah, look at us.

105
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:50,410
For a moment there
I thought we'd have
nothing to talk about.

106
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:53,112
But here we are,

107
00:04:53,113 --> 00:04:54,914
Talking about

108
00:04:54,915 --> 00:04:57,150
How we thought we'd have
nothing to talk about.

109
00:04:57,151 --> 00:04:58,351
That's something
to talk about.

110
00:04:58,352 --> 00:05:01,020
Yeah.
No, it's not.

111
00:05:01,021 --> 00:05:02,588
Yeah, we got nothing.

112
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:04,824
Oh, this could be
something.

113
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:08,494
Oh, hello hello.

114
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:11,397
Are you on the hunt
for a nutritious breakfast?

115
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:14,067
Huh?  Yeah.

116
00:05:14,068 --> 00:05:17,270
Maybe there's one hiding
behind your dignity.

117
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:21,174
Enough.
Mock all you want,

118
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:23,643
But allow me
to introduce you to

119
00:05:23,644 --> 00:05:25,945
The chad dylan cooper
safari bar.

120
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:27,780
It brings out
the beast in you.

121
00:05:27,781 --> 00:05:30,850
Rarr!

122
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:33,186
You have your own
energy bar?

123
00:05:33,187 --> 00:05:34,787
Yes, and more
importantly,

124
00:05:34,788 --> 00:05:37,690
You don't.

125
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:39,892
Oh, and it's good too.

126
00:05:39,893 --> 00:05:42,328
Oh.  Ohh!

127
00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:45,998
A little granola,
nougat--

128
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:49,802
What's that I'm tasting
in the middle?

129
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:52,338
Success.

130
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:55,007
Chew on that, suckas!

131
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:57,377
Ow!

132
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:00,980
Pompous jerk.

133
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:02,982
If grady were here,
we'd be planning

134
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:06,452
A simple but easily-botched
prank on him.

135
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:09,422
Well, guess what.

136
00:06:09,423 --> 00:06:12,358
Tawni is here.
So we're gonna
lose the botch

137
00:06:12,359 --> 00:06:14,861
And kick it up a notch.

138
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:18,331
Oh, I like working
with you already.

139
00:06:18,332 --> 00:06:20,600
Grady never made
our plans rhyme.

140
00:06:20,601 --> 00:06:23,403
Oh, I do it all the time.
See what I did there?

141
00:06:23,404 --> 00:06:25,605
I like it--
the "time-rhyme" thing.

142
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,343
Who is this superhero?

143
00:06:30,344 --> 00:06:34,347
Oh, I know this one.
It's-- it's--

144
00:06:34,348 --> 00:06:36,916
Waterguy?

145
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:39,685
No, aquaman.

146
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:42,422
Aquaman, waterguy--
what's the difference?

147
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:45,758
I don't hate waterguy.

148
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:49,162
Come on, sonny.

149
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:51,431
If my brother's gonna believe
you're my girlfriend,

150
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:53,433
You've got to know
this stuff.

151
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:55,568
Just write it on your hand
if you have to.

152
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:58,838
Well, why don't you
just hit me with some
family questions first?

153
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:01,874
Whoa, family?
We're not moving on
to family

154
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:05,611
Until you know
about my loved ones.

155
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:09,515
Sorry, but this is just like
too much pressure.

156
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:12,251
I think
I need a break.

157
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:14,654
No.

158
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:17,256
- What?
- Are you dumping me?

159
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:21,794
No, I just need
a little fresh air.

160
00:07:21,795 --> 00:07:23,830
Okay.

161
00:07:28,068 --> 00:07:29,669
This is how it starts.

162
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,072
All right, aquaman-- bad.

163
00:07:33,073 --> 00:07:35,475
Iron man-- good.

164
00:07:35,476 --> 00:07:38,878
Narnia-- real.

165
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,114
What does your hand say
about vampires?

166
00:07:42,115 --> 00:07:44,050
( laughs )

167
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:46,085
Let's see...

168
00:07:46,086 --> 00:07:47,987
It says "sweaty."

169
00:07:47,988 --> 00:07:50,423
I mean, no, "sweet."

170
00:07:50,424 --> 00:07:51,991
That was bad.
I mean--

171
00:07:51,992 --> 00:07:54,827
What do you think about
having lunch with me today?

172
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:59,332
Um, let me check the hand
you're not holding.

173
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,835
Ready?

174
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:05,605
Oh, look at that.
It says yes.

175
00:08:05,606 --> 00:08:08,441
Great.
I'll text you the details.

176
00:08:08,442 --> 00:08:11,410
Great.
I'll see you later.

177
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:13,913
- Later.
- ( hisses )

178
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:19,318
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, girlfriend.

179
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,989
My brother just landed
and he wants to haveunch
with me and my lady.

180
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,424
Lunch today?

181
00:08:25,425 --> 00:08:27,727
Thanks, sonny.
This might be

182
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:30,029
The coolest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

183
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,833
( whistling a tune )

184
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:40,373
<i>( dramatic music playing )</i>

185
00:08:55,355 --> 00:08:57,657
<i>Tawni:
Hey!  Seriously!</i>

186
00:09:02,095 --> 00:09:03,896
<i>( music stops )</i>

187
00:09:03,897 --> 00:09:06,899
Just a thought--
maybe your pranks
are easily botched

188
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,535
Because of loud music,
bad choreography

189
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:11,304
And the throwing
of stuff.

190
00:09:11,305 --> 00:09:12,972
That's my style.

191
00:09:12,973 --> 00:09:15,841
Now put the bar
with the fake label
on there.

192
00:09:22,749 --> 00:09:25,885
<i>( chad singing )</i>

193
00:09:25,886 --> 00:09:28,254
âª chad dylan cooper
safari bar âª

194
00:09:28,255 --> 00:09:31,023
âª if you're feeling bad--
jerky chad. âª

195
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:42,101
Huh?

196
00:09:47,874 --> 00:09:50,576
That's weird.
This all fit before.

197
00:09:50,577 --> 00:09:54,447
Dude, we can't
eat this.

198
00:09:54,448 --> 00:09:56,482
Did you even read
the warning label?

199
00:09:56,483 --> 00:09:58,884
No, all I read was
my name on the bar

200
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:01,988
And my name on the check
for the commercial
I'm gonna shoot later.

201
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:04,991
Well, you might want
to take a look.

202
00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:11,631
"warning: Side effects

203
00:10:11,632 --> 00:10:14,867

00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:18,037
And/or body."

205
00:10:18,038 --> 00:10:20,840
Get off my vest.

206
00:10:20,841 --> 00:10:24,143
"as well as intermittent
hearing loss."

207
00:10:24,144 --> 00:10:26,012
You... Shouldn't...

208
00:10:26,013 --> 00:10:28,948
And if you're...
Longer than four hours....

209
00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:30,416
Hospital.

210
00:10:33,253 --> 00:10:35,721
( hums a tune )

211
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:38,124
Where is my brother
already?

212
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,860
Grady, calm down.
It's gonna be okay.

213
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:42,862
Is it, sonny?
Is it?

214
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:46,265
He's gonna see
right through us.

215
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:48,067
Not if we stick
to the plan, okay?

216
00:10:48,068 --> 00:10:50,670
You're gonna break up with me
in front of your brother

217
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:52,538
So you'll look strong

218
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:57,009
And so I can make my date
with blake.

219
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:59,045
You know what?
I'm gonna break up with you

220
00:10:59,046 --> 00:11:01,547
Because I don't like
your singing.

221
00:11:01,548 --> 00:11:04,383
Gravy!

222
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:05,785
What's up, bro?

223
00:11:05,786 --> 00:11:08,521
Hey.
Don't hit me.

224
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:10,890
- I'm not gonna hit you.
- All right.

225
00:11:12,693 --> 00:11:14,860
That's for thinking
I was gonna hit you.

226
00:11:17,197 --> 00:11:19,265
Sorry I'm late.

227
00:11:19,266 --> 00:11:21,801
I was consoling some girl
who was just dumped,

228
00:11:21,802 --> 00:11:25,638
So of course,
got her number!

229
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:27,173
But I'm not gonna
call her,

230
00:11:27,174 --> 00:11:29,608
Because I don't want
to deal with that baggage.

231
00:11:29,609 --> 00:11:33,746
Grant, you're even more
charming in person.

232
00:11:33,747 --> 00:11:37,216
Wow, and you're
even cuter.

233
00:11:37,217 --> 00:11:41,253
So did you win a date-somebody-
out-of-your-league contest?

234
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:42,588
Yeah.

235
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:45,124
Are you kidding me?

236
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,460
He is so in my league.

237
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:51,931
In fact,
I'm out of his league.

238
00:11:52,733 --> 00:11:55,534
Wow, way to go, bro.

239
00:11:55,535 --> 00:11:57,670
Delta nu rules!

240
00:11:59,172 --> 00:12:01,707
Did I mention
he's president
of his fraternity?

241
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,543
Delta nu rules!

242
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,414
- ( phone mooing )
- oh, excuse me.

243
00:12:08,415 --> 00:12:10,416
It's blake.
He's wondering
where I am,

244
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:12,618
- So dump me
when I get back.
- Okay.

245
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:14,754
I'll miss you.
I really will.

246
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:17,022
I don't want to go.
I don't want to go.

247
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,625
You'd better be fast.
I'm getting flustered.

248
00:12:19,626 --> 00:12:21,694
Wow.

249
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:24,063
Mad props, little bro.
Sonny's awesome.

250
00:12:24,064 --> 00:12:26,298
I'm crazy
proud of you.

251
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:28,300
You're proud of me?

252
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:31,370
Totes.

253
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:33,939
And when you two break up--
and trust me,

254
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,776
At some point
you will lose this girl--

255
00:12:36,777 --> 00:12:39,278
Guess who's gonna get
the rebound.

256
00:12:40,313 --> 00:12:41,547
You?

257
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:46,452
As in ulysses s. Grant!

258
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:48,821
Okay, grady, I'm back

259
00:12:48,822 --> 00:12:50,823
From rudely taking
a phone call

260
00:12:50,824 --> 00:12:52,358
In the middle
of our lunch.

261
00:12:52,359 --> 00:12:55,895
I'm sure you have
something to say about that.

262
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:59,198
Uh-huh, I do.
Mm-hmm.

263
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:01,901
I think it's adorable.
And it makes me

264
00:13:01,902 --> 00:13:05,137
Never ever want
to break up with you.

265
00:13:06,673 --> 00:13:08,140
Never?

266
00:13:08,141 --> 00:13:09,942
Ever.

267
00:13:09,943 --> 00:13:13,179
And you can never
ever have her.

268
00:13:25,148 --> 00:13:26,215
What did you do?

269
00:13:26,216 --> 00:13:28,717
We had a plan.
You were supposed to dump me.

270
00:13:28,718 --> 00:13:31,220
Sorry.  I was gonna
break up with you,

271
00:13:31,221 --> 00:13:33,722
But then grant said
that if we ever broke up,

272
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:37,393
He was gonna go after you.
And I couldn't let
that happen.

273
00:13:37,394 --> 00:13:40,162
Well, thank you.
I appreciate that.

274
00:13:40,163 --> 00:13:42,097
But what am I supposed
to do about blake now?

275
00:13:42,098 --> 00:13:44,667
Maybe he can do
dinner instead.

276
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:46,669
Great idea.
I'll text him.

277
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,672
Ha ha ha!
Good news--

278
00:13:49,673 --> 00:13:53,342
I've got a date
with jennifer.

279
00:13:53,343 --> 00:13:56,078
I mean, jessica.

280
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,380
She's really special
to me.

281
00:13:58,381 --> 00:14:00,449
Oh, blake can
do dinner.

282
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,384
Don't make
any dinner plans.

283
00:14:02,385 --> 00:14:05,020
The mitchell brothers are
going on a double date.

284
00:14:05,021 --> 00:14:06,755
Delta nu!

285
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:09,959
Thanks, cousin.

286
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,928
What the delta
am I supposed to do now?

287
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:16,832
You know, I'll just
tell grant

288
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:18,901
That you're pretending
to be my girlfriend.

289
00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:22,071
And then I'll
put my mouth guard in and
take what's coming to me.

290
00:14:22,072 --> 00:14:24,840
Oh, no no.
Just keep it in the case.

291
00:14:24,841 --> 00:14:28,644
We've got to figure out
a reason for you to break up
with me before dinner.

292
00:14:28,645 --> 00:14:31,046
Yeah, but what could
anybody do

293
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:35,017
That would make a person
want to break up with them?

294
00:14:35,018 --> 00:14:37,887
Oh, jackpot.

295
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:46,228
Oh, yeah.
Jackpot.

296
00:14:46,229 --> 00:14:48,898
What do you think
of this?

297
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:52,568
That is disgusting.

298
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:55,771
Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah,
that's the stuff.

299
00:14:55,772 --> 00:14:58,107
( belches )

300
00:14:58,108 --> 00:14:59,275
Oh.

301
00:14:59,276 --> 00:15:01,310
- Seconds.
- Oh.

302
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:03,112
What happened to you?

303
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:08,017
Yeah, sonny,
you are disgusting.

304
00:15:08,018 --> 00:15:12,721
I'm gonna have to rethink
our entire relationship.

305
00:15:12,722 --> 00:15:14,890
Yeah, you are...

306
00:15:14,891 --> 00:15:17,326
- Thinking about
marrying her.
- What?

307
00:15:17,327 --> 00:15:20,462
You hit the jackpot, bro.
You've got a girlfriend

308
00:15:20,463 --> 00:15:22,932
Who can never
get on your case
about being disgusting

309
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:24,934
'cause she's even
more disgusting.

310
00:15:24,935 --> 00:15:27,369
Sonny is gross
and a hottie.

311
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,138
She's a grottie.

312
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:32,975
So I guess this means
I'll be seeing you
at dinner.

313
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,246
He's harder to kill
than a vampire.

314
00:15:37,247 --> 00:15:40,082
You scored!
She's disgusting.

315
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:42,151
Gravy!

316
00:15:46,323 --> 00:15:49,291
- Blake.
- Sonny?

317
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:54,196
I bet you're wondering
why I'm dressed like this.

318
00:15:54,197 --> 00:15:58,033
You're not wearing this
on our date, are you?

319
00:15:58,034 --> 00:16:00,536
'cause buca di fester's
has a dress code.

320
00:16:00,537 --> 00:16:02,538
Yeah, I've heard
about that.

321
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:05,140
It's actually
for a character

322
00:16:05,141 --> 00:16:10,212
On "so random!"
called "gross-out girl."

323
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:12,281
Pretty convincing, huh?

324
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:13,882
Nailed it.

325
00:16:13,883 --> 00:16:16,352
Don't worry
about tonight.

326
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:18,554
I'll be cleaned up
in time for our date.

327
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:20,322
Speaking of tonight,

328
00:16:20,323 --> 00:16:23,025
I was just wondering
if maybe we--

329
00:16:23,026 --> 00:16:25,027
If you're going to push
our date again,

330
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:27,129
Then maybe we should
just cancel it.

331
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,932
No no no,
tonight's perfect.
Tonight's great.

332
00:16:29,933 --> 00:16:32,334
- Cool.
- Cool.

333
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:34,169
( hisses )

334
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,871
Bye.

335
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:41,076
I delta nu it.

336
00:16:43,546 --> 00:16:47,016
Grody, change of plans.

337
00:16:47,017 --> 00:16:49,018
Bros' night out, bro.

338
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:50,819
So call your girlfriend
and tell her

339
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,288
She's free to do
whatever she wants
to do tonight,

340
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:56,558
'cause you and me are
going to buca di fester's.

341
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,161
B-b-b-b-b-bouncing!

342
00:17:01,097 --> 00:17:03,098
Delta nu!

343
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:08,971
All right, everyone.
We got a safar bar
commercial to shoot.

344
00:17:08,972 --> 00:17:12,674
Let's go.
Settle in.
Places places.

345
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:14,676
<i>( bell rings )</i>

346
00:17:14,677 --> 00:17:16,678

00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:20,916
By funhouse vision."

349
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:23,352
Funhouse vision?
What the heck is that?

350
00:17:23,353 --> 00:17:26,121
Oh!

351
00:17:26,122 --> 00:17:29,324
Chad dylan cooper
for the safari bar,
take one.

352
00:17:30,794 --> 00:17:32,161
And action!

353
00:17:33,763 --> 00:17:36,965
Being the greatest
actor of a generation
takes a lot out of you.

354
00:17:36,966 --> 00:17:39,935
So when life bites you,
bite back.

355
00:17:42,705 --> 00:17:46,008
Chad, this is where
you bite the bar.

356
00:17:53,283 --> 00:17:55,284
I can't do it, I can't.
I can't do it.

357
00:17:55,285 --> 00:17:58,220
It's poison,
you hear me?

358
00:17:58,221 --> 00:18:00,389
Celebrity.

359
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:02,424
Funhouse vision?

360
00:18:05,128 --> 00:18:08,330
Awesome.
When did you have time
to change the mirror?

361
00:18:08,331 --> 00:18:11,300
What are you talking about?
I didn't change the mirror.

362
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:13,335
Wha--?

363
00:18:14,804 --> 00:18:17,039
( screaming )

364
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:21,743
Oh, you're good.

365
00:18:25,415 --> 00:18:30,119
Wow, sonny, I have to say,
you clean up well.

366
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,588
Thanks.

367
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:34,857
To soap and water.

368
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,461
So tell me about
the "tridark" series.

369
00:18:40,463 --> 00:18:42,865
Oh, this is great--

370
00:18:42,866 --> 00:18:44,867
You and me at a restaurant
together

371
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:46,702
And you're not
whaling on me

372
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:48,403
Or pointing out
my shortcomings

373
00:18:48,404 --> 00:18:50,272
Or telling me stuff
that makes me feel
like a loser.

374
00:18:50,273 --> 00:18:52,141
Your girlfriend's
cheating on you.

375
00:18:52,142 --> 00:18:54,109
Yeah, stuff like that.

376
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,046
No, your girlfriend
is cheating on you.

377
00:18:57,047 --> 00:18:59,048
That's why I brought
you here.  Look.

378
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:02,017
Oh my gosh.
It's my girlfriend

379
00:19:02,018 --> 00:19:04,487
And blake radisson,

380
00:19:04,488 --> 00:19:08,290
Clearly having
a business dinner.

381
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,793
- Get over there.
- No no.

382
00:19:12,629 --> 00:19:15,564
- Hey, sonny.
- Grady.

383
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:18,033
What are you
doing here?

384
00:19:18,034 --> 00:19:20,603
What are you
waiting for, bro?
She's your girlfriend.

385
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:23,439
Mess him up good.

386
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,009
Wait, girlfriend?
Is that true?

387
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:30,880
- It's complicated.
- Labels-- friend, girlfriend

388
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:33,983
All right!
Once again you punk out

389
00:19:33,984 --> 00:19:36,552
And I've got to step in
to protect the mitchell name.

390
00:19:36,553 --> 00:19:39,054
No no, stop stop.
Enough.

391
00:19:42,492 --> 00:19:44,527
Sonny is not
my girlfriend.

392
00:19:44,528 --> 00:19:47,530
So you were
lying to me?

393
00:19:47,531 --> 00:19:49,899
Yes, we were pretending
to be a couple

394
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,901
So you'd stop
giving me grief

395
00:19:51,902 --> 00:19:54,069
About not having
a girlfriend.

396
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:59,074
Sonny, go get yourself
a vampire.

397
00:19:59,075 --> 00:20:01,577
Thanks, grady.

398
00:20:01,578 --> 00:20:03,712
Okey-dokey, since
everything's cleared up,

399
00:20:03,713 --> 00:20:06,315
I am single
and totally available.

400
00:20:06,316 --> 00:20:08,784
Of course you are.
A girl like you

401
00:20:08,785 --> 00:20:12,087
Would never date
a dork like that.

402
00:20:12,088 --> 00:20:13,556
Excuse me?

403
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:15,825
I'm just saying
we're good here.

404
00:20:15,826 --> 00:20:19,028
And I'm just saying
we're done here.

405
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:21,864
Excuse me?

406
00:20:21,865 --> 00:20:24,433
Yeah, if being sweet,
kind and sensitive

407
00:20:24,434 --> 00:20:26,435
Makes you a dork,
then yes,

408
00:20:26,436 --> 00:20:28,137
Grady is the dorkiest
dork there is.

409
00:20:28,138 --> 00:20:32,041
But I'd rather date a dork
over a jerk any day.

410
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:34,743
Thanks, sonny.
( clears throat )

411
00:20:34,744 --> 00:20:36,745
Now I believe the lady

412
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:39,381
Just gave you
your flying papers.

413
00:20:39,382 --> 00:20:41,717
( hisses )

414
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,688
It works better when
I've got the makeup on

415
00:20:45,689 --> 00:20:47,957
And the script says
that you're scared.

416
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:51,627
( hisses )

417
00:20:53,897 --> 00:20:58,834
So, grant, I don't
really have a girlfriend.

418
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:01,103
Let the humiliation begin.

419
00:21:01,104 --> 00:21:03,305
- You're a lucky man.
- Oh, come on!

420
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:07,209
Wait, what?

421
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,212
I've had a million
girlfriends...

422
00:21:10,213 --> 00:21:12,882
Eww.

423
00:21:12,883 --> 00:21:16,819
But I've never had
a friend who's a girl.

424
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,455
Actually, I've never had
a friend like sonny
at all--

425
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:21,757
Someone who always
has your back.

426
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:24,827
You mean, kind of
like a brother?

427
00:21:24,828 --> 00:21:26,829
Yeah.

428
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,831
Yeah, like a brother.

429
00:21:28,832 --> 00:21:31,567
You know,
all these years

430
00:21:31,568 --> 00:21:33,936
I thought you should be
more like me,

431
00:21:33,937 --> 00:21:36,572
But maybe I should be
a little more like you.

432
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,879
Starting right now
I will always be here
for you.

433
00:21:45,215 --> 00:21:47,216
Nice!

434
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:50,686
Delta nu!

435
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:54,657
I like the new grant.

436
00:21:54,658 --> 00:21:56,659
I like the new grady.

437
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,560
Hey, while we're here,
want to get a bite to eat?

438
00:21:58,561 --> 00:22:00,562
- Yeah.
- Great.

439
00:22:00,563 --> 00:22:03,232
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

440
00:22:03,233 --> 00:22:05,234
You're welcome.

441
00:22:08,538 --> 00:22:10,673
- So...
- No.

442
00:22:10,674 --> 00:22:12,908
To friendship!

443
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:24,201
- Hey.
- Hey.

444
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,540
How was your weekend?

445
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:34,111
Oh, good.
Yeah, it was good.

446
00:22:34,112 --> 00:22:38,315
- How was yours?
- Good.

447
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:40,684
I heard
you dated sonny.

448
00:22:40,685 --> 00:22:42,686
Oh, sorta.

449
00:22:42,687 --> 00:22:45,656
Heard you pranked
with tawni.

450
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:50,160
Yeah, a little.

451
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,159
- Was she better than me?
- Was she better than me?

452
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,130
Wait, don't answer that.

453

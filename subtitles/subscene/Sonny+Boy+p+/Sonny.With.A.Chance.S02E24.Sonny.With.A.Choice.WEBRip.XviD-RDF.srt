1
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:10,820
I can't believe this.
I've never seen a game seven.

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,690
- Go into double overtime.
- Get it to lebron! Get it to lebron!

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,190
Five, four, three...

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,330
To channel 2.

5
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,900
What are you doing?!

6
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,240
They're announcing the
tween choice nominations.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,550
Finally, the nominees
for best tween show are...

8
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,220
"skateboarding boyz,"

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,360
"so you're thinkin'
you're Lincoln?"

10
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,030
"mackenzie falls,"

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,230
And last but not least...

12
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,230
Come on, come on, come on.

13
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,040
..."so random!"

14
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,900
no way, yes!

15
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,240
Why are you guys groaning?

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,910
We just got nominated for best tween show.
This is huge.

17
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,250
No, this is just another opportunity
for us to lose to "mackenzie falls."

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,050
Mm-hmm,
that's right, Sonny.

19
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,760
This'll be our sixth year in
a row losing to "mac falls."

20
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,690
Well, you know what?
This is my first time.

21
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,560
Being nominated, so I'd like to enjoy it.

22
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,800
I'm going to enjoy it
tawni-style,

23
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,530
With a special outfit that says,
"even though I lost,

24
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,770
Look at me, look at me,
not kristen Stewart!"

25
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,600
And I'm working on a special.

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,510
Congratulatory prank for "mac falls"

27
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,570
That involves eggs, three types of dung.

28
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,280
And an industrial vacuum cleaner.

29
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,310
Three types of dung?!

30
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,380
Okay, you know what?
Stop right there!

31
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,620
Are we really the kind
of people that would resort.

32
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:41,320
- To petty pranks out of jealousy?
- Three types of dung!

33
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,720
Okay, we are, but look,
this year win or lose...

34
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,460
- Lose! -... We're gonna
be gracious about it.

35
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,160
Why should we? "Mackenzie falls"
is never gracious about it.

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,900
Chad is a totally changed person
since we started dating.

37
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,840
- This year, win or lose...
- Lose!

38
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,640
- Or win!
- Or lose!

39
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,510
... It's gonna be totally different
with "mackenzie falls."

40
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,350
If a boyfriend and a girlfriend can compete
civilly, then so can our two shows.

41
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,480
And just to be sure, I'm gonna go
talk to him about it right now.

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,750
No pranks!

43
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,420
What am I supposed to do
with 4,000 poached eggs?

44
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,320

62
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,150
And this sixth straight win
for "mackenzie falls"...

63
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,990
No no no, huh-uh.
You know what?

64
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,390
Let me rehearse that
one more time. Sorry.

65
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,060
And this sixth straight win
for "mackenzie falls"

66
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,060
Would not have been possible without my...

67
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,700
My passion, my dedication,

68
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,200
My creativity.

69
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,030
Am I leaving anything out?

70
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,900
I'm sorry, are you on our show?

71
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,210
Oh hey, "mac falls."

72
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,470
So "so random!" wanted me to
bring over a little something.

73
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,210
To congratulate you guys
on your nomination.

74
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,480
- It's gonna blow!
- Everyone duck!

75
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,350
Oh my gosh, come on, guys, really?

76
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,880
This is a real muffin basket, not a prank.

77
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,120
"so random!" has decided
to take the high road.

78
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,420
Well, of course <i>I</i> trust you.

79
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,460
But these guys and what's-her-face
are gonna need some proof.

80
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,060
- Eat it.
- What?

81
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,170
Eat it.
Come on, Sonny.

82
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,630
You are not shoving this in my face.
Chad, you are ridiculous.

83
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,770
So what if we're up for the same award?
We should be thrilled.

84
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,070
Why does it have to be about
winning or losing?

85
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,210
- Because we like winning.
- And more importantly we like you losing...

86
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,450
To us.

87
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,280
No no no no.

88
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,980
Guys, you know, maybe there's.

89
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,590
Something to this high-road thing
milady's yammering on about.

90
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,920
You know what?
New year, new attitude.

91
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,160
Everyone grab a muffin.

92
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,690
Except you.
I don't know who you are.

93
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,330
To "mac falls"
and "so random!"

94
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,340
No matter who wins best show, we
promise not to rub it in your face.

95
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,970
- That's your high road?
- Pretty good, huh?

96
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:50,240
No, give me my muffins back.
Give them back.

97
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,480
- Fine.
- I'm taking them back.

98
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,590
Except maybe I'll just leave this one.

99
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,630
Really?
Awesome.

100
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:12,200
We'd be thrilled
to do it. Thanks.

101
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,100
- Dude.
- Hmm?

102
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,710
We get to present the tween choice
award for best sound effect.

103
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,380
- This is big.
- Oh yeah, huge!

104
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,310
So... so it's an award
for sound effects, right?

105
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,150
- Yeah yeah.
- How about

106
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,190
I do my impression of the sound.

107
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,850
Of a small bird laying a big egg?

108
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,490
Bok-kkk!

109
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,330
Come on, dude, that's not funny.

110
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,630
- We're presenters...
- Yeah?

111
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:45,040
...At "the tween
choice awards."

112
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,870
- Yeah.
- We have to be witty.

113
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:49,370
Like you say, "we're presenting.

114
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,540
The award for best
sound effects."

115
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,510
And I say,
"I like the sound of that."

116
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,520
And then you say,
"I hear ya."

117
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,590
Yeah, and then we'll both hear silence,
because that is not funny at all!

118
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,490
Okay okay, how do we settle this?

119
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:09,730
This may be the most important
decision of our careers.

120
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,070
We have to figure this out like adults.

121
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,870
Boom!

122
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,410
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war!

123
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,680
Hello, I'm Ryan loughlin, this year's
host of "the tween choice awards,"

124
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,880
Coming to you live from the red carpet.

125
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,590
It is a veritable "who's who"

126
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,460
Of who can't stay out
past 10:00.

127
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,260
Oh look,
it's "so random!"'s

128
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,830
Nico Harris and Grady Mitchell...

129
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,800
Standing in front of two people you
would much rather see me interview.

130
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:50,570
Sonny, Chad, quick word!

131
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,140
We of course are joined now.

132
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:55,870
By tonight's hottest Hollywood couple.

133
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,480
And, Sonny, this is your
very first red carpet.

134
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:02,310
Sixth consecutive battle between "so random!
" and "mackenzie falls,"

135
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,250
But our first one between
boyfriend and girlfriend.

136
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,720
- Your thoughts? - Actually, you
know, we don't see it as a battle.

137
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,160
It's just an honor to be nominated.

138
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,660
Which is something the loser always says.

139
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,230
- Am I right, Chad?
- Ryan, there are no losers.

140
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,460
Aww, that's right, Chad.

141
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,000
Tonight we're taking the high road, okay?

142
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,410
- Isn't that right, sweetie?
- Absolutely... high road.

143
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,640
High road.

144
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,750
We're gonna win.
What?

145
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,410
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. You look great, wow.

146
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:40,520
...Meal or no meal dancers.

147
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,720
I still think we should do my "bok" joke.

148
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:47,290
Dude, I won the thumb-war
contest fair and square.

149
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,100
And now presenting the award
for best sound effects,

150
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,810
Give it up for Grady Mitchell
and Nico Harris.

151
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,110
- Ahh.
- Mmm.

152
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,010
- Sound effects...
- Mmm.

153
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,180
I like the sound...

154
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,990
Of that.
Oh...

155
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,690
I hear ya, buddy.

156
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,790
You hear that?
Nothing. Nothing!

157
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:21,500
You know another sound I like?

158
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,830
- What?
- The sound a small bird makes.

159
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,640
When it's laying a big egg.

160
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,040
Bok!

161
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,740
Bok bok!

162
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,310
And the nominees are...

163
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:42,720
One more time for the best
adult cast playing tweens:

164
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,690
"glee."

165
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,590
I can't believe you stole my joke.

166
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,230
But we were dying out there.

167
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,430
Oh, you're lucky you're
not dying right here!

168
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:57,670
Am I right, lincolns, huh?

169
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,900
Coming up after this commercial break,

170
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,170
It's the one you've been waiting for...

171
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,770
Best tween show.

172
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,880
It's so exciting.
I'm so nervous.

173
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,380
Aw, you first timers are so cute.

174
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,720
- Hey, good luck.
- Good luck.

175
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,760
Welcome back.
Well, I think we all know.

176
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,890
Who's going to win tonight's
final award for best tween show,

177
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,730
<i>So let's get right to it.</i>

178
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:32,870
And the choicey goes to

179
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,540
Mac... Aroni and cheese,

180
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,610
It's "so random!"

181
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,010
<i>What?</i>

182
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,390
Well well well.

183
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:02,130
Oh gosh, you know, I have something
that I have been waiting to say.

184
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,800
For five years.

185
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:07,300
To my friends at "mackenzie falls"...

186
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,970
- Ahem... high road.
- Ahem.

187
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,810
To my friends at "mackenzie falls"...

188
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,510
In your face, "mackenzie falls"!

189
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,250
Yeah! Oh yeah,
in your face!

190
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,480
We won and you thought
we'd lose, but guess what?

191
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,250
We won, Whoo!

192
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,690
Uh, what I meant to say.

193
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,860
<i>Was...</i>

194
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,860
Thank you.

195
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,400
Oh, thank you, thank you.

196
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:47,200
Be sure to get the good side of my beak.

197
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,140
Guys, guys, quick word with the winner.

198
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,610
Um, could you...
could you hold this?

199
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,080
- I gotta go talk to Chad.
- Yes I can.

200
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,250
Hey look,

201
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,620
I'm really sorry about my stupid speech.

202
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:05,420
I was just excited and I got
caught up in the moment.

203
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,960
- Are you okay?
- Never better.

204
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,260
I can't wait for "the tween
choice awards" to begin.

205
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,430
Hey, you look great. The night's young,
nothing horrible's happened yet,

206
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,600
Whoo!

207
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,330
Um, Chad, the show's over.

208
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,270
- "so random!" won.
- That's crazy talk.

209
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,010
And my watch says it's 5:00.
You look great,

210
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,110
The night's young and nothing
horrible's happened yet.

211
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:32,780
Okay, he's in shock.

212
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,080
We are all in shock, Sonny.

213
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,450
You have just pulled off the biggest upset.

214
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,820
In tween choice history.

215
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,420
Hey, Ryan, buddy,

216
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,590
Hate to cut this short, but, uh,

217
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,190
According to my watch, we're
gonna be late for the show.

218
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,330
- What show? - He's talking
about the after-show party.

219
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,670
Where I'll thank him again
for not being mad at me.

220
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,370
Over my stupid little speech.

221
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,870
Speech? Why would you do a speech
before the show even begins?

222
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,280
Crazy talk, right?

223
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,280
Okay, you know what?
Let's get you home for a little hot cocoa.

224
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:05,880
I like cocoa.

225
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,780
More like cuckoo.

226
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,450
For "the tween choice awards,"
I'm Ryan loughlin.

227
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,420
Heading home.

228
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,200
How did I come up with "bok"?

229
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,730
How do you explain comedy?
Who knows where this stuff comes from?

230
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:26,670
Who knows where this stuff comes from?

231
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,410
Who knows where this stuff comes from?

232
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,840
I do, but apparently I'm the only one!

233
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,540
Grady!
Grady, wait!

234
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,010
Grady, Grady!
I made a mistake.

235
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,810
Oh no no no no,

236
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,150
See, a mistake is, "oh, I'm sorry, sir.

237
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,220
I charged you twice
for that action figure."

238
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,560
A mistake is, "oh, we're the Titanic.
That iceberg will move for us."

239
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,930
But what you did was much much worse.

240
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,590
And I know the Titanic was a tragedy,

241
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,760
But I was just exaggerating
to make a point.

242
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,370
But still!
What you did.

243
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,930
Was much much worse.

244
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,440
Much worse!

245
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,650
And just like the Captain of the Titanic,

246
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,120
I did not see that coming.

247
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,190
Look at us!
Sitting at the fancy table,

248
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,930
Eating fancy food.

249
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,900
Yeah, and look at "mackenzie
falls" eating loser food.

250
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,740
Losers!

251
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:41,740
You sure you don't want to sit with
your friends at the winners' table?

252
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,540
Oh sure.
Come on, join us.

253
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,380
Sonny, the table is for a winner like you,

254
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,710
- Not a...
- Loser!

255
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,820
Hilarious...
talking lobsters.

256
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,220
Chad, look, I can't not sit with my boyfriend.
That would be weird.

257
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,990
I can't sit at the winner's
table... that would be weird.

258
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:02,560
Sonny, I know you're new at this, but...

259
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,100
- This is your moment, enjoy it.
- I am, Chad.

260
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,100
I just don't want to
flaunt it in front of you.

261
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,740
Oh wow,
it's Mr. Condor.

262
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,670
Heh heh, head of the studio
calling to congratulate you,

263
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,810
Not me.

264
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,810
Oh, Chad, I can't answer
this in front of you.

265
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,950
- I just... I feel bad.
- Answer it! Go!

266
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,150
Okay.

267
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,990
Hello?

268
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,920
Hello, sir.
Hi, yes, sir.

269
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,660
It's Mr. Condor, sir.

270
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:33,190
How's it going?
Oh, thank you so much.

271
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,230
Yes, I am thrilled.

272
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,930
You wanna hear me say it?

273
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,870
Right now?

274
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,470
In your face,
"mackenzie falls."

275
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,170
You know, Chad is standing right here
and I'm sure you want to say hi.

276
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,210
H-hello?
Hello?

277
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,810
You know, I think he was going
through a tunnel or something.

278
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,280
- Yes.
- Yeah.

279
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,380
Look, Chad, are you okay?

280
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,050
I'm fine! Okay?
I'm... I'm fine.

281
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:04,890
Why wouldn't I be fine when they're
covering up my picture with yours?

282
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,460
Hey, Chad,

283
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,500
Don't look directly
into the "sonny."

284
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,330
Look, Chad, clearly you're having trouble.

285
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,370
Dealing with the fact
that "so random!" won.

286
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,310
I know. I'm just...
I'm not used to this.

287
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:25,180
Losing, my picture being covered
up, condor being in a tunnel...

288
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:28,080
Who am I kidding?
He wasn't in a tunnel, I'm in a tunnel.

289
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,910
It's dark in here, Sonny!

290
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,550
Well, you better climb on out of there,

291
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,720
Because if we're gonna be
together you have to get used.

292
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,720
To me being in the spotlight sometimes.

293
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,760
- I hope to win a lot of awards.
- Exactly how many?

294
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,960
Well, I don't know!
A lot, I hope.

295
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,700
You know what?
We're gonna get back to normal.

296
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:53,870
Wait, we're...
we're not normal?

297
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,100
- I'm gonna fix this.
- Fix what?

298
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,870
You and me, we're gonna be good.
You will see.

299
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,540
- All right.
- I'm good,

300
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,250
We're good,
it's all good. Yeah!

301
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,250
He's good.
We're good. I'm good.

302
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,620
- How's the lobster?
- It's good.

303
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,530
This is so cool.

304
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,100
Look at all this stuff people
sent to congratulate me.

305
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,970
"dear tawni"... oh.

306
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,240
"congratulations from the entire
male cast of 'twilight.'"

307
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,180
- Ah.
- What? Let me see that.

308
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,580
"dear 'so random!'
congratulations.

309
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:40,120
From the condor studios
custodial staff."

310
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:44,120
Okay, if that's how you want to read it...

311
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,830
Hey, Grady, this one's for you.

312
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,130
Oh really?

313
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,640
"Grady Mitchell wrote the bird joke."

314
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,810
Dude, you rock and 'bok.'.

315
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,140
"Your friend Nico."

316
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,740
Wow, hey.

317
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,610
You took out this big ad to apologize?

318
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:11,280
Your joke, man, you deserve the credit.

319
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,180
Hey, you do realize
you spelled "bok" wrong?

320
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,190
But I spelled "friend" right.

321
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,920
Actually you did not.

322
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,660
But, um, you know,

323
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,460
It's the thought that counts
and not the spelling.

324
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,030
But I spelled "grady" right.

325
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,000
Come here, buddy!

326
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,010
Hey, what's up, randoms?
How are we enjoying this fine day?

327
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,480
- Oh hey there, Chad Dylan chipper.
- Oh, that I am, that I am.

328
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,350
- I figured out how to solve our
little problem. - Oh, great.

329
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:44,220
- Hey guys, could you give us
like five minutes? - Sure.

330
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,520
Who wants to take a taxi ride to see
where they make Chad park his car now?

331
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,290
It's funny 'cause it's true.

332
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,960
Wow, you're being an awfully good sport.

333
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,630
Well, there's no reason not to be.

334
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:05,670
See, I've been thinking
about what you said about how

335
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,140
I was letting "so random!"'s
win get between us.

336
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,340
And I wanted to fix that.

337
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,740
See, I knew you'd get past this.

338
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,380
Well, I had to...
for us.

339
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,810
Gosh, it just feels so good
to hear that coming from you.

340
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,750
You know, some silly award
shouldn't get between us.

341
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,520
I totally agree.
So I ordered.

342
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,490
A recount of the votes for best tween show.

343
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,220
You did what now?

344
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,290
I ordered a recount.
Oh, great news... "so random!" lost.

345
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,830
- I can't believe this.
- What, that you lost?

346
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,600
Oh, don't worry about it.

347
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,730
You'll get used to it.
I did.

348
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:43,910
No, you didn't.
You ordered a recount, Chad.

349
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,740
Why would you even think about doing that?

350
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:50,010
You felt weird about winning,
I felt weird about losing.

351
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,280
And now, thanks to me, we don't
have to feel weird anymore.

352
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,920
But you do have a very weird
look on your face.

353
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,190
It's called disappointment, Chad.

354
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,590
You were so miserable that you weren't
the center of attention for one day.

355
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,630
That you went out and ordered a recount?

356
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,270
Whoa, okay. I just wanted
things to go back to normal.

357
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,430
- Like I promised.
- Normal?!

358
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,870
Oh, you mean the normal where you
always win and I always lose?

359
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,970
I don't like that normal!

360
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:22,380
Boyfriends and girlfriends are
supposed to support each other.

361
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,280
Root for each other.
I can't be in a relationship with someone.

362
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,750
- Who always puts himself first.
- Whoa, I did this for us, okay?

363
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,750
No, Chad.

364
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,190
The only us there is now is
between you and this award.

365
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,460
I hope you two will be very happy together.

366
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,630
I'm sorry, are you breaking up with me?

367
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,670
'cause I thought I was helping.

368
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,970
That's the worst part about it.

369
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,310
Goodbye, Chad.

370
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,680
- Sonny, don't do this...
- No, just go.

371
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:58,520
- But I... - Chad, there are
no second chances this time.

372
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,950
I'm sorry.

373
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:05,290
You won the recount, but you lost me.

374
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,190
I know you guys are up there.

375
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,170
I'm sorry we lost.

376
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,370
- I don't care about that right now.
- Yeah, none of us do.

377
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,140
Tomorrow we will. Tomorrow I'll be
perfecting my "chad is dead to me" glare.

378
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,140
And we'll be painting
mustaches on Chad's posters.

379
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,880
Yes, and a certain someone
Dylan Cooper will be hairless.

380
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,650
But right now.

381
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,920
What we care about is you.

382
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,890
Thanks, guys.

383
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,160
You know, we could turn back the clock.

384
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,770
And pretend like nothing
horrible has happened yet.

385
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,400
And we're still winners!

386
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,570
I appreciate that, but...

387
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,080
Actually I'd rather not
turn back the clock.

388
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,580
I'm fine right here.

389
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,610
Awwww.

390
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,320
And the nominees for best impression of my impression are.

391
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,320
- Nico Harris...
- Bok-kk!

392
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,590
- ...Tawni Hart...
- Brawk!

393
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:51,460
- ...Sonny Munroe...
- Bawkkkk.

394
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:55,760
- ... And Zora Lancaster.
- Bwok.

395
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,180
And the winner is...

396
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,890
- Chad Dylan Cooper?
- Yeah Whoo.

397
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,350
No. This is such a...

398
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,540
Bok, suckers.

399
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,300
- Bok-kkk.
- Bo-oook!

400
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,520
- I want a recount.
- Oh!

401
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,920

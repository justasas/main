1
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,726
Hi.

2
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,062
My name's Jimmy Livingston.

3
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:22,648
My mom says when I was born...

4
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,484
I came gift-wrapped
from Heaven.

5
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,361
Aaah!

6
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:34,868
Whoa! Whoa!

7
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,996
Well,
I guess this is growing up

8
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,666
My first memories
are kind of hazy.

9
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,002
All I remember is
a place with white walls...

10
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:47,130
bright lights,
and a gigantic bird.

11
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:51,844
I was there because I was born
with no immunities.

12
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,221
A single germ could kill me.

13
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:58,600
But when I was four,
my mom took me home...

14
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,645
to beautiful
Palmdale, California.

15
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,816
Mom helped me
make friends right away.

16
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:10,279
Let's go.

17
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,531
Get him in!

18
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,288
Our house was enormous
like a castle...

19
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,875
and for the first time,
I felt completely free.

20
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,293
There.

21
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:30,424
Now you're safe from
that evil, filthy world.

22
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,510
You're home, Jimmy!

23
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:39,224
And you'll never, ever, ever
have to go out there again.

24
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,284
Look at that.

25
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:59,494
Look what Mommy made for Jimmy.

26
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,418
I had a big room
with my own bed...

27
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,753
Lots of toys...

28
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,631
and two pairs
of retractable arms.

29
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:14,092
"And the prince climbed to
the top of the tower and said...

30
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,469
'Come with me...

31
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,137
and we'll live
happily ever after.'

32
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:22,142
"And Rapunzel left
her plastic bubble and died."

33
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,269
The End.

34
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,688
Those evil doctors.

35
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:32,528
Nobody's gonna get any germs
on my little boy now.

36
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,655
You'll always stay pure.

37
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,240
Won't you, Jimmy?

38
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:42,371
Jimmy! Breakfie!

39
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,747
I had my reading.

40
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,500
I wish they had more than
one magazine in the world, Mom.

41
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:48,043
So do l, dear.

42
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,379
My favorite TV show,
"Land of the Lost. "

43
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,256
I wish TVs had more
than one channel, Mom.

44
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,049
So do l, dear.

45
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:55,551
And I had
the best teacher...

46
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,010
in the whole, wide world.

47
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,053
And then the Indians...

48
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,930
decided to move
to the reservations...

49
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,265
where they
could open casinos...

50
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,891
and sell
tax-free cigarettes...

51
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,060
and stay out of
the white man's way.

52
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,729
Another A-plus.

53
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,607
The neighborhood kids always
wanted to hang at my house.

54
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,984
Lives in a bubble,
smells like poop

55
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:14,403
Bubble boy, bubble boy

56
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,116
Get out of here,
you little buggers! Go on!

57
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,409
But I liked
to hang with my dad.

58
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,202
Holy mother of shit, Morton!

59
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:24,079
Are you trying to kill
him with that thing?

60
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,836
Jimmy, lunchie.

61
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,550

Suppertime was the best.

62
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,468
Nothing could beat Mom's
homemade, vitamin-rich...

63
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,138
soy-based, germ-free,
fat-free fiber cookies.

64
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,932
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

65
00:03:45,184 --> 00:03:47,561
I grew up
like any other kid.

66
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:49,479
At 16,
I didn't get a car...

67
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,274
but I did get an electrical
rock-music guitar!

68
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:55,819
I can't
believe the things I found

69
00:03:55,861 --> 00:03:59,406
I need to find my way

70
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,450
I'm lost, I'm lost

71
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,244
I do believe I'm living

72
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:05,913
In the Land

73
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,165
Of the Lost

74
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,960
I'm living in the Land

75
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,714
Living in the Land

76
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,468
Living in the Land

77
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,678
Of the Lost

78
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,514
I was so happy.

79
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,849
I had everything
a boy could ever want.

80
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,394
Until...

81
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,189
Chloe.

82
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,987
"And then Pinocchio came out
of his plastic bubble...

83
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,365
"touched the filthy little
whore next door and died."

84
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,367
The End.

85
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,035
Ooh, baby

86
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,041
Ahh

87
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,376
Oh, yeah

88
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,711

Over the next few years...

89
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:57,589
I washed my window a lot.

90
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,218
Oh, my

91
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,012
Something
was happening to me.

92
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,430
But I didn't know what.

93
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:12,896
Mom!

94
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:15,440
-Jimmy! What's the matter?
-Mom!

95
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,733
Are you all right?

96
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,610
-What is it?
-Oh! Oh, my God!

97
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,611
Ow!

98
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,905
Don't touch it! Hands off!

99
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,907
Now, just relax,
don't get upset.

100
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:24,908
It hurts!

101
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,951
Just do what
I tell your father--

102
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,578
just say the pledge
of allegiance...

103
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,247
until it goes away.
Come on!

104
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:32,416
I pledge allegiance
to the flag...

105
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,084
of the United States
of America...

106
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:35,377
and to the republic
for which it stands...

107
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,212
one nation under God,
indivisible...

108
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,548
with liberty and justice
for all.

109
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,801
I pledge allegiance
to the flag...

110
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,052
of the United States
of America...

111
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,388
and to the republic
for which it stands...

112
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,057
one nation under God...

113
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,268
Thanks, Mom.

114
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,063
Can't touch this

115
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,525
Can't touch this...

116
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,158
Dude!

117
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,868
You live next door
to the bubble boy.

118
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,536
Know what I heard?

119
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,830
The only thing he can drink
is his own urine.

120
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,665
True story. Swear to God.

121
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,459
I heard the same thing, man.
It's gross.

122
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:17,794
Then what did he drink
to make the urine?

123
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,380
Well, it would...

124
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,299
Tell her.

125
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,675
Shotgun!

126
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,055
He's not a monster, you guys.

127
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,556
He's just a boy in a bubble.

128
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:33,143
I am not a monster.
I'm a human being.

129
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,479
-Bye, Lisa.
-Bye, Chloe.

130
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:37,105
I wish I was the boy
in her bubble.

131
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,899
Oh, yeah!

132
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:43,028
Let's hit the arcade.

133
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,795
Hi, Mr. Livingston?

134
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:02,297
I'm Chloe.
I live...next door.

135
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,113
Hyah!

136
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,266
Oh, my gosh!

137
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,851
-What?
-Are you OK?

138
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:58,687
What?
Wait, no, no, no.

139
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,439
I was just playing.

140
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,024
I was just playing.

141
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:06,320
Mayday! You know, that.

142
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,780
Oh.

143
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,617
Ahem.

144
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,785
Was that Pakuni
you were speaking?

145
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,913
From "Land of the Lost"?

146
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,499
I love "Land of the Lost."

147
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,666
I love you, too.

148
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:23,003
It! It, too.
I love it, too.

149
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,715
-I'm Jimmy.
-I'm--

150
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:28,342
Chloe, the whore next door.

151
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,718
What?

152
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,762
Where did you hear that?

153
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,765
My mom.
She teaches me everything.

154
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,975
Well, really she got it wrong.

155
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,062
I'm actually more of a bitch
than a whore.

156
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:43,565
A bitch. Oh, yeah.

157
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:46,568
A bitch.
Absolutely, a bitch.

158
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:51,740
Yeah.

159
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:53,242
You play guitar?

160
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:56,203
Oh, yeah!

161
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,871
Do you wanna try it?

162
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,540
Oh, no, I don't know how.

163
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,916
I could teach you.

164
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,334
Right now.

165
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,962
I can't right now.

166
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,382
I should go.

167
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,890
How about tomorrow?

168
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:19,268
Oh, jeez, I don't know.

169
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,771
I don't know, bitch.
I got a lot to do.

170
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:25,941
See you tomorrow. Bye.

171
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:32,114
She's certainly proud of
those boobies, isn't she?

172
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,243
Something tells me she's not...

173
00:09:36,285 --> 00:09:38,954
the kind of friend
Jesus would pick, Jimmy.

174
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,623
When I look

175
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:45,127
All a--round

176
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,503
Oh, I suck.

177
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:48,922
No, no. Come here.

178
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,219
You have to press harder.

179
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,762
-OK.
-Harder. Here.

180
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:59,600
-Like...
-Now go. Harder.

181
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:02,144
When I look

182
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:06,023
All around

183
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,816
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America

184
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,234
and to the republic
for which it stands...

185
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,402
one nation under God...

186
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,863
Everything OK?

187
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,406
Yeah. Let's go.

188
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:15,991

Wouldn't it be nice

189
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,993
If we were older

190
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:21,663
And we wouldn't have
to wait so long

191
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:25,501
And wouldn't it be nice
to live together

192
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:30,464
In the kind of world
where we belong

193
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:34,468
I know it's gonna make it
that much better

194
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:36,094
When we can say good night...

195
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:38,347
Trick or treat!

196
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,182
Smell my feet!

197
00:10:40,224 --> 00:10:42,768
Oh, hey!

198
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,312
Aah!

199
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:48,815
In the morning
when the day is new...

200
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:55,989
It's Bubble Guinea.

201
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,159
Oh, my God!

202
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,994
Hi, Bubble Guinea.

203
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,248
Jimmy!

204
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:08,043
Ow! Ah!

205
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,838
Stupid gutter.

206
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:16,093
Jimmy! Ah! Ouch.

207
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,762
Jimmy. Ahh. Hello.

208
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:19,763
Chloe?

209
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:22,808
Yeah. Bubble Boy!

210
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,810
What about your party?

211
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:28,605
Jimmy, you have to wish me
happy birthday.

212
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,607
What about your party?

213
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:33,068
Uhh, the party.

214
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,570
I'll show you a party.

215
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:36,154
Come here.

216
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,115
-Don't be shy.
-Huh?

217
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,741
Come here.

218
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,577
My mom's asleep.

219
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,453
Don't you wanna give me
a birthday kiss?

220
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:46,582
Chloe. Heh heh. Shh.

221
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,625
Shh.

222
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:52,254
Whoa! Oh, Chloe!

223
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,339

I hate this stupid bubble.

224
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,966
I got everything
I wanted for my birthday...

225
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,593
except you, Jimmy.

226
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,094
That's why I'm coming in.

227
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:01,597
Chloe, wait! Whoa, whoa.

228
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:05,601
Don't worry.
You can decontaminate me.

229
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,478
-Hee hee hee.
-What?

230
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,814
Relax. Have a beer.

231
00:12:11,857 --> 00:12:15,485
Wait, um, wait. Chloe?

232
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:19,323
I'm not so sure
that's such a good idea.

233
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:21,658
Jimmy.

234
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,621
Jimmy. Please let me in.

235
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,289
Oh, baby

236
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,874
Please?

237
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,503
Ahh

238
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:56,109
Chloe?

239
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:57,819
I...

240
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,696
Maybe
I should have let her in...

241
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,491
but I was scared.

242
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:05,118
So who could really blame her
for what happened next?

243
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,621
Hold on.

244
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,083
You look beautif--

245
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,419
Oh, hi.

246
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,463
Ooh, corsage.

247
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:18,090
Oh, I'm sorry.

248
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,093
Mark, Jimmy. Jimmy, Mark.

249
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:23,220
'Sup, Jimbo?

250
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,224
'Sup, Marko?

251
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,433
You ready?

252
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,810
Yeah. Just let me
use the bathroom.

253
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,895
All right.
Pinch it quick.

254
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:35,774
-She loves that one.
-Hmm.

255
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,820
-Cigarette?
-What?

256
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:49,329
So Chloe tells me
you're a musician.

257
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,833
Well, I rock,
if that's what you mean.

258
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:53,834
Ahh

259
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:54,960
You know?

260
00:13:55,002 --> 00:13:56,962
So, what are you guys
gonna do tonight?

261
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,299
You know,
a little bit of this.

262
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,925
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

263
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:05,220
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's it, ahh.

264
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,097
Oh, oh!
That's it. Ohh!

265
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,599
Sounds like fun.

266
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,726

All right. All ready.

267
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,478
That's how I do it on stage.

268
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,524
Did I tell you
how beautiful you look?

269
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,318
Come here.

270
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,279
I'm gonna be
the luckiest guy at the prom.

271
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:25,824
One thing was for sure.
Mark was cool.

272
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,201
Bye, Jimmy.

273
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:30,370
Who could compete
with a guy like that?

274
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,414
-Hands.
-I'm sorry.

275
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,711
Come on, Chloe.

276
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,254
We've been going out
for two years...

277
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:41,089
I want a little action.

278
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,257
Mark, I told you--

279
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,593
I want to wait
till I get married.

280
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,186
Hands.

281
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:09,243
I tried to warn you,
but you wouldn't listen.

282
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,870
All women
will leave you someday.

283
00:15:11,912 --> 00:15:13,997
That girl didn't love you.

284
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,707
She just felt sorry for you.

285
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,085
You think she'd marry a boy
who couldn't even touch her?

286
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,925
Hey.

287
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:28,095
Hi.

288
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,721
Are you going somewhere?

289
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:33,892
Yeah. You know Mark?

290
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:38,814
We've sorta been going out
off and on for a while now...

291
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:40,983
and, um...

292
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:45,946
Well, he kind of asked me to...

293
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,781
-To go fishing?
-No!

294
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:50,158
-To go to the movies?
-No!

295
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,246
-To get married?
-Yes!

296
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,959
The wedding's this Saturday
in Niagara Falls.

297
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,338
I didn't know how to tell you,
Jimmy, because...

298
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:08,760
The thing is, um...

299
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,679
I really wanted to know...

300
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,681
if you think
he's the right one...

301
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:16,268
because it's such a big step,
you know? And...

302
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,854
Jimmy?

303
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:25,027
I made you something.

304
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:37,331
Take Bubble Guinea Pig.
I don't want him anymore.

305
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:48,133
So that's it?

306
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,511
That's all
you're going to say?

307
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,180
Bye, Jimmy.

308
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,019
Good-bye.

309
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:04,775
Can you still remember

310
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:07,402
How it seemed

311
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:09,863
That we could live forever

312
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:13,116
In a lovers' dream?

313
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:15,828
The falling
was the best part

314
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:18,580
But now you know

315
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:20,249
The things you cling to

316
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,627
Your heart can start to grow

317
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,548
You, you're walking away

318
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,132
I've been there

319
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:33,262
Now I know what to say

320
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:39,142
I'm the king of yesterday

321
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:43,522
Why don't,
why don't you stay

322
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,107
Chloe!

323
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,986
God...bless America!

324
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:51,655
That nasty little slut...

325
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:54,157
Left just in
the nick of time, Morton.

326
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:07,296
I had no idea
what I was up against.

327
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,339
Chloe hadn't told me much.

328
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,758
All I knew was that
she was in New York...

329
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,678
which may as well been on
the other side of the galaxy...

330
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,973
and I only had
three days to get there.

331
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,808
Three days.

332
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,519
I just needed the bubble suit
to last that long.

333
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,195
Flying high now

334
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:35,490
I'm so high now

335
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:43,999
Ooh!

336
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:52,090
Ooh! Oh, oh, oh!

337
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:06,271
Getting strong now

338
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:11,568
Moving on now

339
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,907
Uhh!

340
00:19:16,949 --> 00:19:18,116
Aah!

341
00:19:19,952 --> 00:19:21,286
Grass.

342
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:32,756
Street lamp.

343
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,216
Oh.

344
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,926
Ooh.

345
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:39,638
Dog poop!
This is awesome!

346
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:52,109
I'm running!

347
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,986
I'm running!

348
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,823
Well, I guess
this is growing up

349
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:02,202
Well, I guess
this is growing up

350
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,582
Well, I guess
this is growing up

351
00:20:08,584 --> 00:20:10,919
Well, I guess
this is growing up

352
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,132
Well, I guess
this is growing up

353
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:32,107
Well, I guess
this is growing up

354
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:36,236
Well, I guess
this is growing up

355
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:42,618
Hello? Hello?

356
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:53,504
Hi. It's my first day
out in the world.

357
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:03,931
I'd like to go
to Niagara Falls.

358
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:10,103
That'll be $260.

359
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:14,942
Plus I gotta charge you
for an additional seat...

360
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:18,612
for that...stupid thing
you're wearing.

361
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:22,908
Oh, money. Oh. Money.

362
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,372
How far will this get me?

363
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,791
Take a step back.

364
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:36,713
That far.

365
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:43,428
Um...

366
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,264
the girl I love
is getting married...

367
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,683
and I have
to stop the wedding.

368
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:51,395
That's fantastic.

369
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,480
Next!

370
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:01,488
Next in line, please.

371
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,169
OK. Have a nice day.

372
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:39,484
The white zone's
for loading and unloading only.

373
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,415
Hey, are you all right?

374
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:55,501
-Are you all right?
-What is it?

375
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,169
Oh, he's alive!

376
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,506
I need to get
to Niagara Falls...

377
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,883
by Saturday to stop Chloe
from getting married.

378
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:05,886
-I'm Todd.
-And I'm Lorraine.

379
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:08,055
And we can get you
to Niagara Falls.

380
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:12,059
Yeah!
Bright and shiny!

381
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,852

Stick him in the rear!

382
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,903
Bright

383
00:23:22,945 --> 00:23:25,280
And shiny

384
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:27,366
Bright

385
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,451
And shiny

386
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:32,120
People all across the land

387
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:34,331
Come and join our happy band

388
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:36,458
Always happy, never gay

389
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,710
Living clean is A-OK

390
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,504
Bright

391
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:42,589
And shiny...

392
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:44,174
Excuse me, Todd.

393
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:47,469
And shiny

394
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,763
If you save yourself
for God

395
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:52,099
You will get the golden rod

396
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,101
Give up on society

397
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:56,270
We will be your family

398
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:58,146
Bright

399
00:23:58,188 --> 00:24:00,440
And shiny

400
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:07,823
Jimmy! Breakfie!

401
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:17,958
Jimmy!

402
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,175
The Kloobda.

403
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,846
The Kloobda is
the holy guide to living pure...

404
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:34,308
dictated to Gil
by a talking salamander.

405
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:35,726
But more on that later.

406
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,686
This will help explain.

407
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:40,189
Put it
in the decontamination bay.

408
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,191
Right there.

409
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:45,485
First,
we prepare our souls...

410
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:48,530
by stripping ourselves
of all material possessions...

411
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:51,200
and sexual desires.

412
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,370
Ha ha ha ha!

413
00:24:56,955 --> 00:24:59,416
-Kool-aid, Lorraine?
-Thanks, Lorraine.

414
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:01,168
-Lorraine?
-Ooh!

415
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,836
Her name's Lorraine, too?

416
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:04,338
We're all Lorraine.

417
00:25:04,421 --> 00:25:05,923
And you will be Todd...

418
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:09,843
a name chosen
especially for you by Gil.

419
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:12,721
What does Bill
do with all your stuff?

420
00:25:12,763 --> 00:25:15,057
He's holding it for us
at the compound.

421
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:16,642
Where's the compound?

422
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:19,394
I'm not really sure.

423
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:21,063
In Texas?

424
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,315
Oh. You're not
a singing group...

425
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:26,318
you're a cult!
Ha ha ha!

426
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,279
Why'd we stop?

427
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:33,242
This isn't Niagara Falls!
This is a desert!

428
00:25:33,325 --> 00:25:36,745
Yes--yes, I realize
that in typical cases...

429
00:25:36,829 --> 00:25:37,871
you have to wait 48 hours.

430
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:40,374
But this is not a typical case.

431
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:43,627
My son is a bubble boy.
He'll die out there!

432
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:47,881
Well, you'll certainly be
in my prayers tonight.

433
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:50,300
And I'll be praying
you get nut cancer!

434
00:25:51,677 --> 00:25:55,097
All right, Plan B.
Did you finish the note?

435
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,599
Come on.

436
00:25:57,683 --> 00:26:00,602
"Mr. and Mrs. Livingston,
we have kidnapped your son.

437
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:05,232
"Pay $1 00,000 or he dies.
Signed, the Jews."

438
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:08,485
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding me?

439
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:12,072
Who in their right mind
is gonna believe this note?

440
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:14,408
It's the Jews, Morton!

441
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:17,703
They're gonna want
more than $1 00,000!

442
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:20,497
Think, man, think!

443
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:22,791
I'm havin' a bad day

444
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,918
Havin' a bad day

445
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,588
So get out of my way

446
00:26:28,964 --> 00:26:30,883
'Cause I'm havin' a bad day

447
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:31,884
Uhh!

448
00:26:31,884 --> 00:26:34,511
Havin' a bad day

449
00:26:34,553 --> 00:26:35,971
Havin' a bad day

450
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:39,266
Get out of my way

451
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:41,810
'Cause I'm havin' a bad day

452
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:43,979
Havin' a bad day

453
00:26:44,021 --> 00:26:45,189
Get off!

454
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,399
Havin' a bad day

455
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:49,526
Get out of my way...

456
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:54,573
Uhh! Aah!

457
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,086
Have you seen my son?

458
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,089
Hello?

459
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:16,053
I think he's deaf.
Have you seen my boy?

460
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:20,057
Your weird-ass son
got on a bus...

461
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:25,020
full of happy people skipping
around all over the place...

462
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:26,563
and they headed towards Vegas.

463
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:28,232
You know, Satan's anus.

464
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:29,441
Thank you.

465
00:27:29,483 --> 00:27:32,611
You filthy, fat,
filthy deaf man!

466
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:35,322
I heard that.

467
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:36,782
Mort, let's move it!

468
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:41,995
I'll have you know
that I've lost two pounds.

469
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:44,039
I have my ankle weights
on right now...

470
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:46,542
and it's very hot in here
and I'm losing weight.

471
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:49,044
I've lost four pounds
in the last two months.

472
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:52,005
Havin' a bad day

473
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:54,550
Havin' a bad day

474
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,927
Get out of my way

475
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:59,930
'Cause I'm havin' a bad day

476
00:27:59,972 --> 00:28:02,641
I'm havin' a bad day

477
00:28:02,683 --> 00:28:04,518
Get out of my way

478
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,103
Hey!

479
00:28:06,186 --> 00:28:08,814
-Hey, hey!
-Whoa!

480
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:11,817
What are you...

481
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,277
some kind of astronaut?

482
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:16,947
No, I'm some kind
of bubble boy.

483
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:20,159
How do you take a dump
in that thing?

484
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,997
I think I could help you
with your situation here.

485
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:27,124
How's some bubble vato
gonna help me?

486
00:28:27,166 --> 00:28:30,002
I got patches.

487
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:32,087
Patches?

488
00:28:32,129 --> 00:28:34,464
I could use
some stinkin' patches.

489
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:40,345
-Gil!
-Gil, we love you!

490
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:43,849
Welcome, my children.
Welcome.

491
00:28:43,932 --> 00:28:48,896
Today will truly be a time
of spiritual illumination.

492
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:52,858
Now, can anyone guess
why we're all here?

493
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:53,901
-Ooh!
-Ooh, me!

494
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:56,612
Yes, Todd.
No, the other Todd.

495
00:28:56,653 --> 00:28:59,490
To find out the final
incarnation of the Chosen One?

496
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,450
Exactly.

497
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:04,036
I can see you've been
reading your Kloobda.

498
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:06,538
The Chosen One is among us!

499
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:10,083
He walks the earth.

500
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:14,421
His final incarnation
will be...

501
00:29:16,965 --> 00:29:18,717
A round one!

502
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:25,891
Yes, the round one.

503
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:29,228
The holy messenger
trapped in a living globe.

504
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:31,939
We must find him
and release him...

505
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,274
so that he may carry us...

506
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:37,736
only true believers,
to the kingdom of Heaven.

507
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:41,448
And those who reject him
will mutate...

508
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:45,118
and burn eternally
on Planet PX-41 .

509
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:49,498
Or PX-42,
if they run out of room.

510
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,917
If there are
no further questions...

511
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,418
Let's move on to the buffet.

512
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:58,632
So they kicked you
out of the bus...

513
00:29:58,674 --> 00:30:01,260
in the middle of the desert
to die like some perro?

514
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:02,845
Yep.

515
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:03,971
Where you headed?

516
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:07,307
Niagara Falls. I gotta
get there by Saturday...

517
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:10,269
to stop Chloe from marrying
the wrong man.

518
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,188
Ha ha ha!
Let's cut the vato, ese!

519
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,191
I wasn't planning on
cutting the vato, no.

520
00:30:16,233 --> 00:30:17,943
Somebody run off
with your old lady...

521
00:30:17,985 --> 00:30:20,404
Legally
you're allowed to cut him.

522
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:22,447
She wasn't
technically my old lady.

523
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:25,534
I just never...

524
00:30:25,576 --> 00:30:28,370
I just never told her
how I felt.

525
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:34,084
When I was your age,
I was in love with a woman.

526
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:36,211
-Debbie?
-No.

527
00:30:36,253 --> 00:30:39,923
-Danielle.
-No. Wildfire!

528
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:44,553
Oh, Wildfire!
She looks really nice.

529
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:45,929
Yeah, but she left me
for some other vato.

530
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:48,056
You know,
real buttoned-down...

531
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:50,726
"I gotta get a job"
kind of vato, you know?

532
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:53,187
To this day, ese,
I regret not finding him...

533
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:56,356
and cutting his heart out
in a really violent way.

534
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:02,279
Don't be like me, ese.
Don't live in regret.

535
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:07,951
We'll be riding wildfire

536
00:31:07,993 --> 00:31:09,536
We'll be riding

537
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:10,787
Ohh!

538
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:15,000
Wildfire

539
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:16,502
I'm OK.

540
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:20,631
Look at the lights!

541
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,758
Now this is
Las Vegas, Jimmy!

542
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,093
Wow!

543
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:26,428
Paris!

544
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,013
That's beautiful, ain't it?

545
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:29,264
And New York!

546
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:31,225
That's big New York.

547
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:32,935
This is amazing, Slim.

548
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:34,436
Ha ha ha ha!

549
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:36,021
Go faster! Go faster!

550
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:37,439
You like the wind
in your hair?

551
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:39,441
-Yeah.
-Ha ha ha!

552
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:44,446
"We have the loosest sluts."

553
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:45,781
That's "slots"!

554
00:31:45,823 --> 00:31:48,158
I'll show you how to play
the slot machines.

555
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,286
We can win some gas money
to get to Niagara Falls!

556
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:52,955
All right, chicas!

557
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:55,624
-Chicas!
-Ha ha ha ha ha!

558
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,795
Ow! Ha ha ha!

559
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:01,547
This is amazing!

560
00:32:01,588 --> 00:32:02,965
This town
never goes to sleep.

561
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:04,967
We'll do some partying!

562
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:13,350
Whoa! Oh, no!

563
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:19,690
Wow! Oh ho!
Ha ha ha ha! Whoo!

564
00:32:25,237 --> 00:32:26,947
Jimmy!

565
00:32:26,989 --> 00:32:29,199
Where are you, baby?

566
00:32:29,241 --> 00:32:30,742
My baby Jimmy?

567
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:32,536
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

568
00:32:32,578 --> 00:32:35,080
Coming through.
Excuse us.

569
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:37,207
Come on,
talk to me, babies.

570
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:39,251
Lookin' good!
Yes, all right.

571
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:44,214
-Slim?
-Yeah.

572
00:32:44,256 --> 00:32:46,175
What's it like?

573
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,891
Ha ha ha ha ha!

574
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:56,768
I could tell you what it was
like with me and Wildfire.

575
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,356
1,200 CCs of American steel
vibrating between your legs.

576
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:04,193
Oh, man.
I'm talking fourth gear.

577
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:08,530
4,000 RPMs! Ay!
Ha ha ha ha!

578
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:10,866
That sounds amazing!
Ha ha!

579
00:33:10,908 --> 00:33:13,869
-Hors d'oeuvres?
-Oh, no, thanks.

580
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:15,746
I got my own.

581
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,917
OK. Last one.

582
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,919
You go for it!

583
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,003
Oh, no. I couldn't.

584
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:24,421
Go on.

585
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:26,715
You want to win the money
for our trip, don't you?

586
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:28,926
But what if I lose again?

587
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:31,803
You didn't get out of that
bubble room to play it safe.

588
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:33,931
You're right.

589
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:35,432
Go for it.

590
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:42,439
Oh! I'm tapped out.

591
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:45,776
I'm gonna steal some quarters
from that blind lady.

592
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:47,486
Slim, I don't think--

593
00:33:47,528 --> 00:33:49,112
I gotta go.
I only have two days--

594
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:54,076
No, Slim! I gotta go!
I only have two days left!

595
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:56,495
-It'll be awesome!
-I only have two days left!

596
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:58,288
Bow-wow
ba-ba-ba bow-wow

597
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,581
Ba-ba-ba-ba

598
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:01,124
Bow-wow
ba-ba-ba bow-wow

599
00:34:01,166 --> 00:34:02,125
Ba-ba-ba-ba

600
00:34:02,209 --> 00:34:05,003
Bow-wow ba-ba-ba bow

601
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:07,756
Rrrow-wow
ba-ba-ba bow-wow

602
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:10,300
I didn't like leaving Slim
without saying good-bye...

603
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:12,261
but I knew the vato
would understand.

604
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:14,012
The wedding
was two days away...

605
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:18,809
and I only had 12 CCs of
American steel to get me there.

606
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:22,521
Don't think I can't see you
gawking at those neon boobies.

607
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:26,024
Just keep your eye
on the road, mister.

608
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,572
Hey, have you seen
my little buddy?

609
00:34:31,572 --> 00:34:35,951
He's got frizzy hair,
and he's in a bubble.

610
00:34:35,993 --> 00:34:37,703
Hey, what's up?

611
00:34:37,744 --> 00:34:39,246
Uhh!

612
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:42,082
Have you seen
this little bubble guy, ma'am?

613
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:46,378
I didn't mean it.

614
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:50,507
Excuse. Hola.

615
00:34:50,549 --> 00:34:51,842
We're a bit lost.

616
00:34:51,884 --> 00:34:53,886
Could you tell us the way to--

617
00:34:53,927 --> 00:34:55,429
Niagara Falls?

618
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,431
I beg your pardon?

619
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:59,016
'Cause that's where
my little buddy was headed...

620
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,268
when you left him
in the desert to die!

621
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:05,772
Come back!

622
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:07,065
You Bright and Shinies--

623
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:09,026
come back and get shiny
on my knife!

624
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:12,237
Hey! Hey! Hey!

625
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:19,828
Aah!

626
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:23,749
This looks like Area 51 .

627
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,709

Holy mother of shit, Morton!

628
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:28,128
What is that?
A space creature? An alien?

629
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,382
Oh, my God! Jimmy!

630
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:34,092
Bow-wow
ba-ba-ba bow-wow

631
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:35,135
Ba-ba-ba-ba

632
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:36,136
Jimmy!

633
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:37,471
Stop the car!

634
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:38,764
Jimmy!

635
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:45,270
Aah!

636
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:46,980
Aah!

637
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:49,942
Uhh! Aah!

638
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:03,247
I wasn't quite sure
just how I'd gotten on board...

639
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:05,999
but I'd always dreamed
of riding a train.

640
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:08,836
Thank goodness
the worst was behind me...

641
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:11,171
or so I thought.

642
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:14,550
RUBBER WO
Look, he's awake.

643
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:22,349
What are we going to do?

644
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:26,144
Aah!

645
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:29,147
-Aah!
-Aah!

646
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:31,316
Shh!

647
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:33,110
Dr. Phreak is gonna hear you!

648
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:36,321
-What?
-He'll hear you. Hide!

649
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:38,782
What did you say?

650
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:42,828
He said be quiet or
the doctor will hear you. Shh!

651
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:44,538
Who are you?

652
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,915
They call me
the Human Sasquatch.

653
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:48,667
What's your real name?

654
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:52,546
Um...Clark?

655
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:54,173
So what's your deal?

656
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,675
Why are you in a bubble?

657
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:58,177
To protect me from germs.

658
00:36:58,218 --> 00:37:00,554
I was born
without any immunities...

659
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:02,222
so even a single one
could kill me.

660
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:04,391
But your doctor
would know all about that.

661
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:06,018
Be quiet!
He's gonna come!

662
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,020
He's not your average doctor.

663
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:09,271
He's Dr. Phreak.

664
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:12,566
We're all part of
his traveling Phreak Show.

665
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:13,901
He owns us.

666
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:15,777
-Owns you?!
-Shh!

667
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:16,862
Be quiet!
Here comes Dr. Phreak!

668
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:18,113
He's an ex-con.

669
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:21,366
If he finds you in this train,
he'll own you, too.

670
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,662
Now you did it, bubble butt.

671
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:27,623
Here he comes!
Run for your life!

672
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:29,750
He's a vicious brute.

673
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:43,639
You're Dr. Phreak?

674
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:46,475
Ha ha ha ha!

675
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:48,101
You're so mini! Ha ha ha!

676
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:49,645
-Mini? Oh, no!
-No!

677
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:53,273
Me, mini?! I'm not mini!

678
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:57,653
I'm not mini!
Not! Not! Not!

679
00:37:57,694 --> 00:37:59,655
I'm not mini!

680
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:01,490
Who the hell are you?

681
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:02,533
He's the bubble boy.

682
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,284
Shut your beak!

683
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:05,494
What are you doing
out of your coop?

684
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:06,829
I shut up.

685
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:10,165
I could use
some fresh meat in my show.

686
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,668
Why don't you hop
your little bubble butt...

687
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,169
back on that train?

688
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:16,505
Thanks, but, um...

689
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:19,299
I gotta get to
Niagara Falls by Saturday...

690
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:20,717
to stop Chloe
from getting married.

691
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:25,722
That's so, so beautiful.

692
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:27,558
I, too, once loved another.

693
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,810
-You did?
-For 1 0 minutes.

694
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:31,520
Then I kicked her ass
out of the car.

695
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:34,273
Well, I gotta get going.

696
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:35,274
Going?!

697
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:36,441
-Oh!
-Oh!

698
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:37,484

What are you gonna do?

699
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,820
You're a freak,
and I should know.

700
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:41,155
That's my business.

701
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:44,032
No decent girl wants
to marry a bubble freak.

702
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:47,035
Once you get that through
your thick, freaky skull...

703
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:49,204
then give me a call.

704
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:51,373
What's wrong with being a freak?

705
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:52,624
Aah!

706
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:57,254
-Oh!
-Oh! That hurt!

707
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:58,672
Doctor?

708
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:01,008
Is he OK?
I didn't mean to...

709
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:03,177
He looks so sweet
when he's not yelling.

710
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:05,762
You've killed him.

711
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,558
-What are we going to do?
-Whoa!

712
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,269
Good luck! Bye!

713
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:15,272
Uhh! Heads up, Bubble!

714
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:16,481
OK. Bye!

715
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:19,067
Get your own bags!
What do you think I am--bellhop?

716
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:28,577
Hey, where are you guys going?

717
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,913
We're going with you,
Dr. Bubble.

718
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,080
We're going with you.

719
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:33,624
Dr. Bubble? No, no!

720
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:36,126
You guys are free.

721
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:37,878
You can do whatever
you want now.

722
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,922

Oh, we're free!

723
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:41,089
Free as a bird!

724
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:43,967
On to Niagara Falls!

725
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:45,636
On to Niagara Falls!

726
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:47,346
All the way!
Oh, I love it!

727
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:48,764
Look, you guys...

728
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:51,725
I gotta do this alone.

729
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:55,646
Oh, yeah.

730
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:57,314
Bye!

731
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:06,698
It sure was nice...

732
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,617
of the train man
to loan me his vehicle...

733
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:11,495
but if l was gonna make it
to the wedding on time...

734
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:14,331
I had to find something
with a motor.

735
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:17,376
Oh, my God!
He ain't eating meat!

736
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:19,878
Can you all believe it?
It's tofu!

737
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:21,713
Tofu!

738
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:24,508
Could anybody
give me a ride?

739
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,677
Tofu gives me such gas!

740
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:31,056
Bloody red meat!
Rare American meat!

741
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:36,144
That's the stupidest-looking hat
I've ever seen.

742
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:39,273
It's adorable!

743
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:41,817
Hey! Hey!

744
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:45,529
Stop picking on him.

745
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:47,239
-Oh!
-Oh!

746
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:49,700
I don't want any trouble.
I'm just--

747
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:50,742
Really?

748
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:52,035

Sissy beach ball!

749
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:54,246
Why are you
in that bubble, boy?

750
00:40:54,288 --> 00:40:55,414
Huh?

751
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:59,293
Because I was born
without any immunities--

752
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:01,587
Immunities?!
What the hell are immunities?

753
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:03,755
Well, I ain't sticking
around to find out!

754
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:05,048
Me, neither.

755
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:09,344
Everybody out!
He's got immunities!

756
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:11,471
-No, no, no!
-He's contagious!

757
00:41:11,513 --> 00:41:13,432
I don't have any immunities!

758
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:15,601
Don't try to change
your story now, boy!

759
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:18,812
I don't have germs!
I'm not contagious!

760
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:20,397
I just need a ride!

761
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,485
I need a ride!

762
00:41:24,526 --> 00:41:26,737
I hereby declare
this place quarantined!

763
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:29,323
I don't have germs!

764
00:41:30,365 --> 00:41:32,075
Oh! Ohh!

765
00:41:32,117 --> 00:41:33,577
What's going on, Sheriff?

766
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,620
Oh!

767
00:41:34,661 --> 00:41:37,289
Guys, I think
your building's on fire.

768
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:41,001
Carl Peterson's
best pig just died!

769
00:41:41,043 --> 00:41:43,629
It's spreading!

770
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,839
Burn, baby, burn

771
00:41:45,881 --> 00:41:47,841
Disco inferno

772
00:41:47,883 --> 00:41:49,343
Burn, baby, burn

773
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,428
Burn that mother down,
y'all

774
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,013
Burn, baby, burn

775
00:41:53,055 --> 00:41:55,474
Disco inferno

776
00:41:55,516 --> 00:41:57,684
Burn, baby, burn

777
00:41:57,726 --> 00:42:01,313
Whoo! Just like Calcutta
in the summer!

778
00:42:01,355 --> 00:42:02,606
Come! Follow me!

779
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:04,608
Come on!

780
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:15,744
Whoa!

781
00:42:19,915 --> 00:42:21,333
I don't think I'm in!

782
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,543

Stop messing about!

783
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:24,670
This whole town
is going to blow!

784
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:31,385
Ha ha ha ha! Boy, howdy!

785
00:42:31,426 --> 00:42:34,805
Now, that's a good fire!
Heh heh heh!

786
00:42:35,931 --> 00:42:37,015
Uh-oh.

787
00:42:38,392 --> 00:42:40,352
Disco inferno, yeah

788
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:43,272
Burn the mother down

789
00:42:43,313 --> 00:42:44,731
Burn, baby, burn

790
00:42:49,987 --> 00:42:52,197
Ice cream! ice cream!

791
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:54,074
Curry!

792
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:56,076

Let's go. Come on.

793
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:59,121
Watch out for the feet.
I told you before.

794
00:42:59,163 --> 00:43:01,206
Look out!
Coming through!

795
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,749
I'm on the run!

796
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:07,254
Morton, that's the one!

797
00:43:07,296 --> 00:43:09,756
Jimmy! Jimmy! We're here!

798
00:43:09,798 --> 00:43:12,676
Morton, get this thing open.

799
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:15,095
Jimmy?!

800
00:43:15,137 --> 00:43:16,346
Jimmy--Ooh!

801
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:19,641
Look at this cute
little boy, Morton!

802
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:21,268
Can you tell me,
have you seen my son?

803
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,062
He's wearing
a large plastic bubble suit.

804
00:43:25,314 --> 00:43:28,233
I know what you want.
I'll give you some candy.

805
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:30,152
He stole my freaks,
that son of a bitch!

806
00:43:30,194 --> 00:43:31,904
Oh! What a potty mouth
you have!

807
00:43:31,945 --> 00:43:34,781
Where was he going?

808
00:43:34,823 --> 00:43:35,949
Screw you, lady!

809
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:37,409
Aah!

810
00:43:40,871 --> 00:43:43,081
Thanks.

811
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:44,291
Thanks for
saving me back there.

812
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:45,459
You're welcome.

813
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:47,628
Those were some crazy vatos.

814
00:43:47,669 --> 00:43:49,588
For some unknown reason,
Shiva has brought you...

815
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,298
into my life
like a hot flash.

816
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:53,300
You came to my defense...

817
00:43:53,342 --> 00:43:56,011
and the law of karma
requires me to return the favor.

818
00:43:56,053 --> 00:43:58,472
This ice cream truck
is merely a catalyst...

819
00:43:58,514 --> 00:44:00,641
a way to teach
the wisdom of the Sacred Cow.

820
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:02,226
For who can resist
ice cream, eh?

821
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:03,268
I know I can't.

822
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:05,771
So, how may I be
of service to you...

823
00:44:05,854 --> 00:44:07,147
my Zip-locked friend?

824
00:44:07,189 --> 00:44:09,274
I need to get to
Niagara Falls by Saturday...

825
00:44:09,316 --> 00:44:11,318
to stop Chloe
from getting married.

826
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,988
Oh. I was thinking...

827
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,032
more along the lines
of a free snow cone...

828
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:20,536
but, OK,
Niagara Falls it is.

829
00:44:22,538 --> 00:44:28,252
Livin' in
the Land of the Lost

830
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:30,254
Livin' in the Land...

831
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:34,883
No way is this better
than "Jurassic Park."

832
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:37,594
I can't believe you and
bubble geek like this show.

833
00:44:37,636 --> 00:44:38,762
The effects look totally fake.

834
00:44:38,804 --> 00:44:40,514
That's the whole point.

835
00:44:40,556 --> 00:44:42,349
What?
It's supposed to look fake?

836
00:44:43,892 --> 00:44:46,353
I'm not here.

837
00:44:48,021 --> 00:44:49,189
Hello?

838
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:52,317
What have you done
with my son?

839
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:53,902
Mrs. Livingston?

840
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:55,070
Is he with you?

841
00:44:55,112 --> 00:44:56,822

How could he be here?

842
00:44:56,864 --> 00:44:58,031
Well, apparently
he's on his way...

843
00:44:58,073 --> 00:44:59,783
to your wedding
in a bubble suit...

844
00:44:59,825 --> 00:45:03,579
exposing himself to
all the wickedness and filth...

845
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,164
this world has to offer!

846
00:45:05,205 --> 00:45:07,457
And you're responsible!

847
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:09,293

Come on! Over here! Come on!

848
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:12,212
-Come on!
-Over here!

849
00:45:12,254 --> 00:45:15,382
-Come on! This way!
-Come on!

850
00:45:15,424 --> 00:45:16,675
Let's go, Morton.

851
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:19,136
Correction. You two
aren't going anywhere...

852
00:45:19,178 --> 00:45:20,762
until I get my freaks back.

853
00:45:20,804 --> 00:45:24,725
Don't you take that tone
of voice with me, young man!

854
00:45:24,766 --> 00:45:28,604
Morton, are you gonna let him
talk to me like that?

855
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:30,814
Yeah, Mort. Are ya?

856
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:39,072
-My car!
-My freaks!

857
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:50,292
Help! Jimmy!
Aah! Jimmy!

858
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:51,460
Help!

859
00:45:51,502 --> 00:45:53,086
Hang on! Hang on!

860
00:45:53,128 --> 00:45:54,755
Aah!

861
00:45:54,796 --> 00:45:57,090
Screw you, Grumpy!

862
00:45:57,132 --> 00:45:59,218
Hop on, babe.

863
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:03,680
Thanks for saving me, Mark.

864
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:04,848
How do you do it?

865
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:08,185
Immunities, baby.
Immunities.

866
00:46:08,227 --> 00:46:10,145
-Aah!

867
00:46:10,187 --> 00:46:12,564
-Aah!
-Aah!

868
00:46:18,237 --> 00:46:20,823
Oh, dear.

869
00:46:24,368 --> 00:46:27,538
Oh! Oh!

870
00:46:27,579 --> 00:46:31,500
Look at that.
It's an elk.

871
00:46:32,668 --> 00:46:35,671
Or is it a caribou?

872
00:46:35,754 --> 00:46:38,632
Or an American bison?

873
00:46:41,009 --> 00:46:42,553
l, uh...

874
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:44,638
I think that it's a cow.

875
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,641
Oh, really?! A cow?!

876
00:46:47,683 --> 00:46:50,602
I didn't know.

877
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:52,563
What have I done?

878
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:54,940
It's just a cow, Pushpop.

879
00:46:57,609 --> 00:46:59,069
Just a cow?

880
00:46:59,111 --> 00:47:01,029
Just a cow?!

881
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:03,198
In my religion,
the cow is the womb...

882
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,159
from which all life springs!

883
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,326
Heh heh heh!

884
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:08,912
I have transgressed
against Shiva!

885
00:47:12,374 --> 00:47:13,750
Shiva?

886
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:16,879

The six-armed goddess.

887
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,755
Have you ever been
karmically bitch-slapped...

888
00:47:18,797 --> 00:47:20,382
by a six-armed goddess?

889
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:24,303
I'll take that as a no!

890
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:25,971
Oh! Um...

891
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:28,390
It's OK, Pushpop.

892
00:47:28,432 --> 00:47:30,642
Your religion's all lies.

893
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:32,895
Pardon?

894
00:47:32,936 --> 00:47:35,063
That's what my mom says.

895
00:47:35,105 --> 00:47:36,857
I mean...

896
00:47:36,899 --> 00:47:38,901
Bollocks.

897
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:41,069
I must atone.

898
00:47:41,111 --> 00:47:42,946

His mother taught him.

899
00:47:42,988 --> 00:47:44,490
What nonsense.

900
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:46,533
May Shiva
shine upon your journey!

901
00:47:46,575 --> 00:47:49,203
Well, can't we...

902
00:47:49,244 --> 00:47:52,289
can't we drive and atone?

903
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:53,874
No! One for the road.

904
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:56,335
What? No, no, no.

905
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:58,670
There are germs in here!

906
00:47:58,712 --> 00:48:00,506
Frozen! No germs!

907
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:04,635
No germs?

908
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:06,178
When did this happen?

909
00:48:10,474 --> 00:48:12,851
Thanks for the lift!
So long!

910
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:14,895
Ice cream

911
00:48:19,525 --> 00:48:22,152
It was one thing
that my mom...

912
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:24,446
had never heard of
the bitch-slapping goddess...

913
00:48:24,488 --> 00:48:26,573
but it seemed like everybody
should have heard...

914
00:48:26,615 --> 00:48:29,535
offrozen,
germ-free ice cream.

915
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:45,592
Ohh!

916
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:52,850
Everybody loves ice cream.

917
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:54,560
Stripper.

918
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,729
Dykes.

919
00:48:57,771 --> 00:48:59,148
Dear Lord,
if Thou findest...

920
00:48:59,189 --> 00:49:00,899
the stealing of this truck
offensive in any way...

921
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:03,152
please direct Thy wrath
upon that midget...

922
00:49:03,193 --> 00:49:06,405
and not upon us,
Thy humble servants. Amen.

923
00:49:07,614 --> 00:49:09,283
All right.
Let's haul ass.

924
00:49:09,324 --> 00:49:11,952
One of you drive.
I can't reach the pedals.

925
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:14,288
Upsy-daisy. Whoo!

926
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:34,266
I am coming back
as a cockroach.

927
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:35,893
Definitely a cockroach.

928
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:41,440
Aah!

929
00:49:41,482 --> 00:49:42,441
Aah!

930
00:49:42,483 --> 00:49:44,109
Oh ho ho! Oh ho ho!

931
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:46,069
Aah! Aah!

932
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:49,031
Now, we don't know where
those hands have been, do we?

933
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:50,949
Rub them together.

934
00:49:50,991 --> 00:49:53,285
Kill those germs!
That's right.

935
00:49:53,327 --> 00:49:54,870
Good boy.

936
00:50:02,211 --> 00:50:03,795
No! Stop!

937
00:50:03,837 --> 00:50:06,507
Show some respect!

938
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:11,303
Hey! Yo, hippie!

939
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:13,972
You seen a big, yellow bus
with a lot of bright...

940
00:50:14,014 --> 00:50:15,849
and shiny cabrones
pass through here?

941
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:19,019
No, sir.
I don't believe I have.

942
00:50:20,687 --> 00:50:23,982
You got any bomb pops
on that truck?

943
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:26,527
Oh, yes. Please,
take the whole damn truck.

944
00:50:26,568 --> 00:50:27,736
All right!

945
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:31,490
Who wants a blue one?

946
00:50:35,202 --> 00:50:38,080
Everything is A-OK

947
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:41,708
Bright and shiny

948
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:45,921
Uhh! Uhh!

949
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,844
What have I done?

950
00:50:50,759 --> 00:50:52,219
You OK?

951
00:50:52,261 --> 00:50:53,387
Yeah.

952
00:50:53,428 --> 00:50:56,265
It's just--
Jimmy's my best friend.

953
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:59,226
We basically spent every day
together in high school.

954
00:50:59,268 --> 00:51:01,770
Yeah? Did you ever...

955
00:51:01,812 --> 00:51:04,565
you know,
get in his bubble?

956
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:06,900
No.

957
00:51:06,942 --> 00:51:08,819
Not that I didn't
think about it, though.

958
00:51:08,861 --> 00:51:09,987
I know what you mean.

959
00:51:10,028 --> 00:51:11,280
I used to play
"Spin the bottle"...

960
00:51:11,321 --> 00:51:14,158
with the kid from
Special Ed. Ha ha ha!

961
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:17,161
Ha ha ha!

962
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:19,705
Well.

963
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:25,878
It would've never worked out
between the two of us.

964
00:51:25,919 --> 00:51:29,173
Yeah. Rubber comes in handy
every once in a while...

965
00:51:29,214 --> 00:51:30,674
but let's not go overboard.

966
00:51:30,716 --> 00:51:32,467
You're way better off
with my brother.

967
00:51:32,509 --> 00:51:35,971
Yeah. Way better off.

968
00:51:37,222 --> 00:51:38,473
Take a little time

969
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:39,933
Throw it on the line

970
00:51:39,975 --> 00:51:40,976
Let me believe

971
00:51:41,018 --> 00:51:42,644
That you believe in me

972
00:51:42,686 --> 00:51:44,062
Baby, turn around

973
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:45,689
Look at what I found

974
00:51:45,731 --> 00:51:47,983
You're the one that I want

975
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:49,735
Take a little time

976
00:51:49,776 --> 00:51:51,195
Throw it on the line

977
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:52,279
Let me believe

978
00:51:52,321 --> 00:51:54,072
That you believe in me

979
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:55,324
Stand and turn around

980
00:51:55,365 --> 00:51:56,700
Look at what I found

981
00:51:56,742 --> 00:51:59,786
You were the one that I wanted

982
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:01,163
Take a little time

983
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:02,164
Throw it on the line

984
00:52:02,206 --> 00:52:03,624
Let me believe

985
00:52:03,665 --> 00:52:05,125
That you believe in me

986
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:06,627
Baby, turn around

987
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:08,003
Look at what I found

988
00:52:08,045 --> 00:52:11,840
You were the one that I wanted

989
00:52:11,882 --> 00:52:14,593
Taxi! Taxi!

990
00:52:14,635 --> 00:52:18,430
Hi! I need to get
to Niagara Falls by tomorrow.

991
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:19,556
Can you take me there?

992
00:52:19,598 --> 00:52:21,850
-Depends.
-On what?

993
00:52:21,892 --> 00:52:24,186
Goin' that far I'll have
to get me some Depends.

994
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:26,522
And 500 smackers!

995
00:52:26,563 --> 00:52:28,273
$500?!

996
00:52:28,315 --> 00:52:31,318
Where am I gonna get $500?

997
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:41,078
Who wants to be next?
Who wants the $500?

998
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,996
Now, we need
some fresh blood here!

999
00:52:43,038 --> 00:52:44,706
Whoa! Spotlight
on the dance floor!

1000
00:52:44,748 --> 00:52:46,583
Whoa, I like the look of this!

1001
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:49,878
Mr. Alien, is it?
What are you doing here, dummy?

1002
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,964
I saw the sign outside...

1003
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:55,008
and it said that you
have $500, and so...

1004
00:52:55,092 --> 00:52:56,885
You want $500?

1005
00:52:56,927 --> 00:52:59,763
Yes. I would like $500.

1006
00:52:59,805 --> 00:53:02,057
You want $500?

1007
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:04,268
Yes. Please, I would like $500.

1008
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:05,853
You want $500?

1009
00:53:05,894 --> 00:53:08,188
Yes, I want $500!

1010
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:11,441
-$500!
-$500!

1011
00:53:11,483 --> 00:53:13,110
All right!

1012
00:53:13,152 --> 00:53:15,487
Our next contestant,
Mr. Alien!

1013
00:53:15,529 --> 00:53:18,490
Red Hot, Working Girl,
bring him on over!

1014
00:53:18,532 --> 00:53:20,784
A big cheer for Mr. Alien!

1015
00:53:22,661 --> 00:53:25,706
Mud! Mud! Mud! Mud!

1016
00:53:25,747 --> 00:53:27,207
Mud! Mud! Mud!

1017
00:53:27,249 --> 00:53:30,252
-$500!
-$500!

1018
00:53:30,335 --> 00:53:31,670
Aah! Hey!

1019
00:53:43,515 --> 00:53:44,516
Whoa! Oh, whoa!

1020
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:47,060
-Unh!
-Unh!

1021
00:53:50,105 --> 00:53:51,315
$500!

1022
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:54,318
Bubble Boy! Bubble Boy!

1023
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:03,327
$500!

1024
00:54:03,368 --> 00:54:08,123
Goddess Shiva,
I really need that money!

1025
00:54:13,045 --> 00:54:14,838
I pledge allegiance
to the flag...

1026
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,423
of the United States
of America...

1027
00:54:16,465 --> 00:54:18,050
and to the republic
for which it stands!

1028
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:23,263
Ha ha ha!
We have winner!

1029
00:54:23,305 --> 00:54:25,390
Winner! Winner! Winner!

1030
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:27,851

Bitch-slap me, Jesus

1031
00:54:27,893 --> 00:54:31,104
I've lost my way

1032
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:33,524
Strayed from your path

1033
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:35,901
Yet I pray

1034
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:39,363
Who let the dogs out

1035
00:54:39,404 --> 00:54:40,989
Woof woof woof

1036
00:54:41,031 --> 00:54:43,992
Morton!
I was listening to that!

1037
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:45,577
Yeah, Mort.

1038
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:49,915
A girl can't get five minutes
of quality time with Jesus.

1039
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:01,051
Man, this is some good curry!

1040
00:55:01,093 --> 00:55:03,762
Ha ha! Yeah!

1041
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:08,183
I got the money!

1042
00:55:08,225 --> 00:55:10,602
Look! There he is!

1043
00:55:10,644 --> 00:55:12,688
I've got the money!
Ha ha!

1044
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:14,606
We found you, Todd.

1045
00:55:14,648 --> 00:55:16,441
We know who you are.

1046
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:19,319
We've come to set you free!

1047
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:20,737
Ow!

1048
00:55:20,779 --> 00:55:22,573
You are the Chosen One!

1049
00:55:22,614 --> 00:55:24,575
I don't need you
to set me free!

1050
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,828
I don't--Oh!

1051
00:55:27,870 --> 00:55:31,123
Wait! Wait!

1052
00:55:31,165 --> 00:55:32,207
Look!
Those people have Jimmy!

1053
00:55:32,249 --> 00:55:34,293
-Stealth!
-What the hell is that?

1054
00:55:34,334 --> 00:55:36,461
We've gotta get him away
from those freaks.

1055
00:55:36,503 --> 00:55:38,964
-What can we do?
-We need a plan.

1056
00:55:39,006 --> 00:55:41,216
We blend.

1057
00:55:41,258 --> 00:55:43,677
I got a plan.
What size shirt you wear?

1058
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:50,017
And now, to avoid mutating
and burning on planet PX-41...

1059
00:55:50,058 --> 00:55:54,062
we release the Chosen One
using the ceremonial tweezers.

1060
00:55:55,105 --> 00:55:58,567
With this tiny prick,
I release thee!

1061
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:00,194
No! Don't! I'll die!

1062
00:56:01,236 --> 00:56:04,865
It must be a test!
Where's my Kloobda?

1063
00:56:04,907 --> 00:56:06,283
Right there, Lorraine!

1064
00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:07,409
Thank you.

1065
00:56:07,451 --> 00:56:08,744
You're welcome.

1066
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:11,914
Wait a minute!
You're not a Shiny!

1067
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:15,125
Who are you?

1068
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:17,544
Uh...Todd?

1069
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:19,922
-Oh!
-Hi, Todd.

1070
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:21,673
Wait a minute!

1071
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:23,800
What's the matter
with your arms?

1072
00:56:23,842 --> 00:56:25,469
What are you talking about?

1073
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:28,722
There's nothing wrong
with my arms!

1074
00:56:28,764 --> 00:56:32,351
We're too late!
We're mutating!

1075
00:56:37,815 --> 00:56:39,983
We'll get you out
through the front of the bus.

1076
00:56:40,025 --> 00:56:43,237
Oh, God!
Why won't you help me?

1077
00:56:45,697 --> 00:56:48,116
Ha ha ha ha!

1078
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:50,244
He's got a bubbly face

1079
00:56:50,285 --> 00:56:51,995
And a bubbly nose

1080
00:56:52,037 --> 00:56:53,539
Mr. Bubble

1081
00:56:54,998 --> 00:56:56,875
Bubble, Bubblicious

1082
00:56:56,917 --> 00:56:58,502
The ultimate bubble.

1083
00:57:00,629 --> 00:57:03,090
Tiny bubbles

1084
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:04,591
Tiny bubbles

1085
00:57:04,633 --> 00:57:06,301
In the wine

1086
00:57:07,344 --> 00:57:10,597
I know. I miss him, too.

1087
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:13,600
Come on, Bubble Boy!
Hurry up!

1088
00:57:13,642 --> 00:57:15,811
Come on!

1089
00:57:15,853 --> 00:57:16,812
This way, guys! Hurry!

1090
00:57:16,854 --> 00:57:18,313
This way!

1091
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:21,191
Ow! Guys! Oh!

1092
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:24,611
Hey! Come on! Todd!

1093
00:57:26,905 --> 00:57:30,784
Hey, Shinies!

1094
00:57:30,826 --> 00:57:32,870
We have some
unfinished business, huh?

1095
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:35,455
No, no, Slim.
They're my friends.

1096
00:57:35,497 --> 00:57:37,040
They got him brainwashed!

1097
00:57:37,082 --> 00:57:39,543
No! No! No!

1098
00:57:39,585 --> 00:57:41,044
Wait!

1099
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:43,130
Bubble, we'll help you out!
Don't worry!

1100
00:57:43,172 --> 00:57:45,757
I'll take you on with
one flipper behind my back!

1101
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:47,050
You want
a mouthful of tuna?

1102
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:50,637
Free Willy! Free Willy!

1103
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:52,514
I'm gonna whup that ass!

1104
00:57:52,556 --> 00:57:54,391
Yeah!

1105
00:57:54,433 --> 00:57:57,186
Aah! Oh, my God!

1106
00:57:57,227 --> 00:57:59,021
Get it off of me!

1107
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:06,612
Ha ha ha ha!

1108
00:58:09,656 --> 00:58:13,202
Niagara Falls,
and step on it!

1109
00:58:22,085 --> 00:58:23,545
It's the cops!

1110
00:58:23,587 --> 00:58:25,881
-Wait a minute!
-Don't touch me there!

1111
00:58:25,923 --> 00:58:27,925
Where's Bubble Boy?

1112
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:33,472

You ask me if l love you

1113
00:58:33,514 --> 00:58:37,267
And I choke on my reply

1114
00:58:37,309 --> 00:58:41,855
I'd rather hurt you honestly

1115
00:58:41,897 --> 00:58:44,566
-Poon !
-Huh?

1116
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:46,610
Chasing a dame, ain't you?

1117
00:58:46,652 --> 00:58:49,238
Who am I to judge you

1118
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:52,825
Last time I was
in a commotion like that...

1119
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:55,702
it was all on account
of Poon .

1120
00:58:55,744 --> 00:58:57,496
Oh, what the astronauts drink.

1121
00:58:57,538 --> 00:58:59,540
No, no. My wife.

1122
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:03,085
My little China doll.

1123
00:59:03,126 --> 00:59:05,045
Yeah, till that damn
brother of mine...

1124
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:07,965
took her off to Waxahachie.

1125
00:59:08,006 --> 00:59:11,260
Snatched my Poon
right out from under me.

1126
00:59:11,301 --> 00:59:14,429
86 years ago.

1127
00:59:14,471 --> 00:59:17,140
I ain't spoke
to that bastard since.

1128
00:59:17,182 --> 00:59:20,561
Don't live in regret, ese.

1129
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:22,938
He's your family.

1130
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,940
Family. Heh.

1131
00:59:24,982 --> 00:59:27,734
I really gotta go!

1132
00:59:27,776 --> 00:59:30,946
I told you, once we're on
the road we're not stopping!

1133
00:59:30,988 --> 00:59:36,034
Than mislead you with a lie

1134
00:59:36,076 --> 00:59:38,328
And after all that...

1135
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:41,456
they still didn't get you
a new puppy?

1136
00:59:41,498 --> 00:59:42,457
No.

1137
00:59:42,499 --> 00:59:45,961
Ohh.
Poor little thing.

1138
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:50,632
No wonder you turned out
the way you did.

1139
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:52,259
Ohh.

1140
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:57,389
And sometimes when we touch

1141
00:59:57,431 --> 01:00:01,310
The honesty's too much

1142
01:00:13,405 --> 01:00:15,657
Morning, Pappy.

1143
01:00:17,576 --> 01:00:19,870
You must be tired.

1144
01:00:19,912 --> 01:00:25,751
You get any sleep?
Ha ha ha!

1145
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:28,921
I said, you get any sleep?

1146
01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:32,633
Pappy!

1147
01:00:34,593 --> 01:00:36,386
Pappy?

1148
01:00:40,807 --> 01:00:42,434
Pappy?

1149
01:00:50,609 --> 01:00:54,446
Pappy? Pappy! Stop!

1150
01:00:54,488 --> 01:00:59,243
Aah!

1151
01:00:59,284 --> 01:01:03,622
Oh! Ow!

1152
01:01:03,664 --> 01:01:05,457
Yow! Yeah, I'm fine.

1153
01:01:09,461 --> 01:01:10,629
You have a phone?

1154
01:01:24,059 --> 01:01:25,853
Yello.

1155
01:01:34,653 --> 01:01:36,446
Hello?

1156
01:01:36,488 --> 01:01:38,907
Hi. Is Chloe there?

1157
01:01:38,949 --> 01:01:41,034

Who can I say is calling?

1158
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:42,327
It's Jimmy.

1159
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:45,914
Oh. Hello, Jimmy.

1160
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:47,749
Where the hell are you?

1161
01:01:47,791 --> 01:01:51,378
I'm really close.
In New York, I think.

1162
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:54,506
I don't mean to burst
your bubble, Jimbo...

1163
01:01:54,548 --> 01:01:57,634
but if you got a thing for
Chloe, it's not gonna happen.

1164
01:01:57,718 --> 01:01:59,678
We're getting married
in one hour.

1165
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:01,471
What are you
expecting to happen?

1166
01:02:01,513 --> 01:02:02,890
You can't even touch her.

1167
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:04,057
How are you
gonna have children?

1168
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:06,185
Do you even have sperm?

1169
01:02:07,561 --> 01:02:10,022
Fact it, dude,
you're a charity case.

1170
01:02:10,063 --> 01:02:13,484
Chloe felt sorry for you
because you lived in a bubble.

1171
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:15,194
Do us all a favor.

1172
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:16,945
Go on back to Palmdale
where you belong.

1173
01:02:26,997 --> 01:02:31,001
I wasn't quite sure what
Mark meant about the sperm...

1174
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:33,921
but he was right
about one thing.

1175
01:02:33,962 --> 01:02:35,923
Even if l did get there...

1176
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:38,550
I couldn't ever really
hold Chloe in my arms...

1177
01:02:38,592 --> 01:02:41,053
or kiss her for real.

1178
01:02:42,971 --> 01:02:45,390
I really was a freak.

1179
01:02:51,063 --> 01:02:52,397
Hello.

1180
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:55,067
Hi, Dr. Phreak.
It's Jimmy.

1181
01:02:55,108 --> 01:02:56,860
Jimmy who?

1182
01:02:56,902 --> 01:02:58,153
The bubble boy.

1183
01:02:58,195 --> 01:03:00,113
Jimmy?! Give me that!

1184
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:01,281
That's my phone!

1185
01:03:01,323 --> 01:03:03,325
Hello? Jimmy?

1186
01:03:03,367 --> 01:03:05,160
-Mom?
-Jimmy!

1187
01:03:05,202 --> 01:03:06,912
What are you doing
with Dr. Phreak?

1188
01:03:06,912 --> 01:03:09,081
-Where are you?
-Where are my freaks?

1189
01:03:09,122 --> 01:03:11,917
OK, sweetheart,
we'll be right there.

1190
01:03:11,917 --> 01:03:13,126
Don't move!

1191
01:03:13,168 --> 01:03:16,004
Morton, we've got our boy back!

1192
01:03:16,046 --> 01:03:17,881
Gimme that.

1193
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:28,058
Aah! Ow! Ooh!

1194
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:33,105
Ow! Eek! Ohh!
Son of a bitch.

1195
01:03:33,188 --> 01:03:34,481
Mama.

1196
01:03:55,878 --> 01:03:59,006
Ohh! Aah!

1197
01:04:10,184 --> 01:04:12,478
I never stole anything before...

1198
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:14,104
and I just fell off
a dead man's car...

1199
01:04:14,146 --> 01:04:15,355
and my parents are about
to come pick me up...

1200
01:04:15,397 --> 01:04:17,107
and this is the girl
I love's favorite beer...

1201
01:04:17,149 --> 01:04:19,651
and I was just wondering,
could I borrow it?

1202
01:04:19,735 --> 01:04:21,945
Yeah, sure.

1203
01:04:21,987 --> 01:04:23,363
Thanks.

1204
01:04:28,202 --> 01:04:29,953
Now open the safe!

1205
01:04:29,995 --> 01:04:31,830
Do it! Chop chop!

1206
01:04:45,928 --> 01:04:47,638
Ohh...

1207
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:50,599
Aah!

1208
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:51,683
My baby!

1209
01:04:51,725 --> 01:04:55,938
The sweet Lord
has delivered you from evil.

1210
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:57,564
Ohh!

1211
01:04:57,606 --> 01:05:00,150
I must say, you put us
through heck, young man!

1212
01:05:00,192 --> 01:05:02,986
But I think you learned
a valuable lesson.

1213
01:05:03,028 --> 01:05:05,614
There's no place like home.

1214
01:05:07,866 --> 01:05:09,576
Morton, load him in the car.

1215
01:05:09,618 --> 01:05:12,246
The Spirit's burning
so strong in my bosom...

1216
01:05:12,246 --> 01:05:15,207
I think I have to wee-wee.

1217
01:05:37,604 --> 01:05:40,566
How--ahem--
how was it out here?

1218
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,609
Was it fun?

1219
01:05:55,330 --> 01:05:57,624
You can see the moon today.

1220
01:05:58,876 --> 01:06:01,003
You know, it kind of
makes you wonder...

1221
01:06:01,044 --> 01:06:03,130
what would have happened
if Neil Armstrong...

1222
01:06:03,172 --> 01:06:06,091
had gone all the way
to the moon...

1223
01:06:06,133 --> 01:06:09,761
and then never
stepped on the surface.

1224
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:28,155
Jimmy!

1225
01:06:28,197 --> 01:06:30,032
Morton, where's Jimmy?!

1226
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:31,366
What happened?

1227
01:06:35,412 --> 01:06:37,706
Jimmy! Jimmy!

1228
01:06:41,084 --> 01:06:43,670
Jimmy! Come to Mommy!

1229
01:06:43,754 --> 01:06:47,549
No, Mom! I'm sorry!

1230
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:50,052
I gotta do this!

1231
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:52,179
I'm not coming home!

1232
01:06:52,221 --> 01:06:54,056
Jimmy!

1233
01:06:54,097 --> 01:06:55,891
Todd!

1234
01:06:55,933 --> 01:06:56,892
Jimmy!

1235
01:06:56,934 --> 01:06:58,227
Todd, we love you!

1236
01:06:58,227 --> 01:07:00,604
We've come to set you free!

1237
01:07:00,646 --> 01:07:01,939
Who the hell are you?

1238
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:04,399
Back off, bitch!
He's the messiah!

1239
01:07:04,441 --> 01:07:05,776
We love you, Todd!

1240
01:07:05,818 --> 01:07:07,110
Jimmy, no!

1241
01:07:07,152 --> 01:07:09,696
Pedal to the metal, Flippy!

1242
01:07:09,738 --> 01:07:11,740
Look!

1243
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,541
I guess
this is growing up

1244
01:07:20,582 --> 01:07:23,210
-Hey!
-Whoa!

1245
01:07:33,512 --> 01:07:34,471
Oh!

1246
01:07:34,513 --> 01:07:37,224
Jimmy! Ha ha ha!

1247
01:07:37,266 --> 01:07:41,895
Vaya con dios, Bubble Boy.

1248
01:07:41,937 --> 01:07:44,398
Hang on, kid.

1249
01:07:44,439 --> 01:07:47,067
Pappy?

1250
01:07:47,109 --> 01:07:50,112
Aah! Shit!

1251
01:07:50,195 --> 01:07:51,321
Watch out!

1252
01:08:04,877 --> 01:08:06,545
Slim?

1253
01:08:08,213 --> 01:08:10,090
Wildfire?

1254
01:08:10,132 --> 01:08:18,849
Wildfire

1255
01:08:18,891 --> 01:08:20,851

What happened to you, Pappy?

1256
01:08:20,893 --> 01:08:22,686
I thought you were dead.

1257
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:24,688
I ain't Pappy. I'm Pippy.

1258
01:08:24,730 --> 01:08:29,026
Ain't talked to that sumbitch
brother of mine in 86 years.

1259
01:08:29,067 --> 01:08:31,653
-That's on account of--
-Poon!

1260
01:08:31,695 --> 01:08:33,864
-Poonani!
-Poonani?

1261
01:08:33,906 --> 01:08:35,699
Sister to Poon.

1262
01:08:35,699 --> 01:08:37,451
Pappy talked about Poon...

1263
01:08:37,493 --> 01:08:39,870
but he never mentioned
any Poonani, Pippy.

1264
01:08:53,383 --> 01:08:55,511
Oh! Ha ha!

1265
01:08:59,556 --> 01:09:01,517
Oh, my gosh!

1266
01:09:01,558 --> 01:09:04,937
I made it! I made it!

1267
01:09:04,978 --> 01:09:08,106
Ha ha ha!

1268
01:09:08,148 --> 01:09:10,609
Niagara Falls!

1269
01:09:14,822 --> 01:09:18,116
Niagara Falls!

1270
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:21,453
Oh, there's the church!
There's the church!

1271
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:25,165
Chloe! Ha ha ha!

1272
01:09:34,258 --> 01:09:38,470
Take me down, Pippy!
Take me down!

1273
01:09:42,057 --> 01:09:43,183
Oh, we're goin' down.

1274
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:47,020
Very fast.

1275
01:09:47,062 --> 01:09:51,066
Pippy!

1276
01:09:52,442 --> 01:09:54,153
Aah!

1277
01:09:58,907 --> 01:10:02,870
Chloe!

1278
01:10:11,503 --> 01:10:12,963
You didn't break out
of that bubble room...

1279
01:10:13,005 --> 01:10:14,464
to play it safe.

1280
01:10:14,506 --> 01:10:16,133
Don't live in regret, ese.

1281
01:10:16,175 --> 01:10:18,468

No regrets. No regrets.

1282
01:10:18,510 --> 01:10:21,805
No regrets. No regrets.

1283
01:10:21,847 --> 01:10:23,557
No regrets! No regrets!

1284
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:27,227
No regrets!

1285
01:10:47,664 --> 01:10:51,710
I made it! Ha ha ha!

1286
01:10:51,752 --> 01:10:54,838
-Score, dude.
-Mmm. Mmm.

1287
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,841
I'm late! I'm late!

1288
01:10:59,134 --> 01:11:01,595

Do you, Mark, take Chloe...

1289
01:11:01,595 --> 01:11:03,430
to be
your lawfully wedded wife?

1290
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:08,060
To honor and cherish,
in sickness and in health...

1291
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:10,020
as long as
you both shall live?

1292
01:11:10,062 --> 01:11:12,773
Oh, yeah.

1293
01:11:12,815 --> 01:11:16,109
I'm almost there!
I'm almost...

1294
01:11:16,151 --> 01:11:17,444
And do you, Chloe...

1295
01:11:17,486 --> 01:11:20,823
take Mark to be
your lawfully wedded husband...

1296
01:11:20,864 --> 01:11:24,409
to honor and cherish,
in sickness and in health...

1297
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:27,412
as long as
you both shall live?

1298
01:11:31,333 --> 01:11:32,584
Come on, babe.

1299
01:11:33,836 --> 01:11:35,295
Easy question.

1300
01:11:35,337 --> 01:11:36,797
Chloe!

1301
01:11:36,839 --> 01:11:38,465
Don't!

1302
01:11:38,507 --> 01:11:40,676
Jimmy!

1303
01:11:40,717 --> 01:11:42,678
Hey, dude, what the hell
are you doing here?

1304
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:44,555
I thought I told you
to head on home.

1305
01:11:44,596 --> 01:11:45,973
Just hold on a second, vato.

1306
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:47,141
Vato?

1307
01:11:47,182 --> 01:11:48,851
Shut up!

1308
01:11:48,892 --> 01:11:50,727
Am I out of line here?

1309
01:11:50,769 --> 01:11:54,481
Chloe, l...

1310
01:11:54,523 --> 01:11:57,276
What?

1311
01:12:02,072 --> 01:12:04,491
What?

1312
01:12:06,827 --> 01:12:09,329
Jimmy, what are you doing?

1313
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:13,750
Jimmy?

1314
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:16,211
Jimmy?

1315
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,013
I'd rather spend
one minute holding you...

1316
01:12:26,054 --> 01:12:29,141
than the rest of my life
knowing I never could.

1317
01:12:31,393 --> 01:12:33,312
So if you don't mind...

1318
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:35,731
may I kiss the bride?

1319
01:12:41,153 --> 01:12:42,779
Is it me?

1320
01:12:46,283 --> 01:12:48,869
I love you.

1321
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:51,246
-I love you, Chloe.
-Jimmy?

1322
01:12:51,288 --> 01:12:52,789
Forever.

1323
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:57,419
OK?

1324
01:12:57,419 --> 01:12:59,421
Jimmy?! No!

1325
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:01,089
Jimmy!

1326
01:13:01,131 --> 01:13:03,926
Jimmy?
I love you, Jimmy.

1327
01:13:03,967 --> 01:13:06,011
I've always loved you.

1328
01:13:06,053 --> 01:13:08,180
He's dead!

1329
01:13:08,222 --> 01:13:10,516
You killed him! Oh!

1330
01:13:10,557 --> 01:13:12,976
Ohh!

1331
01:13:13,018 --> 01:13:14,478
Oh, Jimmy!

1332
01:13:20,359 --> 01:13:23,737

My little sweet Jimmy.

1333
01:13:25,572 --> 01:13:26,573
Ohh.

1334
01:13:26,657 --> 01:13:28,784
Oh, my angel.

1335
01:13:28,826 --> 01:13:30,410
My precious little one.

1336
01:13:30,452 --> 01:13:35,624
My angel.

1337
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:38,168
Tell him.

1338
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:41,129
What are you talking about?
Tell him what?

1339
01:13:41,129 --> 01:13:43,131
You're not dead, Jimmy.

1340
01:13:43,173 --> 01:13:45,509
-He's lying.
-Tell him.

1341
01:13:45,551 --> 01:13:48,011
Tell him everything.

1342
01:13:50,055 --> 01:13:51,306
Ohh...

1343
01:13:51,348 --> 01:13:53,225
you're not dead, Jimmy.

1344
01:13:53,267 --> 01:13:54,977
I'm not?

1345
01:13:56,812 --> 01:13:58,689
Ohh!

1346
01:13:58,730 --> 01:14:00,899
You developed immunities
when you were four.

1347
01:14:00,941 --> 01:14:04,862
I couldn't let the world
ruin you with its filth!

1348
01:14:04,862 --> 01:14:07,072
There are so many
awful things out there.

1349
01:14:07,114 --> 01:14:08,740
There's so many horrible...

1350
01:14:26,091 --> 01:14:27,426
I love you, Mom.

1351
01:14:27,467 --> 01:14:28,635
Oh!

1352
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:30,387
Ain't that sweet.

1353
01:14:53,952 --> 01:14:55,287
So...

1354
01:14:55,329 --> 01:14:59,500
since I'm not dead...

1355
01:15:14,306 --> 01:15:15,933
Wouldn't it be nice

1356
01:15:15,974 --> 01:15:18,143
If we were older

1357
01:15:18,185 --> 01:15:22,105
Then we wouldn't
have to wait so long

1358
01:15:22,147 --> 01:15:25,692
And wouldn't it be nice
to live together

1359
01:15:25,734 --> 01:15:29,446
In the kind of world
where we belong

1360
01:15:29,446 --> 01:15:31,448
May Shiva bless your union.

1361
01:15:31,448 --> 01:15:33,283
Thanks for
the ice cream cake, Pushpop.

1362
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:36,245
Well said, Master.

1363
01:15:37,788 --> 01:15:41,291
You don't have
to follow me this closely.

1364
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:43,335
Everyone!
The buffet is open!

1365
01:15:44,711 --> 01:15:47,881
Winner! Winner! Winner!

1366
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:50,342

1367
01:15:50,342 --> 01:15:51,510
What is it?

1368
01:15:51,552 --> 01:15:52,845

1369
01:15:52,845 --> 01:15:54,930

1372
01:16:01,311 --> 01:16:02,521
Ha ha ha ha!

1373
01:16:02,563 --> 01:16:04,648
It's a long story.
I'll tell you on the honeymoon.

1374
01:16:04,690 --> 01:16:05,649
Thank you.

1375
01:16:05,691 --> 01:16:07,568
To family.

1376
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:09,027
That's right.

1377
01:16:09,027 --> 01:16:10,028
And my 40.

1378
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:12,072
-Have fun, you two!
-You, too, Mom.

1379
01:16:12,114 --> 01:16:15,242
Don't worry. We will.

1380
01:16:15,284 --> 01:16:17,119
Hit it, Slim.

1381
01:16:17,161 --> 01:16:18,954
Hit it, Ace.

1382
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:27,421
-To friendship.
-To friendship.

1383
01:16:27,462 --> 01:16:29,381

Now we're gonna party!

1384
01:16:29,381 --> 01:16:30,549
Jimmy!

1385
01:16:32,384 --> 01:16:34,303

Congratulations, kids.

1386
01:16:34,344 --> 01:16:35,596
Ready to take off?

1387
01:16:35,637 --> 01:16:36,597
Pippy?

1388
01:16:36,638 --> 01:16:38,265
You're right about family, kid.

1389
01:16:38,307 --> 01:16:40,726
Pappy?

1390
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:42,895

1392
01:16:50,611 --> 01:16:54,323
Wouldn't it be nice

1393
01:16:59,411 --> 01:17:02,998
Wouldn't it be nice,
oh, baby

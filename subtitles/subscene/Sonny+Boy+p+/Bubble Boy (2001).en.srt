00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,234
I came gift-wrapped

All I remember is
a place with white walls...

00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:45,880
bright lights,
and a gigantic bird.

13
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:50,594
I was there because I was born
with no immunities.

14
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:52,971
A single germ could kill me.

15
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:57,350

I felt completely free.

where they
could open casinos...

A space creature? An alien?

725
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:31,132
Oh, my God! Jimmy!

726
00:35:31,174 --> 00:35:32,842
Bow-wow
ba-ba-ba bow-wow

727
00:35:32,884 --> 00:35:33,885
Ba-ba-ba-ba

728
00:35:33,885 --> 00:35:34,886
Jimmy!

729
00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:36,221
Stop the car!

730
00:35:36,263 --> 00:35:37,514
Jimmy!

731
00:35:37,555 --> 00:35:40,225
[Tires squeal]

732
00:35:41,977 --> 00:35:44,020
Aah! [Crash]

733
00:35:44,062 --> 00:35:45,730
JIMMY: Aah!

734
00:35:45,772 --> 00:35:48,692
Uhh! Aah!

735
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:52,737
[Train whistle blows]

736
00:35:52,779 --> 00:35:54,739
[Signal clanging]

737
00:35:58,785 --> 00:36:01,997
JIMMY: I wasn't quite sure
just how I'd gotten on board...

738
00:36:02,038 --> 00:36:04,749
but I'd always dreamed
of riding a train.

739
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:07,586
Thank goodness
the worst was behind me...

740
00:36:07,627 --> 00:36:09,921
or so I thought.

741
00:36:09,963 --> 00:36:11,256
[Whispering]

742
00:36:11,298 --> 00:36:13,300
RUBBER WOMAN:
Look, he's awake.

743
00:36:13,341 --> 00:36:15,594
[Whispering continues]

744
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:21,099
What are we going to do?

745
00:36:21,141 --> 00:36:23,643
[Whispering continues]

746
00:36:23,685 --> 00:36:24,894
Aah!

747
00:36:24,936 --> 00:36:27,897
-Aah!
-Aah!

748
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:30,066
Shh!

749
00:36:30,108 --> 00:36:31,860
Dr. Phreak is gonna hear you!

750
00:36:31,902 --> 00:36:35,071
-What?
-He'll hear you. Hide!

751
00:36:35,113 --> 00:36:37,532
What did you say?

752
00:36:37,574 --> 00:36:41,578
He said be quiet or
the doctor will hear you. Shh!

753
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:43,288
Who are you?

754
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,665
They call me
the Human Sasquatch.

755
00:36:45,707 --> 00:36:47,417
What's your real name?

756
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:51,296
Um...Clark?

757
00:36:51,338 --> 00:36:52,923
So what's your deal?

758
00:36:52,964 --> 00:36:55,425
Why are you in a bubble?

759
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:56,927
To protect me from germs.

760
00:36:56,968 --> 00:36:59,304
I was born
without any immunities...

761
00:36:59,346 --> 00:37:00,972
so even a single one
could kill me.

762
00:37:01,014 --> 00:37:03,141
But your doctor
would know all about that.

763
00:37:03,183 --> 00:37:04,768
LL'L ZIP: Be quiet!
He's gonna come!

764
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:06,770
He's not your average doctor.

765
00:37:06,853 --> 00:37:08,021
He's Dr. Phreak.

766
00:37:08,063 --> 00:37:11,316
We're all part of
his traveling Phreak Show.

767
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:12,651
He owns us.

768
00:37:12,692 --> 00:37:14,527
-Owns you?!
-Shh!

769
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:15,612
LL'L ZIP: Be quiet!
Here comes Dr. Phreak!

770
00:37:15,654 --> 00:37:16,863
FLIPPY: He's an ex-con.

771
00:37:16,905 --> 00:37:20,116
If he finds you in this train,
he'll own you, too.

772
00:37:20,158 --> 00:37:22,118
[Brakes screech]

773
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,412
Now you did it, bubble butt.

774
00:37:24,454 --> 00:37:26,373
Here he comes!
Run for your life!

775
00:37:26,414 --> 00:37:28,500
He's a vicious brute.

776
00:37:28,541 --> 00:37:31,086
[Yelling]

777
00:37:31,127 --> 00:37:33,129
[Thud]

778
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:42,389
You're Dr. Phreak?

779
00:37:43,431 --> 00:37:45,225
Ha ha ha ha!

780
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:46,851
You're so mini! Ha ha ha!

781
00:37:46,893 --> 00:37:48,395
-Mini? Oh, no!
-No!

782
00:37:48,436 --> 00:37:52,023
Me, mini?! I'm not mini!

783
00:37:52,065 --> 00:37:56,403
I'm not mini!
Not! Not! Not!

784
00:37:56,444 --> 00:37:58,405
I'm not mini!

785
00:37:58,446 --> 00:38:00,240
Who the hell are you?

786
00:38:00,282 --> 00:38:01,283
He's the bubble boy.

787
00:38:01,283 --> 00:38:03,034
Shut your beak!

788
00:38:03,076 --> 00:38:04,244
What are you doing
out of your coop?

789
00:38:04,286 --> 00:38:05,579
I shut up.

790
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,915
I could use
some fresh meat in my show.

791
00:38:08,957 --> 00:38:11,418
Why don't you hop
your little bubble butt...

792
00:38:11,459 --> 00:38:12,919
back on that train?

793
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:15,255
Thanks, but, um...

794
00:38:15,297 --> 00:38:18,049
I gotta get to
Niagara Falls by Saturday...

795
00:38:18,091 --> 00:38:19,467
to stop Chloe
from getting married.

796
00:38:21,636 --> 00:38:24,472
That's so, so beautiful.

797
00:38:24,514 --> 00:38:26,308
I, too, once loved another.

798
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:28,560
-You did?
-For 1 0 minutes.

799
00:38:28,602 --> 00:38:30,270
Then I kicked her ass
out of the car.

800
00:38:30,312 --> 00:38:33,023
Well, I gotta get going.

801
00:38:33,064 --> 00:38:34,024
Going?!

802
00:38:34,065 --> 00:38:35,191
-Oh!
-Oh!

803
00:38:35,233 --> 00:38:36,234
PHREAK:
What are you gonna do?

804
00:38:36,318 --> 00:38:38,570
You're a freak,
and I should know.

805
00:38:38,612 --> 00:38:39,905
That's my business.

806
00:38:39,946 --> 00:38:42,782
No decent girl wants
to marry a bubble freak.

807
00:38:42,824 --> 00:38:45,785
Once you get that through
your thick, freaky skull...

808
00:38:45,827 --> 00:38:47,954
then give me a call.

809
00:38:47,996 --> 00:38:50,123
What's wrong with being a freak?

810
00:38:50,165 --> 00:38:51,374
Aah!

811
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:56,004
-Oh!
-Oh! That hurt!

812
00:38:56,046 --> 00:38:57,422
Doctor?

813
00:38:57,464 --> 00:38:59,758
JIMMY: Is he OK?
I didn't mean to...

814
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:01,927
FLIPPY: He looks so sweet
when he's not yelling.

815
00:39:01,968 --> 00:39:04,512
You've killed him.

816
00:39:04,554 --> 00:39:05,972
[Talking quietly]

817
00:39:06,014 --> 00:39:08,308
-What are we going to do?
-Whoa!

818
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,019
Good luck! Bye!

819
00:39:11,061 --> 00:39:14,022
Uhh! Heads up, Bubble!

820
00:39:14,064 --> 00:39:15,231
OK. Bye!

821
00:39:15,273 --> 00:39:17,817
Get your own bags!
What do you think I am--bellhop?

822
00:39:25,116 --> 00:39:27,327
Hey, where are you guys going?

823
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:29,663
We're going with you,
Dr. Bubble.

824
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:30,830
We're going with you.

825
00:39:30,872 --> 00:39:32,374
Dr. Bubble? No, no!

826
00:39:32,415 --> 00:39:34,876
You guys are free.

827
00:39:34,918 --> 00:39:36,628
You can do whatever
you want now.

828

Oh, we're free!

829
00:39:38,713 --> 00:39:39,839

833
00:39:46,137 --> 00:39:47,514
JIMMY: Look, you guys...

834
00:39:47,555 --> 00:39:50,475
I gotta do this alone.

835
00:39:53,103 --> 00:39:54,396
Oh, yeah.

836
00:39:54,437 --> 00:39:56,064
JIMMY: Bye!

837
00:40:03,613 --> 00:40:05,448
JIMMY: It sure was nice...

838
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,367
of the train man
to loan me his vehicle...

839
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:10,245
but if l was gonna make it
to the wedding on time...

840
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:13,081
I had to find something
with a motor.

841
00:40:13,123 --> 00:40:16,126
Oh, my God!
He ain't eating meat!

842
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:18,628
Can you all believe it?
It's tofu!

843
00:40:18,628 --> 00:40:20,463
Tofu!

844
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:23,258
JIMMY: Could anybody
give me a ride?

845
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,427
Tofu gives me such gas!

846
00:40:25,468 --> 00:40:29,806
MAN: Bloody red meat!
Rare American meat!

847
00:40:29,848 --> 00:40:32,100
[Laughter]

848
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:34,894
That's the stupidest-looking hat
I've ever seen.

849
00:40:34,936 --> 00:40:38,023
It's adorable!

850
00:40:38,064 --> 00:40:40,567
JIMMY: Hey! Hey!

851
00:40:40,609 --> 00:40:41,902
[Laughter stops]

852
00:40:41,943 --> 00:40:44,279
Stop picking on him.

853
00:40:44,321 --> 00:40:45,989
-Oh!
-Oh!

854
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:48,450
I don't want any trouble.
I'm just--

SHERIFF: Huh?

859
00:40:54,205 --> 00:40:58,043
Because I was born
without any immunities--

860
00:40:58,084 --> 00:41:00,337
Immunities?!
What the hell are immunities?

861
00:41:00,378 --> 00:41:02,505
Well, I ain't sticking
around to find out!

862
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:03,798

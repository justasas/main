1
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,140
You guys, thank you so much
for coming to "'" with me.

2
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,820
- Wasn't it great?
- Sonny, it's a kiddie show.

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,480
We were the only people in the audience.

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,150
Who weren't dressed by our mommies.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,110
This was even too childish for me.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,600
And I think you know I'm pretty childish.

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,330
Yeah, he's like a little boy.

8
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,860
You know what?
You don't understand.

9
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,160
I used to live my life by pauly's pledges.

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,920
Always respect your parents.
Always keep a promise.

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,120
Ooh, like the fact that you promised.

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,150
To pay us $10 for coming to
this stupid show with you?

13
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,020
- Uh-huh.
- Pay up.

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,720
Right.
Here's your money.

15
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,780
- Oh hi, Mr. Condor.
- Terri.

16
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,280
Actually, my name's Tawni.

17
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,180
My first wife's name is Tawni
so I'm calling you terri.

18
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,950
Then terri it is.

19
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,280
Nice to see my stars.

20
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,440
Supporting the newest members
of the condor studio family.

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,280
- Hey, pauly.
- Hi, Mr. Condor!

22
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,280
Aw, I love that bear.

23
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,650
Oh oh!
There's... there's...

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,310
Sonny, it's not a Jonas.

25
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,250
It's just some guy in a bear suit.

26
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,180
La la la la la la la la la!

27
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,910
Look, just girl up and go talk to him.

28
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,110
I... I can't.

29
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,610
I'm too nervous.

30
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,280
Pauly means everything to me.

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,080
I used to watch him every
single day as a kid.

32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,650
All right.
Well, just relax.

33
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,820
We'll all go with you
to pauly's dressing room.

34
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,620
And we'll introduce you
to your childhood hero.

35
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,120
- You guys would do that?
- Yeah.

36
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,250
For another 10 bucks.

37
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:44,190
- You guys are the best.
- Uh-huh.

38
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:47,190
Stop it.

39
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,850
Okay, you can keep your money.

40
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,520
Just don't make me go in there.

41
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,460

- Hey, look!
- What?

59
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,520
Hi.

60
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,150
Well, hello there.

61
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,190
So where's my little pauly pal.

62
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,420
Who wants pauly's pawtograph?

63
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,850
Actually, that would be me.

64
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,190
So there's nobody here over age six.

65
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:10,590
With a cell phone
or any kind of recording device?

66
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,530
Nope.
Just me.

67
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,260
Oh, finally!

68
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:17,090
Gah!
There's a person in there!

69
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,500
Hi.
I'm Hank.

70
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,430
La la la la la la la la la!

71
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,200
You've got to be kidding me.

72
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,500
Aren't you a little old for this?

73
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,330
Is anybody ever too old for pauly?

74
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,930
Yeah, me.

75
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,640
Never thought this gig would last 25 years.

76
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,210
You're not gonna leave till
I sign your photo, are you?

77
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,240
- Fine. What's your...
- My name is Sonny.

78
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,940
Dear Sonny,

79
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,980
Pauly loves you beary beary much.

80
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,550
Rainbow, smiley faces.

81
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,450
Blah blah blah blah blah and a paw print.

82
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:00,650
I imagined this moment much differently.

83
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,720
I think somebody's forgetting
pauly pledge #17...

84
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,220
We're done here!

85
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,220
No. Wait.

86
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,290
Pauly pledge #17 is:

87
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,790
Mind your peas and carrots.

88
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,790
You're a regular superfan.
Wow.

89
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,230
Yeah, you have no idea.

90
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,400
In fact, um,

91
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:22,000
Can I just ask you for one more thing?

92
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,740
And then I promise I'll go.

93
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,910
Look at me.
I'm pauly!

94
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,540
You know, I would've let
you do this for five.

95
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,710
♪ p is for patience ♪

96
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,580
♪ a is for a-okay! ♪

97
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,480
- ♪ u is for... ♪ - You are
disturbingly good at that.

98
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,920
You'd make an excellent pauly.

99
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,820
- Really? - In fact, how
would you like to be pauly.

100
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,760
And give your friend Hank a chance to spend.

101
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:50,190
- His ten-spot.
- Oh my gosh!

102
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,030
Oh my gosh!
Oh my gosh!

103
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,930
Oh my gosh, I can't.

104
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,330
I've got plans with my boyfriend tomorrow.

105
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,830
All right, out of the suit.

106
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,930
- Come on, out of the suit.
- What? No.

107
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,370
No. Mine.
No no. I'll do it.

108
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,700
Congratulations.
Consider yourself.

109
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,540
A bear.

110
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,070
I feel like I'm being crowned
the queen of the north pole.

111
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,010
Wow.

112
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,610
North pole kind of smells
like a High School gym.

113
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,520
Anyways, I just need to push
back our date for an hour.

114
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,690
Happy seven-weekiversary.

115
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:28,060
Oh, just be happy for me.

116
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,130
Hello, class.

117
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,090
Hello, Ms. Bitterman.

118
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,700
Did everyone read the nine chapters.

119
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,460
On American history?

120
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,400
- Up all night.
- Yes.

121
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,300
Well, good for you.

122
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,470
- We're not doing that.
- The one time I read.

123
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,110
Instead we're going to be
having a little pop quiz.

124
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,710
A certain red-headed lady.

125
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,410
Has a gentleman caller.

126
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,880
That makes her feel like she's 39 again.

127
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,480
This is about to get weird.

128
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,750
How long should this wonderful
independent spirit wait.

129
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,550
Before introducing this man to her.

130
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,820
Cat?

131
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,660
And there's the weird.

132
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,230
Don't tell me you're getting ready.

133
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,130
To introduce him
to Dr. Mittens.

134
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,630
And there's the weirdest.

135
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,170
How do you know so much about her cat?

136
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,800
I'm a listener.

137
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,070
Ooh. Dr. Mittens.
This is serious.

138
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,770
Sounds like it's time for Dr.
Mittens and your gentleman caller to meet.

139
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,480
You're right!

140
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,910
No you're not.
What if he's not ready?

141
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,910
No, this is too risky.
It's too risky!

142
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:38,650
Come on.
He's a grown man.

143
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,180
I'm talking about
Dr. Mittens!

144
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,620
He's been hurt before
and he's no spring kitten.

145
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,290
His life's not perfect.

146
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,520
Like my sister who married a dentist.

147
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,360
And has a pool that's not
made out of plastic.

148
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,390
And sits in the front yard.

149
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,200
I never thought I'd say this,
but can we please study now?

150
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,870
Oh, look at all the pauly pals!

151
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:08,510
This is gonna be so great.

152
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,140
Here's your head.
Break a paw.

153
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,610
- I'm out of here.
- Thanks. Oh, don't forget

154
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,780
I have a date with my boyfriend in one hour.

155
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,810
- To celebrate... - I know, I know.
Young love.

156
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,310
It's beautiful.

157
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,850
Hank.

158
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,060
What are you doing? There's a line of
kids out there waiting to see you.

159
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,290
And I can't wait
to meet them, Mr. Condor.

160
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,400
That's the spirit you're
contractually obligated to have!

161
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,330
Have fun!

162
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,630
Hey, kids, who's ready to
meet pauly the polar bear?

163
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,310
Hello, all my pauly pals!

164
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,510
Ahh!

165
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,480
Oh, look at that!

166
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,410
Pauly's being smothered with love.

167
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,320
Dude, how you gonna call a time out?

168
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,490
- Oh, you know how I do.
- What?!

169
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:14,060
Flowers?
Oh dude, you shouldn't have.

170
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,760
Oh!

171
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,430
Dude, I didn't.
They're for sunny.

172
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,000
It's our
seven-weekiversary.

173
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,840
I'm taking her to Chez schwerman.

174
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,900
- And yet she's not here.
- Hmm.

175
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,770
Blow off!

176
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,880
- Impossible.
- Blow off...

177
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,780
Denial!

178
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,420
Dude, you might want to sit down
because you've been stood up.

179
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,120
You guys don't know
what you're talking about.

180
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,390
Then again, you do get blown
off by girls all the time.

181
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,720
Not true.

182
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,690
I don't even get that far.

183
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,230
Well, I do.
And this has all the signs.

184
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,900
Of a girl losing interest in you.

185
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,670
It happens in stages.

186
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,770
Stage one:
You're blown off.

187
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,340
Stage two: They stop
answering your phone calls.

188
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,240
- Mm-hmm.
- Or so I've been told.

189
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,040
- Well, I told you that.
- Yeah, you did.

190
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,150
No cell phones at the meet and greet.

191
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,880
Which is why pauly is turning it off.

192
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,490
Voicemail.

193
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,760
- How many rings?
- Two.

194
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:32,500
Ooh.

195
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,300
- Two means she heard it...
- Saw who it was...

196
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,630
- Thought about it...
- And turned the phone off.

197
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,200
Because she's not...

198
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,510
Interested.

199
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,240
I can't believe this.

200
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,350
- Join us, Chad.
- Yes, Chad.

201
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,690
Join us. Join the dateless
world of online gaming.

202
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,020
- No, never.
- Oh!

203
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,760
Here's your pawtograph, little girl.

204
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,560
Where's Hank?

205
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,300
Hey kids, who wants to see
pauly dislocate his shoulder?

206
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,830
Yay!

207
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:16,240
It doesn't even hurt.

208
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,770
Ooh ooh, my arm's made of rubber.

209
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,010
Hello?

210
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,010
I'm missing my anniversary?
Where are you?

211
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,810
Well, I'll tell you where I'm not...

212
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,580
In a wet bear suit.

213
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,550
When are you coming back?

214
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,220
Oh, probably about, uh, never!

215
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,920
What?!

216
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,230
So let me get this straight...

217
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,400
Hey, Mr. Condor,
I have to ask you something.

218
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,470
Just a sec, pauly.

219
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,310
I'm talking to my pal pepe here.

220
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,510
- Oh. - So you filled
in for your friend.

221
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,680
While his wife had a baby?

222
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,580
Oh, isn't friendship
just a wonderful thing?

223
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,780
Yes it is.

224
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,620
You're fired, your friend is fired,

225
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,280
And when the baby turns 18,
the baby is fired.

226
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,920
Nobody fills in for anyone here.

227
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,920
Without checking with me first.

228
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,360
Now why don't you just March
your little happy feet.

229
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,290
Down to the unemployment office?

230
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,660
- What do you want?
- Huh? Oh.

231
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,300
Uh, yeah, I was just wondering.

232
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,100
If you wanted to go in on a baby gift.

233
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,540
For pepe's friend...

234
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,940
But I guess not.

235
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,110
You've got five minutes.

236
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,510
Then I want you back out
there with the kids.

237
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,850
Hi, hanky-wanky.

238
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,390
Oh ho ho.

239
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:59,660
I'm not hanky-wanky.
I'm pauly-wauly.

240
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,060
Ooh, I like this game.

241
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,800
You know what? Pauly finds this
game a little uncomfortable.

242
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:09,170
Oh, I know you're at work,

243
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,800
But I couldn't wait any longer.

244
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,540
I brought someone special by.

245
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,170
To meet the other furry guy in my life.

246
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,140
Okay, you sneezed.

247
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,540
That doesn't necessarily
mean you're allergic.

248
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,910
It must just be dusty in that head.

249
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,880
- Oh! Sonny!
- Sorry.

250
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,890
Oh. Well, this is
embarrassing.

251
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,520
There's nothing to be embarrassed
about, Ms. Bitterman.

252
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,760
I'm not talking about me.
I'm talking about you.

253
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,030
I'm just introducing a cat to a polar bear.
Nothing weird about that.

254
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,200
Where's Hank?

255
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,000
Wait.
Hank is the Hank.

256
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,000
In the hanky-wanky?

257
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,100
And he had an appointment.

258
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,840
With Dr. Mittens, which clearly,
he's chosen not to keep.

259
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,270
This is
a cat-tastrophe.

260
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,640
I just hate my life.

261
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:05,690
Five minutes are up.
Let's go!

262
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,220
I'm on my way.

263
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,730
I hate my life.

264
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,100
Wait wait wait.
No. She's coming.

265
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:26,240
She's coming. 'S traffic
and wardrobe problems.

266
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,950
No show!

267
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,050
Worse than we thought.

268
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,090
- Dating an imaginary woman.
- Oh, been there.

269
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,620
Hey hey!

270
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,590
You're wrong and you're...
you're weird.

271
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,630
You both have to leave.
I'm on a date.

272
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,730
- Go.
- Are you, Chad?

273
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,430
Are you really?

274
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,800
See, I'm...

275
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,130
... not an expert at these things,

276
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,140
But I believe a date involves two people.

277
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,170
In a romantical situation.

278
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:07,450
I can't believe this.
This isn't traffic.

279
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,150
There's no wardrobe problems.
I've been stood up.

280
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,520
There's a way to make
the pain go away, Chad.

281
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,420
Join us.

282
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,160
Yes, Chad.
Join us.

283
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,790
You could be player three.

284
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,760
Three.

285
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,300
- Shiny.
- I can see myself.

286
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,370
- Touch it.
- Ah! Never!

287
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,440
Oh hey, Chad, can we have your

288
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,610
salad?

289
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,290
Ah!

290
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,890
What are you doing here?

291
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,730
Uh, I'm not turning my essay in late,

292
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,170
If that's what you're asking.

293
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,970
- What are you doing here?
- I'm not sitting here weeping in the dark.

294
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,870
Over my disastrous love life,
if that's what you're implying.

295
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,240
No. I meant why are you
here petting a cat carrier?

296
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:17,680
Why should Dr. Mittens
enjoy human touch.

297
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,310
If I can't?

298
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,680
Hanky-nky ran away.

299
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,890
And he'll come back another day?

300
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,650
I'm sorry. I don't know
that nursery rhyme.

301
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,550
I think I scared him off.

302
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,320
Wanting him to meet
Dr. Mittens.

303
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,020
Oh, you've got to help me!

304
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:42,900
Well, I'm not quite sure what I can do.

305
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,770
There's a "c" in it for you.

306
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,940
Make it a "c+"

307
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,700
And you got yourself
a hanky-wanky.

308
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,200
Shut up, mittens!

309
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,040
You've got nine lives!
Let me have one!

310
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,580
Okay.

311
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,950
Here you go.
Pauly's last autograph for the day.

312
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,190
I think I've got pawthritis.

313
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,430
- Pauly?
- Mr. Condor?

314
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,430
Pauly, before you leave, there's
one more kid you've got to see.

315
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,930
But pauly's supposed to be
off the clock now.

316
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,840
Just do it.

317
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,470
- Hi, pauly.
- Oh boy.

318
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,710
I've been a fan of yours forever.

319
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,250
- Seriously?
- Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

320
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,250
"Chad's cool.
Chad plays by his own rules.

321
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,150
- Chad's awesome."
- Is this going somewhere?

322
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,050
Why don't we sit down and talk about it?

323
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,090
- Yeah, no, I can't really...
- No, really, it's fine.

324
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,760
- I got to go to the little bear's room.
- Sit on down.

325
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:58,160
You can hold it.

326
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,490
Ooh, did someone just spill
something on your lap?

327
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:03,330
Not just somebody...
everybody.

328
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,960
- Yeah, are we done here?
- No, let's get back to me.

329
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,470
Well, when I was a kid
and I was having a problem

330
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,000
I would always think,

331
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,940
what would pauly do?

332
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,010
Don't you have someone else you can ask?

333
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,510
Somebody human?

334
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:26,310
- Possibly a girlfriend?
- That's the problem, pauly.

335
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:29,420
Today's our seven-weekiversary
and she totally blew me off.

336
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,350
I don't think she wants to see me anymore.

337
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,320
- That's not true.
- I think it is.

338
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,960
I don't know what to do.

339
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,690
Ah! Sonny!
Whoa.

340
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,260
No it's not.

341
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,930
Uh, all that stuff
I told you, I was kidding.

342
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,630
Of course you were.

343
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,630
Stop that.
Why are you in that suit?

344
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,530
Chad, I'm so sorry.

345
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,470
I promised the guy that
I'd be pauly for an hour.

346
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,940
And then he never came back.

347
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,310
So now I'm stuck in this suit being pauly.

348
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,540
And I smell like the inside
of a man's sock.

349
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,110
Well, that's a relief.
Nico and Grady had me convinced.

350
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,680
That you weren't into me anymore.

351
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,050
You were taking girl advice
from Nico and Grady?

352
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,120
It's called hitting rock bottom, Sonny.

353
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,850
Aww, that's the saddest and
sweetest thing I've ever heard.

354
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,160
Almost as sad and sweet
as you coming to pauly.

355
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:20,060
For advice on our relationship.

356
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,030
I knew it was you in there.

357
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,860
You know what?
Hank needs to be in here.

358
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,170
Whenever there's a little
girl or boy in need or...

359
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,000
Or a big boy...

360
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,440
- Stop that.
-... Pauly needs to be there.

361
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,840
We're spending our anniversary
tracking down that jerk, aren't we?

362
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,380
Yeah. We need to find a way to
get me out of this costume,

363
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,580
Hank back into this costume.

364
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,080
And this is gonna require you
being in a different costume.

365
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,150
What?

366
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,260
Never question pauly.

367
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,520
You are disturbingly good at that.

368
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,090
I know.

369
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,370
I like this place, Carl.

370
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,200
Finally people in costumes
making my dreams come true.

371
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,540
- You!
- You?

372
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,340
How'd you find me?

373
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,640
I found this in pauly's pocket.

374
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,940
Along with a deck of cards.

375
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,010
And a human tooth.

376
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:25,110
Cards aren't mine.

377
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,850
Hank, you can't quit being pauly.

378
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:30,120
Think of the kids.

379
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,020
I am.
That's why I quit.

380
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,030
Now scram.
You're harshing my smoothie.

381
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,060
But you can't quit being pauly.

382
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,230
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't
have dropped out of school.

383
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,230
To become Harry the hot dog.

384
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,370
See, Hank, you don't just inspire kids.

385
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,070
Apparently, I also inspire
bad life decisions.

386
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,480
I bet your parents are very proud.

387
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:53,810
I think you should leave
my parents out of this.

388
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,720
Um, Harry,

389
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,590
Remember why you're here...

390
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,960
To tell Hank how much pauly means to you.

391
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:06,630
Not until he apologizes for
bringing my parents into this.

392
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,760
Beat it, meathead, unless you
want a swift kick in the bun.

393
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,730
You know what?
That's not very paulylike.

394
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,630
Yeah, but it's very hanklike.
You picked the wrong fight.

395
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,270
And the wrong smoothie, hot bun boy.

396
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,270
Bring it, 'cause this dog is steamed!

397
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,140
- Come on, bring it!
- You guys!

398
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:22,070
You guys need to back up, back up!

399
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,310
All right?
Stop it, stop it, Chad!

400
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,980
You know this beef stick?

401
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,550
Yeah, this beef stick here is my boyfriend.

402
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,590
We're spending our anniversary.

403
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,120
Trying to remind you
of how important pauly is.

404
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,260
Aw, you're real romantic, aren't you?

405
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,020
Bet you got that from your parents,

406
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,860
Maybe your daddy, Chaddy.

407
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,290
Do not bring dad Dylan Cooper into this!

408
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,200
It doesn't matter what we're doing.

409
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,030
The important thing is that
we're doing it together.

410
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,370
Like pauly pledge 14 says:

411
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,100
You're never alone.

412
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,640
Aww.

413
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,810
Wow. You kids really
take this stuff seriously.

414
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:00,010
Not just us.
Millions of other kids do too.

415
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,880
I forgot how much this pauly
stuff means to people.

416
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,620
So you'll go back to being pauly?

417
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,790
Yeah, I guess being
a big furry toilet's tough,

418
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,690
But it's a living.

419
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,990
Besides the kids need me.

420
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,060
They're not the only ones.

421
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,490
Go ahead,
Ms. Bitterman.

422
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,130
Give me my "c+" and go get your man.

423
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:22,070
- Oh, Hank.
- Joy, I'm so glad you're here.

424
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,700
These kids made me realize
I don't want to be alone.

425
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,000
Is that Dr. Mittens
in there?

426
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,870
Are you ready to meet him?

427
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,010
Let's take this to the next level, baby.

428
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,540
Come on, Dr. Mittens.

429
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,680
There's someone I want you to meet.

430
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,450
Yeah, I don't think this is gonna work out.

431
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:50,060
But I think this will.

432
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,440
Uh, this isn't gonna
affect my grade, is it?

433
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,800
Hard to believe this is our seventh week.

434
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,900
Feels just like our fifth.

435
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,600
Aw, in here?

436
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,630
- No, in here.
- Me too.

437
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,300
You feeling what I'm feeling?

438
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,040
Gas station Sushi all over again.

439
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,970
Been looking all over for this.

440
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,780
No no no no no! Oh.

441
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,980
Oh boy.

442
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,380

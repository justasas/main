1
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,060
Aw, look at us going on a bike ride together, having a picnic.

2
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,450
Fresh air, protective headgear-- romantic and responsible.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,230
Yeah, responsible for my helmet hair.

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,660
- But you're worth it.
- Thanks.

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,210
We're gonna be so good on "celebrity first mates," 'cause we're first mates.

6
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:28,570
"Celebrity first mates"?

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:29,930
Yeah, it's the quiz show.

8
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,260
Remember, I told you about it-- "tween week" and the studio shows are competing for their charity, remember?

9
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,730
Right right, sorry.

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,160
I-- you just looked so cute in your protective headgear, I totally forgot.

11
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:40,510
Nice save.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,210
- I'll race ya.
- Ah. You're on!

13
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,740
Oh. You look good Chad! Chad!

14
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,690
Chad!

15
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,570
Chad!

16
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,050
Chad! Oh my gosh! Are you Ok?

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,050
Yeah. Yeah. I'm Ok!

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,090
I'm not Ok. Why are there two of you?

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,990
Whoever you are! Guess I hate your boyfriend so hard and you're seeing double

20
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,010
I gotta go!

21
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,130
What's going on?

22
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,000
Alright. Well...!

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,410
The truth is....

24
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,160
.... Get back here Chad!

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,950
Chad?

26
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,480
Maybe I fell out of my bike!

27
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,430
I'm so bored.

28
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,250
- Wanna play video games?
- Nah.

29
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,270
Wanna get out the blender

30
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,140
Yeah, that's original.

31
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,620
- What-- what was that?
- Nothin'.

32
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,760
At least I'm tryin'.

33
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,810
Hey, whoa whoa whoa.
What was that?

34
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,480
- Nothin'.
- No no no.

35
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,290
- You said somethin'.
- Ah!

36
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,120
That argument we had was the most exciting thing we've done all week.

37
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,960
Wanna do it again?

38
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,840
Nah.

39
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Oh, what's happened to us?

40
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,380
Let's face it, dude-- we're in a rut.

41
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,370
You're bored with each other?

42
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,990
Yeah.

43
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,970
Now you know how the rest of us feel.

44
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,780
Which is why you two better get your act together for this week's "Celebrity first mates"

45
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,910
Oh, the game show?

46
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,860
Yeah. That'll be fun.

47
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,480
I forgot what fun is.

48
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:35,220
Oh, I'll tell you what fun is-- it's me fulfilling my dream of being this week's celebrity

49
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,000
You guys, you are never going to believe what just happened to me.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,450
Oh, remember when things used to happen to us?

51
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,420
Okay, I just saw two chads.

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,190
Since you're all staring at me like I'm a nut job, I'll provide more detail.

53
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,620
There was one chad on a golf cart and one chad on a bicycle.

54
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,280
That information doesn't make you any less of a nut job.

55
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,250
I know. What's going on?

56
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,570
I'll tell you what's going on here.

57
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,660
Chad has an avatar.

58
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,400
Oh, that's ridiculous.

59
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,710
- It's a hologram.
- Oh please.

60
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,410
Clearly chad's using a lookalike to cheat on her.

61
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,590
Yeah, I'm gonna go with avatar.

62
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,820
Look, I know it's hard to hear, sonny, but guys are dogs.

63
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,250
And hollywood guys are the worst dogs of all.

64
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,450
Ah, it's true.

65
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,750
We are.

66
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,140
Someday.

67
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,200
You know what? This is silly.

68
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,330
I'm sure there's some logical explanation for this.

69
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,200
I'm just gonna go ask him

70
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,250
one of him, if I can figure out which one.

71
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,990
Well, that rules out hologram.

72
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:02,270
I never saw "avatar," so I'm in no position to judge.

73
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,960
But I do know that I saw two of you.

74
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,060
So where's your secret girlfriend, chad?

75
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,210
First of all, there's no secret girlfriend.

76
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,290
Second of all, you didn't see "avatar"?

77
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,430
You wouldn't take me.

78
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,510
You mean chad wouldn't take you.

79
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,490
Sonny, I'm not chad.

80
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,350
I'm his stunt double, chaz.

81
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,220
You know what?
I'm not buying it and neither is my stunt double bunny.

82
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,730
Chad dylan cooper to wardrobe, please.

83
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,220
Well go.

84
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:36,980
I would if I were chad dylan cooper, but I'm not.

85
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,120
I'm a completely different person.

86
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,860
I'm chaz milton looper.

87
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,560
- Really?
- Indeed.

88
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,200
"Indeed"?

89
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:52,070
No no no, you were supposed " and then we would have gone, " " yeah well, like I said, chaz.

90
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,240
Yeah well, like I said, chaz.

91
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,410
All right.

92
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:01,940
- This isn't over, Cha..

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,830
..Z.

94
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,540
Well, I'm gonna go to wardrobe to find the ....D

95
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,150
You cheating cheater.

96
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,440
He's cheating on you with me.

97
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,320
Now that's what I'm talking about.

98
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,220
You know what?
We're through, chaz.

99
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,770
Did you hear that?

100
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,820
Chaz, you're through.

101
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,650
Chaz?

102
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,220
You mean, you're not-- you're not chad?

103
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,380
- No. I'm Chazzzzz
- Not "ddd"?

104
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,590
No. You just broke me up with my girlfriend.

105
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,630
Wait a second.
I'm not convinced.

106
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,730
You hate this, don't you?
See, I know you and you hate this.

107
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,790
What are you doing?

108
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,770
Oh my gosh, you didn't immediately just fix your hair.

109
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,570
You're not Chad.

110
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,400
Indeed.

111
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,430
This is getting way too weird.

112
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,050
Okay, I'm really sorry about your girlfriend.

113
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:23,540
- Should I call her?
- No, it's okay. I'll handle it.

114
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,600
Honestly, I don't blame you for being upset.

115
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,810
Good. thank you.
I-- I'll get out of your hair.

116
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:33,070
But I'm not letting you out of my sight, not until I get my hands on the real chad.

117
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,070
You're coming with me.

118
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,290
- Want any toppings?
- No.

119
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,300
Not even a nut, a sprinkle or a shaving?

120
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,050
What's the point?

121
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,920
I guess this pretty much sums us up.

122
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:54,750
Yep, just a boring mix of chocolate and vanilla.

123
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,270
You know, if we eat this fast enough, we'll get a brain freeze.

124
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,400
Yeah.

125
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,430
At least we'll feel something.

126
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,100
Probably not.

127
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,980
All right, ferrigno.

128
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,650
What's it gonna take to buy you out?

129
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,190
I don't want your money.

130
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,560
What I want is to make a direct deposit into your face.

131
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,160
Unless you're gonna get your daddy to fight for you, MacKENZIE?

132
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,440
I fight my own battles, ferrigno.

133
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,240
Cut cut!

134
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:31,430
Bring-- bring my stunt double chaz in here to get punched in the face by lou ferrigno. go go.

135
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,720
One second, buddy.

136
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,440
Chaz?

137
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,160
I get paid no matter who I punch.

138
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,340
Chaz!

139
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,170
Move it, hulk.

140
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:48,130
Look, it's weird enough that there are two of you.

141
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,670
It's even weirder that when I found out there were two of you, you both ran off.

142
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,010
What are you hiding?
Which one of you is which?

143
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,660
Quick, chaz, mix it up.

144
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,410
- Ah!
- Ha!

145
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,650
Sorry, chad, you're gonna have to take this punch yourself.

146
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,740
What's going on? Why were you pretending to be chaz before?

147
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,130
Has chaz ever pretended to be you?

148
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,030
Were you even on our bike date?

149
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,810
No. But I have a really good reason.

150
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,450
Dazzle me.

151
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,540
I don't know how to bike.

152
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,870
What was that?

153
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,470
I said I don't know how to ( mumbling ) Ride a bike.

154
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,190
- Excuse me?
- I don't know how to ride a bike!

155
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,730
Yeah no, I heard you the first time.
I just couldn't believe it.

156
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:59,720
Look, I have a fear of spokes and pedals and this hitting the cement.

157
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,650
You know what?

158
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,550
That's such a relief.

159
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:07,580
I mean, grady thought you were an avatar

160
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,200
Nico thought you were a hologram

161
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,080
Tawni thought you were cheating on me.

162
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:15,240
- Ridiculous.
- I know, right?

163
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,400
You know, now that I think about it, what you did was really sweet.

164
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,300
I mean, rather than you letting me down

165
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,130
I went to the trouble of getting a stunt double for this one thing.

166
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,030
Uh-huh.

167
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,190
It wasn't this one thing, was it?

168
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,600
Funny story.

169
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,690
When you're the #1 tween star

170
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,640
You have certain contractual obligations that preclude you from

171
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,850
putting yourself in harm's way.

172
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,830
Story's not funny yet.

173
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:49,480
Exactly what dates put you in harm's way?

174
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,980
Wait, that wasn't you?

175
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,570
There were pointy things involved.

176
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,470
Uh, harm's way.

177
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,680
What else?

178
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,170
Here's your cocoa.

179
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,030
- Seriously?
- Hot liquid, sonny.

180
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,030
That's classic harm's way.

181
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,290
You done?

182
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,000
Happy one-week anniversary, myseñorita.

183
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,820
And they said we wouldn't last.

184
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,370
- Olé!
- Olé!

185
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,760
Our anniversary?

186
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,020
You know mexican makes me gassy, and that would put you in harm's way.

187
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,310
See?

188
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,440
Just looking out for you.

189
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,340
No you weren't.

190
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,960
A stunt double? Really?

191
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:49,070
I mean, I just... I can't...
- Spit it out, sonny.

192
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,510
We're over.

193
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,050
Spit it back in.
Spit it back in.

194
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,880
No, you know what? We're done.

195
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,220
Our whole relationship has been a lie.

196
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,500
No. It hasn't

197
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,660
I just couldn't risk getting hurt.

198
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,070
So instead you hurt me.

199
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:10,060
- Sonny, no wait! I couldn't... just...
- There you are, chaz.

200
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,600
Let's do this thing.

201
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:15,740
No! Seriously, I'm not "Chazzz". I'm "chaddd"!

202
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,560
Well, I got rid of him.

203
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,770
You and chad broke up?

204
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,800
Yeah, me and nico are this close to breaking up.

205
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,970
Are we really gonna have this conversation now?

206
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,690
Chad was so afraid of hurting himself

207
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,030
that he sent his stunt double chaz

208
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,550
on dates with me that he thought would put him in danger.

209
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,320
What kind of danger?

210
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,970
Rock climbing, rollerblading, eating mexican food.

211
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,600
- Mexican food?
- What kind of mexican food?

212
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,070
Well, if it was dangerous or if it gave you gas, I would have been doing it with chaz.

213
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:04,950
This chaz guy sounds like exactly what we need to get us out of our rut.

214
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,550
Yeah. Come on, I want to stop by the dressing room to get my spelunking hat.

215
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,760
- We're back, baby!
- Yeah! Ha ha!

216
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,980
I'm back too, baby.

217
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,420
Was I not clear?

218
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,290
Chad, we're over.
I don't want you back.

219
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,760
But sonny, we're supposed to be going on "celebrity first mates" together.

220
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,330
Don't you want to set sail on the sea of forgiveness?

221
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,650
No, I'd rather set sail on the titanic.

222
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,630
At least those people got a nice meal before they went down.

223
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,220
I don't want to do anything with you.

224
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:47,160
In fact, I'm gonna do the show with the person that I thought was you-- chaz milton looper.

225
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,010
What did you do to chaz milton looper?

226
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,760
We broke him.

227
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,430
We broke him bad.

228
00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:02,030
You know, sword fighting while spelunking sounded like a good idea on the car ride there.

229
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:06,860
Yeah, but waving a sharp object near a rope as you're dangling over the center of the earth

230
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,410
turns out you're in an ambulance on the way back.

231
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,030
Oh, maybe you're gonna have to call chad.

232
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,680
Save your minutes. I'm right here.

233
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,960
No way.

234
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,300
Beaten, battered and bandaged, chaz is still gonna be a better partner than you.

235
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,410
You heard that, right, chaz?

236
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,520
Ooh, was that a yes?

237
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,760
No, he just wants his pudding.

238
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,530
Ah hello?

239
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:38,820
I'm right here, cast free.

240
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,820
Can he work a buzzer?

241
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,160
See? chaddy can.

242
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,140
How about with a pencil?

243
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,780
Here you go.

244
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,840
What am I thinking?
I can't do the show.

245
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,230
But you have to, sonny.
Think about your charity.

246
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,820
And what is my charity, chad?

247
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,520
Kids?

248
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,940
Um, rainforests.

249
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,180
Orphaned armadillos?

250
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,600
He just broke his tongue on the pudding.

251
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:19,320
Well, that's everything.

252
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,510
All right. I guess I don't have a choice.

253
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,340
But I'm doing it for children's literacy, armadill-dork.

254
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,420
See?

255
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,270
We're already moving on to new pet names.

256
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,920
Right? Right? Miss... miss girlfriend of armadill-dork?

257
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,190
Whoa!

258
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:53,310
Once again, here's your host of "celebrity first mates," tawni hart!

259
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,730
Can I get an "aye aye"?

260
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,340
Aye aye.

261
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,990
All right. Let's get right to the first round.

262
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,950
Remember, the more you know about your first mates, the more points you'll get and the more money you'll make for your charity.

263
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,340
- Are you ready?
- Ready!

264
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,700
You'll see, sonny, I won't let you down.

265
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,040
We're gonna kick some booty.

266
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,660
Booty-- like pirate treasures.

267
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,590
Oh! yeah, I totally get it. That's so funny.

268
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,990
All right, first-round questions are for pirate ramora, pirate nico and pirate chad.

269
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,840
Put down your eyepatches.

270
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,820
Where and when did you meet your first mate?

271
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,440
13 Years ago.

272
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,780
We threw up on the same teacup ride.

273
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,140
All over father diggins.

274
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,140
Why didn't you ring in?

275
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,180
Because you don't remember. Nice.

276
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:53,850
Next question: What's your first mate's favorite video game?

277
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,580
That's easy-- all of them.

278
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,150
I do love all of them.

279
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,150
- How did you know?
- Who's player 2?

280
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,210
- You are.
- Yeah.

281
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:08,630
Chad, you know that my favorite game is "dance dance dance attack," remember?

282
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,990
Which I played with chaz, didn't i?

283
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,300
Three dances and an attack?

284
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,310
Come on, sonny, I could not risk it.

285
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,000
Put yourself in my shoes.

286
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,800
You don't even put yourself in your shoes.

287
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:30,000
Grady's favorite fruit is cantaloupe, cut in a half moon served with lemon

288
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,620
Yeah!

289
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,590
Squid tentacles.

290
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,800
Those are my least-favorite type of tentacles.

291
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,780
Knuckle hair!

292
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,640
That is why I can't watch robin williams.

293
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:47,410
Har-hook! oh!

294
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:57,280
Yeah!

295
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,820
I can't believe it.

296
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,280
You didn't answer one question right.

297
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,190
Oh come on, do you know my least-favorite kind of tentacles?

298
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,190
Cuttlefish.

299
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,170
And you are a good listener.

300
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,980
Nico and grady are pillaging their opponents - with 23 points.

301
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,090
Tween gladiators have six.

302
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:24,120
And in the brig are sonny and chad, with -4.

303
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,050
Only 60 seconds left in round one.

304
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,650
Then it's full speed ahead.

305
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,600
What's your first mate's birthday?

306
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,190
- You better know this.
- APRIL 3rd.

307
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,200
You-- oh!

308
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,100
AUGUST 20th.

309
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,850
What's my middle name?

310
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,640
- Ruth.
- Ruth?

311
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,420
What's my mom's name?

312
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,190
- Ruth?
- Connie!

313
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,500
- Who's ruth?
- I don't know.

314
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,100
What are you doing?
I ask the questions.

315
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,920
Well, I've got a few questions of my own.

316
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,310
Mutiny!

317
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,490
Okay, I'm gonna go really basic here.

318
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,600
What's my phone number?

319
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,190
Hang on, hang on, that is not a fair question.

320
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,990
Nobody knows each other's phone numbers.

321
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,710
We're all on speed dial.

322
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,970
Phone number-- 555-0100.

323
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,850
Cell: 555-0105.

324
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,140
Emergency contact: Nico harris.

325
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,250
555-0199!

326
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,460
- Let's get the "argh" right.
- I'm tryin'.

327
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,830
That's the end of round one.
We'll be right back after this commercial break.

328
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,680
Aw man!

329
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,610
We just clobbered to death these scallywags.

330
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,210
You know, we weren't in a rut at all.

331
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,310
Yeah. We didn't need chaz.

332
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,580
We have everything we need right here.

333
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,860
My man.

334
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,740
You see that? Now that's two people who care about each other.

335
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,180
We will never have what they have, chad.

336
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,700
You know why?

337
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,750
Because you know absolutely nothing about me.

338
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,890
Sonny, wait. Please.

339
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,050
- What?
- I do know something about you.

340
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,440
I know you're the first girl who's ever called me out on me bein...

341
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,750
- A jerk?
- Yeah.

342
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,400
But you did it because you knew that beneath at jerk, there was a person worth getting to know.

343
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,230
All I'm asking for, sonny, is a chance to start over and prove you right.

344
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,210
I'm sorry, chad.

345
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,780
It's too late.

346
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,060
Sonny, wait!

347
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,920
Wait, you didn't hear your "parr"ting gift!

348
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,470

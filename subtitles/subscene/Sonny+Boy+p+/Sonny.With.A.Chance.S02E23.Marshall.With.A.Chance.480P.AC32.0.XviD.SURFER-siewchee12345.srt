1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,090
Okay, rehearsal's up.

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,030
And, action.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,430
<i>Konichiwa</i> and welcome.

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,140
To America's favorite Japanese game show:

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,140
"where's the wasabi?"

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,080
One of these pieces of Sushi.

7
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,720
Is loaded with super spicy
Japanese wasabi mustard.

8
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,980
Contestants, where's the wasabi?

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,020
- Is it in the salmon?
- Is it in the salmon?

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,730
Oh, it's just fishy.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,900
Oh oh, octopus.
It's in the octopus.

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,670
Is it in the octopus?

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,040
Uh... Chewy.

14
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,840
- Squishy.
- Hmmm.

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,010
Huh... hoo ha.
Ooh, that's hot.

16
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,210
Oh ah ah!
It's hot!

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,020
Guys, why is there real wasabi in there?

18
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,520
- It burns!
- And that's...

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,290
- How we play "where's the wasabi"?
- Water water!

20
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:08,490
How do we play "where's the funny"?
Because I'm not seeing it.

21
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:11,460
Oh, water!

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:15,500
- But you said you loved this sketch.
- That was 20 minutes ago.

23
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,670
Oh, water water!

24
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:22,340
What's going on? You haven't liked a
single sketch we've written all week.

25
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,880
That's because there's nothing to like.

26
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,010
And this sketch?
This sketch stinks on rice.

27
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,690
See what I did there? Instead of
stinks on ice, I said stinks on rice.

28
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,220
Because it's Sushi.
That's comedy!

29
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,260
And I want to see some by tomorrow.

30
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,930
Ahhh.

31
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,240
So, uh, so did Marshall like the sketch?

49
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,170
- I'm exhausted.
- Yeah.

50
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,040
We've been trying to come up
with a sketch all night.

51
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,350
Okay okay, I got this.

52
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,250
How about this sketch?
Let me just turn the camera on.

53
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,820
Okay.

54
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,120
All right, so there's a lizard, right?

55
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,790
And he goes to the north pole.

56
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,260
And then a bunch of funny stuff happens.

57
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,590
But at the end of it he says,

58
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,860
"iguana wish you
a merry Christmas."

59
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,030
<i>Yeah, ha ha ha!</i>

60
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,200
Who's with me?

61
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,510
We can't send that video to Marshall.

62
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,940
- He's miserable enough already.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,310
This is ridiculous.
What is Marshall's problem?

64
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,350
He's been snippy for weeks.
Nothing makes him happy.

65
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,290
I know, right?
Ooh, I got it...

66
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,550
Who am I?
Who am I? Ready?

67
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,960
See what I did there?
See what I did there?

68
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:44,890
I changed ice to rice, 'cause it's Sushi.

69
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,000
And I'm Marshall pike!

70
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,300
See what I did there?
See what I did there?

71
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,170
My turn, my turn!

72
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,370
I don't have any good ideas.
I just hate all yours.

73
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,510
What?

74
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,640
'cause I'm the boss.

75
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,680
I'm in charge.

76
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,580
Okay.

77
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,480
Unless my mommy calls.

78
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,490
Marshall, it's your mother.

79
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,560
I want you home
by 6:00.

80
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,760
So we can go girdle shopping.

81
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,760
For you.

82
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,070
- That's so good.
- Guys, guys, guys,

83
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,070
Let's call it a night, all right?

84
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,510
Let's just send him Sonny's
stupid iguana thing.

85
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,940
I mean, whatever we send he'll hate anyway.

86
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,710
You know what we should send him.

87
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,780
Is our Marshall impressions.

88
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,420
Ha!
Yeah right.

89
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,520
Seriously though, you should delete those.

90
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,220
No no no, actually I'm gonna
send them right now, Marshall.

91
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:50,590
Come on, you wouldn't dare.

92
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,960
Oh you...
you don't think I would?

93
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,060
- No, come on.
- Um, no.

94
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,560
- You wouldn't dare.
- You don't think I'll do it?

95
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,870
- No!
- No, we just said no.

96
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,600
That's really funny,
'cause I just hit send.

97
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,210
What'd you do?

98
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,440
- Are you crazy? - Relax relax.
I hit delete, okay?

99
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,410
- Oh, trying to scare me.
- Oh my gosh, I hit send!

100
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,650
No, unsend unsend!

101
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,400
Sorry. I feel like I've been
called to the principal's office.

102
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,470
I was home-schooled.
I feel like I'm in my mother's kitchen.

103
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,440
Get ready to move back there because
none of us are keeping our jobs.

104
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,110
Look, relax.
Nobody is losing their jobs, okay?

105
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:42,780
Not if we stick together and tell
Marshall we were just fooling around.

106
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,680
- Yeah.
- We were just blowing off steam.

107
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,750
- Yeah, you're right.
- <i>You're right.</i>

108
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:51,020
- Fire Sonny! - Oh, we have no free will.
She did it!

109
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,590
- Sonny did it.
- Marshall, look,

110
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,700
I'm really really sorry.

111
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,470
We <i>all</i> are.

112
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,770
Look, I'm not happy about what you did.

113
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,270
But it really showed me
how crabby I've been lately.

114
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,770
I guess it's because I turned
40-something last week.

115
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,640
You're 40-something?

116
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,110
Would that something be 50?

117
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:22,290
I always thought by the time
I turned <i>40-something</i>

118
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,130
- I'd be something. - But, Marshall, you are.
You have a really great job.

119
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah, but I always wanted to perform,

120
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:31,330
To be on the stage

121
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,000
"my life with ma";

122
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,540
To hear the applause and the laughter,

123
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,410
Just like you kids do after every show.

124
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,740
Ah well.

125
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,980
I'll just keep bottling it up
and take my anger out on you.

126
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,980
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

127
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,390
Now come up with a sketch that's funny!

128
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,920
- You see what I did there?
- Yeah yeah.

129
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,860
All right, well, at least
we still have our jobs.

130
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,430
Yeah, let's get out of here before
somebody makes things worse.

131
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,740
Hey, where's Sonny?

132
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,240
- Sonny!
- Don't make things worse!

133
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,780
Sonny...

134
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,910
Ahem.

135
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,180
What are you still doing here?

136
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:19,680
Marshall, I think that you
should go for your dream.

137
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,590
And do your one-man show.

138
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,890
Well, I can't just leave and drop.

139
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,090
All my responsibilities
at "so random!"

140
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,090
Why not?
We'll be okay.

141
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,130
Well, I... I guess
it would be a shame.

142
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,600
For a script like this to go to waste.

143
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,100
That's your one-man show?

144
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:39,740
I live with my mother.
There's only one room where I have any privacy.

145
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,410
The first act, second act.

146
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,810
Come on, Marshall,
you don't want to just...

147
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,080
Flush this dream down the toilet.

148
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,780
Do you? No.
You wanna know why?

149
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,280
'cause you were born
to play these "rolls."

150
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,650
See what I did there?

151
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:58,250
Why, yes I did.

152
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,920
I'm convinced.

153
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,760
Sonny, I'm gonna take off two weeks.

154
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,730
And live the dream.

155
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,630
Ooh ooh, I should write
about this in my diary.

156
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,340
"dear diary, I'm taking
the plunge."

157
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,740
It's so freeing with Marshall gone.

158
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,350
I can just sit around
all day reading magazines.

159
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,320
Um, you do that when Marshall is here.

160
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,680
Yes, but do I do this?

161
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,620
Yes.

162
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,360
It just feels freer, okay?

163
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,970
You haven't even gotten dressed yet?

164
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,010
Oh no no no no.

165
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,140
I slept in my shirt and jeans.

166
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,180
I changed into this.

167
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,710
Wanna know why?

168
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,780
'cause I can.
Marshall's not here.

169
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,550
So every day is jammy day.

170
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,190
What?

171
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,130
- You were doing jammy day?
- Yeah.

172
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,230
I'm doing jammy day!

173
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,600
Jammy slam!

174
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,570
So are you wearing a diaper?

175
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,810
No!

176
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,810
Well, ahem, me neither.

177
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,250
But thanks to Sonny,

178
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,720
We could totally wear one if we wanted to.

179
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,420
Uh, excuse me, kids,
is this "so random!"?

180
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,020
Yeah, it sure is.
How can we help you?

181
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,890
I'm Stanley.
I'll be filling in for Marshall.

182
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,260
Great, there goes our freedom.

183
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,730
- Yeah.
- Huh.

184
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,860
From a guy named Stanley?
Please.

185
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,070
♪ pushover! ♪.

186
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,010
You're right, <i>stanley</i> can be
a bit of a pushover.

187
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,610
But you know who isn't?

188
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,710
Savage stan!

189
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,420
Are you ready to take
your comedy to the extreme?

190
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,420
Because until Marshall comes back.

191
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,290
We're going to yuk it up
gladiator-style!

192
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,070
I'm scared.

193
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,800
Bet you wish you were
wearing a diaper now, huh?

194
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,330
Listen up, you comedy cream puffs.

195
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,400
I was the executive producer.

196
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,870
At "tween gladiators," but there was.

197
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,140
An incident.

198
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,040
And now I am your new executive producer.

199
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,210
Ah. ( Chuckles )
excuse me, Mr. Savage.

200
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,310
Uh, d-define incident.

201
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,720
The pinkie is overrated.

202
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,000
I knew we were one short.
Now get in line!

203
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,510
Now here's the deal:
Your sketches are weak.

204
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,610
Your jokes are flabby.

205
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,150
And your characters are as
undeveloped as this guy's arms.

206
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,650
- I'm a 12-year-old girl.
- No excuse!

207
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,920
It kind of is.

208
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,320
Zip it!

209
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,490
Now we are gonna put the punch.

210
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,290
In punchline, the slap.

211
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,330
In slapstick.
And if we break a few bones.

212
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,100
In the process,

213
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,830
It'll be funny.

214
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,310
Broken funny bones.

215
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,680
Do you see what I did there?

216
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,320
I don't like what you did there.

217
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,360
Good morning, cream puffs.

218
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,530
Good morning, savage stan.

219
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,390
Wasn't he clean-shaven
last night?

220
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,660
Oh yeah, he was.

221
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,630
I shave four times a day!

222
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,740
- It is my private shame!
- Okay okay.

223
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,800
Now!

224
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,740
Marshall says your
"where's the wasabi?" sketch.

225
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,710
Was weak.
That is because <i>you</i> are weak.

226
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,250
- Oh. - So you are going
to be doing push-ups.

227
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,180
Over bowls of wasabi.

228
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,090
Now drop and give me funny!

229
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,730
- Where is the wasabi?!
- ( Falters ) is it in the salmon?

230
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,400
No.
Where is the wasabi?!

231
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,730
Is it in the octopus?

232
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,610
- No. - I don't know
what he wants us to say.

233
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,210
Where is the wasabi?

234
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,110
It's in my eyes!

235
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,410
Yes!

236
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,750
Now that is funny.

237
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,450
It burns.
Oh, it burns.

238
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,560
Knock knock.

239
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,290
Who's there?

240
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,660
Knock knock.
Who's there?

241
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,700
Hey, guys, good news.
The doctor says I'm gonna be fine.

242
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,600
- As long as I don't get anything else in my eyes.
- Oh, that's great.

243
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Why is there wasabi on that thing?

244
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,110
Oh, it burns.
Oh, it burns.

245
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,410
This guy kills me.

246
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,980
Ow, it burns, guys.
It burns bad!

247
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,590
Next we are going to do.

248
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,990
An observational exercise.

249
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,120
Because comedy is all around you.

250
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,590
Now who's our first volunteer?

251
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,330
Run!

252
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,810
Call for help.
Call for help.

253
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,670
Call for help.

254
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,780
Hi, Marshall, how's it going?

255
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,150
Sonny, Sonny, you pushing
me out the door was.

256
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,150
The greatest thing that
ever happened to me.

257
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,350
Ask him when he's coming back.

258
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,120
So, Marshall, any chance we'll be
seeing you sooner than two weeks?

259
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,760
- <i>Absolutely.</i>
- Great.

260
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,860
If you come to the theater,

261
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,300
'cause that's where I'm going
to be for the rest of my life.

262
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:28,970
- I'm quitting "so random!"
- You're quitting "so random!"?

263
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,930
- No!
- No!

264
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,700
<i>No!</i>

265
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,840
Thanks.
All right, guys.

266
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,170
Good news... the wasabi
blindness is temporary.

267
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,980
I just have to avoid physical activity.

268
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,110
For the next three seconds, so...

269
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,580
Three, two... ( screams )

270
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,820
<i>Marshall! Marshall!</i>
<i>Marshall!</i>

271
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,990
<i>Marshall!</i>

272
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,760
Guys, I think it's this way.

273
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,700
- Marshall!
- Whoa!

274
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,800
- We gotta talk to you!
- Wait!

275
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,370
You can't stop Marshall
from living his dream.

276
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,540
Sonny, enough!
We heard you the whole ride here.

277
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,370
- Uh-huh.
- Whole ride!

278
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,670
- Blah blah blah.
- Anyways, we have to get Marshall back.

279
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,180
- Before savage stan kills us.
- Us?

280
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,210
Us? <i>Hello!</i>

281
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,710
Temporary wasabi blindness.

282
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,150
You guys, Marshall is having
the time of his life.

283
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,320
You can't just take that away from
him for your own selfish needs.

284
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,520
Do you even know us?

285
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,690
Hi, kids, what are you doing here?

286
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,530
- Oh marshall...
- No no no!

287
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,560
- We just wanted to tell you...
- Tell you how excited we are...

288
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,530
-... About you coming back... -...
Coming back to where you belong:

289
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:39,430
The theater.

290
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,170
Oh, I know why you kids are here.

291
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,740
You couldn't wait to see the show, huh?

292
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,680
- Nope! - All right, I'm gonna
give you a little preview.

293
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,840
Of "my life with ma"!
Come on.

294
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,910
Sit sit sit sit.

295
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,780
Ooh, it's my first audience.

296
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,950
All right, ready?

297
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,890

00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:10,090
Oh. You know, I've been thinking
a lot about dreams lately.

348
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,230
And I realized that,
you know, there's a reason.

349
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,360
Why people call them dreams.

350
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,830
And not realities, you know what I mean?

351
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,570
Oh yeah!
For most people.

352
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,740
Oh, those poor delusional saps.

353
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,580
Look, Marshall,

354
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,740
This is gonna be hard for me to say,

355
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,780
But your show, it just...

356
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,780
Needed a little something.

357
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,120
M-more like a big...
a <i>big</i> something.

358
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,130
Sonny, I'm not stupid. I think I know
where you're going with this thing.

359
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,790
Thank goodness.

360
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,560
I just... I didn't want
to have to say the words.

361
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,430
You don't have to.
Let me say it for you.

362
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,230
You want to be in the show, huh?

363
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,100
- I do? - I knew it!
I knew it.

364
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,140
It may be a one-man show, but my dream
is big enough for the two of us.

365
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,710
Sonny, you are gonna play ma.

366
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,910
What?

367
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,580
Yeah.

368
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,780
<i>♪ I wiped his tush ♪</i>

369
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,450

376
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,180
That's odd... that cheering
sounds a lot like booing.

377
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,420
No no, they're not booing.

378
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:48,790
They're saying, "bo-ooy, that
was a good... " who am I kidding?

379
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:51,690
Yeah, at least they're not throwing
anything, you know what I mean?

380
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,800
Hey!
Hey, that was Tawni's shoe.

381
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:57,370
What was I thinking, having a dream?

382
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,530
<i>Get off the stage!</i>

383
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,340
You know what?
You're right.

384
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,640
- I am getting off the stage.
- No...

385
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:07,170
Oh, and grab my shoe!

386
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,810
Shame on you for booing my boy.

387
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,610
Sit down!

388
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,450
He deserves better than that.

389
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,590
Is this still part of the show?

390
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,960
I'm not sure.

391
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,960
Instead of booing him for his failure,

392
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,660
You should be applauding him.

393
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,600
For his courage...

394
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,670
For taking a chance on his dream.

395
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,000
So let's hear it for my boy.

396
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,840
I said let's hear it for my boy!

397
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,480
Sonny, it's okay.
My dream is over.

398
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,480
Marshall, you told us your dream was.

399
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,920
To do a show and hear
applause and laughter.

400
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,090
You know what? You do that
every week on "so random!"

401
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,860
Without you pushing us to be
our funniest and to do our best,

402
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,830
The show would...

403
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,900
Stink on rice.

404
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,730
See what I did there?

405
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,170
I see what you did there.

406
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,240
That laughter and applause
that you hear every week.

407
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,410
Is just as much for you as it is for us.

408
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,080
I guess I never thought about it that way.

409
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,350
I guess I was already living my dream.

410
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,950
So will you come back
to "so random!"?

411
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,620
Absolutely.

412
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,260
My performing days are over.

413
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,330
Yes!

414
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,100
- Oh man, it's a miracle.
- What?

415
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,310
- You can see?
- No, Marshall's coming back.

416
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:54,020
Do your eyes feel like they're on fire?

417
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,140
It's burns.

418
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,230
Are you experiencing dry mouth?

419
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:03,120
Does it feel like you've been smacked
in the face with a giant fluff stick?

420
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,390
Then you are using your Wasabi wrong.
Or using wasabi can lead to...

421
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,990
Itchy Eyes, Cripsy Corneas,

422
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,570
Pyrotechnic Pupils.

423
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,300
Volcanic Throat.

424
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,720
Vomiting.

425
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,280
- And feeling of loneliness.
- Guys?

426
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,020
You need to remember: Wasabi is a food!

427
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,430
Not a face cream!

428
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,480
Wasabi: a little of it is a tasty treat.

429
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,650
But too much of it... does that.

430
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,570
- It's burns!
- Please use wasabi responsably.

431

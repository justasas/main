1
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,109
- Move!
- Move it!

2
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,195
Move!

3
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,515
Move!

4
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,835
Now!

5
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,515
It's me home.

6
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,278
- Bye, Bruno!
- Bye, Bruno!

7
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,799
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Mum, what's going on?

8
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,790
- We're celebrating.
- Celebrating?

9
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,751
Your father's been given a promotion.

10
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,678
- That means a better job.
- I know what promotion is.

11
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,551
So we're having a little party
to celebrate.

12
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,875
He's still going to be a soldier though,
isn't he?

13
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,629
Yes, my lamb.
Yes, just a more important one now.

14
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,437
There's some even more exciting news,

15
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,836
but I think Dad wanted
to tell you about that himself.

16
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,636
- Moving? Where to?
- To the countryside.

17
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,432
That's miles away.
What about Karl and Leon and Martin?

18
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,913
Sweetheart, I know it's hard,

19
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,430
but we're all having to say goodbye
to our friends for the time being.

20
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,948
Anyway, we'll make new ones
where we're going. Won't we?

21
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,151
Of course you are.
You'll make lots of new friends.

22
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,875
Bruno, you can have your friends
around in the morning before we go.

23
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,390
Think of it as an adventure,
like in one of your books.

24
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,429
But this is the best house ever.

25
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,549
Well, you never know. The house
we're going to might be even better.

26
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,636
Dad says it's got a garden.

27
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,399
Look, the thing is, Bruno,
the thing about being a soldier,

28
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,512
is that life is not so much about choice,
it's more about duty,

29
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,597
so if your country needs
you to go somewhere, you go.

30
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,837
Now, of course, going somewhere else
is much easier

31
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,634
when you know that your family
are so delighted to go with you.

32
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,993
Bruno! You're getting bigger
every time I see you.

33
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,110
It's only been a week, Nathalie.

34
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,038
Well, perhaps it's me
that's getting smaller.

35
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,273
So, you two,

36
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,153
well, what do you think of all this?
Moving out of Berlin?

37
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,271
Well, Mummy and Daddy say
it's a good thing,

38
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,231
so I suppose it must be.

39
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,236
Children, be angels, will you?
Pass some food around.

40
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,238
<i>Heil Hitler!</i>

41
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,832
Congratulations.

42
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,310
- Doesn't he look wonderful?
- Absolutely.

43
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,355
I'm so proud of you, my boy.

44
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,113
Oh, dear. I sometimes wonder
if this is all down to me,

45
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,278
making you those costumes
for your little plays when you were tiny.

46
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,995
- You used to adore all that dressing up.
- Nathalie...

47
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,112
Does it still make you feel special,
Ralf dear?

48
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,513
The uniform and what it stands for?

49
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,189
Mother, it's a party.
Let's not spoil things.

50
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,636
Me, spoil things?

51
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,992
You should be careful.

52
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,112
Airing your views so publicly
could land you in trouble.

53
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,593
You know that.

54
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,637
So, how long are we losing you for,
my boy?

55
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,950
- Until the war is won, I would think.
- Well, not so long then.

56
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,908
Bruno!

57
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,311
All right, Bruno. Time to say goodbye.

58
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,631
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye!

59
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,909
"Time has come for me to sleep
Lord, I thank Thee for Thy keep

60
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,270
"Watch this night well over me
And teach me, Lord, to trust in Thee

61
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,676
"Care for children, sick and poor
Grant them, Lord, Thy blessing more

62
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,076
"And this I pray in Jesus' name
Care for my family just the same"

63
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,155
Amen.

64
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,999
Children, look. Look! Our new home.

65
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,549
I have some business to take care of.
I'll see you shortly.

66
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,636
Well, what do we think?

67
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,436
Come on. It's lovely.

68
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,836
You two choose your rooms.
I'll have Maria come

69
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,232
and help you unpack.

70
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,230
What do you think of it, Maria?
The new house.

71
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,071
It's not for me to say.

72
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,078
But it won't feel like home
until we make it feel like home, will it?

73
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,878
Is he already up?

74
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,319
Who was that?

75
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,920
One of your father's soldiers,
I suppose.

76
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,919
- He looked very serious.
- Well, they are, aren't they?

77
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,873
- Why are we whispering?
- I don't know.

78
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,475
- And play with who?
- The children over on the farm.

79
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,478
Farm? I didn't see a farm.
And that one, too.

80
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,795
You can only see it from my room.

81
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,077
And there are some children there?

82
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,873
- Yes, quite a few.
- That's good.

83
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,879
- So, I'll be able to play with them.
- I don't see why not.

84
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,708
I'll wait a little bit,
just to see what they're like,

85
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,957
- because they look a bit strange.
- The children do?

86
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,512
- Well, and the farmers.
- What sort of strange?

87
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,473
I'm sorry.

88
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,839
Vegetables.

89
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,269
There.

90
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,118
Bruno, have you unpacked everything?

91
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,709
Because I think you should
go back upstairs and finish off.

92
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,398
Thank you, ma'am.

93
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,549
Bruno.

94
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,190
- I told you they were strange.
- Who?

95
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,073
The farmers. They wear pyjamas.

96
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,479
Bruno, I was just
coming to look for you.

97
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,836
Well, thank you for that.
That was extremely useful.

98
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,270
<i>- I'll be over to see you later.
- Of course, Herr Kommandant.</i>

99
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,708
Come in.

100
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,798
Sit down, sit down.

101
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,831
Well, what do you think?

102
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,028
Oh, dear.

103
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,312
I want to go home.

104
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,788
You are home, Bruno.
Home is where the family is.

105
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,432
Isn't that right?

106
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,433
Bruno, you have to at least
give the place a chance.

107
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,118
I promise you,
it won't be long before you...

108
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,631
Why do the farmers wear pyjamas?
I can see them from my window.

109
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,472
The thing is, Bruno, those people...

110
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,152
Well, you see,
they're not really people at all.

111
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,833
Bruno, who told you it was a farm?

112
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,155
- Was it Maria?
- No.

113
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,077
It is a farm, isn't it?

114
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,675
Yes.

115
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,229
Is it to do with your new job?

116
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,953
All you need to know
about my work here, Bruno,

117
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,675
is that it's very important
to our country and to you.

118
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,749
We're working very hard
to make this world a better place

119
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,028
for you to grow up in.

120
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,038
But you're not a farmer.
You're a soldier.

121
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,231
Bruno, can you come and help me
finish sorting out in the kitchen?

122
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,829
I can still play with them, though?
The children.

123
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,989
I don't think so, Bruno. No.

124
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,430
Like you say, they're a bit strange.
A bit...

125
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,391
Well, they're different.

126
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,509
Don't worry, my darling.
We'll find you some new friends,

127
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,199
but they won't be the ones
from the farm.

128
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,709
Ralf, you promised.

129
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,115
- You said it was miles away.
- It is.

130
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,549
How was I to know he could see it
from the bedroom window?

131
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,114
There was one of them in our kitchen.

132
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,399
- Master Bruno, how are you today?
- Fed up.

133
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,593
You said the same thing
every day for two whole weeks.

134
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,552
- It's true.
- Well, you should be out playing.

135
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,672
- Playing with who?
- I don't know. Gretel?

136
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,636
- Well, you can make your own fun.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

137
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,874
One thing's for sure,

138
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,595
sitting around being miserable
won't make things any happier.

139
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,433
- Bruno, what are you doing?
- Exploring!

140
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,597
No! No, not in the back.
I told you, it's out of bounds.

141
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,518
- Explore at the front.
- But I've explored it all.

142
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,393
- Well, find something else to do.
- Like what?

143
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,237
Come back in now,
and we'll think of something.

144
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,471
So, children,
what are you doing today?

145
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,715
- Same as yesterday.
- And what was that?

146
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,991
- Same as the day before.
- Except you went exploring.

147
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,594
- I like exploring.
- Where did you go?

148
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,315
I wanted to look in the back garden,
but Mum wouldn't let me.

149
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,992
The back garden?

150
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,238
Well, God forbid.

151
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,236
I expect you'll be missing
those friends of yours.

152
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,872
I even miss school.

153
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,598
Well, I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

154
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,198
Anyway, you won't be missing it
for long.

155
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,630
- Really?
- I've arranged a tutor for you both.

156
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,073
<i>A Herr Liszt
will be visiting twice a week.</i>

157
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,473
So we're not going to school?

158
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,151
School's coming here?

159
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,555
On an old bicycle, I gather.

160
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,190
It's a bird without the...

161
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,556
Good morning, little man.
And how are you this morning?

162
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,238
- Can I ask you a favour?
- Well, you can ask.

163
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,074
Are there any spare tyres around?

164
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,509
An old one
from one of the trucks or something?

165
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,313
Well, the only spare tyre
I've seen around here

166
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,635
belongs to Lieutenant Meinberg.

167
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,516
- Well, is he using it?
- Yes, he's very attached to it.

168
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,073
Stop it. He doesn't understand.
He's only eight.

169
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,556
You're only 12,
so stop pretending you're any older.

170
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,318
What do you want a tyre for, anyway?

171
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,352
- I want to make a swing.
- A swing?

172
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,356
That does sound exciting.

173
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,395
You!

174
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,353
Here, now.

175
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,875
Move!

176
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,712
Take this boy to the outhouse
in the back garden.

177
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,591
There are some tyres in there.
He will select one.

178
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,791
You will carry it where he asks.
Do you understand?

179
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,673
Well, little man,
what are you waiting for?

180
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,272
How about this one?

181
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,472
Where's my mum?

182
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,593
She's out.

183
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,714
- When is she back?
- Soon, I expect.

184
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,512
But don't worry.

185
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,590
- But I might bleed to death.
- No, you won't.

186
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,871
- Will I need to go to hospital?
- No. It's only a small cut.

187
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,070
Come on. It's not that bad.

188
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,151
There, all better.

189
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,190
- What's your name?
- Pavel.

190
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,152
Now, you've got to sit still
for a few minutes

191
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,114
before you start
walking around on that again.

192
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,594
Will you tell my mum what happened?

193
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,393
I think she's going to see it for herself.

194
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,794
She'll probably take me to a doctor.

195
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,672
I don't think so.

196
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,912
- It could be worse than it looks.
- It isn't.

197
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,713
How would you know?
You're not a doctor.

198
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,474
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

199
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,638
You peel potatoes.

200
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,916
I practised as a doctor.

201
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,593
Before I...

202
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,392
Before I came here.

203
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:32,554
You couldn't have been much good
then, if you had to practise.

204
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,111
Now, what are you going to be
when you grow up?

205
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,118
I know. An explorer.

206
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,632
How do you know that?

207
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,637
Is it nice on the farm?

208
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,680
Bruno. Bruno, what happened to you?

209
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,349
I made a swing,
but I fell off it and cut my knee.

210
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,915
But Pavel here, he carried me in
and put a bandage on it.

211
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,677
- Go to your room.
- But Pavel says I...

212
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,915
Don't argue. Go to your room.

213
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,199
Thank you.

214
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,160
It's not fair, you having this view.

215
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,077
Well, I'm not swapping.

216
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,797
I think school's here.

217
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,635
No, I mean more recent history.

218
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,309
- Are you interested in current affairs?
- Yes, very.

219
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,989
So, you'll be aware of the situation

220
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,235
in which our great nation
presently finds itself.

221
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,598
Yes. I read newspapers whenever I can
and one of Father's men

222
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,596
keeps me up to date
on everything that's happening.

223
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,077
Good. And you, Bruno.
Have you been reading newspapers?

224
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,150
- Have you been reading anything?
- Books.

225
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,231
Good. What sort of books?

226
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,151
Adventure books, mainly.

227
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,115
You know, knights in shining armour,
exploring strange lands and stuff,

228
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,830
and silly princesses
always getting in the way.

229
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,352
Well, this is why I'm here to help.
You're how old now, Bruno? Eight?

230
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,031
Time to get your head
out of those fiction books

231
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,116
and start learning about fact.

232
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,709
Time, I think,
to turn your mind to the real world,

233
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,672
and I believe
this would be the perfect start.

234
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,119
Die, die!

235
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,796
Die, die.

236
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,349
Hello.

237
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,633
I'm exploring.

238
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,993
- What are you doing?
- We're... We're building a new hut.

239
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,119
Have you got lots of friends over there?

240
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,480
A few. But we fight a lot.

241
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,198
That's why I like being out here.
I can be on my own.

242
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,479
- I'm Bruno.
- Shmuel.

243
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,195
- Sorry?
- I'm Shmuel.

244
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,149
That's your name? Never heard
of anyone called that before.

245
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,430
I've never heard
of anyone called Bruno.

246
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,314
But Shmuel. No one's called Shmuel.

247
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,195
I live in the house, back there.

248
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,953
- Have you got any food on you?
- No.

249
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,793
Are you hungry?

250
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,272
How old are you?

251
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,155
- Eight.
- Me, too!

252
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,709
It's not fair,
me being stuck over here on my own,

253
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,479
while you're over there,
playing with friends all day.

254
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,353
- Playing?
- Well, that number.

255
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,950
- Isn't it a part of a game or something?
- It's just my number.

256
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,070
Everyone gets given
a different number.

257
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,596
Right. Then what happens?

258
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,114
- I have to go back now!
- Really?

259
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,309
Yeah.

260
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,518
It was nice to meet you, Shmuel.

261
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,756
And you, Bruno.

262
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,155
Bye.

263
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,591
Mum, I can't find my football.

264
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,790
Well, it'll be
in one of your cupboards, sweet.

265
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,637
It isn't. I've looked.

266
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,589
Can I have a piece of chocolate?

267
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,633
A piece. Yes.

268
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,434
Bruno?

269
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,271
- Have you looked in the cellar?
- The cellar?

270
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,678
For your football.

271
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,475
Damn.

272
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,711
- Gretel, I've just seen all your...
- All my what?

273
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,952
All your dolls, down in the cellar.

274
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,911
Dolls are for little girls.

275
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,599
It's not right to play with silly toys

276
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,269
while people are away
risking their lives for the Fatherland.

277
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,319
- "My people's density is my density."
- Destiny.

278
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,315
"lts struggles and its sorrows,
its joys and its miseries are mine.

279
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,875
"I must work and create
for the resurrection of my Fatherland.

280
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,434
"The history of my people
is great and glorious."

281
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,959
And it's 12:00.

282
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,952
- I'm sorry?
- Isn't that when we finish?

283
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,992
The termination of the lesson
is for the tutor to decide, Bruno,

284
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,873
not the pupil.
Now, will you please continue.

285
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,237
Bruno, there you are.

286
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:43,395
I'm just going into town for an hour.
Do you want to come?

287
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,710
You be careful on that thing.

288
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,194
Thank you.

289
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,636
Can I ask you something?

290
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,519
Why do you people
wear pyjamas all day?

291
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,351
- They're not pyjamas.
- Well, those.

292
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,118
We have to.
They took all our other clothes away.

293
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,957
- Who did?
- The soldiers.

294
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,638
The soldiers? Why?

295
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,153
I don't like soldiers. Do you?

296
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,037
I do, quite. My dad's a soldier,

297
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,837
but not the sort that takes
people's clothes away for no reason.

298
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,438
What sort, then?

299
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,799
Well, he's the important sort.

300
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,310
He's in charge of making
everything better for everyone.

301
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,908
- So is your dad a farmer?
- No, he's a watchmaker.

302
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,518
Or was. Most of the time now,
he just mends boots.

303
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,396
It's funny how grown-ups
can't make their minds up

304
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,432
about what they want to do.
It's like Pavel.

305
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,869
Do you know him? Lives over there.

306
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,869
He used to be a doctor,
but gave it all up to peel potatoes.

307
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,752
Can I ask you another question?

308
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,075
What do you burn in those chimneys?

309
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,669
I saw them going the other day.
Is it just lots of hay and stuff?

310
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,678
I don't know.
We're not allowed over there.

311
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,870
Mama says it's old clothes.

312
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,559
Well, whatever it is, it smells horrid.

313
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,836
I wish
you'd remembered the chocolate.

314
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,472
Yes, I'm sorry.

315
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,398
I know! Perhaps you can come
and have supper with us sometime.

316
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,954
I can't, can I? Because of this.

317
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,074
But that's to stop
the animals getting out, isn't it?

318
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:56,351
Animals?
No, it's to stop people getting out.

319
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,676
Are you not allowed out?

320
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,155
- Why? What have you done?
- I'm a Jew.

321
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,556
I think I should go now.

322
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,714
- Will you be here tomorrow?
- I'll try.

323
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,354
- Goodbye, then!
- Bye.

324
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,636
Little present, sweetheart.

325
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,678
Thank you, Mummy.

326
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,550
- Have you seen Bruno?
- Outside on his swing, I think.

327
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,109
Yes, Thursday's perfect.
I'll have a car come to collect you both.

328
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,390
Are Grandma and Grandpa coming?

329
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,797
Hey, did you smell
that horrible smell the other day?

330
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,673
- Coming from the chimneys.
- What sort of ill?

331
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,476
The day I fell off the swing.

332
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,554
- Did you smell it, Mum?
- Father.

333
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,193
Mum.

334
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,552
Let me speak to her.

335
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,477
Yes, she is. I can hear her.

336
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,394
Yes. We look forward to it. Goodbye.

337
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,830
- Is Grandma not coming?
- No.

338
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,716
She's poorly, apparently,
but Grandpa's coming.

339
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,790
- Did you smell it, Dad?
- What?

340
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,196
That horrid smell from the chimneys.
What is it?

341
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,030
I think they just burn rubbish
there sometimes.

342
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,752
- Look.
- What?

343
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,158
- Hey!
- Gretel.

344
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,479
Hey, that's not fair!

345
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,999
- Gretel.
- What?

346
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,112
It's only a game.

347
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,549
Ralf, this tutor you brought in,

348
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,349
does he usually teach children
as young as Gretel and Bruno?

349
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,512
I believe so. Why?

350
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,437
Well, do we know
what he's teaching them?

351
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,277
Gretel seems to have become so...

352
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,788
They're being taught what all children
are being taught at the moment.

353
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,832
They mustn't get left behind.

354
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,074
Come on.

355
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,552
Let's get to bed.

356
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,439
"The Jew slandered us
and incited our enemies.

357
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,789
"The Jew corrupted us
through bad books.

358
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,115
"He mocked
our literature and our music.

359
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,435
"Everywhere, his influence
was destructive,

360
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,313
"the eventual result of which
was our nation's collapse,

361
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,237
- "and then..."
- Yes, Bruno.

362
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,795
I don't understand.

363
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,752
A nation's collapse
is all down to this one man?

364
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,190
The Jew here
means the entire Jewish race.

365
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,151
If it had been just one man,

366
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,668
I'm sure something
would've been done about him.

367
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,792
There is such a thing as a nice Jew,
though, isn't there?

368
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,469
I think, Bruno,
if you ever found a nice Jew,

369
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,393
you would be
the best explorer in the world.

370
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,112
Continue, Gretel.

371
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,952
"The aim of the Jew
is to become the ruler of humanity.

372
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,514
<i>"The Jew is not creative,
but destructive.</i>

373
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,994
"He is the enemy of culture.

374
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,271
"Thousands of Germans
have been made poor by the Jew."

375
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,519
Master Bruno.

376
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,915
What are you doing? You've just
had your lunch, haven't you?

377
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,669
I was going for a walk,
and I thought I might get peckish.

378
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,439
But don't make a mess of your satchel.
Bring it here.

379
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,837
- I'll wrap it properly for you.
- No. It's none of your business.

380
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,552
Bruno, what is it?

381
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,715
What are you doing with your satchel?

382
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:29,356
<i>Herr Liszt gave us some books.
I'm going out on the swing to read.</i>

383
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,676
- Let me see.
- What?

384
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,314
- The books.
- No.

385
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,114
<i>Bruno, I just want to see
what books Herr Liszt has given you.</i>

386
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,356
- I told a lie.
- What?

387
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,078
I've just got

388
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,958
adventure books.

389
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,831
Go on. Off you go, then.

390
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,830
Now, Maria,
there's two extra for supper tonight.

391
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,029
<i>The Kommandant's father will be here,</i>

392
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,355
and I believe
Lieutenant Kotler is joining us.

393
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,355
Here.

394
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,958
What's the matter?

395
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,238
- Don't throw it back.
- What? Why not?

396
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,636
- It's dangerous.
- Dangerous?

397
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,636
It's just a ball. Come on.

398
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,031
Do you not like playing?

399
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,033
- Just not ball games?
- Not here.

400
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,709
- Tell me how the number game works.
- I told you, it's not a game.

401
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,716
We just all have numbers.

402
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,428
Shmuel!

403
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,631
Bruno! What are you doing?

404
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,317
My ball went over.
I was just getting it back.

405
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,473
They smell even worse
when they burn, don't they?

406
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,589
What?

407
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,438
But, surely you...

408
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,068
Elsa, I was sworn to secrecy.

409
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:35,156
- From your own wife.
- Yes.

410
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,278
I took an oath upon my life.
Do you understand?

411
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,560
Elsa, you believe in this, too.

412
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,235
- You want this country to be strong...
- No, Ralf, no! No, not that!

413
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,153
How can you...

414
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,792
- Because I'm a soldier.
- How can you...

415
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,513
- Soldiers fight wars.
- That isn't war!

416
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,358
It's a part of it! It's a vital part of it!

417
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:11,479
The Fatherland we all desire,
all of us, you included,

418
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,353
cannot be achieved
without work such as this!

419
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,074
- Elsa. Elsa.
- Get away from me! Get away from me!

420
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,399
Grandpa's here.

421
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,000
- I don't believe this.
- Grandpa's here.

422
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,470
We'll be through in a moment.

423
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,876
Who told you about this?

424
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,913
How's Grandma?

425
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,789
She's a bit under the weather,
I'm afraid.

426
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:25,799
It's a shame, she was so much
looking forward to seeing you.

427
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:29,196
- Perhaps next time, if she feels up to it.
- Absolutely.

428
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,197
You know, Ralf,
your mother really is sick.

429
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,475
She's been talking about this visit
for weeks.

430
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,875
Maybe that's what's made her sick.

431
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,990
So, your father tells me
that you've got a tutor.

432
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,270
Yes. He's nice.

433
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,553
But he won't let us read
any adventure books.

434
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,115
All we do is boring, old history.

435
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,710
Let me tell you something, young man.

436
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:10,958
If it wasn't for history, we wouldn't
all be sitting around this table.

437
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,560
The work your father is doing here,

438
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,397
history in the making.

439
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,189
When I was your age, history was
my favourite subject by miles,

440
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,510
which obviously
didn't please my father.

441
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,879
Why not?

442
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,798
Well, he was a professor of literature
at the university.

443
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:40,116
Really, does he still teach?

444
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,310
- I don't really know.
- You don't know?

445
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,636
We're not in touch, my father and I.
He left the country some time ago.

446
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,559
Really, when?

447
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,036
<i>About four years ago,
Herr Kommandant.</i>

448
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:10,632
But surely he can't be very old.
What is he, still in his 40s, late 40s?

449
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,958
Where did he go?

450
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,312
Lieutenant Kotler,

451
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,109
your father, the professor of literature,
where did he go?

452
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,518
<i>I believe it was Switzerland,
Herr Kommandant.</i>

453
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,069
How strange that he should choose
to leave the Fatherland

454
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,599
at the very moment it needed him most.

455
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,359
Just when we're all required
to play our part in the national revival.

456
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,719
More wine!

457
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,713
What reason did he give?
Was he tubercular?

458
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,112
Did he go there to take the air?

459
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,312
<i>I'm afraid I really don't know,
Herr Kommandant.</i>

460
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,271
You'd have to ask him.

461
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,959
Well, that would be rather difficult,
wouldn't it?

462
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,150
With him being in Switzerland.

463
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:07,068
Come on!

464
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,668
What's the matter with you tonight?

465
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:23,156
Yes, perhaps that was it.
Perhaps he was ill.

466
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,480
Unless, of course,
he had disagreements.

467
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:32,950
- I mean, with government policy.
- One hears of such men.

468
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,269
Disturbed, most of them,
or just plain cowards.

469
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,751
- Even so, all of them traitors.
- Absolutely right.

470
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,318
Presumably,
if that was the case with your father,

471
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,955
you will have informed your superiors,
as is your duty.

472
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,439
Lieutenant Kotler!

473
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,633
You cretin Jew! Filth!

474
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,439
Ralf!

475
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,069
Jew!

476
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,630
- But Dad just sat there.
- What did you expect him to do?

477
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,672
The Jew deserved it.

478
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,596
Can I ask you something
about the farm?

479
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,232
Bruno, you don't still think it's a farm,
do you?

480
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,952
It's a camp. What's called a work camp.

481
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,796
For Jews, obviously.

482
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:03,993
Just Jews?

483
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:07,589
Because they're the best workers?

484
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,036
They're not in there
because they're good, silly.

485
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,798
They're no good at anything.

486
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,558
They're in there because they're evil.

487
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,716
- They're the enemy.
- The enemy?

488
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,035
- But I thought we were fighting...
- They're evil, Bruno.

489
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,957
Evil, dangerous vermin.

490
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,233
They're the reason
we lost the Great War.

491
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:27,114
<i>Haven't you been listening to anything
Herr Liszt has been telling us?</i>

492
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,639
No. Not really.

493
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:34,670
Dad's not horrible, is he?
He's a good man.

494
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,474
- Of course, he is.
- But he's in charge of a horrible place.

495
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,475
It's only horrible for them, Bruno.

496
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,954
We should be proud of Dad,
now more than ever before.

497
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,468
He's making the country great again.

498
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,677
<i>Like you say, they're a bit strange.
A bit...</i>

499
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,755
<i>Well, they're different.</i>

500
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,631
<i>They're the enemy, Bruno.</i>

501
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,591
<i>Evil, dangerous vermin.</i>

502
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,632
<i>Well, you see,
they're not really people at all.</i>

503
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,990
What are you doing here?

504
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:17,079
They wanted someone with tiny fingers
to clean all these.

505
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:32,278
We're not supposed to be friends,
you and me.

506
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,278
We're meant to be enemies.
Did you know that?

507
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,638
Do you want some?

508
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,274
- What's your dad like?
- What's he like?

509
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,272
Is he a good man?

510
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,315
You've never thought he wasn't?

511
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,791
And you're proud of him?

512
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:11,031
Aren't you proud of yours?

513
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,191
Is it really horrible in the camp?

514
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,355
How dare you
talk to people in the house.

515
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,038
How dare you!

516
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,233
Are you eating?

517
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,796
Have you been stealing food?

518
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:38,115
- Answer me!
- No, sir. He gave it to me.

519
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,078
He's my friend.

520
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,035
What?

521
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,113
Little man,

522
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,956
do you know this Jew?

523
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,399
Do you know this Jew?

524
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,432
No, I just walked in,
and he was helping himself.

525
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,434
I've never seen him before in my life.

526
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,474
You, finish cleaning the glasses.

527
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,352
When I come back,
we'll have a little chat

528
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:17,109
about what happens to rats who steal.
Come away.

529
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,999
<i>New arrivals here are happy
to discover that life in the camp</i>

530
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,359
<i>is not all work.</i>

531
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,073
<i>And that there's
ample opportunity for leisure also.</i>

532
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,556
<i>At the end of their day
at the ironmongery</i>

533
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,273
<i>or the build or boot factory,
the workers can enjoy</i>

534
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:09,551
<i>the many forms of pastime
that the camp has to offer.</i>

535
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,039
<i>Organised sport is very popular.</i>

536
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:16,072
<i>Those that don't play
certainly enjoy watching.</i>

537
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:19,439
<i>At the end of the working day,</i>

538
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,789
<i>the centrally located café
is the ideal place</i>

539
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:26,277
<i>for friends and families to join together
for a hearty and nutritious meal.</i>

540
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:30,959
<i>The children, in particular,
enjoy the pastries and cakes on offer.</i>

541
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:38,634
<i>In the evenings,
the occasional music concerts,</i>

542
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:41,638
<i>either by visiting orchestras
or, indeed, by talented musicians</i>

543
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:44,433
<i>from within the camp itself,
are always well attended.</i>

544
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,909
<i>Other recreations include
reading in the library,</i>

545
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:54,717
<i>pottery, cookery, art and horticulture
for adult and child alike.</i>

546
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:58,799
<i>Almost any activity one could wish for
is available within the camp.</i>

547
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,555
Splendid.

548
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:17,630
- Bravo. Excellent.
- Thank you.

549
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,912
Goodbye, little man.

550
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,597
Shmuel! Shmuel!

551
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,990
I don't understand.

552
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,429
I saw a film about the camp,

553
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,597
and it looked so nice.

554
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:23,596
I don't know why I did it.

555
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,673
Gretel and everyone
were saying all these things,

556
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,836
and that soldier's so scary.

557
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:37,395
Been coming here for days,
but you were never here.

558
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,116
I thought maybe
we weren't friends any more.

559
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:54,432
Shmuel, I'm really sorry for what I did.
We are still friends, aren't we?

560
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:27,916
Where's Kurt these days?
I haven't seen him for ages.

561
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,631
- Who's Kurt?
- Lieutenant Kotler.

562
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,790
He's been moved to the front.

563
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,871
It was felt that
his youth and enthusiasm

564
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:40,558
would be put to better use there.

565
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,636
<i>Herr Kommandant, telephone.</i>

566
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,909
In actual fact, Gretel, he was sent there

567
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,712
because he failed
to inform the authorities

568
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,069
of his father's
lack of loyalty to the Party.

569
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:51,917
Which was his duty, I might add.

570
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,996
- Which was his bad luck.
- Bad luck?

571
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:57,999
Well, bad luck that it was his father
who was disloyal, and not his mother.

572
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,679
One presumably
doesn't have to report one's mother.

573
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,997
- What?
- When will Pavel be back?

574
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,474
- Mum?
- Never, stupid.

575
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,389
It's Father. They've been bombed.

576
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,238
Grandmother's dead.

577
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,195
"...the victory
which You have obtained for us

578
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,470
"and for all who sleep in Him,

579
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,990
"keep us who are still in the body
in everlasting fellowship

580
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:21,270
"with all that wait for Thee on earth,

581
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:23,675
"and with all that are around Thee
in heaven,

582
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:25,995
"in union with Him
who is the resurrection

583
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:29,635
"and the life, who liveth and reigneth
with Thee and the Holy Ghost,

584
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,638
"ever one God, world without end.
Amen."

585
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:36,116
He can't have that on there.
She wouldn't have wanted it.

586
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,508
He does.

587
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:06,834
"Almighty God, who by the death of..."

588
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,279
<i>Have you ever been to a funeral?</i>

589
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:13,350
My grandma and grandpa both died
just after we got here,

590
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,630
but there weren't any funerals.

591
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,036
That one there to there.

592
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,355
They both died at the same time?

593
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:27,028
What of?

594
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,509
I don't know.

595
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:33,269
Papa said they must have caught
something on the way here.

596
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:36,392
They had to go to a hospital
as soon as we arrived.

597
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,431
We didn't see them again.

598
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,759
This is fun.

599
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,316
Wish we could do something
a bit more exciting, though.

600
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,476
- That one there to there.
- This one?

601
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,191
- This one?
- No, that one.

602
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,677
- This one to here?
- No, there!

603
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,711
- To here?
- No.

604
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,478
- Here?
- No.

605
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:18,960
- I don't want you to go away again.
- No. Neither do I.

606
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,116
You can't behave like this!

607
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:51,911
- You're questioning my behaviour?
- It can't continue!

608
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,509
I know.
I can't stand this any more, Ralf.

609
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:56,869
I can't stay here and be a part of this.

610
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,912
Don't you think there will be questions?

611
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,359
- Questions?
- Well, now, what does it say

612
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:05,916
about my ability to carry out my work
if I cannot control my own family?

613
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:08,793
- Work? Is that what you call it?
- Pull yourself together, woman.

614
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,558
Right. Just ignore it. Ignore it.

615
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:14,229
Ignore the fact
that the man I married is a monster!

616
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,080
Even your own mother
couldn't love you.

617
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,118
Are you happy here?

618
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:31,112
Yes. Very.

619
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,792
And you, Gretel?

620
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:42,634
Well, I was, but I do miss home.
I miss my friends.

621
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:48,070
Yes, I'm sure. And you, too, Bruno.
You must miss those friends of yours.

622
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:51,628
No. Not any more, really.

623
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:08,353
I suppose the real question is,
if the opportunity arose,

624
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,915
would you prefer
to live somewhere else?

625
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:15,714
- Back home?
- No. Not Berlin. Not yet.

626
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:21,115
Somewhere safe, say Aunt Lottie's
in Heidelberg, for example.

627
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:24,396
All of us? You as well?

628
01:09:25,480 --> 01:09:28,631
No. That won't be possible just yet,
I'm afraid.

629
01:09:28,680 --> 01:09:31,240
I must stay
and complete my work here.

630
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:37,035
See, at the moment,
your mother is finding it...

631
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:43,233
She just feels right now you need
to spend some time elsewhere.

632
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,032
Would you like that?

633
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:59,913
I'm afraid, Bruno, in life, we often
have to do things we don't want to do.

634
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:02,554
The important thing is
your mother does not feel

635
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:05,398
that this is an appropriate place for you
to be spending your childhood,

636
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,955
and the more I think about it, the more
I realise she's very probably right.

637
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,433
- But, Dad...
- No!

638
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:19,470
It's time for you to move away.

639
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,516
Is everything all right?

640
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,151
We can't find Papa.

641
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,760
He went on a different work duty
with some of the men,

642
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,870
and they haven't come back.

643
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:07,155
I've got some bad news, too.
I'm going away.

644
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,677
How long for this time?

645
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:14,476
That's why it's bad. It's forever, I think.

646
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,718
Mum says this is no place for children,
which is just stupid.

647
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:23,232
- When do you go?
- Tomorrow. After lunch.

648
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:28,910
So, I won't ever see you again?

649
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:34,639
Yes, you will. You can come on holiday
to Berlin if you like,

650
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,797
when everybody's getting on
with each other again.

651
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:45,233
I wish I could've helped you
find your dad.

652
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,116
I really want to make up
for letting you down like I did.

653
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:52,072
That would have done it, wouldn't it?
Helping you find your dad?

654
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,873
Would've been great.
Like a secret mission.

655
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,751
- I could dig under.
- What? With that?

656
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,873
- No, but I could bring something.
- You don't want to come over here.

657
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,309
Look.

658
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,797
- I could come through to your side.
- What's the point in that?

659
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,638
Your dad's not going to be over here,
is he?

660
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:27,994
But I'd stick out though, wouldn't I,
if I came through?

661
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,837
I don't look like you.

662
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,476
You could look like me, though.

663
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,795
If you dressed like me
and shaved your hair off.

664
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,876
I'm not shaving my hair off.

665
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:44,199
- You could cover it with a cap.
- My pyjamas are a different colour.

666
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:47,869
I could bring some.
There's a hut full of them,

667
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:50,480
thousands of them.
Would you do it, though?

668
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,670
- I want to do it.
- Would you dare do it, though?

669
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,234
- I want to help you find your dad.
- I've got to go.

670
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,556
Tomorrow, then?
I'll bring an extra-big sandwich.

671
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,716
And don't forget the pyjamas!

672
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,269
Bruno?

673
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,475
Mum, can I go and play on the swing?

674
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,599
- Bruno...
- It's my last chance.

675
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,751
All right. Go on then.

676
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:48,598
- I thought you weren't coming!
- I'm sorry. It wasn't easy to get away.

677
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,189
I'm not meant to be out here today.
You forgot the pyjamas!

678
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,992
- Did you bring the sandwich?
- Would I let you down?

679
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,074
Shmuel.

680
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:31,555
Here.

681
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:48,159
How do I look?

682
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,077
Right. Let's get going.

683
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:13,789
Bruno?

684
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:16,559
That's enough.

685
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:47,630
Let's go and find your dad.

686
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:53,954
Come on!

687
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,993
Master Bruno?

688
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,074
Shmuel.

689
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:44,033
- Can we go to the café or something?
- Café?

690
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:50,112
- Maybe I should go home.
- What about Papa?

691
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,349
Yeah.

692
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,636
We'll check our hut first.

693
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:10,874
Bruno?

694
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,148
Come on.

695
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:32,995
Papa?

696
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:37,355
Up! Up! Get up!

697
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,356
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

698
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,152
We go on marches sometimes.

699
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:43,111
Move! Up, up!

700
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:46,918
Move, move!

701
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:58,479
Bruno!

702
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:02,672
He must still be
outside somewhere, ma'am.

703
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,519
Bruno!

704
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,394
Bruno?

705
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,272
- Move!
- Quickly!

706
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,588
Get up!

707
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,752
Get up. You must!

708
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,319
Move them out!

709
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:58,675
...which means that
our weekly capabilities

710
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,233
would be almost tripled,

711
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,475
so, therefore,
by the end of the summer...

712
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,512
- Ralf.
- Elsa, I'm in a meeting.

713
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,672
Bruno's missing.

714
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:14,439
Come on!

715
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,438
Wait here!

716
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:34,119
Come on!

717
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:38,193
Move! Move!

718
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,392
Join the queue!

719
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,679
Come on, you!

720
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,873
Bruno!

721
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,028
Move it!

722
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,034
Go on.

723
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:15,908
Bruno!

724
01:21:25,240 --> 01:21:29,950
It's all right. I think we're just waiting
in here until the rain stops.

725
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,353
Clothes off!

726
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,116
Where are we going?

727
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,351
No, it's just a shower.

728
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,239
A shower?

729
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,799
Open the gates! Open the gates!

730
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,355
Move!

731
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,116
Bruno!

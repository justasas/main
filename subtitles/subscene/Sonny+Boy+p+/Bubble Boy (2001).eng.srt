00:00:14,933 --> 00:00:16,476
Hi.

3
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:18,812
My name's Jimmy Livingston.

4
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:21,398
My mom says when I was born...

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,234
I came gift-wrapped
from Heaven.

6
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:26,111
Aaah!

7
00:00:32,033 --> 00:00:33,618
Whoa! Whoa!

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,746
Well,
I guess this is growing up

9
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:39,416
My first memories
are kind of hazy.

10
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:42,752
All I remember is
a place with white walls...

11
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:45,880
bright lights,
and a gigantic bird.

12
00:00:47,299 --> 00:00:50,594
I was there because I was born
with no immunities.

13
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:52,971
A single germ could kill me.

14
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:57,350
But when I was four,
my mom took me home...

15
00:00:57,392 --> 00:01:00,395
to beautiful
Palmdale, California.

16
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:04,566
Mom helped me
make friends right away.

17
00:01:07,152 --> 00:01:09,029
Let's go.

18
00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:11,281
Get him in!

19
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:18,038
Our house was enormous
like a castle...

20
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,625
and for the first time,
I felt completely free.

21
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,043
There.

22
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:29,174
Now you're safe from
that evil, filthy world.

23
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:32,260
You're home, Jimmy!

24
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:37,974
And you'll never, ever, ever
have to go out there again.

25
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:56,034
Look at that.

26
00:01:56,076 --> 00:01:58,244
Look what Mommy made for Jimmy.

27
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:05,168
I had a big room
with my own bed...

28
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,503
Lots of toys...

29
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:09,381
and two pairs
of retractable arms.

30
00:02:09,422 --> 00:02:12,842
"And the prince climbed to
the top of the tower and said...

31
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:14,219
'Come with me...

32
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:15,887
and we'll live
happily ever after.'

33
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:20,892
"And Rapunzel left
her plastic bubble and died."

34
00:02:20,934 --> 00:02:23,019
The End.

35
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:25,438
Those evil doctors.

36
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:31,278
Nobody's gonna get any germs
on my little boy now.

37
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,405
You'll always stay pure.

38
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:34,990
Won't you, Jimmy?

39
00:02:38,994 --> 00:02:41,121
Jimmy! Breakfie!

40
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,497
I had my reading.

41
00:02:42,497 --> 00:02:45,250
I wish they had more than
one magazine in the world, Mom.

42
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:46,793
So do l, dear.

43
00:02:46,835 --> 00:02:49,129
My favorite TV show,
"Land of the Lost. "

44
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,006
I wish TVs had more
than one channel, Mom.

45
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:52,799
So do l, dear.

46
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:54,301
And I had
the best teacher...

47
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:55,760
in the whole, wide world.

48
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:56,803
And then the Indians...

49
00:02:56,845 --> 00:02:58,680
decided to move
to the reservations...

50
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:00,015
where they
could open casinos...

51
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:01,641
and sell
tax-free cigarettes...

52
00:03:01,683 --> 00:03:03,810
and stay out of
the white man's way.

53
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:06,479
Another A-plus.

54
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:09,357
The neighborhood kids always
wanted to hang at my house.

55
00:03:09,357 --> 00:03:10,734
Lives in a bubble,
smells like poop

56
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:13,153
Bubble boy, bubble boy

57
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:17,866
Get out of here,
you little buggers! Go on!

58
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:19,159
But I liked
to hang with my dad.

59
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,952
Holy mother of shit, Morton!

60
00:03:20,994 --> 00:03:22,829
Are you trying to kill
him with that thing?

61
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,586
Jimmy, lunchie.

62
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:35,300
Suppertime was the best.

63
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:37,218
Nothing could beat Mom's
homemade, vitamin-rich...

64
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,888
soy-based, germ-free,
fat-free fiber cookies.

65
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:42,682
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

66
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:46,311
I grew up
like any other kid.

67
00:03:46,353 --> 00:03:48,229
At 16,
I didn't get a car...

68
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:51,024
but I did get an electrical
rock-music guitar!

69
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:54,569
I can't
believe the things I found

70
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:58,156
I need to find my way

71
00:03:58,198 --> 00:04:00,200
I'm lost, I'm lost

72
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,994
I do believe I'm living

73
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:04,663
In the Land

74
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:06,915
Of the Lost

75
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,710
I'm living in the Land

76
00:04:12,128 --> 00:04:14,464
Living in the Land

77
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,218
Living in the Land

78
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,428
Of the Lost

79
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,264
I was so happy.

80
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:24,599
I had everything
a boy could ever want.

81
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:28,144
Until...

82
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:30,939
Chloe.

83
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,737
"And then Pinocchio came out
of his plastic bubble...

84
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:40,115
"touched the filthy little
whore next door and died."

85
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:42,117
The End.

86
00:04:42,158 --> 00:04:43,785
Ooh, baby

87
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,791
Ahh

88
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:51,126
Oh, yeah

89
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:53,461
Over the next few years...

90
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:56,339
I washed my window a lot.

91
00:04:58,508 --> 00:04:59,968
Oh, my

92
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:02,762
Something
was happening to me.

93
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:04,180
But I didn't know what.

94
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:11,646
Mom!

95
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:14,190
-Jimmy! What's the matter?
-Mom!

96
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,483
Are you all right?

97
00:05:15,525 --> 00:05:17,360
-What is it?
-Oh! Oh, my God!

98
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:18,361
Ow!

99
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:20,655
Don't touch it! Hands off!

100
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:22,657
Now, just relax,
don't get upset.

101
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:23,658
It hurts!

102
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,701
Just do what
I tell your father--

103
00:05:24,743 --> 00:05:26,328
just say the pledge
of allegiance...

104
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:28,997
until it goes away.
Come on!

105
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,166
I pledge allegiance
to the flag...

106
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:32,834
of the United States
of America...

107
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:34,127
and to the republic
for which it stands...

108
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:35,962
one nation under God,
indivisible...

109
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:38,298
with liberty and justice
for all.

110
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:41,551
I pledge allegiance
to the flag...

111
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:42,802
of the United States
of America...

112
00:05:42,844 --> 00:05:45,138
and to the republic
for which it stands...

113
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,807
one nation under God...

114
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:50,018
Thanks, Mom.

115
00:05:52,312 --> 00:05:53,813
Can't touch this

116
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:57,275
Can't touch this...

117
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:04,908
Dude!

118
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,618
You live next door
to the bubble boy.

119
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,286
Know what I heard?

120
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:10,580
The only thing he can drink
is his own urine.

121
00:06:10,622 --> 00:06:12,415
True story. Swear to God.

122
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:14,209
I heard the same thing, man.
It's gross.

123
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:16,544
Then what did he drink
to make the urine?

124
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:19,130
Well, it would...

125
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:21,049
Tell her.

126
00:06:21,091 --> 00:06:22,425
Shotgun!

127
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,805
He's not a monster, you guys.

128
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:28,306
He's just a boy in a bubble.

129
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:31,893
I am not a monster.
I'm a human being.

130
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,229
-Bye, Lisa.
-Bye, Chloe.

131
00:06:34,271 --> 00:06:35,855
I wish I was the boy
in her bubble.

132
00:06:35,897 --> 00:06:37,649
Oh, yeah!

133
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:41,778
Let's hit the arcade.

134
00:06:56,376 --> 00:06:58,545
Hi, Mr. Livingston?

135
00:06:58,587 --> 00:07:01,047
I'm Chloe.
I live...next door.

136
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:24,863
Hyah!

137
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:53,016
Oh, my gosh!

138
00:07:53,058 --> 00:07:54,601
-What?
-Are you OK?

139
00:07:54,643 --> 00:07:57,437
What?
Wait, no, no, no.

140
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,189
I was just playing.

141
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,774
I was just playing.

142
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:05,070
Mayday! You know, that.

143
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:07,530
Oh.

144
00:08:07,572 --> 00:08:10,367
Ahem.

145
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:12,535
Was that Pakuni
you were speaking?

146
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:14,663
From "Land of the Lost"?

147
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:17,249
I love "Land of the Lost."

148
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,416
I love you, too.

149
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,753
It! It, too.
I love it, too.

150
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:25,465
-I'm Jimmy.
-I'm--

151
00:08:25,507 --> 00:08:27,092
Chloe, the whore next door.

152
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:28,468
What?

153
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,512
Where did you hear that?

154
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:33,515
My mom.
She teaches me everything.

155
00:08:33,556 --> 00:08:35,725
Well, really she got it wrong.

156
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:38,812
I'm actually more of a bitch
than a whore.

157
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:42,315
A bitch. Oh, yeah.

158
00:08:42,315 --> 00:08:45,318
A bitch.
Absolutely, a bitch.

159
00:08:46,861 --> 00:08:50,490
Yeah.

160
00:08:50,532 --> 00:08:51,992
You play guitar?

161
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:54,953
Oh, yeah!

162
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:56,621
Do you wanna try it?

163
00:08:56,663 --> 00:08:58,290
Oh, no, I don't know how.

164
00:08:58,331 --> 00:08:59,666
I could teach you.

165
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,084
Right now.

166
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:03,712
I can't right now.

167
00:09:05,672 --> 00:09:07,132
I should go.

168
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:15,640
How about tomorrow?

169
00:09:15,682 --> 00:09:18,018
Oh, jeez, I don't know.

170
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:21,521
I don't know, bitch.
I got a lot to do.

171
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:24,691
See you tomorrow. Bye.

172
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:30,864
She's certainly proud of
those boobies, isn't she?

173
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,993
Something tells me she's not...

174
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:37,704
the kind of friend
Jesus would pick, Jimmy.

175
00:09:37,746 --> 00:09:40,373
When I look

176
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:43,877
All a--round

177
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,253
Oh, I suck.

178
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:47,672
No, no. Come here.

179
00:09:51,176 --> 00:09:52,969
You have to press harder.

180
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:54,512
-OK.
-Harder. Here.

181
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:58,350
-Like...
-Now go. Harder.

182
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:00,894
When I look

183
00:10:00,936 --> 00:10:04,773
All around

184
00:10:04,814 --> 00:10:06,566
I pledge allegiance to the flag
of the United States of America

185
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:07,984
and to the republic
for which it stands...

186
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:09,152
one nation under God...

187
00:10:09,194 --> 00:10:11,613
Everything OK?

188
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:13,156
Yeah. Let's go.

189
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:14,741
Wouldn't it be nice

190
00:10:14,783 --> 00:10:16,743
If we were older

191
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:20,413
And we wouldn't have
to wait so long

192
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:24,251
And wouldn't it be nice
to live together

193
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:29,214
In the kind of world
where we belong

194
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:33,218
I know it's gonna make it
that much better

195
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:34,844
When we can say good night...

196
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:37,097
Trick or treat!

197
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:38,932
Smell my feet!

198
00:10:38,974 --> 00:10:41,518
Oh, hey!

199
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,062
Aah!

200
00:10:44,104 --> 00:10:47,565
In the morning
when the day is new...

201
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:54,739
It's Bubble Guinea.

202
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:57,909
Oh, my God!

203
00:10:57,951 --> 00:10:59,744
Hi, Bubble Guinea.

204
00:11:01,371 --> 00:11:02,998
Jimmy!

205
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:06,793
Ow! Ah!

206
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:09,588
Stupid gutter.

207
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:14,843
Jimmy! Ah! Ouch.

208
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:17,512
Jimmy. Ahh. Hello.

209
00:11:17,554 --> 00:11:18,513
Chloe?

210
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:21,558
Yeah. Bubble Boy!

211
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,560
What about your party?

212
00:11:23,602 --> 00:11:27,355
Jimmy, you have to wish me
happy birthday.

213
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:29,357
What about your party?

214
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,818
Uhh, the party.

215
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,320
I'll show you a party.

216
00:11:33,403 --> 00:11:34,904
Come here.

217
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:36,865
-Don't be shy.
-Huh?

218
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:38,491
Come here.

219
00:11:38,533 --> 00:11:40,327
My mom's asleep.

220
00:11:40,368 --> 00:11:42,203
Don't you wanna give me
a birthday kiss?

221
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:45,332
Chloe. Heh heh. Shh.

222
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:47,375
Shh.

223
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:51,004
Whoa! Oh, Chloe!

224
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:53,089
I hate this stupid bubble.

225
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:54,716
I got everything
I wanted for my birthday...

226
00:11:54,758 --> 00:11:56,343
except you, Jimmy.

227
00:11:56,384 --> 00:11:57,844
That's why I'm coming in.

228
00:11:57,886 --> 00:12:00,347
Chloe, wait! Whoa, whoa.

229
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:04,351
Don't worry.
You can decontaminate me.

230
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:07,228
-Hee hee hee.
-What?

231
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,564
Relax. Have a beer.

232
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:14,235
Wait, um, wait. Chloe?

233
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,073
I'm not so sure
that's such a good idea.

234
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:20,408
Jimmy.

235
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,371
Jimmy. Please let me in.

236
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:26,039
Oh, baby

237
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:27,624
Please?

238
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:31,253
Ahh

239
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:54,859
Chloe?

240
00:12:54,901 --> 00:12:56,569
I...

241
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:58,446
Maybe
I should have let her in...

242
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:01,241
but I was scared.

243
00:13:01,283 --> 00:13:03,868
So who could really blame her
for what happened next?

244
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,371
Hold on.

245
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:09,833
You look beautif--

246
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:13,169
Oh, hi.

247
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:15,213
Ooh, corsage.

248
00:13:15,255 --> 00:13:16,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

249
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:19,843
Mark, Jimmy. Jimmy, Mark.

250
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:21,970
'Sup, Jimbo?

251
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,974
'Sup, Marko?

252
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:27,183
You ready?

253
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:28,560
Yeah. Just let me
use the bathroom.

254
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:30,645
All right.
Pinch it quick.

255
00:13:32,564 --> 00:13:34,524
-She loves that one.
-Hmm.

256
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,570
-Cigarette?
-What?

257
00:13:45,702 --> 00:13:48,079
So Chloe tells me
you're a musician.

258
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,583
Well, I rock,
if that's what you mean.

259
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,584
Ahh

260
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:53,710
You know?

261
00:13:53,752 --> 00:13:55,712
So, what are you guys
gonna do tonight?

262
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,049
You know,
a little bit of this.

263
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,675
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

264
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:03,970
Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's it, ahh.

265
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:05,847
Oh, oh!
That's it. Ohh!

266
00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:07,349
Sounds like fun.

267
00:14:07,432 --> 00:14:09,476
All right. All ready.

268
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:12,228
That's how I do it on stage.

269
00:14:14,397 --> 00:14:16,274
Did I tell you
how beautiful you look?

270
00:14:16,316 --> 00:14:18,068
Come here.

271
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:21,029
I'm gonna be
the luckiest guy at the prom.

272
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:24,574
One thing was for sure.
Mark was cool.

273
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:25,951
Bye, Jimmy.

274
00:14:25,992 --> 00:14:29,120
Who could compete
with a guy like that?

275
00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:31,164
-Hands.
-I'm sorry.

276
00:14:35,043 --> 00:14:36,461
Come on, Chloe.

277
00:14:36,503 --> 00:14:38,004
We've been going out
for two years...

278
00:14:38,046 --> 00:14:39,839
I want a little action.

279
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:41,007
Mark, I told you--

280
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:43,343
I want to wait
till I get married.

281
00:14:51,184 --> 00:14:52,936
Hands.

282
00:15:05,365 --> 00:15:07,993
I tried to warn you,
but you wouldn't listen.

283
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:10,620
All women
will leave you someday.

284
00:15:10,662 --> 00:15:12,747
That girl didn't love you.

285
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:14,457
She just felt sorry for you.

286
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:16,835
You think she'd marry a boy
who couldn't even touch her?

287
00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:23,675
Hey.

288
00:15:23,717 --> 00:15:26,845
Hi.

289
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:28,471
Are you going somewhere?

290
00:15:28,513 --> 00:15:32,642
Yeah. You know Mark?

291
00:15:32,684 --> 00:15:37,564
We've sorta been going out
off and on for a while now...

292
00:15:37,606 --> 00:15:39,733
and, um...

293
00:15:39,774 --> 00:15:44,696
Well, he kind of asked me to...

294
00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:46,531
-To go fishing?
-No!

295
00:15:46,573 --> 00:15:48,908
-To go to the movies?
-No!

296
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,996
-To get married?
-Yes!

297
00:15:55,415 --> 00:15:57,709
The wedding's this Saturday
in Niagara Falls.

298
00:15:59,085 --> 00:16:02,088
I didn't know how to tell you,
Jimmy, because...

299
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:07,510
The thing is, um...

300
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:09,429
I really wanted to know...

301
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,431
if you think
he's the right one...

302
00:16:11,431 --> 00:16:15,018
because it's such a big step,
you know? And...

303
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:17,604
Jimmy?

304
00:16:20,273 --> 00:16:23,777
I made you something.

305
00:16:33,203 --> 00:16:36,081
Take Bubble Guinea Pig.
I don't want him anymore.

306
00:16:45,215 --> 00:16:46,883
So that's it?

307
00:16:46,925 --> 00:16:49,261
That's all
you're going to say?

308
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:51,930
Bye, Jimmy.

309
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,769
Good-bye.

310
00:17:00,522 --> 00:17:03,525
Can you still remember

311
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:06,152
How it seemed

312
00:17:06,194 --> 00:17:08,613
That we could live forever

313
00:17:08,655 --> 00:17:11,866
In a lovers' dream?

314
00:17:11,908 --> 00:17:14,578
The falling
was the best part

315
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:17,330
But now you know

316
00:17:17,372 --> 00:17:18,999
The things you cling to

317
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,377
Your heart can start to grow

318
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:26,298
You, you're walking away

319
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:27,882
I've been there

320
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:32,012
Now I know what to say

321
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:37,892
I'm the king of yesterday

322
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:42,272
Why don't,
why don't you stay

323
00:17:42,314 --> 00:17:43,857
Chloe!

324
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:47,736
God...bless America!

325
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:50,405
That nasty little slut...

326
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:52,907
Left just in
the nick of time, Morton.

327
00:18:02,959 --> 00:18:06,046
I had no idea
what I was up against.

328
00:18:06,087 --> 00:18:08,089
Chloe hadn't told me much.

329
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:10,508
All I knew was that
she was in New York...

330
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,428
which may as well been on
the other side of the galaxy...

331
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,723
and I only had
three days to get there.

332
00:18:16,765 --> 00:18:18,558
Three days.

333
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,269
I just needed the bubble suit
to last that long.

334
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,945
Flying high now

335
00:18:29,986 --> 00:18:34,240
I'm so high now

336
00:18:41,331 --> 00:18:42,749
Ooh!

337
00:18:46,795 --> 00:18:50,840
Ooh! Oh, oh, oh!

338
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:05,021
Getting strong now

339
00:19:05,063 --> 00:19:10,318
Moving on now

340
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:15,657
Uhh!

341
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:16,866
Aah!

342
00:19:18,702 --> 00:19:20,036
Grass.

343
00:19:29,838 --> 00:19:31,506
Street lamp.

344
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:32,966
Oh.

345
00:19:33,008 --> 00:19:34,676
Ooh.

346
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:38,388
Dog poop!
This is awesome!

347
00:19:48,648 --> 00:19:50,859
I'm running!

348
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,736
I'm running!

349
00:19:54,237 --> 00:19:56,573
Well, I guess
this is growing up

350
00:19:58,241 --> 00:20:00,952
Well, I guess
this is growing up

351
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:05,332
Well, I guess
this is growing up

352
00:20:07,334 --> 00:20:09,669
Well, I guess
this is growing up

353
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,882
Well, I guess
this is growing up

354
00:20:28,605 --> 00:20:30,857
Well, I guess
this is growing up

355
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:34,986
Well, I guess
this is growing up

356
00:20:38,031 --> 00:20:41,368
Hello? Hello?

357
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:52,254
Hi. It's my first day
out in the world.

358
00:21:00,178 --> 00:21:02,681
I'd like to go
to Niagara Falls.

359
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:08,853
That'll be $260.

360
00:21:11,273 --> 00:21:13,692
Plus I gotta charge you
for an additional seat...

361
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:17,362
for that...stupid thing
you're wearing.

362
00:21:17,404 --> 00:21:21,658
Oh, money. Oh. Money.

363
00:21:25,328 --> 00:21:27,122
How far will this get me?

364
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:29,541
Take a step back.

365
00:21:32,711 --> 00:21:35,463
That far.

366
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:42,178
Um...

367
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,014
the girl I love
is getting married...

368
00:21:44,055 --> 00:21:46,433
and I have
to stop the wedding.

369
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:50,145
That's fantastic.

370
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:52,230
Next!

371
00:21:57,611 --> 00:22:00,238
Next in line, please.

372
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:13,919
OK. Have a nice day.

373
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:38,234
The white zone's
for loading and unloading only.

374
00:22:50,163 --> 00:22:52,165
Hey, are you all right?

375
00:22:52,207 --> 00:22:54,251
-Are you all right?
-What is it?

376
00:22:54,292 --> 00:22:55,919
Oh, he's alive!

377
00:22:57,837 --> 00:22:59,256
I need to get
to Niagara Falls...

378
00:22:59,297 --> 00:23:01,633
by Saturday to stop Chloe
from getting married.

379
00:23:01,675 --> 00:23:04,636
-I'm Todd.
-And I'm Lorraine.

380
00:23:04,678 --> 00:23:06,805
And we can get you
to Niagara Falls.

381
00:23:06,846 --> 00:23:10,809
Yeah!
Bright and shiny!

382
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:12,602
Stick him in the rear!

383
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:21,653
Bright

384
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:24,030
And shiny

385
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:26,116
Bright

386
00:23:26,157 --> 00:23:28,201
And shiny

387
00:23:28,243 --> 00:23:30,870
People all across the land

388
00:23:30,912 --> 00:23:33,081
Come and join our happy band

389
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:35,208
Always happy, never gay

390
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,460
Living clean is A-OK

391
00:23:37,502 --> 00:23:39,254
Bright

392
00:23:39,296 --> 00:23:41,339
And shiny...

393
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:42,924
Excuse me, Todd.

394
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:46,219
And shiny

395
00:23:46,261 --> 00:23:48,513
If you save yourself
for God

396
00:23:48,555 --> 00:23:50,849
You will get the golden rod

397
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:52,851
Give up on society

398
00:23:52,892 --> 00:23:55,020
We will be your family

399
00:23:55,061 --> 00:23:56,896
Bright

400
00:23:56,938 --> 00:23:59,190
And shiny

401
00:24:04,112 --> 00:24:06,573
Jimmy! Breakfie!

402
00:24:11,953 --> 00:24:16,708
Jimmy!

403
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,925
The Kloobda.

404
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:29,596
The Kloobda is
the holy guide to living pure...

405
00:24:29,638 --> 00:24:33,058
dictated to Gil
by a talking salamander.

406
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:34,476
But more on that later.

407
00:24:34,517 --> 00:24:36,436
This will help explain.

408
00:24:36,478 --> 00:24:38,939
Put it
in the decontamination bay.

409
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,941
Right there.

410
00:24:42,275 --> 00:24:44,235
First,
we prepare our souls...

411
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:47,280
by stripping ourselves
of all material possessions...

412
00:24:47,322 --> 00:24:49,950
and sexual desires.

413
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:54,120
Ha ha ha ha!

414
00:24:55,705 --> 00:24:58,166
-Kool-aid, Lorraine?
-Thanks, Lorraine.

415
00:24:58,208 --> 00:24:59,918
-Lorraine?
-Ooh!

416
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,586
Her name's Lorraine, too?

417
00:25:01,628 --> 00:25:03,088
We're all Lorraine.

418
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:04,673
And you will be Todd...

419
00:25:04,714 --> 00:25:08,593
a name chosen
especially for you by Gil.

420
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:11,471
What does Bill
do with all your stuff?

421
00:25:11,513 --> 00:25:13,807
He's holding it for us
at the compound.

422
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:15,392
Where's the compound?

423
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:18,144
I'm not really sure.

424
00:25:18,186 --> 00:25:19,813
In Texas?

425
00:25:19,854 --> 00:25:22,065
Oh. You're not
a singing group...

426
00:25:22,107 --> 00:25:25,068
you're a cult!
Ha ha ha!

427
00:25:26,736 --> 00:25:28,029
Why'd we stop?

428
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:31,992
This isn't Niagara Falls!
This is a desert!

429
00:25:32,075 --> 00:25:35,495
Yes--yes, I realize
that in typical cases...

430
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:36,621
you have to wait 48 hours.

431
00:25:36,663 --> 00:25:39,124
But this is not a typical case.

432
00:25:39,165 --> 00:25:42,377
My son is a bubble boy.
He'll die out there!

433
00:25:43,878 --> 00:25:46,631
Well, you'll certainly be
in my prayers tonight.

434
00:25:46,673 --> 00:25:49,050
And I'll be praying
you get nut cancer!

435
00:25:50,427 --> 00:25:53,847
All right, Plan B.
Did you finish the note?

436
00:25:53,888 --> 00:25:56,349
Come on.

437
00:25:56,433 --> 00:25:59,352
"Mr. and Mrs. Livingston,
we have kidnapped your son.

438
00:25:59,394 --> 00:26:03,982
"Pay $1 00,000 or he dies.
Signed, the Jews."

439
00:26:04,024 --> 00:26:07,235
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding me?

440
00:26:07,277 --> 00:26:10,822
Who in their right mind
is gonna believe this note?

441
00:26:10,864 --> 00:26:13,158
It's the Jews, Morton!

442
00:26:13,199 --> 00:26:16,453
They're gonna want
more than $1 00,000!

443
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:19,247
Think, man, think!

444
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:21,541
I'm havin' a bad day

445
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:23,668
Havin' a bad day

446
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,338
So get out of my way

447
00:26:27,714 --> 00:26:29,633
'Cause I'm havin' a bad day

448
00:26:29,633 --> 00:26:30,634
Uhh!

449
00:26:30,634 --> 00:26:33,261
Havin' a bad day

450
00:26:33,303 --> 00:26:34,721
Havin' a bad day

451
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:38,016
Get out of my way

452
00:26:38,058 --> 00:26:40,560
'Cause I'm havin' a bad day

453
00:26:40,644 --> 00:26:42,729
Havin' a bad day

454
00:26:42,771 --> 00:26:43,939
Get off!

455
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,149
Havin' a bad day

456
00:26:46,191 --> 00:26:48,276
Get out of my way...

457
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:53,323
Uhh! Aah!

458
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:06,836
Have you seen my son?

459
00:27:08,129 --> 00:27:09,839
Hello?

460
00:27:09,881 --> 00:27:14,803
I think he's deaf.
Have you seen my boy?

461
00:27:14,886 --> 00:27:18,807
Your weird-ass son
got on a bus...

462
00:27:18,848 --> 00:27:23,770
full of happy people skipping
around all over the place...

463
00:27:23,812 --> 00:27:25,313
and they headed towards Vegas.

464
00:27:25,355 --> 00:27:26,982
You know, Satan's anus.

465
00:27:27,023 --> 00:27:28,191
Thank you.

466
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:31,361
You filthy, fat,
filthy deaf man!

467
00:27:31,403 --> 00:27:34,072
I heard that.

468
00:27:34,114 --> 00:27:35,532
Mort, let's move it!

469
00:27:37,742 --> 00:27:40,745
I'll have you know
that I've lost two pounds.

470
00:27:40,787 --> 00:27:42,789
I have my ankle weights
on right now...

471
00:27:42,831 --> 00:27:45,292
and it's very hot in here
and I'm losing weight.

472
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,794
I've lost four pounds
in the last two months.

473
00:27:49,045 --> 00:27:50,755
Havin' a bad day

474
00:27:50,797 --> 00:27:53,300
Havin' a bad day

475
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:55,677
Get out of my way

476
00:27:55,719 --> 00:27:58,680
'Cause I'm havin' a bad day

477
00:27:58,722 --> 00:28:01,391
I'm havin' a bad day

478
00:28:01,433 --> 00:28:03,268
Get out of my way

479
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,853
Hey!

480
00:28:04,936 --> 00:28:07,564
-Hey, hey!
-Whoa!

481
00:28:07,606 --> 00:28:10,567
What are you...

482
00:28:10,609 --> 00:28:12,027
some kind of astronaut?

483
00:28:12,068 --> 00:28:15,697
No, I'm some kind
of bubble boy.

484
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:18,909
How do you take a dump
in that thing?

485
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,747
I think I could help you
with your situation here.

486
00:28:23,788 --> 00:28:25,874
How's some bubble vato
gonna help me?

487
00:28:25,916 --> 00:28:28,752
I got patches.

488
00:28:28,793 --> 00:28:30,837
Patches?

489
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:33,214
I could use
some stinkin' patches.

490
00:28:35,467 --> 00:28:39,095
-Gil!
-Gil, we love you!

491
00:28:39,137 --> 00:28:42,599
Welcome, my children.
Welcome.

492
00:28:42,682 --> 00:28:47,646
Today will truly be a time
of spiritual illumination.

493
00:28:49,648 --> 00:28:51,608
Now, can anyone guess
why we're all here?

494
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:52,651
-Ooh!
-Ooh, me!

495
00:28:52,692 --> 00:28:55,362
Yes, Todd.
No, the other Todd.

496
00:28:55,403 --> 00:28:58,240
To find out the final
incarnation of the Chosen One?

497
00:28:58,281 --> 00:29:00,200
Exactly.

498
00:29:00,242 --> 00:29:02,786
I can see you've been
reading your Kloobda.

499
00:29:02,827 --> 00:29:05,288
The Chosen One is among us!

500
00:29:06,581 --> 00:29:08,833
He walks the earth.

501
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:13,171
His final incarnation
will be...

502
00:29:15,715 --> 00:29:17,467
A round one!

503
00:29:22,055 --> 00:29:24,641
Yes, the round one.

504
00:29:24,683 --> 00:29:27,978
The holy messenger
trapped in a living globe.

505
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:30,689
We must find him
and release him...

506
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,024
so that he may carry us...

507
00:29:33,066 --> 00:29:36,486
only true believers,
to the kingdom of Heaven.

508
00:29:36,528 --> 00:29:40,198
And those who reject him
will mutate...

509
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,868
and burn eternally
on Planet PX-41 .

510
00:29:44,911 --> 00:29:48,248
Or PX-42,
if they run out of room.

511
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,667
If there are
no further questions...

512
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:52,168
Let's move on to the buffet.

513
00:29:55,755 --> 00:29:57,382
So they kicked you
out of the bus...

514
00:29:57,424 --> 00:30:00,010
in the middle of the desert
to die like some perro?

515
00:30:00,051 --> 00:30:01,595
Yep.

516
00:30:01,636 --> 00:30:02,721
Where you headed?

517
00:30:02,762 --> 00:30:06,057
Niagara Falls. I gotta
get there by Saturday...

518
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:09,019
to stop Chloe from marrying
the wrong man.

519
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:11,938
Ha ha ha!
Let's cut the vato, ese!

520
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,941
I wasn't planning on
cutting the vato, no.

521
00:30:14,983 --> 00:30:16,693
Somebody run off
with your old lady...

522
00:30:16,735 --> 00:30:19,154
Legally
you're allowed to cut him.

523
00:30:19,195 --> 00:30:21,197
She wasn't
technically my old lady.

524
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:24,284
I just never...

525
00:30:24,326 --> 00:30:27,120
I just never told her
how I felt.

526
00:30:27,162 --> 00:30:32,834
When I was your age,
I was in love with a woman.

527
00:30:32,876 --> 00:30:34,961
-Debbie?
-No.

528
00:30:35,003 --> 00:30:38,673
-Danielle.
-No. Wildfire!

529
00:30:38,715 --> 00:30:43,303
Oh, Wildfire!
She looks really nice.

530
00:30:43,345 --> 00:30:44,679
Yeah, but she left me
for some other vato.

531
00:30:44,721 --> 00:30:46,806
You know,
real buttoned-down...

532
00:30:46,848 --> 00:30:49,476
"I gotta get a job"
kind of vato, you know?

533
00:30:49,517 --> 00:30:51,937
To this day, ese,
I regret not finding him...

534
00:30:51,978 --> 00:30:55,106
and cutting his heart out
in a really violent way.

535
00:30:57,192 --> 00:31:01,029
Don't be like me, ese.
Don't live in regret.

536
00:31:01,071 --> 00:31:06,701
We'll be riding wildfire

537
00:31:06,743 --> 00:31:08,286
We'll be riding

538
00:31:08,328 --> 00:31:09,537
Ohh!

539
00:31:09,579 --> 00:31:13,750
Wildfire

540
00:31:13,792 --> 00:31:15,252
I'm OK.

541
00:31:17,921 --> 00:31:19,381
Look at the lights!

542
00:31:19,422 --> 00:31:21,508
Now this is
Las Vegas, Jimmy!

543
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:23,843
Wow!

544
00:31:23,885 --> 00:31:25,178
Paris!

545
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,763
That's beautiful, ain't it?

546
00:31:26,805 --> 00:31:28,014
And New York!

547
00:31:28,056 --> 00:31:29,975
That's big New York.

548
00:31:30,016 --> 00:31:31,685
This is amazing, Slim.

549
00:31:31,726 --> 00:31:33,186
Ha ha ha ha!

550
00:31:33,228 --> 00:31:34,771
Go faster! Go faster!

551
00:31:34,813 --> 00:31:36,189
You like the wind
in your hair?

552
00:31:36,231 --> 00:31:38,191
-Yeah.
-Ha ha ha!

553
00:31:40,902 --> 00:31:43,196
"We have the loosest sluts."

554
00:31:43,238 --> 00:31:44,531
That's "slots"!

555
00:31:44,573 --> 00:31:46,908
I'll show you how to play
the slot machines.

556
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:50,036
We can win some gas money
to get to Niagara Falls!

557
00:31:50,078 --> 00:31:51,705
All right, chicas!

558
00:31:51,746 --> 00:31:54,374
-Chicas!
-Ha ha ha ha ha!

559
00:31:56,585 --> 00:31:58,545
Ow! Ha ha ha!

560
00:31:58,587 --> 00:32:00,297
This is amazing!

561
00:32:00,338 --> 00:32:01,715
This town
never goes to sleep.

562
00:32:01,756 --> 00:32:03,717
We'll do some partying!

563
00:32:10,473 --> 00:32:12,100
Whoa! Oh, no!

564
00:32:13,643 --> 00:32:18,440
Wow! Oh ho!
Ha ha ha ha! Whoo!

565
00:32:23,987 --> 00:32:25,697
Jimmy!

566
00:32:25,739 --> 00:32:27,949
Where are you, baby?

567
00:32:27,991 --> 00:32:29,492
My baby Jimmy?

568
00:32:29,534 --> 00:32:31,286
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

569
00:32:31,328 --> 00:32:33,830
Coming through.
Excuse us.

570
00:32:33,872 --> 00:32:35,957
Come on,
talk to me, babies.

571
00:32:35,999 --> 00:32:38,001
Lookin' good!
Yes, all right.

572
00:32:41,004 --> 00:32:42,964
-Slim?
-Yeah.

573
00:32:43,006 --> 00:32:44,925
What's it like?

574
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,641
Ha ha ha ha ha!

575
00:32:52,682 --> 00:32:55,518
I could tell you what it was
like with me and Wildfire.

576
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,106
1,200 CCs of American steel
vibrating between your legs.

577
00:33:00,148 --> 00:33:02,943
Oh, man.
I'm talking fourth gear.

578
00:33:02,984 --> 00:33:07,280
4,000 RPMs! Ay!
Ha ha ha ha!

579
00:33:07,322 --> 00:33:09,616
That sounds amazing!
Ha ha!

580
00:33:09,658 --> 00:33:12,619
-Hors d'oeuvres?
-Oh, no, thanks.

581
00:33:12,702 --> 00:33:14,496
I got my own.

582
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,667
OK. Last one.

583
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,669
You go for it!

584
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,753
Oh, no. I couldn't.

585
00:33:21,795 --> 00:33:23,171
Go on.

586
00:33:23,213 --> 00:33:25,465
You want to win the money
for our trip, don't you?

587
00:33:25,507 --> 00:33:27,676
But what if I lose again?

588
00:33:27,717 --> 00:33:30,553
You didn't get out of that
bubble room to play it safe.

589
00:33:30,595 --> 00:33:32,681
You're right.

590
00:33:32,722 --> 00:33:34,182
Go for it.

591
00:33:39,104 --> 00:33:41,189
Oh! I'm tapped out.

592
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:44,526
I'm gonna steal some quarters
from that blind lady.

593
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:46,236
Slim, I don't think--

594
00:33:46,278 --> 00:33:47,862
I gotta go.
I only have two days--

595
00:33:49,906 --> 00:33:52,826
No, Slim! I gotta go!
I only have two days left!

596
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:55,245
-It'll be awesome!
-I only have two days left!

597
00:33:55,287 --> 00:33:57,038
Bow-wow
ba-ba-ba bow-wow

598
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,331
Ba-ba-ba-ba

599
00:33:58,373 --> 00:33:59,874
Bow-wow
ba-ba-ba bow-wow

600
00:33:59,916 --> 00:34:00,875
Ba-ba-ba-ba

601
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:03,753
Bow-wow ba-ba-ba bow

602
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:06,506
Rrrow-wow
ba-ba-ba bow-wow

603
00:34:06,548 --> 00:34:09,050
I didn't like leaving Slim
without saying good-bye...

604
00:34:09,134 --> 00:34:11,011
but I knew the vato
would understand.

605
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:12,762
The wedding
was two days away...

606
00:34:12,804 --> 00:34:17,559
and I only had 12 CCs of
American steel to get me there.

607
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:21,271
Don't think I can't see you
gawking at those neon boobies.

608
00:34:21,313 --> 00:34:24,774
Just keep your eye
on the road, mister.

609
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,322
Hey, have you seen
my little buddy?

610
00:34:30,322 --> 00:34:34,701
He's got frizzy hair,
and he's in a bubble.

611
00:34:34,743 --> 00:34:36,453
Hey, what's up?

612
00:34:36,494 --> 00:34:37,996
Uhh!

613
00:34:38,038 --> 00:34:40,832
Have you seen
this little bubble guy, ma'am?

614
00:34:42,876 --> 00:34:45,128
I didn't mean it.

615
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:49,257
Excuse. Hola.

616
00:34:49,299 --> 00:34:50,592
We're a bit lost.

617
00:34:50,634 --> 00:34:52,636
Could you tell us the way to--

618
00:34:52,677 --> 00:34:54,179
Niagara Falls?

619
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,181
I beg your pardon?

620
00:34:56,222 --> 00:34:57,766
'Cause that's where
my little buddy was headed...

621
00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:00,018
when you left him
in the desert to die!

622
00:35:02,687 --> 00:35:04,522
Come back!

623
00:35:04,564 --> 00:35:05,815
You Bright and Shinies--

624
00:35:05,857 --> 00:35:07,776
come back and get shiny
on my knife!

625
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:10,987
Hey! Hey! Hey!

626
00:35:15,867 --> 00:35:18,578
Aah!

627
00:35:19,871 --> 00:35:22,499
This looks like Area 51 .

628
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,459
Holy mother of shit, Morton!

629
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:26,878
What is that?
A space creature? An alien?

630
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:31,132
Oh, my God! Jimmy!

631
00:35:31,174 --> 00:35:32,842
Bow-wow
ba-ba-ba bow-wow

632
00:35:32,884 --> 00:35:33,885
Ba-ba-ba-ba

633
00:35:33,885 --> 00:35:34,886
Jimmy!

634
00:35:34,886 --> 00:35:36,221
Stop the car!

635
00:35:36,263 --> 00:35:37,514
Jimmy!

636
00:35:41,977 --> 00:35:44,020
Aah!

637
00:35:44,062 --> 00:35:45,730
Aah!

638
00:35:45,772 --> 00:35:48,692
Uhh! Aah!

639
00:35:58,785 --> 00:36:01,997
I wasn't quite sure
just how I'd gotten on board...

640
00:36:02,038 --> 00:36:04,749
but I'd always dreamed
of riding a train.

641
00:36:04,791 --> 00:36:07,586
Thank goodness
the worst was behind me...

642
00:36:07,627 --> 00:36:09,921
or so I thought.

643
00:36:11,298 --> 00:36:13,300
RUBBER WO
Look, he's awake.

644
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:21,099
What are we going to do?

645
00:36:23,685 --> 00:36:24,894
Aah!

646
00:36:24,936 --> 00:36:27,897
-Aah!
-Aah!

647
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:30,066
Shh!

648
00:36:30,108 --> 00:36:31,860
Dr. Phreak is gonna hear you!

649
00:36:31,902 --> 00:36:35,071
-What?
-He'll hear you. Hide!

650
00:36:35,113 --> 00:36:37,532
What did you say?

651
00:36:37,574 --> 00:36:41,578
He said be quiet or
the doctor will hear you. Shh!

652
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:43,288
Who are you?

653
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,665
They call me
the Human Sasquatch.

654
00:36:45,707 --> 00:36:47,417
What's your real name?

655
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:51,296
Um...Clark?

656
00:36:51,338 --> 00:36:52,923
So what's your deal?

657
00:36:52,964 --> 00:36:55,425
Why are you in a bubble?

658
00:36:55,467 --> 00:36:56,927
To protect me from germs.

659
00:36:56,968 --> 00:36:59,304
I was born
without any immunities...

660
00:36:59,346 --> 00:37:00,972
so even a single one
could kill me.

661
00:37:01,014 --> 00:37:03,141
But your doctor
would know all about that.

662
00:37:03,183 --> 00:37:04,768
Be quiet!
He's gonna come!

663
00:37:04,809 --> 00:37:06,770
He's not your average doctor.

664
00:37:06,853 --> 00:37:08,021
He's Dr. Phreak.

665
00:37:08,063 --> 00:37:11,316
We're all part of
his traveling Phreak Show.

666
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:12,651
He owns us.

667
00:37:12,692 --> 00:37:14,527
-Owns you?!
-Shh!

668
00:37:14,569 --> 00:37:15,612
Be quiet!
Here comes Dr. Phreak!

669
00:37:15,654 --> 00:37:16,863
He's an ex-con.

670
00:37:16,905 --> 00:37:20,116
If he finds you in this train,
he'll own you, too.

671
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,412
Now you did it, bubble butt.

672
00:37:24,454 --> 00:37:26,373
Here he comes!
Run for your life!

673
00:37:26,414 --> 00:37:28,500
He's a vicious brute.

674
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:42,389
You're Dr. Phreak?

675
00:37:43,431 --> 00:37:45,225
Ha ha ha ha!

676
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:46,851
You're so mini! Ha ha ha!

677
00:37:46,893 --> 00:37:48,395
-Mini? Oh, no!
-No!

678
00:37:48,436 --> 00:37:52,023
Me, mini?! I'm not mini!

679
00:37:52,065 --> 00:37:56,403
I'm not mini!
Not! Not! Not!

680
00:37:56,444 --> 00:37:58,405
I'm not mini!

681
00:37:58,446 --> 00:38:00,240
Who the hell are you?

682
00:38:00,282 --> 00:38:01,283
He's the bubble boy.

683
00:38:01,283 --> 00:38:03,034
Shut your beak!

684
00:38:03,076 --> 00:38:04,244
What are you doing
out of your coop?

685
00:38:04,286 --> 00:38:05,579
I shut up.

686
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,915
I could use
some fresh meat in my show.

687
00:38:08,957 --> 00:38:11,418
Why don't you hop
your little bubble butt...

688
00:38:11,459 --> 00:38:12,919
back on that train?

689
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:15,255
Thanks, but, um...

690
00:38:15,297 --> 00:38:18,049
I gotta get to
Niagara Falls by Saturday...

691
00:38:18,091 --> 00:38:19,467
to stop Chloe
from getting married.

692
00:38:21,636 --> 00:38:24,472
That's so, so beautiful.

693
00:38:24,514 --> 00:38:26,308
I, too, once loved another.

694
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:28,560
-You did?
-For 1 0 minutes.

695
00:38:28,602 --> 00:38:30,270
Then I kicked her ass
out of the car.

696
00:38:30,312 --> 00:38:33,023
Well, I gotta get going.

697
00:38:33,064 --> 00:38:34,024
Going?!

698
00:38:34,065 --> 00:38:35,191
-Oh!
-Oh!

699
00:38:35,233 --> 00:38:36,234
What are you gonna do?

700
00:38:36,318 --> 00:38:38,570
You're a freak,
and I should know.

701
00:38:38,612 --> 00:38:39,905
That's my business.

702
00:38:39,946 --> 00:38:42,782
No decent girl wants
to marry a bubble freak.

703
00:38:42,824 --> 00:38:45,785
Once you get that through
your thick, freaky skull...

704
00:38:45,827 --> 00:38:47,954
then give me a call.

705
00:38:47,996 --> 00:38:50,123
What's wrong with being a freak?

706
00:38:50,165 --> 00:38:51,374
Aah!

707
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:56,004
-Oh!
-Oh! That hurt!

708
00:38:56,046 --> 00:38:57,422
Doctor?

709
00:38:57,464 --> 00:38:59,758
Is he OK?
I didn't mean to...

710
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:01,927
He looks so sweet
when he's not yelling.

711
00:39:01,968 --> 00:39:04,512
You've killed him.

712
00:39:06,014 --> 00:39:08,308
-What are we going to do?
-Whoa!

713
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,019
Good luck! Bye!

714
00:39:11,061 --> 00:39:14,022
Uhh! Heads up, Bubble!

715
00:39:14,064 --> 00:39:15,231
OK. Bye!

716
00:39:15,273 --> 00:39:17,817
Get your own bags!
What do you think I am--bellhop?

717
00:39:25,116 --> 00:39:27,327
Hey, where are you guys going?

718
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:29,663
We're going with you,
Dr. Bubble.

719
00:39:29,704 --> 00:39:30,830
We're going with you.

720
00:39:30,872 --> 00:39:32,374
Dr. Bubble? No, no!

721
00:39:32,415 --> 00:39:34,876
You guys are free.

722
00:39:34,918 --> 00:39:36,628
You can do whatever
you want now.

723
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,672
Oh, we're free!

724
00:39:38,713 --> 00:39:39,839
Free as a bird!

725
00:39:39,881 --> 00:39:42,717
On to Niagara Falls!

726
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:44,386
On to Niagara Falls!

727
00:39:44,427 --> 00:39:46,096
All the way!
Oh, I love it!

728
00:39:46,137 --> 00:39:47,514
Look, you guys...

729
00:39:47,555 --> 00:39:50,475
I gotta do this alone.

730
00:39:53,103 --> 00:39:54,396
Oh, yeah.

731
00:39:54,437 --> 00:39:56,064
Bye!

732
00:40:03,613 --> 00:40:05,448
It sure was nice...

733
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,367
of the train man
to loan me his vehicle...

734
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:10,245
but if l was gonna make it
to the wedding on time...

735
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:13,081
I had to find something
with a motor.

736
00:40:13,123 --> 00:40:16,126
Oh, my God!
He ain't eating meat!

737
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:18,628
Can you all believe it?
It's tofu!

738
00:40:18,628 --> 00:40:20,463
Tofu!

739
00:40:20,505 --> 00:40:23,258
Could anybody
give me a ride?

740
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,427
Tofu gives me such gas!

741
00:40:25,468 --> 00:40:29,806
Bloody red meat!
Rare American meat!

742
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:34,894
That's the stupidest-looking hat
I've ever seen.

743
00:40:34,936 --> 00:40:38,023
It's adorable!

744
00:40:38,064 --> 00:40:40,567
Hey! Hey!

745
00:40:41,943 --> 00:40:44,279
Stop picking on him.

746
00:40:44,321 --> 00:40:45,989
-Oh!
-Oh!

747
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:48,450
I don't want any trouble.
I'm just--

748
00:40:48,491 --> 00:40:49,492
Really?

749
00:40:49,534 --> 00:40:50,785
Sissy beach ball!

750
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:52,996
Why are you
in that bubble, boy?

751
00:40:53,038 --> 00:40:54,164
Huh?

752
00:40:54,205 --> 00:40:58,043
Because I was born
without any immunities--

753
00:40:58,084 --> 00:41:00,337
Immunities?!
What the hell are immunities?

754
00:41:00,378 --> 00:41:02,505
Well, I ain't sticking
around to find out!

755
00:41:02,547 --> 00:41:03,798
Me, neither.

756
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:08,094
Everybody out!
He's got immunities!

757
00:41:08,136 --> 00:41:10,221
-No, no, no!
-He's contagious!

758
00:41:10,263 --> 00:41:12,182
I don't have any immunities!

759
00:41:12,223 --> 00:41:14,351
Don't try to change
your story now, boy!

760
00:41:14,392 --> 00:41:17,562
I don't have germs!
I'm not contagious!

761
00:41:17,604 --> 00:41:19,147
I just need a ride!

762
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:23,235
I need a ride!

763
00:41:23,276 --> 00:41:25,487
I hereby declare
this place quarantined!

764
00:41:25,528 --> 00:41:28,073
I don't have germs!

765
00:41:29,115 --> 00:41:30,825
Oh! Ohh!

766
00:41:30,867 --> 00:41:32,327
What's going on, Sheriff?

767
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:33,370
Oh!

768
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:36,039
Guys, I think
your building's on fire.

769
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:39,751
Carl Peterson's
best pig just died!

770
00:41:39,793 --> 00:41:42,379
It's spreading!

771
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,589
Burn, baby, burn

772
00:41:44,631 --> 00:41:46,591
Disco inferno

773
00:41:46,633 --> 00:41:48,093
Burn, baby, burn

774
00:41:48,134 --> 00:41:50,178
Burn that mother down,
y'all

775
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,763
Burn, baby, burn

776
00:41:51,805 --> 00:41:54,224
Disco inferno

777
00:41:54,266 --> 00:41:56,434
Burn, baby, burn

778
00:41:56,476 --> 00:42:00,063
Whoo! Just like Calcutta
in the summer!

779
00:42:00,105 --> 00:42:01,356
Come! Follow me!

780
00:42:01,398 --> 00:42:03,358
Come on!

781
00:42:11,449 --> 00:42:14,494
Whoa!

782
00:42:18,665 --> 00:42:20,083
I don't think I'm in!

783
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:21,293
Stop messing about!

784
00:42:21,334 --> 00:42:23,420
This whole town
is going to blow!

785
00:42:27,299 --> 00:42:30,135
Ha ha ha ha! Boy, howdy!

786
00:42:30,176 --> 00:42:33,555
Now, that's a good fire!
Heh heh heh!

787
00:42:34,681 --> 00:42:35,765
Uh-oh.

788
00:42:37,142 --> 00:42:39,102
Disco inferno, yeah

789
00:42:39,185 --> 00:42:42,022
Burn the mother down

790
00:42:42,063 --> 00:42:43,481
Burn, baby, burn

791
00:42:48,737 --> 00:42:50,947
Ice cream! ice cream!

792
00:42:50,989 --> 00:42:52,824
Curry!

793
00:42:52,866 --> 00:42:54,826
Let's go. Come on.

794
00:42:54,868 --> 00:42:57,871
Watch out for the feet.
I told you before.

795
00:42:57,913 --> 00:42:59,956
Look out!
Coming through!

796
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,499
I'm on the run!

797
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,004
Morton, that's the one!

798
00:43:06,046 --> 00:43:08,506
Jimmy! Jimmy! We're here!

799
00:43:08,548 --> 00:43:11,426
Morton, get this thing open.

800
00:43:11,468 --> 00:43:13,845
Jimmy?!

801
00:43:13,887 --> 00:43:15,096
Jimmy--Ooh!

802
00:43:15,138 --> 00:43:18,391
Look at this cute
little boy, Morton!

803
00:43:18,433 --> 00:43:20,018
Can you tell me,
have you seen my son?

804
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,812
He's wearing
a large plastic bubble suit.

805
00:43:24,064 --> 00:43:26,983
I know what you want.
I'll give you some candy.

806
00:43:27,025 --> 00:43:28,902
He stole my freaks,
that son of a bitch!

807
00:43:28,944 --> 00:43:30,654
Oh! What a potty mouth
you have!

808
00:43:30,695 --> 00:43:33,531
Where was he going?

809
00:43:33,573 --> 00:43:34,699
Screw you, lady!

810
00:43:34,741 --> 00:43:36,159
Aah!

811
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:41,831
Thanks.

812
00:43:41,873 --> 00:43:43,041
Thanks for
saving me back there.

813
00:43:43,083 --> 00:43:44,209
You're welcome.

814
00:43:44,251 --> 00:43:46,378
Those were some crazy vatos.

815
00:43:46,419 --> 00:43:48,338
For some unknown reason,
Shiva has brought you...

816
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,048
into my life
like a hot flash.

817
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:52,050
You came to my defense...

818
00:43:52,092 --> 00:43:54,761
and the law of karma
requires me to return the favor.

819
00:43:54,803 --> 00:43:57,222
This ice cream truck
is merely a catalyst...

820
00:43:57,264 --> 00:43:59,391
a way to teach
the wisdom of the Sacred Cow.

821
00:43:59,432 --> 00:44:00,976
For who can resist
ice cream, eh?

822
00:44:01,017 --> 00:44:02,018
I know I can't.

823
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,521
So, how may I be
of service to you...

824
00:44:04,604 --> 00:44:05,897
my Zip-locked friend?

825
00:44:05,939 --> 00:44:08,024
I need to get to
Niagara Falls by Saturday...

826
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:10,068
to stop Chloe
from getting married.

827
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:13,738
Oh. I was thinking...

828
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,782
more along the lines
of a free snow cone...

829
00:44:15,782 --> 00:44:19,286
but, OK,
Niagara Falls it is.

830
00:44:21,288 --> 00:44:27,002
Livin' in
the Land of the Lost

831
00:44:27,043 --> 00:44:29,004
Livin' in the Land...

832
00:44:30,213 --> 00:44:33,633
No way is this better
than "Jurassic Park."

833
00:44:33,675 --> 00:44:36,344
I can't believe you and
bubble geek like this show.

834
00:44:36,386 --> 00:44:37,512
The effects look totally fake.

835
00:44:37,554 --> 00:44:39,264
That's the whole point.

836
00:44:39,306 --> 00:44:41,099
What?
It's supposed to look fake?

837
00:44:42,642 --> 00:44:45,103
I'm not here.

838
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:47,939
Hello?

839
00:44:47,981 --> 00:44:51,067
What have you done
with my son?

840
00:44:51,109 --> 00:44:52,652
Mrs. Livingston?

841
00:44:52,694 --> 00:44:53,820
Is he with you?

842
00:44:53,862 --> 00:44:55,572
How could he be here?

843
00:44:55,614 --> 00:44:56,781
Well, apparently
he's on his way...

844
00:44:56,823 --> 00:44:58,533
to your wedding
in a bubble suit...

845
00:44:58,575 --> 00:45:02,329
exposing himself to
all the wickedness and filth...

846
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:03,914
this world has to offer!

847
00:45:03,955 --> 00:45:06,207
And you're responsible!

848
00:45:06,249 --> 00:45:08,043
Come on! Over here! Come on!

849
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:10,962
-Come on!
-Over here!

850
00:45:11,004 --> 00:45:14,132
-Come on! This way!
-Come on!

851
00:45:14,174 --> 00:45:15,425
Let's go, Morton.

852
00:45:15,467 --> 00:45:17,886
Correction. You two
aren't going anywhere...

853
00:45:17,928 --> 00:45:19,512
until I get my freaks back.

854
00:45:19,554 --> 00:45:23,475
Don't you take that tone
of voice with me, young man!

855
00:45:23,516 --> 00:45:27,354
Morton, are you gonna let him
talk to me like that?

856
00:45:27,395 --> 00:45:29,564
Yeah, Mort. Are ya?

857
00:45:35,403 --> 00:45:37,822
-My car!
-My freaks!

858
00:45:44,871 --> 00:45:49,042
Help! Jimmy!
Aah! Jimmy!

859
00:45:49,084 --> 00:45:50,210
Help!

860
00:45:50,252 --> 00:45:51,836
Hang on! Hang on!

861
00:45:51,878 --> 00:45:53,505
Aah!

862
00:45:53,546 --> 00:45:55,840
Screw you, Grumpy!

863
00:45:55,882 --> 00:45:57,968
Hop on, babe.

864
00:46:00,178 --> 00:46:02,430
Thanks for saving me, Mark.

865
00:46:02,472 --> 00:46:03,598
How do you do it?

866
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:06,935
Immunities, baby.
Immunities.

867
00:46:06,977 --> 00:46:08,895
-Aah!

868
00:46:08,937 --> 00:46:11,314
-Aah!
-Aah!

869
00:46:16,987 --> 00:46:19,573
Oh, dear.

870
00:46:23,118 --> 00:46:26,288
Oh! Oh!

871
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:30,250
Look at that.
It's an elk.

872
00:46:31,418 --> 00:46:34,421
Or is it a caribou?

873
00:46:34,504 --> 00:46:37,382
Or an American bison?

874
00:46:39,759 --> 00:46:41,303
l, uh...

875
00:46:41,344 --> 00:46:43,388
I think that it's a cow.

876
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:46,391
Oh, really?! A cow?!

877
00:46:46,433 --> 00:46:49,352
I didn't know.

878
00:46:49,394 --> 00:46:51,313
What have I done?

879
00:46:51,354 --> 00:46:53,690
It's just a cow, Pushpop.

880
00:46:56,359 --> 00:46:57,819
Just a cow?

881
00:46:57,861 --> 00:46:59,779
Just a cow?!

882
00:46:59,821 --> 00:47:01,948
In my religion,
the cow is the womb...

883
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:03,909
from which all life springs!

884
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:05,076
Heh heh heh!

885
00:47:05,118 --> 00:47:07,662
I have transgressed
against Shiva!

886
00:47:11,124 --> 00:47:12,500
Shiva?

887
00:47:13,627 --> 00:47:15,629
The six-armed goddess.

888
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,505
Have you ever been
karmically bitch-slapped...

889
00:47:17,547 --> 00:47:19,132
by a six-armed goddess?

890
00:47:20,216 --> 00:47:23,053
I'll take that as a no!

891
00:47:23,094 --> 00:47:24,721
Oh! Um...

892
00:47:24,763 --> 00:47:27,140
It's OK, Pushpop.

893
00:47:27,182 --> 00:47:29,392
Your religion's all lies.

894
00:47:29,434 --> 00:47:31,645
Pardon?

895
00:47:31,686 --> 00:47:33,813
That's what my mom says.

896
00:47:33,855 --> 00:47:35,607
I mean...

897
00:47:35,649 --> 00:47:37,651
Bollocks.

898
00:47:37,734 --> 00:47:39,819
I must atone.

899
00:47:39,861 --> 00:47:41,696
His mother taught him.

900
00:47:41,738 --> 00:47:43,240
What nonsense.

901
00:47:43,281 --> 00:47:45,283
May Shiva
shine upon your journey!

902
00:47:45,325 --> 00:47:47,953
Well, can't we...

903
00:47:47,994 --> 00:47:51,039
can't we drive and atone?

904
00:47:51,081 --> 00:47:52,624
No! One for the road.

905
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:55,085
What? No, no, no.

906
00:47:55,126 --> 00:47:57,420
There are germs in here!

907
00:47:57,462 --> 00:47:59,256
Frozen! No germs!

908
00:48:01,299 --> 00:48:03,385
No germs?

909
00:48:03,426 --> 00:48:04,928
When did this happen?

910
00:48:09,224 --> 00:48:11,601
Thanks for the lift!
So long!

911
00:48:11,643 --> 00:48:13,645
Ice cream

912
00:48:18,275 --> 00:48:20,902
It was one thing
that my mom...

913
00:48:20,944 --> 00:48:23,196
had never heard of
the bitch-slapping goddess...

914
00:48:23,238 --> 00:48:25,323
but it seemed like everybody
should have heard...

915
00:48:25,365 --> 00:48:28,285
offrozen,
germ-free ice cream.

916
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,342
Ohh!

917
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:51,600
Everybody loves ice cream.

918
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:53,310
Stripper.

919
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,479
Dykes.

920
00:48:56,521 --> 00:48:57,898
Dear Lord,
if Thou findest...

921
00:48:57,939 --> 00:48:59,649
the stealing of this truck
offensive in any way...

922
00:48:59,691 --> 00:49:01,902
please direct Thy wrath
upon that midget...

923
00:49:01,943 --> 00:49:05,155
and not upon us,
Thy humble servants. Amen.

924
00:49:06,364 --> 00:49:08,033
All right.
Let's haul ass.

925
00:49:08,074 --> 00:49:10,702
One of you drive.
I can't reach the pedals.

926
00:49:10,744 --> 00:49:13,038
Upsy-daisy. Whoo!

927
00:49:30,305 --> 00:49:33,016
I am coming back
as a cockroach.

928
00:49:33,058 --> 00:49:34,643
Definitely a cockroach.

929
00:49:39,064 --> 00:49:40,190
Aah!

930
00:49:40,232 --> 00:49:41,191
Aah!

931
00:49:41,233 --> 00:49:42,859
Oh ho ho! Oh ho ho!

932
00:49:42,901 --> 00:49:44,819
Aah! Aah!

933
00:49:44,861 --> 00:49:47,781
Now, we don't know where
those hands have been, do we?

934
00:49:47,822 --> 00:49:49,699
Rub them together.

935
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:52,035
Kill those germs!
That's right.

936
00:49:52,077 --> 00:49:53,620
Good boy.

937
00:50:00,961 --> 00:50:02,545
No! Stop!

938
00:50:02,587 --> 00:50:05,257
Show some respect!

939
00:50:07,592 --> 00:50:10,053
Hey! Yo, hippie!

940
00:50:10,095 --> 00:50:12,722
You seen a big, yellow bus
with a lot of bright...

941
00:50:12,764 --> 00:50:14,599
and shiny cabrones
pass through here?

942
00:50:14,641 --> 00:50:17,769
No, sir.
I don't believe I have.

943
00:50:19,437 --> 00:50:22,732
You got any bomb pops
on that truck?

944
00:50:22,774 --> 00:50:25,277
Oh, yes. Please,
take the whole damn truck.

945
00:50:25,318 --> 00:50:26,486
All right!

946
00:50:27,988 --> 00:50:30,240
Who wants a blue one?

947
00:50:33,952 --> 00:50:36,830
Everything is A-OK

948
00:50:36,871 --> 00:50:40,458
Bright and shiny

949
00:50:43,044 --> 00:50:44,671
Uhh! Uhh!

950
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:50,594
What have I done?

951
00:50:49,509 --> 00:50:50,969
You OK?

952
00:50:51,011 --> 00:50:52,137
Yeah.

953
00:50:52,178 --> 00:50:55,015
It's just--
Jimmy's my best friend.

954
00:50:55,056 --> 00:50:57,976
We basically spent every day
together in high school.

955
00:50:58,018 --> 00:51:00,520
Yeah? Did you ever...

956
00:51:00,562 --> 00:51:03,315
you know,
get in his bubble?

957
00:51:03,356 --> 00:51:05,650
No.

958
00:51:05,692 --> 00:51:07,569
Not that I didn't
think about it, though.

959
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:08,737
I know what you mean.

960
00:51:08,778 --> 00:51:10,030
I used to play
"Spin the bottle"...

961
00:51:10,071 --> 00:51:12,908
with the kid from
Special Ed. Ha ha ha!

962
00:51:12,949 --> 00:51:15,911
Ha ha ha!

963
00:51:15,952 --> 00:51:18,455
Well.

964
00:51:20,916 --> 00:51:24,628
It would've never worked out
between the two of us.

965
00:51:24,669 --> 00:51:27,923
Yeah. Rubber comes in handy
every once in a while...

966
00:51:27,964 --> 00:51:29,424
but let's not go overboard.

967
00:51:29,466 --> 00:51:31,217
You're way better off
with my brother.

968
00:51:31,259 --> 00:51:34,721
Yeah. Way better off.

969
00:51:35,972 --> 00:51:37,223
Take a little time

970
00:51:37,265 --> 00:51:38,683
Throw it on the line

971
00:51:38,725 --> 00:51:39,726
Let me believe

972
00:51:39,768 --> 00:51:41,394
That you believe in me

973
00:51:41,436 --> 00:51:42,812
Baby, turn around

974
00:51:42,854 --> 00:51:44,439
Look at what I found

975
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:46,733
You're the one that I want

976
00:51:46,775 --> 00:51:48,485
Take a little time

977
00:51:48,526 --> 00:51:49,945
Throw it on the line

978
00:51:49,986 --> 00:51:51,029
Let me believe

979
00:51:51,071 --> 00:51:52,822
That you believe in me

980
00:51:52,864 --> 00:51:54,074
Stand and turn around

981
00:51:54,115 --> 00:51:55,450
Look at what I found

982
00:51:55,492 --> 00:51:58,536
You were the one that I wanted

983
00:51:58,578 --> 00:51:59,913
Take a little time

984
00:51:59,955 --> 00:52:00,914
Throw it on the line

985
00:52:00,956 --> 00:52:02,374
Let me believe

986
00:52:02,415 --> 00:52:03,875
That you believe in me

987
00:52:03,959 --> 00:52:05,377
Baby, turn around

988
00:52:05,418 --> 00:52:06,753
Look at what I found

989
00:52:06,795 --> 00:52:10,590
You were the one that I wanted

990
00:52:10,632 --> 00:52:13,343
Taxi! Taxi!

991
00:52:13,385 --> 00:52:17,180
Hi! I need to get
to Niagara Falls by tomorrow.

992
00:52:17,222 --> 00:52:18,306
Can you take me there?

993
00:52:18,348 --> 00:52:20,600
-Depends.
-On what?

994
00:52:20,642 --> 00:52:22,936
Goin' that far I'll have
to get me some Depends.

995
00:52:22,978 --> 00:52:25,272
And 500 smackers!

996
00:52:25,313 --> 00:52:27,023
$500?!

997
00:52:27,065 --> 00:52:30,068
Where am I gonna get $500?

998
00:52:36,491 --> 00:52:39,828
Who wants to be next?
Who wants the $500?

999
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:41,746
Now, we need
some fresh blood here!

1000
00:52:41,788 --> 00:52:43,456
Whoa! Spotlight
on the dance floor!

1001
00:52:43,498 --> 00:52:45,333
Whoa, I like the look of this!

1002
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:48,628
Mr. Alien, is it?
What are you doing here, dummy?

1003
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:50,714
I saw the sign outside...

1004
00:52:50,755 --> 00:52:53,758
and it said that you
have $500, and so...

1005
00:52:53,842 --> 00:52:55,635
You want $500?

1006
00:52:55,677 --> 00:52:58,513
Yes. I would like $500.

1007
00:52:58,555 --> 00:53:00,807
You want $500?

1008
00:53:00,849 --> 00:53:03,018
Yes. Please, I would like $500.

1009
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:04,603
You want $500?

1010
00:53:04,644 --> 00:53:06,938
Yes, I want $500!

1011
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:10,191
-$500!
-$500!

1012
00:53:10,233 --> 00:53:11,860
All right!

1013
00:53:11,902 --> 00:53:14,237
Our next contestant,
Mr. Alien!

1014
00:53:14,279 --> 00:53:17,240
Red Hot, Working Girl,
bring him on over!

1015
00:53:17,282 --> 00:53:19,534
A big cheer for Mr. Alien!

1016
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:24,456
Mud! Mud! Mud! Mud!

1017
00:53:24,497 --> 00:53:25,957
Mud! Mud! Mud!

1018
00:53:25,999 --> 00:53:29,002
-$500!
-$500!

1019
00:53:29,085 --> 00:53:30,420
Aah! Hey!

1020
00:53:42,265 --> 00:53:43,266
Whoa! Oh, whoa!

1021
00:53:43,266 --> 00:53:45,810
-Unh!
-Unh!

1022
00:53:48,855 --> 00:53:50,065
$500!

1023
00:53:51,191 --> 00:53:53,068
Bubble Boy! Bubble Boy!

1024
00:54:00,867 --> 00:54:02,077
$500!

1025
00:54:02,118 --> 00:54:06,873
Goddess Shiva,
I really need that money!

1026
00:54:11,795 --> 00:54:13,588
I pledge allegiance
to the flag...

1027
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,173
of the United States
of America...

1028
00:54:15,215 --> 00:54:16,800
and to the republic
for which it stands!

1029
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,013
Ha ha ha!
We have winner!

1030
00:54:22,055 --> 00:54:24,140
Winner! Winner! Winner!

1031
00:54:24,182 --> 00:54:26,601
Bitch-slap me, Jesus

1032
00:54:26,643 --> 00:54:29,854
I've lost my way

1033
00:54:29,896 --> 00:54:32,274
Strayed from your path

1034
00:54:32,315 --> 00:54:34,651
Yet I pray

1035
00:54:35,735 --> 00:54:38,113
Who let the dogs out

1036
00:54:38,154 --> 00:54:39,739
Woof woof woof

1037
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:42,742
Morton!
I was listening to that!

1038
00:54:42,826 --> 00:54:44,327
Yeah, Mort.

1039
00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:48,665
A girl can't get five minutes
of quality time with Jesus.

1040
00:54:57,757 --> 00:54:59,801
Man, this is some good curry!

1041
00:54:59,843 --> 00:55:02,512
Ha ha! Yeah!

1042
00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:06,933
I got the money!

1043
00:55:06,975 --> 00:55:09,352
Look! There he is!

1044
00:55:09,394 --> 00:55:11,438
I've got the money!
Ha ha!

1045
00:55:11,479 --> 00:55:13,356
We found you, Todd.

1046
00:55:13,398 --> 00:55:15,191
We know who you are.

1047
00:55:15,233 --> 00:55:18,069
We've come to set you free!

1048
00:55:18,111 --> 00:55:19,487
Ow!

1049
00:55:19,529 --> 00:55:21,323
You are the Chosen One!

1050
00:55:21,364 --> 00:55:23,325
I don't need you
to set me free!

1051
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:26,578
I don't--Oh!

1052
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:29,873
Wait! Wait!

1053
00:55:29,915 --> 00:55:30,957
Look!
Those people have Jimmy!

1054
00:55:30,999 --> 00:55:33,043
-Stealth!
-What the hell is that?

1055
00:55:33,084 --> 00:55:35,211
We've gotta get him away
from those freaks.

1056
00:55:35,253 --> 00:55:37,714
-What can we do?
-We need a plan.

1057
00:55:37,756 --> 00:55:39,966
We blend.

1058
00:55:40,008 --> 00:55:42,427
I got a plan.
What size shirt you wear?

1059
00:55:43,970 --> 00:55:48,767
And now, to avoid mutating
and burning on planet PX-41...

1060
00:55:48,808 --> 00:55:52,812
we release the Chosen One
using the ceremonial tweezers.

1061
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:57,317
With this tiny prick,
I release thee!

1062
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:58,944
No! Don't! I'll die!

1063
00:55:59,986 --> 00:56:03,615
It must be a test!
Where's my Kloobda?

1064
00:56:03,657 --> 00:56:05,033
Right there, Lorraine!

1065
00:56:05,075 --> 00:56:06,159
Thank you.

1066
00:56:06,201 --> 00:56:07,494
You're welcome.

1067
00:56:07,535 --> 00:56:10,664
Wait a minute!
You're not a Shiny!

1068
00:56:11,873 --> 00:56:13,875
Who are you?

1069
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:16,294
Uh...Todd?

1070
00:56:16,336 --> 00:56:18,672
-Oh!
-Hi, Todd.

1071
00:56:18,713 --> 00:56:20,423
Wait a minute!

1072
00:56:20,465 --> 00:56:22,550
What's the matter
with your arms?

1073
00:56:22,592 --> 00:56:24,219
What are you talking about?

1074
00:56:24,261 --> 00:56:27,472
There's nothing wrong
with my arms!

1075
00:56:27,514 --> 00:56:31,101
We're too late!
We're mutating!

1076
00:56:36,565 --> 00:56:38,733
We'll get you out
through the front of the bus.

1077
00:56:38,775 --> 00:56:41,987
Oh, God!
Why won't you help me?

1078
00:56:44,447 --> 00:56:46,866
Ha ha ha ha!

1079
00:56:46,908 --> 00:56:48,994
He's got a bubbly face

1080
00:56:49,035 --> 00:56:50,745
And a bubbly nose

1081
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:52,289
Mr. Bubble

1082
00:56:53,748 --> 00:56:55,625
Bubble, Bubblicious

1083
00:56:55,667 --> 00:56:57,252
The ultimate bubble.

1084
00:56:59,379 --> 00:57:01,840
Tiny bubbles

1085
00:57:01,881 --> 00:57:03,341
Tiny bubbles

1086
00:57:03,383 --> 00:57:05,051
In the wine

1087
00:57:06,094 --> 00:57:09,347
I know. I miss him, too.

1088
00:57:09,389 --> 00:57:12,350
Come on, Bubble Boy!
Hurry up!

1089
00:57:12,392 --> 00:57:14,561
Come on!

1090
00:57:14,603 --> 00:57:15,562
This way, guys! Hurry!

1091
00:57:15,604 --> 00:57:17,063
This way!

1092
00:57:17,105 --> 00:57:19,941
Ow! Guys! Oh!

1093
00:57:19,983 --> 00:57:23,361
Hey! Come on! Todd!

1094
00:57:25,655 --> 00:57:29,534
Hey, Shinies!

1095
00:57:29,576 --> 00:57:31,620
We have some
unfinished business, huh?

1096
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:34,205
No, no, Slim.
They're my friends.

1097
00:57:34,247 --> 00:57:35,790
They got him brainwashed!

1098
00:57:35,832 --> 00:57:38,293
No! No! No!

1099
00:57:38,335 --> 00:57:39,794
Wait!

1100
00:57:39,836 --> 00:57:41,880
Bubble, we'll help you out!
Don't worry!

1101
00:57:41,922 --> 00:57:44,507
I'll take you on with
one flipper behind my back!

1102
00:57:44,549 --> 00:57:45,800
You want
a mouthful of tuna?

1103
00:57:45,842 --> 00:57:49,387
Free Willy! Free Willy!

1104
00:57:49,429 --> 00:57:51,264
I'm gonna whup that ass!

1105
00:57:51,306 --> 00:57:53,141
Yeah!

1106
00:57:53,183 --> 00:57:55,936
Aah! Oh, my God!

1107
00:57:55,977 --> 00:57:57,771
Get it off of me!

1108
00:58:03,109 --> 00:58:05,362
Ha ha ha ha!

1109
00:58:08,406 --> 00:58:11,952
Niagara Falls,
and step on it!

1110
00:58:20,835 --> 00:58:22,295
It's the cops!

1111
00:58:22,337 --> 00:58:24,631
-Wait a minute!
-Don't touch me there!

1112
00:58:24,673 --> 00:58:26,675
Where's Bubble Boy?

1113
00:58:27,926 --> 00:58:32,222
You ask me if l love you

1114
00:58:32,264 --> 00:58:36,017
And I choke on my reply

1115
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:40,605
I'd rather hurt you honestly

1116
00:58:40,647 --> 00:58:43,316
-Poon !
-Huh?

1117
00:58:43,358 --> 00:58:45,360
Chasing a dame, ain't you?

1118
00:58:45,402 --> 00:58:47,988
Who am I to judge you

1119
00:58:48,029 --> 00:58:51,575
Last time I was
in a commotion like that...

1120
00:58:51,616 --> 00:58:54,452
it was all on account
of Poon .

1121
00:58:54,494 --> 00:58:56,246
Oh, what the astronauts drink.

1122
00:58:56,288 --> 00:58:58,290
No, no. My wife.

1123
00:58:58,373 --> 00:59:01,835
My little China doll.

1124
00:59:01,876 --> 00:59:03,795
Yeah, till that damn
brother of mine...

1125
00:59:03,837 --> 00:59:06,715
took her off to Waxahachie.

1126
00:59:06,756 --> 00:59:10,010
Snatched my Poon
right out from under me.

1127
00:59:10,051 --> 00:59:13,179
86 years ago.

1128
00:59:13,221 --> 00:59:15,890
I ain't spoke
to that bastard since.

1129
00:59:15,932 --> 00:59:19,311
Don't live in regret, ese.

1130
00:59:19,352 --> 00:59:21,688
He's your family.

1131
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:23,690
Family. Heh.

1132
00:59:23,732 --> 00:59:26,484
I really gotta go!

1133
00:59:26,526 --> 00:59:29,696
I told you, once we're on
the road we're not stopping!

1134
00:59:29,738 --> 00:59:34,784
Than mislead you with a lie

1135
00:59:34,826 --> 00:59:37,078
And after all that...

1136
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,206
they still didn't get you
a new puppy?

1137
00:59:40,248 --> 00:59:41,207
No.

1138
00:59:41,249 --> 00:59:44,711
Ohh.
Poor little thing.

1139
00:59:44,753 --> 00:59:49,382
No wonder you turned out
the way you did.

1140
00:59:49,424 --> 00:59:51,009
Ohh.

1141
00:59:51,092 --> 00:59:56,139
And sometimes when we touch

1142
00:59:56,181 --> 01:00:00,060
The honesty's too much

1143
01:00:12,155 --> 01:00:14,407
Morning, Pappy.

1144
01:00:16,326 --> 01:00:18,620
You must be tired.

1145
01:00:18,662 --> 01:00:24,501
You get any sleep?
Ha ha ha!

1146
01:00:24,542 --> 01:00:27,671
I said, you get any sleep?

1147
01:00:27,712 --> 01:00:31,383
Pappy!

1148
01:00:33,343 --> 01:00:35,136
Pappy?

1149
01:00:39,557 --> 01:00:41,184
Pappy?

1150
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:53,196
Pappy? Pappy! Stop!

1151
01:00:53,238 --> 01:00:57,993
Aah!

1152
01:00:58,034 --> 01:01:02,372
Oh! Ow!

1153
01:01:02,414 --> 01:01:04,207
Yow! Yeah, I'm fine.

1154
01:01:08,211 --> 01:01:09,379
You have a phone?

1155
01:01:22,809 --> 01:01:24,603
Yello.

1156
01:01:33,403 --> 01:01:35,196
Hello?

1157
01:01:35,238 --> 01:01:37,657
Hi. Is Chloe there?

1158
01:01:37,699 --> 01:01:39,784
Who can I say is calling?

1159
01:01:39,826 --> 01:01:41,077
It's Jimmy.

1160
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,664
Oh. Hello, Jimmy.

1161
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:46,499
Where the hell are you?

1162
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:50,128
I'm really close.
In New York, I think.

1163
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:53,256
I don't mean to burst
your bubble, Jimbo...

1164
01:01:53,298 --> 01:01:56,384
but if you got a thing for
Chloe, it's not gonna happen.

1165
01:01:56,468 --> 01:01:58,428
We're getting married
in one hour.

1166
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:00,221
What are you
expecting to happen?

1167
01:02:00,263 --> 01:02:01,640
You can't even touch her.

1168
01:02:01,681 --> 01:02:02,807
How are you
gonna have children?

1169
01:02:02,849 --> 01:02:04,935
Do you even have sperm?

1170
01:02:06,311 --> 01:02:08,772
Fact it, dude,
you're a charity case.

1171
01:02:08,813 --> 01:02:12,234
Chloe felt sorry for you
because you lived in a bubble.

1172
01:02:12,317 --> 01:02:13,944
Do us all a favor.

1173
01:02:13,985 --> 01:02:15,695
Go on back to Palmdale
where you belong.

1174
01:02:25,747 --> 01:02:29,751
I wasn't quite sure what
Mark meant about the sperm...

1175
01:02:29,834 --> 01:02:32,671
but he was right
about one thing.

1176
01:02:32,712 --> 01:02:34,673
Even if l did get there...

1177
01:02:34,714 --> 01:02:37,300
I couldn't ever really
hold Chloe in my arms...

1178
01:02:37,342 --> 01:02:39,803
or kiss her for real.

1179
01:02:41,721 --> 01:02:44,140
I really was a freak.

1180
01:02:49,813 --> 01:02:51,147
Hello.

1181
01:02:51,189 --> 01:02:53,817
Hi, Dr. Phreak.
It's Jimmy.

1182
01:02:53,858 --> 01:02:55,610
Jimmy who?

1183
01:02:55,652 --> 01:02:56,903
The bubble boy.

1184
01:02:56,945 --> 01:02:58,863
Jimmy?! Give me that!

1185
01:02:58,905 --> 01:03:00,031
That's my phone!

1186
01:03:00,073 --> 01:03:02,075
Hello? Jimmy?

1187
01:03:02,117 --> 01:03:03,910
-Mom?
-Jimmy!

1188
01:03:03,952 --> 01:03:05,662
What are you doing
with Dr. Phreak?

1189
01:03:05,662 --> 01:03:07,831
-Where are you?
-Where are my freaks?

1190
01:03:07,872 --> 01:03:10,667
OK, sweetheart,
we'll be right there.

1191
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:11,876
Don't move!

1192
01:03:11,918 --> 01:03:14,754
Morton, we've got our boy back!

1193
01:03:14,796 --> 01:03:16,631
Gimme that.

1194
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:26,808
Aah! Ow! Ooh!

1195
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:31,855
Ow! Eek! Ohh!
Son of a bitch.

1196
01:03:31,938 --> 01:03:33,231
Mama.

1197
01:03:54,628 --> 01:03:57,756
Ohh! Aah!

1198
01:04:08,934 --> 01:04:11,228
I never stole anything before...

1199
01:04:11,269 --> 01:04:12,854
and I just fell off
a dead man's car...

1200
01:04:12,896 --> 01:04:14,105
and my parents are about
to come pick me up...

1201
01:04:14,147 --> 01:04:15,857
and this is the girl
I love's favorite beer...

1202
01:04:15,899 --> 01:04:18,401
and I was just wondering,
could I borrow it?

1203
01:04:18,485 --> 01:04:20,695
Yeah, sure.

1204
01:04:20,737 --> 01:04:22,113
Thanks.

1205
01:04:26,952 --> 01:04:28,703
Now open the safe!

1206
01:04:28,745 --> 01:04:30,580
Do it! Chop chop!

1207
01:04:44,678 --> 01:04:46,388
Ohh...

1208
01:04:48,181 --> 01:04:49,349
Aah!

1209
01:04:49,349 --> 01:04:50,433
My baby!

1210
01:04:50,475 --> 01:04:54,688
The sweet Lord
has delivered you from evil.

1211
01:04:54,729 --> 01:04:56,314
Ohh!

1212
01:04:56,356 --> 01:04:58,900
I must say, you put us
through heck, young man!

1213
01:04:58,942 --> 01:05:01,736
But I think you learned
a valuable lesson.

1214
01:05:01,778 --> 01:05:04,364
There's no place like home.

1215
01:05:06,616 --> 01:05:08,326
Morton, load him in the car.

1216
01:05:08,368 --> 01:05:10,996
The Spirit's burning
so strong in my bosom...

1217
01:05:10,996 --> 01:05:13,957
I think I have to wee-wee.

1218
01:05:36,354 --> 01:05:39,316
How--ahem--
how was it out here?

1219
01:05:39,357 --> 01:05:41,359
Was it fun?

1220
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,374
You can see the moon today.

1221
01:05:57,626 --> 01:05:59,753
You know, it kind of
makes you wonder...

1222
01:05:59,794 --> 01:06:01,880
what would have happened
if Neil Armstrong...

1223
01:06:01,922 --> 01:06:04,841
had gone all the way
to the moon...

1224
01:06:04,883 --> 01:06:08,511
and then never
stepped on the surface.

1225
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,905
Jimmy!

1226
01:06:26,947 --> 01:06:28,782
Morton, where's Jimmy?!

1227
01:06:28,823 --> 01:06:30,116
What happened?

1228
01:06:34,162 --> 01:06:36,456
Jimmy! Jimmy!

1229
01:06:39,834 --> 01:06:42,420
Jimmy! Come to Mommy!

1230
01:06:42,504 --> 01:06:46,299
No, Mom! I'm sorry!

1231
01:06:46,341 --> 01:06:48,802
I gotta do this!

1232
01:06:48,843 --> 01:06:50,929
I'm not coming home!

1233
01:06:50,971 --> 01:06:52,806
Jimmy!

1234
01:06:52,847 --> 01:06:54,641
Todd!

1235
01:06:54,683 --> 01:06:55,642
Jimmy!

1236
01:06:55,684 --> 01:06:56,977
Todd, we love you!

1237
01:06:56,977 --> 01:06:59,354
We've come to set you free!

1238
01:06:59,396 --> 01:07:00,689
Who the hell are you?

1239
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:03,149
Back off, bitch!
He's the messiah!

1240
01:07:03,191 --> 01:07:04,526
We love you, Todd!

1241
01:07:04,568 --> 01:07:05,860
Jimmy, no!

1242
01:07:05,902 --> 01:07:08,446
Pedal to the metal, Flippy!

1243
01:07:08,488 --> 01:07:10,490
Look!

1244
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:19,291
I guess
this is growing up

1245
01:07:19,332 --> 01:07:21,960
-Hey!
-Whoa!

1246
01:07:32,262 --> 01:07:33,221
Oh!

1247
01:07:33,263 --> 01:07:35,974
Jimmy! Ha ha ha!

1248
01:07:36,016 --> 01:07:40,645
Vaya con dios, Bubble Boy.

1249
01:07:40,687 --> 01:07:43,148
Hang on, kid.

1250
01:07:43,189 --> 01:07:45,817
Pappy?

1251
01:07:45,859 --> 01:07:48,862
Aah! Shit!

1252
01:07:48,945 --> 01:07:50,071
Watch out!

1253
01:08:03,627 --> 01:08:05,295
Slim?

1254
01:08:06,963 --> 01:08:08,840
Wildfire?

1255
01:08:08,882 --> 01:08:17,599
Wildfire

1256
01:08:17,641 --> 01:08:19,601
What happened to you, Pappy?

1257
01:08:19,643 --> 01:08:21,436
I thought you were dead.

1258
01:08:21,478 --> 01:08:23,438
I ain't Pappy. I'm Pippy.

1259
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:27,776
Ain't talked to that sumbitch
brother of mine in 86 years.

1260
01:08:27,817 --> 01:08:30,403
-That's on account of--
-Poon!

1261
01:08:30,445 --> 01:08:32,614
-Poonani!
-Poonani?

1262
01:08:32,656 --> 01:08:34,449
Sister to Poon.

1263
01:08:34,449 --> 01:08:36,201
Pappy talked about Poon...

1264
01:08:36,243 --> 01:08:38,620
but he never mentioned
any Poonani, Pippy.

1265
01:08:52,133 --> 01:08:54,261
Oh! Ha ha!

1266
01:08:58,306 --> 01:09:00,267
Oh, my gosh!

1267
01:09:00,308 --> 01:09:03,687
I made it! I made it!

1268
01:09:03,728 --> 01:09:06,856
Ha ha ha!

1269
01:09:06,898 --> 01:09:09,359
Niagara Falls!

1270
01:09:13,572 --> 01:09:16,866
Niagara Falls!

1271
01:09:16,908 --> 01:09:20,203
Oh, there's the church!
There's the church!

1272
01:09:20,203 --> 01:09:23,915
Chloe! Ha ha ha!

1273
01:09:33,008 --> 01:09:37,220
Take me down, Pippy!
Take me down!

1274
01:09:40,807 --> 01:09:41,933
Oh, we're goin' down.

1275
01:09:43,351 --> 01:09:45,770
Very fast.

1276
01:09:45,812 --> 01:09:49,816
Pippy!

1277
01:09:51,192 --> 01:09:52,903
Aah!

1278
01:09:57,657 --> 01:10:01,620
Chloe!

1279
01:10:10,253 --> 01:10:11,713
You didn't break out
of that bubble room...

1280
01:10:11,755 --> 01:10:13,214
to play it safe.

1281
01:10:13,256 --> 01:10:14,883
Don't live in regret, ese.

1282
01:10:14,925 --> 01:10:17,218
No regrets. No regrets.

1283
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:20,555
No regrets. No regrets.

1284
01:10:20,597 --> 01:10:22,307
No regrets! No regrets!

1285
01:10:22,349 --> 01:10:25,977
No regrets!

1286
01:10:46,414 --> 01:10:50,460
I made it! Ha ha ha!

1287
01:10:50,502 --> 01:10:53,588
-Score, dude.
-Mmm. Mmm.

1288
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:56,591
I'm late! I'm late!

1289
01:10:57,884 --> 01:11:00,345
Do you, Mark, take Chloe...

1290
01:11:00,345 --> 01:11:02,180
to be
your lawfully wedded wife?

1291
01:11:02,222 --> 01:11:06,810
To honor and cherish,
in sickness and in health...

1292
01:11:06,851 --> 01:11:08,770
as long as
you both shall live?

1293
01:11:08,812 --> 01:11:11,523
Oh, yeah.

1294
01:11:11,565 --> 01:11:14,859
I'm almost there!
I'm almost...

1295
01:11:14,901 --> 01:11:16,194
And do you, Chloe...

1296
01:11:16,236 --> 01:11:19,573
take Mark to be
your lawfully wedded husband...

1297
01:11:19,614 --> 01:11:23,159
to honor and cherish,
in sickness and in health...

1298
01:11:23,243 --> 01:11:26,162
as long as
you both shall live?

1299
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:31,334
Come on, babe.

1300
01:11:32,586 --> 01:11:34,045
Easy question.

1301
01:11:34,087 --> 01:11:35,547
Chloe!

1302
01:11:35,589 --> 01:11:37,215
Don't!

1303
01:11:37,257 --> 01:11:39,426
Jimmy!

1304
01:11:39,467 --> 01:11:41,428
Hey, dude, what the hell
are you doing here?

1305
01:11:41,469 --> 01:11:43,305
I thought I told you
to head on home.

1306
01:11:43,346 --> 01:11:44,723
Just hold on a second, vato.

1307
01:11:44,723 --> 01:11:45,891
Vato?

1308
01:11:45,932 --> 01:11:47,601
Shut up!

1309
01:11:47,642 --> 01:11:49,477
Am I out of line here?

1310
01:11:49,519 --> 01:11:53,231
Chloe, l...

1311
01:11:53,273 --> 01:11:56,026
What?

1312
01:12:00,822 --> 01:12:03,241
What?

1313
01:12:05,577 --> 01:12:08,079
Jimmy, what are you doing?

1314
01:12:10,206 --> 01:12:12,500
Jimmy?

1315
01:12:12,542 --> 01:12:14,961
Jimmy?

1316
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:24,763
I'd rather spend
one minute holding you...

1317
01:12:24,804 --> 01:12:27,891
than the rest of my life
knowing I never could.

1318
01:12:30,143 --> 01:12:32,062
So if you don't mind...

1319
01:12:32,103 --> 01:12:34,481
may I kiss the bride?

1320
01:12:39,903 --> 01:12:41,529
Is it me?

1321
01:12:45,033 --> 01:12:47,619
I love you.

1322
01:12:47,661 --> 01:12:49,996
-I love you, Chloe.
-Jimmy?

1323
01:12:50,038 --> 01:12:51,539
Forever.

1324
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:56,169
OK?

1325
01:12:56,169 --> 01:12:58,171
Jimmy?! No!

1326
01:12:58,171 --> 01:12:59,839
Jimmy!

1327
01:12:59,881 --> 01:13:02,676
Jimmy?
I love you, Jimmy.

1328
01:13:02,717 --> 01:13:04,761
I've always loved you.

1329
01:13:04,803 --> 01:13:06,930
He's dead!

1330
01:13:06,972 --> 01:13:09,266
You killed him! Oh!

1331
01:13:09,307 --> 01:13:11,726
Ohh!

1332
01:13:11,768 --> 01:13:13,228
Oh, Jimmy!

1333
01:13:19,109 --> 01:13:22,487
My little sweet Jimmy.

1334
01:13:24,322 --> 01:13:25,323
Ohh.

1335
01:13:25,407 --> 01:13:27,534
Oh, my angel.

1336
01:13:27,576 --> 01:13:29,160
My precious little one.

1337
01:13:29,202 --> 01:13:34,374
My angel.

1338
01:13:34,416 --> 01:13:36,918
Tell him.

1339
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,879
What are you talking about?
Tell him what?

1340
01:13:39,879 --> 01:13:41,881
You're not dead, Jimmy.

1341
01:13:41,923 --> 01:13:44,259
-He's lying.
-Tell him.

1342
01:13:44,301 --> 01:13:46,761
Tell him everything.

1343
01:13:48,805 --> 01:13:50,056
Ohh...

1344
01:13:50,098 --> 01:13:51,975
you're not dead, Jimmy.

1345
01:13:52,017 --> 01:13:53,727
I'm not?

1346
01:13:55,562 --> 01:13:57,439
Ohh!

1347
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,649
You developed immunities
when you were four.

1348
01:13:59,691 --> 01:14:03,612
I couldn't let the world
ruin you with its filth!

1349
01:14:03,612 --> 01:14:05,822
There are so many
awful things out there.

1350
01:14:05,864 --> 01:14:07,490
There's so many horrible...

1351
01:14:24,841 --> 01:14:26,176
I love you, Mom.

1352
01:14:26,217 --> 01:14:27,385
Oh!

1353
01:14:27,427 --> 01:14:29,137
Ain't that sweet.

1354
01:14:52,702 --> 01:14:54,037
So...

1355
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:58,250
since I'm not dead...

1356
01:15:13,056 --> 01:15:14,683
Wouldn't it be nice

1357
01:15:14,724 --> 01:15:16,893
If we were older

1358
01:15:16,935 --> 01:15:20,855
Then we wouldn't
have to wait so long

1359
01:15:20,897 --> 01:15:24,442
And wouldn't it be nice
to live together

1360
01:15:24,484 --> 01:15:28,196
In the kind of world
where we belong

1361
01:15:28,196 --> 01:15:30,198
May Shiva bless your union.

1362
01:15:30,198 --> 01:15:32,033
Thanks for
the ice cream cake, Pushpop.

1363
01:15:32,075 --> 01:15:34,995
Well said, Master.

1364
01:15:36,538 --> 01:15:40,041
You don't have
to follow me this closely.

1365
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:42,085
Everyone!
The buffet is open!

1366
01:15:43,461 --> 01:15:46,631
Winner! Winner! Winner!

1367
01:15:46,673 --> 01:15:49,092

1368
01:15:49,092 --> 01:15:50,260

1370
01:15:51,595 --> 01:15:53,680

Ha ha ha ha!

1374
01:16:01,313 --> 01:16:03,398
It's a long story.
I'll tell you on the honeymoon.

1375
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:04,399
Thank you.

1376
01:16:04,441 --> 01:16:06,318
To family.

1377
01:16:06,359 --> 01:16:07,777
That's right.

1378
01:16:07,777 --> 01:16:08,778
And my 40.

1379
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:10,822
-Have fun, you two!
-You, too, Mom.

1380
01:16:10,864 --> 01:16:13,992
Don't worry. We will.

1381
01:16:14,034 --> 01:16:15,869
Hit it, Slim.

1382
01:16:15,911 --> 01:16:17,704
Hit it, Ace.

1383
01:16:23,543 --> 01:16:26,171
-To friendship.
-To friendship.

1384
01:16:26,212 --> 01:16:28,131
Now we're gonna party!

1385
01:16:28,131 --> 01:16:29,299
Jimmy!

1386
01:16:31,134 --> 01:16:33,053
Congratulations, kids.

1387
01:16:33,094 --> 01:16:34,346
Ready to take off?

1388
01:16:34,387 --> 01:16:35,347
Pippy?

1389
01:16:35,388 --> 01:16:37,015
You're right about family, kid.

1390
01:16:37,057 --> 01:16:39,476
Pappy?

1391
01:16:39,517 --> 01:16:41,645

Wouldn't it be nice

1394

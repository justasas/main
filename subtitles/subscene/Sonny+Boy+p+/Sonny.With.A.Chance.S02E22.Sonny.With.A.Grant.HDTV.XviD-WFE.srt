1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,050
Sunscreen for my cruise to cancun!

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,380
Whoopee cushion for my week at camp comedy.

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,720
Bikini.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,160
Slide whistle.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,120
Funny nose
and glasses... hmm?

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,600
- Flip-flops.
- These aren't mine, no.

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,270
Aw, look at you randoms going
away for your week off,

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,340
Which in a way is like
giving me a week off too.

9
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,510
- You I'll miss.
- Aw, I'll miss you too.

10
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,840
Oh, I haven't even left for my cruise yet.

11
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,050
And I already feel seasick.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,480
Oh hey, speaking of things
that make you sick,

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,850
I don't know if you heard, but
my life as I know it is over.

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:49,020
What? Oh, chad, I'm only going to
be gone to camp comedy for a week.

15
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,960
Oh, not 'cause of you, milady.

16
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,260
Condor studios are so cheap.

17
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,490
They give me nothing.
Zac efron's studio?

18
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,660
Bought him a car.
Then they bought him a house.

19
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,170
To put that car in.
Then they put that house on an island.

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,770
And named it after him.
Look! It's called zac island.

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,370
Oh, okay, you know what, chad?

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,510
Look, you've got everything that you need.

23
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,170
You've got a great parking spot.

24
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,080
You have room rvice in your dressing room.

25
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,780
What else do you want?
Someone to cut your meat for you?

26
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:16,110
Oh my gosh, you get that too?!

27
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,350
- Well, it's just for the filet.
- You get filet?

28
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,420
- Efron gets kobe.
- Kobe beef?

29
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,260
No, bryant. He comes in and
cuts his steak for him.

30
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,460
You know what?
I'm going to mr. Condor.

31
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,290
And I'm giving him a list of my demands.

32
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,700
You just need to be grateful
for what you have.

33
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,100
Think about it... you have
a wonderful girlfriend.

34
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,270
Who lets you carry her luggage...

35
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,270
And puts up with your baggage.

36
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,040
You're right.
Come on, I'll drive you to the airport.

37
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,040
You know, efron has
a full-time chauffeur so...

38
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,480
- Oh well, maybe I should date efron then.
- Do not even joke about that!

00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,870
finally.

57
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:46,000
Everyone's away so grady gets to play!

58
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,810
Well, what should I do first?

59
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,010
Ah, first thing is
to stop talking to myself.

60
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:56,680
And the second thing is...
oh look.

61
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,050
I just broke the first thing.

62
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,160
You know what?
No rules, just video games.

63
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,830
Game on.

64
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,900
Stupid hurricane.

65
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,640
Game off.

66
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:24,040
Can you believe they canceled a
cruise because of a 14omph wind?

67
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,850
You know what I did?
I went right up to that captain,

68
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,750
I looked him in the eye and I said, "man up!
" next thing I know,

69
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,450
That man was up and blowing
across the deck.

70
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,590
Let me guess, you're going
to spend your vacation.

71
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,430
At home like nico and zora.

72
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,960
Wrong!
My house is getting bedazzled.

73
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,300
So I will be spending
my vacation right here.

74
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,700
Whoo!

75
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,870
Hey, I'm gonna go get some
spray tan and guacamole.

76
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:03,420
Hey, frankenstein just called.
He wants his bride back.

77
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,920
Oh and, grady, your really
annoying loud brother is here.

78
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,720
Hey hey, gravy!

79
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,960
What up, pup?

80
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:19,700
Hey, grant.
What are you doing here?

81
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,430
Oh, I just finished my first
semester of college, brah.

82
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,340
I don't want to brag,
but I got straight "c"s!

83
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,140
In two of my classes.

84
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,310
So where are you planning on staying?

85
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,310
Oh, with my fraternity brothers, bro,

86
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,550
- At the local delta nu house.
- All right!

87
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:39,820

All right.

94
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,810
So let me guess...
you're gonna hit three.

95
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,810
Me, the beach and dad up for money.

96
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,750
I'm here to work, grots.
Get me a summer job.

97
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,580
Wow, look at you being
mr. Responsible.

98
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,250
So what are you gonna do?
Get a job washing cars.

99
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,190
Or bagging groceries?

100
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,160
I'm gonna do what you do...
work in showbiz;

101
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:25,300
Be a director;
Star in a movie;

102
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,830
Find some old rich lady to take
care of me for a couple of months.

103
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,300
Hey, you leave grandma alone!

104
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,540
Oh, you didn't hear?

105
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,040
What what what?!

106
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,540
Psych!
You're so gullible, bro.

107
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,050
You can't just waltz
into hollywood and be a star.

108
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,350
And then scare me about grandma.

109
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,050
I'm sorry I freaked
you out about grandbones.

110
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,520
But I'm still very serious
about getting a job.

111
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,530
It's not as easy as you think, grant.
You have to start at the bottom.

112
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,430
Oh, you mean
like "so random!"

113
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,960
Booyah! See,
I can do comedy.

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,600
Oh yeah, the bottom,
"so random!" yeah.

115
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,670
- But there's nothing funny about
grandbones being dead. - What?

116
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,610
See, I can do drama too.
I'm totally kidding.

117
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,340
- She's fine, she's just fine.
- All right, okay.

118
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,410
Delta nu, bam!

119
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,960
Oh hey, mind if I join you?

120
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,730
I don't know what you're saying.
Why don't you join me?

121
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:35,130
Oh, are you eating for two
since nico's not here?

122
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,470
Oh oh, it's not for me.

123
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,070
It's a little welcome present
for my brother grant.

124
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,680
Whoop, oh no.

125
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,750
Yeah, I got him his first hollywood
job as a cafeteria busboy.

126
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,250
Oh, I even got him this apron.

127
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:57,590
He thinks working on
"so random!" is the bottom.

128
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,720
I'll show him the bottom, baby.

129
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,270
Nice. Nice.

130
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,570
Nice try.

131
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:15,870
Ooh, a coconut drink with an umbrella...

132
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,210
Tropical.

133
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,250
Hey, you know what would make this better?

134
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,580
Bigger!

135
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,750
Scooter, tubbs, go find me a coconut.

136
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,980
Big enough to fit that umbrella.

137
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,390
Oh yeah, huh!

138
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,120
Oh, so what was that job
you called me about?

139
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,760
Well, you're looking at it.

140
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,900
Congratulations, you are
now a hollywood busboy.

141
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,030
Whoa. <i> Whoa.</i>

142
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,630
I didn't attend one third of my
classes in college to be a busboy.

143
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,570
Oh, by the way, is that a sarong?

144
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,910
Because on you it looks so right!

145
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,440
Only a jerk like you would say out loud.

146
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,610
What everyone else
in this room is thinking.

147
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,950
You know what else they're thinking?

148
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,750
This guy shouldn't be cleaning up
tables, he should be dancing on them!

149
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,090
♪ nu nu ♪

150
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,690

Wow, that is one arrogant guy.

153
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,530
Yeah, that attitude's
gonna get him nowhere.

154
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,470
Oh, f.Y.I., mr. Condor,

155
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,770
Here's my list of demands.
It accordions out.

You... reaccordion this.

157
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,080
And clean up that table!
We don't want the dancer to slip.

158
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,450
Everything always goes grant's way.

159
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,860

Am I?

164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,770
Okay, great first day at camp, kids.

165
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,610
Now remember, pies are for
eating, not throwing.

166
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,950
I know what cabin you sleep in, brian!

167
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,050
Hello?

168
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,890
- Hello?
- <i>Hello?</i>

169
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Sonny? Sonny, I can't hear you.
Hold on.

170
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,160
I'm gonna try and move around,
find a good spot.

171
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:17,400
Chad? Hey,
I can't hear you either.

172
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,160
The reception's horrible.

173
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,830
Thank you, you're adorable too.

174
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,400
I gave my list
to mr. Condor.

175
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,770
No no, I didn't see a condor,

176
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:28,510
But I think I saw an eagle.

177
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,010
No!
No no no no.

178
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,780
Everything I'm asking for is legal.

179
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:36,250
Okay, I'm not sure what you're asking,

180
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,150
But my advice is don't be greedy.

181
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,020
That is great advice.
I will be greedy!

182
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,350
No no, why would you beat grady?

183
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:45,460
Wait.

184
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,830
Oh, brian, put down that pie.

185
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,960
I gotta go.

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,400
What?
Hello?

187
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,100
This is a nightmare.

188
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,670
Chad, I've looked over your entire list.

189
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,510
And the answer is yes to all of it.

190
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,510
- Really? The indoor spa?
- Yes.

191
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,610
- The bumper cars?
- Yes.

192
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,510
My weight in chocolate?

193
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,980
Agreed.

194
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,950
I believe that covers the entire list.

195
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,650
Should we put
this baby to bed? Deal?

196
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,750
Not quite.

197
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,690
A wise woman once told me
I should be greedy,

198
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,760
- So I want a pony.
- A pony?!

199
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,260
Yes, a pony... the one thing zac
efron did not get from his list.

200
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,800
So I want a pony.

201
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:29,700
And I want his name to be frank.

202
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,370
You're pushing it, cooper.

203
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,140
And I want a puppy to ride
on the pony's back,

204
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,170
'cause it is really cute when they do that.

205
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,510
Now do we have a deal?

206
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,780
Here's what we have.

207
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,150
- You can take frank...
- Oh, I got a pony!

208
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,580
- ...And the puppy on his back...
- Aww.

209
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,290
...And ride them off together
to the land of you-are-fired.

210
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,820
Because, as the name of the
land indicates, you are fired!

211
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,930
Where is this coming from?

212
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,670
Hello? No, chad, I still
can't hear anything.

213
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,610
How did everything go
with mr. Condor?

214
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,250
Oh, I got fired from "mackenzie
falls" and I lost everything.

215
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,550
Oh, you got everything?
Good for you!

216
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,380
- Oh, hello?
- <i>Hello?</i>

217
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,520

- Hello.

218
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,520
<i>We're sorry.</i>

No, you know what?

You cannot take my dressing room!

Hey, brah, I didn't need to

Man, I remember when I was bussing tables.

276
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,540
I bussed the table!

277
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,680
Eh, you know, the bottom line is.

278
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,340

Ooh yes.

286
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,450
Ma! I said I'd make

Hi, chad.
Can I come in?

288
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,080
- Oh hey, buddy.
- Buddy?

289
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,090
Wow, he's worse off than I thought.

290
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,390
Oh man!

291
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,190
I've dreamt of a room like this.

292
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:22,160
No way, a racecar bed!

293
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,670
How could you have ever
wanted to move out of here?

294
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,540
Ah, don't worry.
We are not making that mistake again.

295

Without you there'd
be no "falls."

303
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,100
It'd just be water falling off
a rock. You gave it purpose.

304
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,530
You gave it a name!
What happened to that chad dylan cooper, huh?

00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:06,130
You're letting in chicks?

344
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,900
Orange ones?

345
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,800
Yep, and we have a new delta nu president.

346
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,870
That'd be me.

347
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,700
Scooter, tubbs, what did they do to you?

348
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,980
You've been busy as mackenzie.
I had some free time,

349
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,510
And scott and melvin tubberson here,

350
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:27,750
Needed a new leader.
So I took over and made a few changes.

351
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,760
♪ delta nu, delta nu ♪

352
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,890
♪ study hard, obey curfew ♪

353
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:41,160
♪ return library books when they are due ♪

354
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,700
- ♪ or renew ♪
- ♪ At delta nu. ♪.

355
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:49,200
It burns! Oh.

356
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,770
Grant, what's going on?
You're late.

357
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,940
Everyone is waiting
for you down on the set.

358
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,410
They're gonna have to
keep on waiting, condude,

359
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,250
Because I quit!

360
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:01,110
I can't let delta nu take
a back seat to my summer job.

361
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,080
Summer job?
You're gonna give up.

362
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,620
A hollywood career to go
back to some fraternity?

363
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,120
You obviously don't know the deep respect.

364
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,790
Fraternity brothers have for one another.

365
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,930
Scooter, tubbs, grab my giant
coconut and let's bounce.

366
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,770
What?
I...

367
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,600
What am I gonna do now?
I need a mackenzie.

368
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,770
You know, you've got one right there.

369
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,980
The orange chick?

370
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,710
No, the pasty dude.

371
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,120
I don't know,

372
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,250
The old mackenzie was pretty
greedy... a pony and a puppy.

373
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:43,260
Well, sir, the new mackenzie
has been humbled.

374
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,130
I'll settle for either a puppy or a pony.

375
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,430
- You'll get neither!
- I'll take it.

376
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,900
Grady, I couldn't have gotten
my job back without you.

377
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,570
You know, I learned a valuable lesson.

378
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,640
About being happy with what you have,

379
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,440
And about how whether
you're chad dylan cooper.

380
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,480
Or zac efron.

381
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:06,510
Studios just don't want
to give you live animals.

382
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,480
No problem, buddy.

383
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,820
Yeah, about the whole buddy thing...

384
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,560
Oh oh, yeah, I get it.

385
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,090
Everything's back to normal now, huh?

386
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,960
So this is where you call security.

387
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,100
And kick me out of your
dressing room, right?

388
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,570
You know what?
As my way of saying thank you,

389
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,740
Why don't you kick yourself out?

390
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,670
- Oh, you mean it?
- You've earned it.

391
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,310
Okay, uh...

392
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,580
Security! Oh no, I just can't.
My friend.

393
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:42,320
He's my buddy.
Oh no, oh oh oh!

394
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:49,560
Game on.

395
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,860
- What up, pup?
- Game off.

396
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,070
I'm outie.
Just wanted to say bye-onara.

397
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,230
Hey, grant, before you leave

398
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,400
I have to confess something.

399
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,570
What? That chad didn't
really take over delta nu.

400
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,840
And it was a big scam
so he could get his job back?

401
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,180
Oh, not the face!
Not the face!

402
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,250
Relax, I'm not mad.

403
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,910
All right.

404
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,620
You know, I figured if me being here.

405
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,020
Drove you to team up
with a dude you can't stand,

406
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,490
I must have really been
cramping your styles.

407
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,420
I mean, this whole hollywood
thing is your thing, not mine.

408
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,960
You know? And I should have
never crashed your party.

409
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:31,100
- Thanks, bro. - 'Cause there's a million
other parties in this town to crash!

410
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,330
Whoo!

411
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,840
Well, are you coming?

412
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,170
Oh yeah. Yeah!

413
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:43,010
Oh hey, willy wonka called.

414
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,980
He needs you back at the chocolate factory.

415
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:50,050
Oh, are you leaving already?

416
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,350
Ni-iiiiiice!

417
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,390
Nice.

418
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,650
Have you always wanted to be the class clown?
Well, now you can,

419
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,920
Thanks to camp comedy.

420
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Where you'll learn classic comedy
skills like the double take...

421
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,000
The spit take...

422
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:23,370
The double spit take.

423
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,670
You'll also learn advanced
physical comedy bits.

424
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,610
Like the banana-peel slip...

425
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,140
Whoops.

426
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,480
...And the fine art
of stepping on a rake.

427
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,880
We'll also teach you how to be
funny without using words at all.

428
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,450
Woo-woo-woo.
Ah-oooo!

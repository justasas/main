1
00:00:01,451 --> 00:00:03,093
Mom, you home?

2
00:00:03,094 --> 00:00:04,810
A little help here!

3
00:00:04,811 --> 00:00:07,281
Sonny, someone
at the door needs help.

4
00:00:07,282 --> 00:00:08,983
Yeah, me.

5
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:10,485
Well, tell her
I said hi--

6
00:00:10,486 --> 00:00:12,690
Look out, mackenzie!
He's in the pool!

7
00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:16,165
Mom, you're
watching "mackenzie falls"?

8
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,434
- How could you?
- How can't I?

9
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:21,072
There's just so much drama.

10
00:00:21,073 --> 00:00:23,543
But it's "mackenzie falls."
it's a betrayal.

11
00:00:23,544 --> 00:00:26,314
And as long as I live under
your roof, I forbid this.

12
00:00:26,315 --> 00:00:30,553
- You really should give it a chance.
- Oh, I've seen it before.

13
00:00:32,123 --> 00:00:35,260
The falls have been in my
family for generations, Chloe.

14
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:37,663
- He said "falls"!
- Falls!

15
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:40,802
Lemme-- no--

16
00:00:40,803 --> 00:00:43,771
Give... Me...
That... Remote!

17
00:00:43,772 --> 00:00:45,074
Yes! Yes!

18
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:46,809
- Don't do it!
- No! No!

19
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,513
<i>Maybe it's you,
maybe it's me.</i>

20
00:00:51,617 --> 00:00:54,187
<i>Maybe it's the horse.</i>

21
00:00:54,188 --> 00:00:57,358
<i>Maybe it's...
The falls.</i>

22
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,994
Falls!

23
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:01,763
Seriously?

24
00:01:01,764 --> 00:01:03,031
Sorry.

25
00:01:03,032 --> 00:01:05,868
Bad habit.
I'm really sorry.

26
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:07,803
You know, I think you need

27
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:10,072
To give this show a chance.

28
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:13,543
- At first I really didn't care
much for your show-- - Shh!

29
00:01:13,544 --> 00:01:16,579
Oh, mack, how much longer

30
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:19,349
Can we keep denying our
feelings for each other?

31
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,286
Until I can be sure that one
of us isn't going to get hurt.

32
00:01:23,722 --> 00:01:25,622
Oh, mackenzie.

33
00:01:25,623 --> 00:01:28,025
Isn't it great?

34
00:01:28,026 --> 00:01:29,927
Sweetie, you don't
have homework, do you?

35
00:01:29,928 --> 00:01:31,328
I do.

36
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,364
Three seasons worth.

37
00:01:33,365 --> 00:01:36,600
There's just so much drama.

00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:31,990
And there's the sea
of tranquility.

52
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:34,459
And there's the second coat.

53
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,395
And... Done!

54
00:02:37,396 --> 00:02:41,399
Hey, fellas, how's your solar
system project coming?

55
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,503
- Right on schedule.
- Haven't done a thing.

56
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:46,204
So it's your usual plan?

57
00:02:46,205 --> 00:02:47,873
Wait for Sonny
to finish her project,

58
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:49,708
She sees how little
you've done on yours,

59
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:52,443
You "freak out,"
and she feels sorry for you.

60
00:02:52,444 --> 00:02:55,046
And then she does it for us.

61
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:57,548
We put a lot of effort
into this plan.

62
00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:00,017
- Mm-hmm.
- Wanna go bowling?

63
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:02,953
Ooh, I'll grab neptune
and kick your butt.

64
00:03:02,954 --> 00:03:04,188
Oh.

65
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:06,556
Uranus is mine!

66
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:13,063
They should be
ashamed of themselves.

67
00:03:13,064 --> 00:03:16,066
For relying on Sonny
to do all their work?

68
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:17,801
No, just in general.

69
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:22,506
Morning.

70
00:03:22,507 --> 00:03:23,774
Wow!

71
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:25,609
If how bad you look
is any indication

72
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,112
Of how hard you've been
working on our project,

73
00:03:28,113 --> 00:03:33,117
Well, may I say "hello a+"?

74
00:03:33,118 --> 00:03:35,619
Because you look horrible.

75
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,422
Well, I didn't
get much done last night.

76
00:03:38,423 --> 00:03:40,356
There was a lot
of drama at my house.

77
00:03:40,357 --> 00:03:42,525
<i>You know how this town is.</i>

78
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:45,528
If people see us on the same
horse together, Chloe,

79
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:47,197
They will talk.

80
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:49,399
But I'm tired of riding alone.

81
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,835
Get on that horse, mackenzie!

82
00:03:55,172 --> 00:03:57,473
I don't know what went on
at your house last night,

83
00:03:57,474 --> 00:04:01,778
But I am very disappointed in you.
I did my part. See?

84
00:04:03,047 --> 00:04:05,714
What does a manicure have
to do with the universe?

85
00:04:05,715 --> 00:04:08,916
Because my nails
are out of this world.

86
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,958
Man, I had no idea you
were such a good bowler.

87
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,893
I am a man of many layers.

88
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:24,962
Peel one back, I am a bowler.

89
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:27,798
Peel back another,
I'm a krumper.

90
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:38,139
That might be a layer
you wanna keep covered.

91
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,107
- Let's get something to eat.
- Yeah.

92
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:44,376
Oh, hey, there's Sonny.
I wonder how she's doing on her project?

93
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:47,746
You know, she can't start on
ours until she finishes her own.

94
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:50,215
Wait wait wait.
Relax, g.

95
00:04:50,216 --> 00:04:52,450
Your worry layer is showing.

96
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:54,651
She's probably over
there, studying away.

97
00:04:54,652 --> 00:04:57,319
It's weird, Chloe.

98
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,355
I've never experienced
this feeling before.

99
00:05:00,356 --> 00:05:02,623
It's called love!

100
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:04,458
Worried now?

101
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:07,728
This could be worse
than your krumping.

102
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:11,331
Hey, Sonny.

103
00:05:11,332 --> 00:05:13,599
Oh, hey guys, what's up?

104
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,701
Oh, sorry.

105
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:18,703
Hey, so how's your
solar system coming?

106
00:05:18,704 --> 00:05:21,505
Oh, good good.
And yours?

107
00:05:21,506 --> 00:05:23,407
- Good.
- Good.

108
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:26,409
- Great.
- Okay, that was a little weird

109
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,544
What you yelled out
a minute ago.

110
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:32,347
- What?
- Something about "love."

111
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:34,315
Oh!
Oh, yeah!

112
00:05:34,316 --> 00:05:35,516
<i>- No no no no no.
- Yeah.</i>

113
00:05:35,517 --> 00:05:37,552
That was just me, you know,

114
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:40,388
Practicing to be a...

115
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:42,824
Tennis judge.

116
00:05:42,825 --> 00:05:46,528
- 40-love!
- A tennis judge?

117
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:49,764
Yeah, you know, it's always
been a dream of mine.

118
00:05:49,765 --> 00:05:52,434
Fault!
Match point!

119
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,802
Ball boy!

120
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,305
See how annoying that is?
You know what?

121
00:05:57,306 --> 00:05:59,239
I'm just gonna
go practice somewhere

122
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,707
Where I won't bother anyone.

123
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,608
- I'll see you guys later?
- Yup.

124
00:06:02,609 --> 00:06:04,977
- Deuce!
- Whoa!

125
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,546
A tennis judge?

126
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:09,714
I wonder what else
she's keeping from us.

127
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:13,250
Maybe...
She's a krumper.

128
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:18,019
You have hurt me
for the last time.

129
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,654
It's over!

130
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:22,956
Oh no, what have I done?

131
00:06:22,957 --> 00:06:25,256
That was the best
relationship I ever had.

132
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:31,693
<i>Hi, it's Sonny.
Leave a message.</i>

133
00:06:31,694 --> 00:06:35,128
It's me again...
Partner.

134
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:39,332
Listen, that last message
was just my fear talking.

135
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,401
And I don't know
why my fear is talking

136
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,302
When your guilt should be,

137
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,905
Because you should be working on our project!
We're through!

138
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:51,608
Oh no, what have I done?

139
00:06:51,609 --> 00:06:55,111
- Hey, have you seen Sonny?
- No, and I'm very worried.

140
00:06:55,112 --> 00:06:58,514
<i>- Me too. - You realize if she
doesn't do her project--</i>

141
00:06:58,515 --> 00:07:00,783
Then this was all for nothing!

142
00:07:00,784 --> 00:07:02,351
I bought rings to match saturn.

143
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:04,853
Don't you guys see
what's happening here?

144
00:07:04,854 --> 00:07:07,221
We've become just like
the solar system itself--

145
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:09,990
A perfectly balanced,
inter-connected group of bodies

146
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:12,158
Bound by gravity to the sun.

147
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:14,727
Or in this case, the Sonny.

148
00:07:14,728 --> 00:07:17,396
See, I kind of felt
my metaphor was clear

149
00:07:17,397 --> 00:07:19,631
Without having
to hit it on the nose.

150
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:22,833
- I don't think so.
- Well, I know so!

151
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:26,136
Stop it. Stop it!
This is horrible.

152
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:28,804
If Sonny becomes the
center of my universe,

153
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:31,005
Where does that leave me?

154
00:07:31,006 --> 00:07:33,174
You?
What about us?

155
00:07:33,175 --> 00:07:36,043
The fate of our scale-model
universe hangs in the balance.

156
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:39,279
People, this is bigger
than the solar system,

157
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,681
Or 10% of your grade.

158
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:43,482
What are you talking about?

159
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:45,651
- Well--
- Oh!

160
00:07:45,652 --> 00:07:47,986
Sometimes a girl sees things,

161
00:07:47,987 --> 00:07:50,989
Things she wishes she hadn't while
she's slithering around in the vents

162
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,624
And hiding in places
she probably shouldn't.

163
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:57,526
- What kinds of things?
- Horrible things.

164
00:07:57,527 --> 00:08:00,528
The kind of things that can get you
an "f" on your science project.

165
00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:02,730
Oh, I'm talking about betrayal,

166
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:05,933
The kind of betrayal that has
to be seen to be believed.

167
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:07,969
Can't we just hear about it?

168
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,738
Are you really this lazy?

169
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,906
Yes.

170
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,340
It's one of my layers.

171
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:14,742
You gotta see it!

172
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,945
<i>Normally I control
my own destiny, Chloe,</i>

173
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:21,447
<i>But I'm just so confused.</i>

174
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:23,815
Oh, mackenzie!

175
00:08:27,186 --> 00:08:29,454
Sonny's a secret
"falls" watcher?

176
00:08:29,455 --> 00:08:32,690
If my nails weren't so perfect,
I'd scratch her eyes out.

177
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:36,659
We can break
her of her despicable obsession

178
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,030
With that cheesy melodrama
and help our friend...

179
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:42,132
- Or?
- Or we can shame her.

180
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:45,068
I see no reason
we can't do both.

181
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:48,771
<i>If I don't ask Chloe out
after they unveil my statue,</i>

182
00:08:48,772 --> 00:08:51,473
I may never get the chance

183
00:08:51,474 --> 00:08:52,908
Or the courage again.

184
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:55,377
How much longer can you
expect a girl to wait?

185
00:08:55,378 --> 00:08:56,811
Just ask her out, mackenzie.

186
00:08:56,812 --> 00:08:58,880
Ask. Ask!

187
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:02,350
Ooh! Hey, guys.
How's it going? What's up?

188
00:09:02,351 --> 00:09:05,285
- The jig, sister!
- We know your dirty little secret.

189
00:09:05,286 --> 00:09:08,087
- You've been cheating on us.
- With the "falls"!

190
00:09:08,088 --> 00:09:10,823
That is ridiculous, okay?

191
00:09:10,824 --> 00:09:14,193
You know I hate the "falls"
just as much as you do.

192
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:15,995
Oh, do you?

193
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:17,596
Then I guess you won't mind

194
00:09:17,597 --> 00:09:19,798
If we just take a look
at your phone?

195
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,867
- Yeah, get it!
- No no!

196
00:09:21,868 --> 00:09:24,069
Hey!

197
00:09:25,505 --> 00:09:29,240
The first step is admitting
you have a problem.

198
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:33,810
You're right.
I do have a problem.

199
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:35,911
Thank you.
Thank you all.

200
00:09:35,912 --> 00:09:38,246
Now, if you'll excuse me,

201
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:41,215
I'm going to go talk to a
professional immediately.

202
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:45,417
I need to talk
to you immediately.

203
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,085
I'm glad you're here.
I need a favor.

204
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,953
I don't have time to help you
with your science project.

205
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:53,456
Please, I have actual
scientists for that.

206
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:55,057
I need a tennis judge.

207
00:09:55,058 --> 00:09:57,960
- Word on the street is you can help.
- What?

208
00:09:57,961 --> 00:10:00,996
- I'm not a tennis judge.
- So you just made up that up?

209
00:10:00,997 --> 00:10:03,732
- Yes, but listen-- - Who
makes up something like that?

210
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,633
Who needs a freelance
tennis judge?

211
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:08,369
Actually, I'm hosting my
annual charity tournament

212
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,772
- And I don't want to lose again.
- Oh, I see.

213
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:13,976
Well, as much as I'd
love to help you cheat

214
00:10:13,977 --> 00:10:16,479
For a good cause,
I can't. Why?

215
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,081
Oh, yeah.
Because I'm not a tennis judge.

216
00:10:19,082 --> 00:10:22,551
- Uh-huh. So what did you want?
- Some answers.

217
00:10:22,552 --> 00:10:24,788
- To what?
- To how it all ends.

218
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:27,057
To how long it's going to be
before you ask the girl

219
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:29,827
- You're destined to be with.
- I'm not sure I can answer that.

220
00:10:29,828 --> 00:10:32,595
Aren't you in charge
of your own destiny?

221
00:10:32,596 --> 00:10:34,128
I guess.

222
00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:36,396
Well then it's time
to say, "enough!"

223
00:10:36,397 --> 00:10:40,800
I mean, when two people are this right for
each other, there's only one thing to do.

224
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:42,768
How long have you
felt this way?

225
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:44,970
Just since yesterday.
It hasn't been long,

226
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:47,038
But it hit me
like a ton of bricks.

227
00:10:48,441 --> 00:10:50,575
I mean, I guess
I feel the same way.

228
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:52,610
Well, then do something
about it.

229
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,011
- Okay, I will.
- Great!

230
00:10:54,012 --> 00:10:56,980
Sonny, will you go out with me?

231
00:11:02,503 --> 00:11:04,437
I'm sorry,
did you just ask me out?

232
00:11:04,438 --> 00:11:06,506
I'm sorry, didn't you
just beg me to?

233
00:11:06,507 --> 00:11:10,309
Wait, did you think
I was talking about--

234
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,110
Oh, dear, this is awkward.

235
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,281
It sure is.
It sure is awkward.

236
00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:19,817
I mean, I know
why it's awkward,

237
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:21,919
I just want to know
if you know...

238
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,286
Why it's awkward.

239
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:25,355
I was talking about
mackenzie and Chloe,

240
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:26,990
But you seemed
to be talking--

241
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:29,024
Yup yup, me too.
Same page.

242
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:31,159
- Whew!
- Whoo-hoo.

243
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,528
See, I just thought
you thought I thought

244
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:36,997
It was awkward because you
thought I was asking you out.

245
00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:40,066
Rather than mackenzie
asking Chloe out.

246
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,100
Which I was.

247
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,435
Yeah, but you
said Sonny--

248
00:11:42,436 --> 00:11:44,604
Yup yup, that's awkward.

249
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,075
- So.
- So.

250
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:54,049
- You're a "mackenzie falls" fan now?
- Yeah.

251
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,219
Cool. Cool.

252
00:11:58,255 --> 00:12:01,123
So I suppose I should probably tell
you I'm a "so random!" fan now.

253
00:12:01,124 --> 00:12:04,459
- Really?
- Yeah, but I'd be lying.

254
00:12:05,695 --> 00:12:08,163
You know, it's funny.

255
00:12:08,164 --> 00:12:10,598
Like I learned
with "mackenzie falls,"

256
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,599
Sometimes if you
look at something

257
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,969
With an open mind,
you can surprise yourself.

258
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,005
So... Yeah.

259
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,608
What?

260
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:23,144
Yeah, I'll go out with you.

261
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:25,747
- Good.
- Good.

262
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:28,116
- So we're doing this.
- I guess so.

263
00:12:28,117 --> 00:12:31,353
Wait. So I still don't know.
Does mackenzie ever ask--

264
00:12:31,354 --> 00:12:33,788
Bah bah bah bah.
If we're gonna make this thing work,

265
00:12:33,789 --> 00:12:36,787
I'm going to have to insist you
never ask me about my business.

266
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:38,785
Ugh, fine. I guess
I'm gonna have to

267
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:41,982
Check the blogs
like everybody else.

268
00:12:48,353 --> 00:12:51,754
Solar system's done.
Pretty good huh?

269
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:54,323
Uh-huh.

270
00:12:54,324 --> 00:12:56,059
Uh-huh.

271
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,330
It's a little busy.
It's a little loud.

272
00:12:59,331 --> 00:13:02,366
I'll have to re-think my scarf,
but I can make it work.

273
00:13:03,468 --> 00:13:06,836
Sonny, have you noticed
how little progress

274
00:13:06,837 --> 00:13:08,905
Nico and I have made
on our project?

275
00:13:08,906 --> 00:13:12,207
My parents are going to
be so disappointed in me.

276
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,844
Well, I think my glue gun is still
warmed up, so let me help you.

277
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:19,313
See? All the planets
have re-aligned

278
00:13:19,314 --> 00:13:21,748
- Around the Sonny again.
- Mm-hmm.

279
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:24,286
By the way, you guys, I just
really want to say thank you

280
00:13:24,287 --> 00:13:27,522
For helping me kick that
"mackenzie falls" habit.

281
00:13:27,523 --> 00:13:29,490
I am so glad that's behind us.

282
00:13:29,491 --> 00:13:32,758
Behind us? Ha.
I'm not over the betrayal.

283
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:35,226
- We are, we are.
- We're cool with the betrayal.

284
00:13:35,227 --> 00:13:38,062
We don't mind a little
betrayal every now and again.

285
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:40,931
No, you know what?
You're right.

286
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:42,665
It was betrayal.

287
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:46,035
I kept something from you, something
that I knew would upset you.

288
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:49,304
Which is why, in the spirit
of full disclosure--

289
00:13:49,305 --> 00:13:52,073
I mean, the only thing
you could possibly do

290
00:13:52,074 --> 00:13:53,707
That would be a bigger betrayal

291
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,242
Would be if you were
dating Chad or something.

292
00:13:56,243 --> 00:13:57,443
Dating Chad?

293
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:08,353
- Whoo-hoo!
- Don't even like his highlights.

294
00:14:08,354 --> 00:14:10,955
That's too funny, guys.

295
00:14:10,956 --> 00:14:13,857
So what did you want
to disclosure to us?

296
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,761
Oh... That.

297
00:14:18,762 --> 00:14:22,198
That, um...

298
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:26,101
I just need to disclose
that I'm torn...

299
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:29,003
As to...

300
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:32,874
Whether or not I should
include pluto as a planet.

301
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:35,776
Uh, pluto's not a planet.

302
00:14:35,777 --> 00:14:37,211
Says you.

303
00:14:37,212 --> 00:14:39,346
Says NASA.

304
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:40,747
You know what?

305
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:43,182
I'm not just gonna
take NASA's word for it.

306
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,150
I'm going to go talk
to a professional.

307
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,786
Immediately.
Again.

308
00:14:49,354 --> 00:14:52,323
I just need to run my lines once
before we shoot this thing.

309
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:54,558
Let's take it from where I say,

310
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,226
"I need to talk
to you right away."

311
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:57,994
I need to talk
to you right away.

312
00:14:57,995 --> 00:15:01,096
That is my line!
Do I need to fire some-- oh, hey Sonny.

313
00:15:01,097 --> 00:15:03,932
Hey, um, can I talk
to you for a sec?

314
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:06,267
Sorry to interrupt.

315
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:09,503
- Huge fan since yesterday.
- That's a five, everybody.

316
00:15:09,504 --> 00:15:12,639
- Apparently I need to talk to my lady.
- Joking!

317
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,008
He's just kidding.
I'm not his lady.

318
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:16,509
Okay, look,

319
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,744
I gotta talk to you
about something.

320
00:15:18,745 --> 00:15:20,179
Is this about our date?

321
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,581
Yes, I just...

322
00:15:22,582 --> 00:15:24,116
I think we need to call it off.

323
00:15:24,117 --> 00:15:25,884
Is this about
me not telling you

324
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:28,052
How things play out
between mack and Chloe?

325
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,588
No no no.
I seriously don't care about them

326
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:31,789
Or the "falls" right now.

327
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,790
I just... I think
I rushed into something

328
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:39,060
- That I didn't fully think through.
- That hurts me, Sonny.

329
00:15:40,996 --> 00:15:43,263
I'm sorry.

330
00:15:44,632 --> 00:15:47,333
How could you say you don't
care about the "falls"?

331
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,868
Whoa whoa, wait!
What are you more upset about,

332
00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:53,069
The fact that I'm
calling off our date

333
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:57,105
- Or that I'm over the "falls"?
- That's a toughie.

334
00:15:57,106 --> 00:16:00,308
- That's a toughie?
- It's just that, you know,

335
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:02,509
If you date me,
you date the "falls."

336
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,444
So if you hurt one of us,
you hurt us both.

337
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:07,813
Oh my gosh.
I can't believe I was so close

338
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:09,881
To going on a date with you.

339
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:12,449
I mean, what was I thinking?
Obviously I wasn't thinking.

340
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,084
Yeah, and ironically
this is a drama-free zone,

341
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:17,185
- So security!
- Let me tell you something.

342
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:21,955
24 hours ago I fell in love with a guy
named mackenzie. And you, Chad, are no--

343
00:16:21,956 --> 00:16:24,290
- Don't say mackenzie!
Do not say mackenzie! - Mackenzie!

344
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,658
She said it! That's it!
Where's my security?

345
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:29,193
You are no longer
welcome at the "falls."

346
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,699
You said "falls"!

347
00:16:37,842 --> 00:16:40,349
You know another layer I have?

348
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,117
Origami.

349
00:16:42,118 --> 00:16:44,087
It's like a paper petting zoo.

350
00:16:44,088 --> 00:16:45,856
You know, I'm not really a fan

351
00:16:45,857 --> 00:16:48,660
Of your whole "layer"
thing, all right?

352
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:55,633
Are you okay?

353
00:16:55,634 --> 00:16:59,772
Dude, why are our
planets on the ground?

354
00:16:59,773 --> 00:17:01,973
And why are
they leading to--

355
00:17:01,974 --> 00:17:04,208
"mackenzie falls"?

356
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:06,911
Because Sonny's not just
watching it anymore,

357
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:09,312
She's living it!

358
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:12,381
Oh! Oh!

359
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:21,922
They chased me and they chased
me until finally I shook them

360
00:17:21,923 --> 00:17:24,157
When I transferred
to the cross-town bus

361
00:17:24,158 --> 00:17:26,660
And grady didn't have change.

362
00:17:26,661 --> 00:17:28,695
That is an unbelievable story.

363
00:17:28,696 --> 00:17:31,531
It's very dramatic.
Very dramatic.

364
00:17:31,532 --> 00:17:33,233
- You know what else is dramatic?
- Mom!

365
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:34,934
Oh, please let me
watch the "falls"!

366
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:37,269
Can't we just talk?
Tell me about your day.

367
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,337
Come on.

368
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:42,040
Oh, good.
Something to do.

369
00:17:44,309 --> 00:17:47,276
- Mackenzie!
- Mom!

370
00:17:47,277 --> 00:17:52,013
Sorry, I didn't know
how strict your ban was.

371
00:17:54,483 --> 00:17:57,217
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

372
00:17:57,218 --> 00:17:59,853
Can I come in?

373
00:17:59,854 --> 00:18:01,521
A little.

374
00:18:04,658 --> 00:18:06,825
I thought about
what you asked me, and--

375
00:18:06,826 --> 00:18:08,026
Excuse me.

376
00:18:08,027 --> 00:18:10,328
Mom, you may go
watch the "falls."

377
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:11,463
I'm good.

378
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:13,264
Go watch the "falls."

379
00:18:14,366 --> 00:18:15,933
- In your room.
- Awww.

380
00:18:18,103 --> 00:18:19,570
Go on.

381
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:22,539
Anyways, you asked
which hurt more,

382
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,008
Being over the "falls" or you
canceling our date, and...

383
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:28,177
It was definitely
you canceling our date.

384
00:18:28,178 --> 00:18:30,679
It's not a toughie at all.

385
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,049
Thanks, that's very
mackenzie of you.

386
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,583
Thanks.

387
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:38,319
So you never did give me a reason
why you called off our date.

388
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,020
It's kind of like you said.

389
00:18:40,021 --> 00:18:41,955
When you date me,
you date "so random!"

390
00:18:41,956 --> 00:18:43,723
And you know them,
they can be a--

391
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,360
What are you guys doing here?

392
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:51,029
I found change.

393
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,498
It's worse than we thought.

394
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:56,166
Flowers, a "mack falls" box set

395
00:18:56,167 --> 00:18:58,736
And a photo of Chad
holding flowers,

396
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,670
And a "mack falls" box set?

397
00:19:02,673 --> 00:19:05,274
- Chad?!
- Chad?!

398
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:08,710
Well, it's pretty obvious
what's going on here.

399
00:19:11,613 --> 00:19:12,846
Well, you're all wrong

400
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:14,881
Because Chad is here to see me.

401
00:19:14,882 --> 00:19:16,850
What?

402
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:19,252
- Mom?
- It's okay, Sonny.

403
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:21,553
I am not ashamed
to tell them the truth.

404
00:19:21,554 --> 00:19:25,490
- No, but I might be.
What are you doing? - Trust me.

405
00:19:25,491 --> 00:19:29,326
Chad came here tonight bearing
gifts for me because--

406
00:19:29,327 --> 00:19:31,528
Sonny's mother is also...

407
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:32,496
My mother.

408
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:36,399
So that means...

409
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,433
That's right.

410
00:19:37,434 --> 00:19:39,234
- Chad is--
- Yes.

411
00:19:39,235 --> 00:19:41,267
Your long lost brother.

412
00:19:41,268 --> 00:19:43,832
You lie!

413
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:45,233
Don't believe them, Sonny!

414
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:50,797
This is the plot line
of the season finale

415
00:19:52,564 --> 00:19:54,553
How would you know that, grady?

416
00:19:54,554 --> 00:19:56,298
't know.

417
00:19:57,934 --> 00:19:59,760
Grady? How would you
know that, grady?

418
00:19:59,761 --> 00:20:01,522
Because...

419
00:20:01,523 --> 00:20:04,470
Cause I used to secretly watch the "falls."
That, grady?

420
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:06,836
Ahh, who are we kidding?

421
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:09,543
We've all been hooked
at one point or another.

422
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:11,314
I hit bottom three years ago.

423
00:20:11,315 --> 00:20:14,621
I've been "falls" free
for two seasons.

424
00:20:14,622 --> 00:20:17,798
Six episodes.

425
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,132
This is awesome.

426
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:21,304
So, wait, why have you guys
been getting all over me?

427
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:24,177
- Because we thought you were different.
- We wanted to keep you pure.

428
00:20:24,178 --> 00:20:27,753
And we were all very concerned
about our science projects.

429
00:20:29,557 --> 00:20:31,929
But mostly to keep you pure.

430
00:20:33,332 --> 00:20:35,403
But you've been
soiled by the "falls,"

431
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:37,342
Like the rest of us.

432
00:20:39,243 --> 00:20:41,414
And that means that makes
you no better than me.

433
00:20:41,415 --> 00:20:44,555
Ha ha! You guys can start
revolving around me again.

434
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:50,903
Wait a minute,

435
00:20:50,904 --> 00:20:54,143
If Chad is not really here
because he's Sonny's brother,

436
00:20:54,144 --> 00:20:55,981
Then what is he doing here?

437
00:20:55,982 --> 00:20:58,052
Good one, nico.

438
00:20:58,922 --> 00:21:00,290
You want me to tell them?

439
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,930
No! No no no,
um, I'll tell them.

440
00:21:04,435 --> 00:21:07,841
Because I am not ashamed
and I have nothing to hide.

441
00:21:07,842 --> 00:21:09,110
That's my girl.

442
00:21:10,615 --> 00:21:12,652
I am...

443
00:21:12,653 --> 00:21:15,693
Judging Chad's celebrity
tennis tournament! Duh!

444
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:18,866
- Oh!
- I know!

445
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:22,208
- I thought you were gonna
say "dating." - No.

446
00:21:23,745 --> 00:21:26,719
- I'll see you guys later.
- We'll get out of here.

447
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,155
All right.

448
00:21:28,156 --> 00:21:30,962
<i>- Bye, Sonny!
- Later, Sonny!</i>

449
00:21:32,199 --> 00:21:36,375
So, uh...
When's the tournament?

450
00:21:36,376 --> 00:21:38,713
I'll give you the details
tomorrow night.

451
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,080
What's tomorrow night?

452
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:40,149
I'll give you the details
tomorrow night.

453
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:43,123
Oh, our first date.
See ya.

454
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:47,102
Ooh, the plot thickens.

455
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,173
- Room.
- Can't we just talk?

456
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:51,411
- Room. - Aww.
Can't we just talk? - Room.

457
00:21:56,465 --> 00:21:59,232
<i>On the next
"Mackenzie falls"...</i>

458
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:01,234
<i>An innocent dance turns
into a date</i>

459
00:22:01,268 --> 00:22:03,002
<i>With danger.</i>

460
00:22:03,036 --> 00:22:07,005
Chloe, we're going to polka.
Nobody can find out.

461
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,808
<i>And you won't believe who's
got it out for mackenzie.</i>

462
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:12,343
No! No spoilers--
no spoilers!

463
00:22:12,378 --> 00:22:15,646
See you there.
And wear your polka pants.

464
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,980
I'm already wearing them.

465
00:22:17,981 --> 00:22:18,817
What are u doing, J?

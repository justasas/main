A space creature? An alien?

725
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:32,382
Oh, my God! Jimmy!

726
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:34,092
Bow-wow
ba-ba-ba bow-wow

727
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:35,135
Ba-ba-ba-ba

728
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:36,136
Jimmy!

729
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:37,471
Stop the car!

730
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:38,764
Jimmy!

731
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:41,475
[Tires squeal]

732
00:35:43,227 --> 00:35:45,270
Aah! [Crash]

733
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:46,980
JIMMY: Aah!

734
00:35:47,022 --> 00:35:49,942
Uhh! Aah!

735
00:35:51,109 --> 00:35:53,987
[Train whistle blows]

736
00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:55,989
[Signal clanging]

737
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:03,247
JIMMY: I wasn't quite sure
just how I'd gotten on board...

738
00:36:03,288 --> 00:36:05,999
but I'd always dreamed
of riding a train.

739
00:36:06,041 --> 00:36:08,836
Thank goodness
the worst was behind me...

740
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:11,171
or so I thought.

741
00:36:11,213 --> 00:36:12,506
[Whispering]

742
00:36:12,548 --> 00:36:14,550
RUBBER WOMAN:
Look, he's awake.

743
00:36:14,591 --> 00:36:16,844
[Whispering continues]

744
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:22,349
What are we going to do?

745
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:24,893
[Whispering continues]

746
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:26,144
Aah!

747
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:29,147
-Aah!
-Aah!

748
00:36:29,231 --> 00:36:31,316
Shh!

749
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:33,110
Dr. Phreak is gonna hear you!

750
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:36,321
-What?
-He'll hear you. Hide!

751
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:38,782
What did you say?

752
00:36:38,824 --> 00:36:42,828
He said be quiet or
the doctor will hear you. Shh!

753
00:36:42,911 --> 00:36:44,538
Who are you?

754
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,915
They call me
the Human Sasquatch.

755
00:36:46,957 --> 00:36:48,667
What's your real name?

756
00:36:48,709 --> 00:36:52,546
Um...Clark?

757
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:54,173
So what's your deal?

758
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,675
Why are you in a bubble?

759
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:58,177
To protect me from germs.

760
00:36:58,218 --> 00:37:00,554
I was born
without any immunities...

761
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:02,222
so even a single one
could kill me.

762
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:04,391
But your doctor
would know all about that.

763
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:06,018
LL'L ZIP: Be quiet!
He's gonna come!

764
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,020
He's not your average doctor.

765
00:37:08,103 --> 00:37:09,271
He's Dr. Phreak.

766
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:12,566
We're all part of
his traveling Phreak Show.

767
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:13,901
He owns us.

768
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:15,777
-Owns you?!
-Shh!

769
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:16,862
LL'L ZIP: Be quiet!
Here comes Dr. Phreak!

770
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:18,113
FLIPPY: He's an ex-con.

771
00:37:18,155 --> 00:37:21,366
If he finds you in this train,
he'll own you, too.

772
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:23,368
[Brakes screech]

773
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,662
Now you did it, bubble butt.

774
00:37:25,704 --> 00:37:27,623
Here he comes!
Run for your life!

775
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:29,750
He's a vicious brute.

776
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:32,336
[Yelling]

777
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:34,379
[Thud]

778
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:43,639
You're Dr. Phreak?

779
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:46,475
Ha ha ha ha!

780
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:48,101
You're so mini! Ha ha ha!

781
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:49,645
-Mini? Oh, no!
-No!

782
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:53,273
Me, mini?! I'm not mini!

783
00:37:53,315 --> 00:37:57,653
I'm not mini!
Not! Not! Not!

784
00:37:57,694 --> 00:37:59,655
I'm not mini!

785
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:01,490
Who the hell are you?

786
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:02,533
He's the bubble boy.

787
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,284
Shut your beak!

788
00:38:04,326 --> 00:38:05,494
What are you doing
out of your coop?

789
00:38:05,536 --> 00:38:06,829
I shut up.

790
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:10,165
I could use
some fresh meat in my show.

791
00:38:10,207 --> 00:38:12,668
Why don't you hop
your little bubble butt...

792
00:38:12,709 --> 00:38:14,169
back on that train?

793
00:38:14,211 --> 00:38:16,505
Thanks, but, um...

794
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:19,299
I gotta get to
Niagara Falls by Saturday...

795
00:38:19,341 --> 00:38:20,717
to stop Chloe
from getting married.

796
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:25,722
That's so, so beautiful.

797
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:27,558
I, too, once loved another.

798
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,810
-You did?
-For 1 0 minutes.

799
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:31,520
Then I kicked her ass
out of the car.

800
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:34,273
Well, I gotta get going.

801
00:38:34,314 --> 00:38:35,274
Going?!

802
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:36,441
-Oh!
-Oh!

803
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:37,484
PHREAK:
What are you gonna do?

804
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:39,820
You're a freak,
and I should know.

805
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:41,155
That's my business.

806
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:44,032
No decent girl wants
to marry a bubble freak.

807
00:38:44,074 --> 00:38:47,035
Once you get that through
your thick, freaky skull...

808
00:38:47,077 --> 00:38:49,204
then give me a call.

809
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:51,373
What's wrong with being a freak?

810
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:52,624
Aah!

811
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:57,254
-Oh!
-Oh! That hurt!

812
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:58,672
Doctor?

813
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:01,008
JIMMY: Is he OK?
I didn't mean to...

814
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:03,177
FLIPPY: He looks so sweet
when he's not yelling.

815
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:05,762
You've killed him.

816
00:39:05,804 --> 00:39:07,222
[Talking quietly]

817
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:09,558
-What are we going to do?
-Whoa!

818
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,269
Good luck! Bye!

819
00:39:12,311 --> 00:39:15,272
Uhh! Heads up, Bubble!

820
00:39:15,314 --> 00:39:16,481
OK. Bye!

821
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:19,067
Get your own bags!
What do you think I am--bellhop?

822
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:28,577
Hey, where are you guys going?

823
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,913
We're going with you,
Dr. Bubble.

824
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:32,080
We're going with you.

825
00:39:32,122 --> 00:39:33,624
Dr. Bubble? No, no!

826
00:39:33,665 --> 00:39:36,126
You guys are free.

827
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:37,878
You can do whatever
you want now.

828
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,922
CHICKEN MAN:
Oh, we're free!

829
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:41,089
Free as a bird!

830
00:39:41,131 --> 00:39:43,967

832
00:39:45,677 --> 00:39:47,346
All the way!
Oh, I love it!

833
00:39:47,387 --> 00:39:48,764
JIMMY: Look, you guys...

834
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:51,725
I gotta do this alone.

835
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:55,646
Oh, yeah.

836
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:57,314
JIMMY: Bye!

837
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:06,698
JIMMY: It sure was nice...

838
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,617
of the train man
to loan me his vehicle...

839
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:11,495
but if l was gonna make it
to the wedding on time...

840
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:14,331
I had to find something
with a motor.

841
00:40:14,373 --> 00:40:17,376
Oh, my God!
He ain't eating meat!

842
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:19,878
Can you all believe it?
It's tofu!

843
00:40:19,878 --> 00:40:21,713
Tofu!

844
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:24,508
JIMMY: Could anybody
give me a ride?

845
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,677
Tofu gives me such gas!

846
00:40:26,718 --> 00:40:31,056
MAN: Bloody red meat!
Rare American meat!

847
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:33,350
[Laughter]

848
00:40:33,392 --> 00:40:36,144
That's the stupidest-looking hat
I've ever seen.

849
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:39,273
It's adorable!

850
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:41,817
JIMMY: Hey! Hey!

851
00:40:41,859 --> 00:40:43,152
[Laughter stops]

852
00:40:43,193 --> 00:40:45,529
Stop picking on him.

853
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:47,239
-Oh!
-Oh!

854
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:49,700
I don't want any trouble.
I'm just--

SHERIFF: Huh?

859
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:59,293
Because I was born
without any immunities--

860
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:01,587
Immunities?!
What the hell are immunities?

861
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:03,755
Well, I ain't sticking
around to find out!

862
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:05,048

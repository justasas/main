1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,800
One Year Ago.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,130
And now give it up for Sonny Munroe!

3
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:14,510
Thank you so much, West appleton high.

4
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,870
I can't believe one week from today

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:19,780
I will be leaving Wisconsin
to go to Hollywood!

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,350
And it's a good thing too, because
I didn't finish my book report.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,550
Boo!

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,790
Sorry, Mr. Henderson.

9
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,520
But I promise exactly one year from today

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,460
I will be back for homecoming to
accept West appleton's highest honor,

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,430
The firing of the cheese cannon...

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,370
And to deliver my book report.

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,670
And even though I'll be leaving Wisconsin,

14
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,940
I will always have cheese in my heart.

15
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,780
♪ gouda, havarti, cheddar and Jack ♪

16
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,350
♪ Wisconsin cheese
is an awesome snack! ♪.

17
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,090
All right, now in honor of Sonny's
first year on "So Random!"

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,390
I'd like to take a moment to
say a few heartfelt words:

19
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,960
Here comes cake.

20
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,900
Guys, I feel so loved.
Oh.

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,270
"Sonny Munroe is a phony."

22
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,240
Marshall, is this some kind of joke?

23
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,080
I'd never put that on a cake.
They charge by the letter.

24
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,380
Mine said, "yay!"

25
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,210
Who would do something like this?

26
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,920
Who cares? Cake is cake.
Scrape off the top. Let's eat.

27
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,590

42
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,590
How can you guys eat that cake?
It's full of hatred and lies.

43
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:38,730
Whoever doesn't like you, Sonny,
was trying to make a statement...

44
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,500
A delicious, Fluffy statement.

45
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,070
I mean, come on, Sonny,
it's not a big deal.

46
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,440
I mean, we've all gotten hate cakes before.

47
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,210
- Really?
- No.

48
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,540
No. But, you know,
if they're anything like this,

49
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,350
I'm gonna start ticking people off.

50
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,510
Yeah, Sonny, what did you do?

51
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,380
Can you do it again for my birthday?

52
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,390
Look at this: Sonny's hate cake is
the lead story on "tween weekly."

53
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,290
- What? - I know, not a
single mention of me.

54
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,800
I hate and I hate and I hate.
Where's the love?

55
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,270
"Sonny Munroe and
her costars..."

56
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,440
See? I'm not even a star
anymore, I'm a costar.

57
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,900
"... Were shocked when
during a celebration.

58
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,870
Of her first year
at 'So Random!'..."

59
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,080
No mention of my five years here.

60
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,210
"... An anonymous hate cake
was delivered."

61
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,250
Saying, 'Sonny Munroe
is a phony. '.

62
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,620
Sources on the scene describe
the cake as creamy.

63
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,950
"And buttery, but filled
with hate."

64
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,420
I remember when they used to
describe me that way.

65
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,490
Okay, good news and bad news.

66
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,390
The good news is, the bakery has no idea.

67
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,230
Who changed the message on the cake.

68
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,400
How is that good news?

69
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,730
When you compare it to this.

70
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,940
Sorry, that was mine.

71
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,510
I mean when you compare it to this.

72
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,320
I'm Ryan loughlin.

73
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,450
And this is "Tween Weekly TV."

74
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,020
Apparently cakes aren't the only way.

75
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,860
To send a nasty message
to So Random!'s Sonny Munroe.

76
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,100
I received this
mysterious letter this morning...

77
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:26,000
Mysterious because it seems.

78
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,010
To be using letters from an
outdated form of communication.

79
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,340
Called a magazine.

80
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,950
"Sonny Munroe is not.

81
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,950
The girl
she says she is."

82
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:43,790
So if she is not, who is she?

83
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,390
And what is she hiding?

84
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,160
Looks like things aren't so "sunny"

85
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,230
At "So Random!."

86
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,200
Who is doing this to me?

87
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,070
Well, let's think about this.
Have you made any enemies lately?

88
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,910
Well, I didn't take that flyer
from the guy in the hot-dog suit.

89
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,470
And I guess he was just doing his job.

90
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,380
That lady who said "good morning"...
I didn't say good morning back.

91
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,350
I thought it but I just didn't say it.

92
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,520
Ryan's right.
Who am I?

93
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:14,420
Sonny, this is crazy.
You're a nice kid.

94
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,060
Nice kid! There was a nice kid
selling chocolate for his school.

95
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,820
And I didn't buy any.
But it had nuts. I don't like nuts.

96
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,190
And for that I deserve a hate cake?

97
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,760
No you don't.

98
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,900
Come on, I'm gonna get you a new cake.

99
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,700
What would you like it to say?

100
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,130
And I'm willing to go as high
as six letters.

101
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,740
Without my bottles, your water is useless.

102
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,550
And without my water,
your bottles are just...

103
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,780
Empty like your heart.

104
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,350
Oh, cut, milady's on the set!

105
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,190
Come on now.

106
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,300
- We're in the middle of a scene here.
- Uh, he called me.

107
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,930
Cut her some slack, Penelope.

108
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,830
You saw the "tween weekly" story.

109
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,670
Someone's got it out for milady.

110
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,870
So you okay?

111
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,910
No, not really. I mean,
I'm totally stressed out.

112
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,680
With that cake and the hate and the letter.

113
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,050
I mean, it's just hard for me to be
excited about going back to Wisconsin.

114
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,680
Well, not to mention the book report.

115
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,080
Ah, the book report.

116
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,390
Relax relax.
I can help you.

117
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,520
- With the book report?
- Ha! Sonny, no. Please.

118
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,360
There's only three things that I read...

119
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,090
My scripts, my reviews and my checks.

120
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,830
And my check report
says that I'm rich enough.

121
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,430
To fly you to Wisconsin
on my private jet, air Chad.

122
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,000
You would do that?

123
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:40,040
I don't know.
Let's find out.

124
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,440
"let your heart take wing."

125
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,380
Well, that settles it.
We're going.

126
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,410
Wait a minute. You just made that
decision based on a fortune cookie?

127
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,050
It helps that I have
a private jet. But yes.

128
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,220
Now you can't tell anyone about this,

129
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,450
But this is how I make every
major decision in my life.

130
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,360
- Since when? - Since I had chinese
food with my psychic last week.

131
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,460
She said,
"you're destined for failure."

132
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,800
My cookie said, "you're
destined for greatness."

133
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,630
So I went with the cookie.

134
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,130
And now I'm flying air Chad.
You are one smart cookie.

135
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,970
Ha! Speaking of
smart cookies,

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,940
I got a great idea that's
gonna cheer you up.

137
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,910
- Penelope!
- Ready to get back to work?

138
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,710
I'm thinking we can finish our scene later.

139
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,050
My leading lady and my leading milady.

140
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,050
Do a little shopping together, huh?

141
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,420
What?

142
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,780
We don't even know each other.

143
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,250
That's where the shopping comes in.

144
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,920
Come on, girls, shop it up!

145
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,590
So you think that all
it takes for girls to bond.

146
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,730
Is to go shopping?

147
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,460
- It doesn't?
- No.

148
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,130
It helps to have something
in common to talk about.

149
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,430
Yeah, like the fact that
you think all it takes.

150
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,640
For girls to bond is to go shopping.

151
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,640
Well, I think we've found our topic.

152
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,040
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

153
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:01,320
Dude? Dude, what
are you doing?

154
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:05,020
Oh oh, I'm testing out
my new app... treasure tracker.

155
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,290
It turns any phone into
a portable metal detector.

156
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,690
Yeah, who knows what
valuable stuff we'll find?

157
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:14,660
Maybe you can find the 99¢
you lost on that worthless app.

158
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,530
Booya! Sunglasses.

159
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,840
Worthless.

160
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,770
Retainer.

161
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,010
Worthless.

162
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,320
- Rare gold coin.
- Worth lots. What...

163
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,350
We're rich.
Do you know what this means?

164
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:39,790
We can finally get those matching tug
boats we've been dreaming about.

165
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,160
I certainly hope that noise
is coming out of your mouths.

166
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,560
Where's Sonny?

167
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,670
I've got a more important question.

168
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,400
- Is that lasagna?
- Not just any lasagna.

169
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,470
Somebody sent me hate lasagna.

170
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,970
"dear Tawni, you are the second
prettiest girl on the planet."

171
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:00,580
Oh, that is some saucy hate.

172
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,980
Yeah. I want to rub it in Sonny's face
before I show it to "tween weekly."

173
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,220
You spelled "prettiest" wrong.

174
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,550
- No I didn't.
- Aha!

175
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,350
I knew you baked your own hate.

176
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,260
Well, it's not fair that
Sonny gets all the hate food.

177
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,590
Where is she?

178
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:19,200
She's at the mall with Penelope.

179
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,670
Of course she is!
She's out shopping.

180
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,100
With another celebrity
to get more publicity.

181
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,540
Well, she's about to be
shopping with two celebrities.

182
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:31,210
Baby, if you want to shop with two
celebrities, just come with us.

183
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,250
- Yeah, we're heading out to the
tugboat factory outlet. - Whoo-whoo!

184
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,620
There's not one word or sound in
that sentence that's appealing.

185
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,850
Hey!

186
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:44,520
My retainer!

187
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,720
I have been looking for this.

188
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,290
Oh, I almost forgot my lasagna.

189
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,740
Okay, how about this one?
How about this one?

190
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,810
- C. D. C.!
- Wha-doo-doo!

191
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,980
"peace out, suckers!"

192
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,750
Oh, okay, what do you think about this top?

193
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,450
It looks really great on you.

194
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,890
Thanks. Oh, and how good
does this necklace look with it?

195
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,220
Yeah. Oh wow,
that's expensive.

196
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,060
Oh, I know. Right?

197
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:25,400
I don't want to take it off.
It's too pretty.

198
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:27,160
This is fun, right?

199
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,330
Yeah. We can't
tell Chad though.

200
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,570
No.

201
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,770
Excuse me one sec.
Hello.

202
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,770
Hi, it's Tawni.

203
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,810
Who?

204
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,140
- Tawni.
- Tawni?

205
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,610
That's what I said...
Tawni.

206
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,910
So are you having a good time?

207
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,750
Actually I am. Penelope just
picked out an awesome top for me.

208
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,190
Let me be the judge of that.

209
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,290
Curses!

210
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,630
What are you doing here and why
are you tatking like that?

211
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,430
Oh, I'm wearing my retainer.

212
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,430
Although it doesn't seem to fit so good,

213
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,370
So I'm just gonna...

214
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,200
Much better.

215
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,180
So where are we celebrities shopping next?

216
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,980
Oh, I get it, Tawni.
You're feeling a little left out.

217
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,020
Only of having my picture taken.

218
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,220
I may not have been seen
coming in with you two,

219
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,890
But I'm gonna be seen walking out.

220
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,160
- Sonny, Penelope!
- Tawni. What? I'm right here.

221
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,500
Sonny, care to make a comment
about the letter?

222
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,330
- Leave her alone.
- That's right.

223
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,240
And pay attention to me.
Wanna see what I bought?

224
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,910
- So what are you two girls...
- Three girls.

225
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,810
... Up to today?

226
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,510
Honestly, Ryan, there's no story here.

227
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,010
We're just going shopping.

228
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,580
That's what celebrities do.
Duh.

229
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,490
Excuse me, miss.
I'm gonna need to look in that bag.

230
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,990
- Why?
- Oh, you did buy that necklace?

231
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,890
No, ma'am, she didn't.

232
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,090
- You're gonna need to come with us.
- What?

233
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,600
No, there must be some sort of mistake.

234
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,430
Or has there?

235
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,830
Sonny Munroe, shoplifter.

236
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,540
Looks like that necklace just got.

237
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,170
Some matching bracelets.

238
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:18,910
I'm Ryan laughlin for
"Tween Weekly TV."

239
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,440
Cut.

240
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,170
I promise you, Mr. Condor, this
whole Sonny-shoplifting thing.

241
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,970
Is gonna blow over.

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,940
Yes, you know the press.

243
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,810
They'll lose interest in
the story in five minutes.

244
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,980
Ah!

245
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,150
What? Oh. No no, sir,
nothing's wrong.

246
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,320
I just won tickets for Justin bieber.

247
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,150
Ah! Ha ha ha.

248
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,490
Yes, of course you can come along, sir.

249
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,190
Yes, pick you up at 8:00.

250
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,560
Great.

251
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,560
Now I gotta win Justin bieber tickets.

252
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,460
I'm innocent. I promise
I didn't steal the necklace.

253
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,530
Get back.
All you people care about.

254
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,140
Is dragging people through the mud.

255
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,300
Speaking of mud, we're getting down
and dirty on "MacKenZie Falls"

256
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,810
Wednesdays at 8:00,
7:00 central.

257
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,240
Get back!

258
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,840
Chad, thank you so much
for bailing me out of jail.

259
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,310
Well, can't have milady
rotting away in the big house.

260
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,380
And, Marshall, thank you
for having my back.

261
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,750
Well, I can't have one of
my stars treated like this.

262
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,220
Pizza delivery for Sonny Munroe.

263
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,020
Aha.

264
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,190
I'll handle this.

265
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,500
Sonny, how did you break out of prison?

266
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:34,430
I can't believe you tried the old
paparazzi-disguised- as-a-delivery-guy trick!

267
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,840
We'll find out the truth about you, Sonny!

268
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,910
Get out of here, you hack!
Aha ha ha ha ha!

269
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,740
This is why I got into this business.

270
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,980
Can either one of you
get me Justin bieber tickets?

271
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:56,760
Oh, it's perfect.
Thank you so much.

272
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:00,390
I was gonna put something in,
not take something out.

273
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,370
That's it.
Everybody hide your wallets.

274
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,200
Sonny Munroe coming through.

275
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,070
If she doesn't get you,
her cheese ball will.

276
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,770
Don't worry about them, Sonny.
We know you're innocent.

277
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,310
But we're not too sure about your sanity.

278
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,940
What is this?

279
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,280
And why does it smell like Grady's feet?

280
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,550
Oh, sorry, that...
that is my feet.

281
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,320
Ew!

282
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:28,550
Yeah, I was changing into
my lunch socks, so...

283
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,060
Okay, this cheese ball right
here happens to represent

284
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:36,100
175 years of West appleton
High School tradition.

285
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,830
Not a lot going on
in West appleton, is there?

286
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:42,300
Wait, I didn't tell you the exciting part.

287
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,240
As the person who gets to
fire the cheese cannon,

288
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,240
I get to bring a cheese ball
that best represents me.

289
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,080
So I had the cafeteria make one...

290
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,680
Half californian/ half Wisconsin cheddar.

291
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,750
You think your cheese ball is cool?

292
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,250
Check out what me and Grady found
while you were in the pokey.

293
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,360
Our first treasure.

294
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,960
Oh, so that explains the hats.

295
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,190
You guys are finally
getting your tug boats.

296
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:11,000
I guess some Hollywood dreams
really do come true.

297
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,470
- Let me look at that.
- No!

298
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,770
Man, if I'd had a couple of these,
I would have bought the necklace.

299
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,010
Ha. I'll be taking that
back now.

300
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,110
And putting it somewhere were
no one else would think to go.

301
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,980
Oh, your "facechum" page?

302
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,020
Oh look, it's Penelope.

303
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,220
- Hey, you're gonna strike out.
- No I'm not.

304
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,720
Hey! You know,
my friend and I.

305
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,490
Are treasure hunters.

306
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:44,000
And your x just marked my spot.

307
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,170
That line just might work...

308
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,530
Oh really?

309
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,100
... If your goal is
to die alone.

310
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,010
I don't want to die alone.

311
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,480
Sonny, how are you doing?

312
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:59,280
This is Sonny watch!

313
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,750
Not so good anymore.

314
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:03,250
Coming up tonight on "tween wkly tv, "

315
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,490
Another Sonny Munroe shocker.

316
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,760
The voice behind the letter speaks.

317
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:11,490
That necklace wasn't.

318
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,430
The first thing Sonny Munroe stole.

319
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,660
If you're keeping track,

320
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,430
That makes it at least the second thing.

321
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,700
That Sonny Munroe has stolen.

322
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,000
Where will this crime spree end?

323
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,270
At three? At four?

324
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,780
At five?
Tune in tonight at 6:00.

325
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:34,510
As we continue "tween weekly
tv"'s Sonny watch.

326
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,320
When will this end?

327
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,190
For you...
I mean for you.

328
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,820
Do you have any idea who that person is?

329
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,660
No.

330
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,330
Oh, think about it, Sonny.
Who do you know.

331
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,700
Who talks...
like this?

332
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:55,330
- Nobody.
- But I just did.

333
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,870
Don't worry, Sonny.

334
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,480
If you need me, call me.

335
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,210
If you need me, call me!

336
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,050
I am gonna die alone.

337
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,020
I'm dying a little right now.

338
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,220
Ryan will stop at nothing
to get his story...

339
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,190
Unless we stop him first.
You guys are there for me, right?

340
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,390
Yeah!

341
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:23,360
Will there be cameras?

342
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,870
I mean...

343
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,740
Oh, come on, who am I kidding?
Will there be cameras?

344
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,040
All right, Sonny's dating Chad.

345
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,310
And I will stop at nothing to dig
something else up on her in here.

346
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,250
- Ha!
- Ah!

347
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,690
Looking for something?

348
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,450
Whah!

349
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,360
Well, if it ain't the trash
looking through the trash.

350
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,630
That was good.

351
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,560
I've been working on that all afternoon.

352
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,730
I could tell.

353
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,760
Why are you in a dumpster?

354
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,070
We're in a dumpster because that's
where the trash is thrown out.

355
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,640
I've been working on that
since I heard your line.

356
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,740
I can tell.

357
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,710
Look, every single thing you've
said about me, Ryan, is not true.

358
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,610
But you wouldn't know that because you haven't
even asked me my side of the story yet.

359
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:14,610
Ah!

360
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,050
Or mine!

361
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,480
Uh, dude, get this...

362
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,990
Out coin is somewhere in the trash.

363
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,820
You know what?
I am not gonna laugh at your stuff.

364
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,390
If you don't laugh at mine.

365
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,030
It's not a joke.
It's gone.

366
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,000
Not as long as I have my treasure tracker.

367
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:34,470
You just hurt people with
false accusations.

368
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,840
There's no proof that I did
any of that stuff, okay?

369
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,400
It's just people saying that I did.

370
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,340
You know what?
You're right.

371
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:43,110
You deserve to be heard.
Roll it.

372
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,150
I'm Ryan laughlin for "Tween Weekly TV"

373
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,820
With Sonny Munroe's side of the story.

374
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,750
Hi, I'm Sonny Munroe and I'm...

375
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:57,060
- A thief!
- You stole our rare coin?

376
00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:00,230
- No! - And that's her
side of the story.

377
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,530
- No I didn't!
- Cut.

378
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,900
Please, you guys have to listen me.

379
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,100
I have no idea how that coin
got into my pocket.

380
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,440
- We believed in you.
- We defended you.

381
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:16,740
You couldn't allow me one shining
moment in the garbage, could you?

382
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,780
I can explain this.

383
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,050
We're waiting.

384
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,580
Guys, I can't explain this.

385
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,250
I sure hope you can explain this.

386
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,900
Ha.
That's mine.

387
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,240
I mean, I sure hope you can explain this.

388
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:46,370
Everybody knows sicky Vicky,

389
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,380
Sonny Munroe's first breakout
character on "So Random!, "

390
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,580
The one that landed Sonny
her big Hollywood dream.

391
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,120
Today I've got pink-eye.

392
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,950
I got it from Alice mazarsky
because she came to school.

393
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,890
With pink-eye... not cool.

394
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,090
So how would a girl.

395
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,260
Who's stolen a necklace...

396
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,900
Not cool!

397
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,670
-... A coin...
- Not cool!

398
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,900
... And heaven knows
what else...

399
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,940
Not cool!

400
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:22,680
... Come up with an original
character like sicky Vicky?

401
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,340
By stealing it.

402
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,310
Not cool!

403
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,450
What? I didn't steal
sicky Vicky.

404
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,280
I made that character up.

405
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,650
Meet the real sicky Vicky, Vicky sicowitz.

406
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,190
I couldn't keep quiet anymore, Ryan.

407
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:40,490
How many lies has she told?

408
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,200
How many more people will she hurt?

409
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,500
Not cool.

410
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,500
Not cool at all.

411
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,470
Not cool, Sonny.

412
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,540
Marshall, look, I know
this looks really bad,

413
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,180
- But you've got to believe me.
- I want to believe you.

414
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,640
But it's all too much.
And now it's affecting the show.

415
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,380
So until this is cleared up,
I'm sorry, Sonny,

416
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,350
But you're off "So Random!."

417
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,690
Guys?

418
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,680
I'm Ryan laughlin for "Tween Weekly TV, "

419
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,120
Reporting live outside
Sonny Munroe's apartment.

420
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,820
Go away!

421
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,330
Never.

422
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,330
This is Sonny watch!

423
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,960
And tonight...

424
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,900
I said no interviews!

425
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,400
Delivery for Sonny Munroe.

426
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,540
Oh, my food's here.

427
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,540
Chad?

428
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,140
- You recognize me?
- There are people who didn't?

429
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,210
Yeah, Ryan and the other reporters.

430
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,380
It's a zoo down there.
This is the only way I could sneak up.

431
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,380
Oh, I'm so glad to see you...

432
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,390
Even looking like that.

433
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,360
Let's go eat. You won't believe
how many fake delivery guys.

434
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,860
Have shown up at my door.

435
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:04,360
You're the first one I haven't beaten up.

436
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,990
Sonny Munroe!

437
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,030
Did you steal sicky Vicky
from Vicky sicowitz?

438
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,700
There is no Vicky sicowitz!
I made sicky Vicky up!

439
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,370
Yeah, now leave milady alone!

440
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,970
Shut up, chinese-food guy!

441
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,710
Oh my gosh, it's Chad Dylan Cooper.

442
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,520
Yeah, and he's telling you to
leave his lady alone.

443
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,050
Oh really?

444
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,420
Did your fortune cookie
tell you to say that?

445
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,020
Ha ha ha!

446
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,930
- You told?
- No I didn't.

447
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,100
How'd they all find out, Sonny?
You were the only one who knew.

448
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,970
Chad, I didn't tell anybody
about your fortune cookies.

449
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,370
Oh my gosh, you don't believe me.

450
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Well...

451
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,410
Are you thinking about checking a cookie?

452
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,880
Would that be bad?

453
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,380
I don't know.
Let's see.

454
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,150
"he who checks cookie.

455
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,920
Checks into hospital."

456
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,960
Come on, Sonny. I told you a secret.
Now everybody knows about it.

457
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,460
- What am I supposed to think?
- You're not supposed to think.

458
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,330
I'm your girlfriend.
You're supposed to trust me.

459
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,830
You know what? Just take
your stupid fortune cookies.

460
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,930
And your private plane and just go.

461
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,240
- You're gonna lose all
your Chad miles. - Out.

462
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:26,110
I said go away, Chad.

463
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,980
- Tawni?
- You're living my dream.

464
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,950
What?

465
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,820
I'm stuck inside my apartment
trapped by paparazzi.

466
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,290
Stop rubbing it in!

467
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
You want my life?
Take it.

468
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,990
Everyone either thinks that
I'm a thief or a liar.

469
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,930
I have to find my way back to Wisconsin.

470
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,860
Without paparazzi following me.

471
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,430
And I still haven't done my book
report on "the grapes of wrath."

472
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,270
You think you have it bad?

473
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,800
Nobody even notices me anymore.

474
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,240
Try being me and see how that feels.

475
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,680
What are you doing?

476
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,450
Wow!
You weren't kidding.

477
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,490
Looking like you is the perfect
way to sneak out of my apartment.

478
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,120
Nobody... and I mean nobody...
paid any attention to me.

479
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,460
Ha ha!

480
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,460
Yeah, I was there.

481
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,000
You know what?
I thought with at least two Tawnis,

482
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,300
It would draw some attention
just for the curiosity factor.

483
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:28,500
But no!
We were doubly ignored.

484
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:31,940
Oh, too funny.
Ah.

485
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,540
So where do you want to drop me off?

486
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,380
They're probably looking
for me at the airport,

487
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,450
So bus station, train?

488
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:41,220
It'd probably be easier for me
to drive you to Wisconsin.

489
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,920
How is that easier?

490
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,420
Uh, I don't want to go
anywhere near a bus station.

491
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,590
That's where the carless go.

492
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:51,430
I see what's happening here.
You're being nice to me.

493
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,200
Only because you look like somebody I like.

494
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,200
- Now get that thing off your head.
- Ow!

495
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,270
No.

496
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,240
You sound like the only
person left who believes in me.

497
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,670
How do you know I'm not just doing this.

498
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,140
For the publicity I'll get
once we prove you're innocent?

499
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,750
You think I'm innocent?

500
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,910
You do believe in me.

501
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,650
Well, since there are no cameras here,

502
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,490
Sadly,

503
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,550
Yes, I believe in you.

504
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,490
But don't make a big deal out of it.

505
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,960
Oh!

506
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,960
I'm trying to drive!

507
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,860
- Read your book!
- Okay.

508
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,400
You believe in me, Tawni.

509
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,510
Those better be the first
words of that book.

510
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:47,620
So let me see if I've
deduced this properly.

511
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,820
I go away for three days
to a Sherlock Holmes convention;

512
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,750
Sonny's accused of being a liar,

513
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:54,690
Stealing a necklace and your valuable coin;

514
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,960
Has a fight with her
fortune-cookie-eating boyfriend.

515
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,360
And then hits the road with
her new best friend Tawni?

516
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,130
Which leads me to.

517
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,270
Did you know your valuable
coin was chocolate?

518
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,700
Say what now?

519
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,440
I'm giving you one last chance, MacKenZie.

520
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,540
If you don't give me your water,
I'll fill my bottles from the tap.

521
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,450
Chad, this is where you turn and face me.

522
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:27,620
This is milady at the zoo...

523
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,790
Milady at the pancake house
eating a short stack.

524
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:35,260
This is milady screaming at me to stop
taking pictures of her short stack.

525
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,900
Chad, what are you doing?

526
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:40,000
That's what she said
when I took the picture.

527
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,100
Oh, why did I let her go?

528
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,610
Don't look at me.

529
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,680
We ran over something.

530
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,320
Well, ladies,

531
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,920
Looks like the reason you're
stuck here in jawbone junction.

532
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,320
Is what we in the tow-truck
vernacular call a flat tire.

533
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,790
Yeah, I know it's a flat tire.

534
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,260
And I would have changed it myself.

535
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,100
If someone hadn't removed
the spare to make room.

536
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,100
For her spare velour designer sweatsuit.

537
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,940
Sir, can you just fix our tire?

538
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,770
Don't I know you from somewhere?

539
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:19,370
No no, just a stranger passing through.

540
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,110
What about me?
Do you know me from somewhere?

541
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:25,650
Now that you mention it, there is
something about you that's familiar.

542
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,380
Finally!

543
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,890
You remind me of something
I found under your wheel well.

544
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,790
This dead critter looks just like
the one on top of your head.

545
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,620
What?

546
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,730
Anyway, to fix the tire and
to decritterize your vehicle,

547
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,700
It'll be $527.

548
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,830
Okay, you know what?
How much without the decritterizing?

549
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,900
Oh, that's on the house.

550
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,240
Provided I get to keep it.

551
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:52,870
So let's get a move on, 'cause I'm due up.

552
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,180
At the jawbone junction
joke-off tonight.

553
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,880
Just give him the credit card.

554
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,380
Credit card?
Ha ha!

555
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,590
I don't take no credit card.
Just cash money.

556
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,920
We don't have any cash money.

557
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,260
You know what? It's okay.
We'll challenge you to the joke-off.

558
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,660
Yeah. You fix our car
and if we win tonight,

559
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,160
We'll just call it even.

560
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,860
I've got to warn you:

561
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,670
I've won that thing five years in a row.

562
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,670
Well, we're just two girls from California.

563
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,040
- That don't know anything
about being funny. - Mmm-nhh.

564
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:25,710
What choice do we have?

565
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,910
Fine. If you win,
you don't owe me nothing.

566
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,810
- But if I win, I get...
- The car?

567
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:34,420
- My velour pants?
- That cheese ball.

568
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,290
- No! - No, you said
it yourself, girlie...

569
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,220
What other choice to you have?

570
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,560
It's winner takes ball.

571
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,630
Okay, let's go through this one more time.

572
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,300
The coin is chocolate.

573
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,370
See, this is where you keep losing us.

574
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,100
Look, for the sake of argument, okay,

575
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,770
Let's just say that the coin was chocolate.

576
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,540
It was chocolate!

577
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,710
It doesn't matter what
the coin was made of.

578
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,650
Sonny still stole it.

579
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,750
Well, I'm not convinced.
Did you actually see her take the coin?

580
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,150
- No.
- No.

581
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,320
- But we know it was her.
- Yeah.

582
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,950
Not enough.

583
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,620
If I learned anything at
that Sherlock Holmes convention,

584
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,890
Besides not to inhale this bubble pipe,

585
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:18,790
It's that you can't solve
a case without cold hard facts.

586
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,430
Fact: The missing coin
was in her pocket.

587
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,800
Fact: The stolen necklace
was in her bag.

588
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,570
Fact: It's hard to take you
seriously wearing those dumb hats.

589
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,900
Fact: You're wearing
a dumb hat too.

590
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,670
Fact: Mine matches
my coat.

591
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,110
- Fact: Ours matches our boats.
- Fact: Mine's waterproof!

592
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:34,680
Fact: So is ours!

593
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,010
Fine, we all agree... we all
have cool waterproof hats.

594
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,680
So that proves it!

595
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,580
- Sonny's guilty.
- Mm-hmm.

596
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:49,960
Okay okay, folks.
Welcome to the jawbone junction joke-off.

597
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,790
You know how it's done.
The first one without.

598
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,330
A clever retort loses.

599
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,730
Ladies first.

600
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:00,070
City before pretty.

601
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,170
No no, after you.
Hicks before chicks.

602
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,780
Whoa!

603
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,110
Now we got ourselves
a joke-off.

604
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,110
You might be from the city if your heels.

605
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:15,320
Are higher than
my I. Q.

606
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,120
Well, you might be from jawbone.

607
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:23,160
If you're missing teeth and
you're not looking for them.

608
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:27,400
All right, all right.
You might be city folk.

609
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:31,870
If you've changed out of your sweatpants
so you ain't sweatin' in 'em.

610
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,140
You might be from jawbone.

611
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,510
If you call the food in your beard dessert.

612
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:46,180
Well, you might be from the city if...

613
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,650
If...

614
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,550
Shoot, I can't top that.

615
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:58,360
It's funny and true.
Mmm!

616
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,860
Looks like we've got
ourselves a new champion.

617
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,470
Not bad for a couple of amateurs.

618
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,970
Thank you.

619
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,670
Oh oh, thank you.

620
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,840
You guys have been a great audience.

621
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,380
And you know what? You can watch
us weekly on our hit comedy show,

622
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,780
- "So Random!."
- What?

623
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:21,180
I've been bamboozled by
a couple of "con-medians."

624
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,820
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

625
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,650
Get back here.
You get back here!

626
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,960
Boo!

627
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,490
Well, you must be from the city.

628
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:34,130
If you left without
your fancy cellular phone.

629
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,800
Hello?

630
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:40,000
I miss you, short stack!

631
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,910
All right, boys, you think Sonny's guilty?

632
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,710
Prove it.
Show me some evidence.

633
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,210
- Ah, we'll show you something.
- Yeah yeah, we will.

634
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:55,050
- Come on, you take the left, I'll take the right.
- All right, I got it.

635
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,220
Aha!

636
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:01,060
Look at these terrified hairy
children and the fear in their eyes.

637
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:03,890
Who knows what she did to them?

638
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,530
Those are baby seals.

639
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,330
Sonny rescued them from an oil spill,

640
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,500
Then bathed them by hand
and nursed them back to health.

641
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,570
Face it, she's as innocent
as you are wrong.

642
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,000
There's got to be a clue
around here somewhere.

643
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,910
- What are you eating?
- Mmm, Sonny's cheese ball.

644
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:22,510
Wait, what's Sonny's cheese ball
doing on Tawni's makeup table?

645
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,880
Next to a receipt for a cake?

646
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,450
Oh, and a magazine with all
the letters cut out.

647
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,180
Like the letter Sonny got.

648
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:33,890
Okay, clearly Sonny has moved
all her evidence.

649
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,920
Over to Tawni's makeup table.

650
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,860
It's elementary, my dear half wit.

651
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,200
If you had spent $2, 000 on
a deductive-reasoning seminar,

652
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:44,400
As I did, you would know, as I do,

653
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:46,600
That the guilty party is Tawni!

654
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,570
Whoa whoa.
Okay, this changes everything.

655
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:51,710
If Sonny isn't guilty,

656
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:55,210
Then logic follows that
the coin isn't chocolate!

657
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,780
Ha ha ha! Stick that in
your pipe and blow it.

658
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,880
No.

659
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,580
What it means is.

660
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,090
We owe Sonny an apology.

661
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,120
Yeah, we do.

662
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,890
I just hope we get the chance.

663
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:12,230
"how to build
a cheese-ball bomb."

664
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,930
"how to build a cheese-
ball bomb."

665
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,130
- You're saying Tawni's behind this?
- Think about it.

666
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,730
Who's had it out for Sonny since
she first came to the show?

667
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:22,070
- Tawni.
- Okay.

668
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:25,740
And who just happened to show up just
before Sonny got caught for shoplifting?

669
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,440
- Tawni.
- Right.

670
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,110
Right. And who was in
the dumpster when Sonny.

671
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,410
Allegedly stole Nico and Grady's coin?

672
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,650
Tawni! Tawni! Tawni!

673
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,920
This is all my fault.

674
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:39,320
Sonny should be flying safely
to Wisconsin with me.

675
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,060
Instead who is she driving with?

676
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,430
This is where you would
all yell "Tawni."

677
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,330
Oh, Tawni!

678
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,270
- Tawni.
- Why didn't I see it?

679
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,070
Yeah.

680
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,800
Dude, for something that could
possibly blow my face off,

681
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,270
- This is good eatin'.
- I told you.

682
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:02,480
Wisconsin cheddar, California cheddar.

683
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,850
You know what I'm not tasting?

684
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,620
The blowing-your-face-off part.
There's no gunpowder.

685
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,520
Wait a minute. If we've got
the real cheese ball,

686
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,350
- That means Sonny's got the...
- Bomb!

687
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:13,620
This book is the bomb!

688
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:17,630
And from where I'm sitting, it
looks like you're almost finished.

689
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:25,360
Whyyyy!

690
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,860
And that concludes
our in-flight entertainment.

691
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,430
Thank you.

692
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,800
Good thing this plane comes with barf bags.

693
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:34,240
Man over p. A.
This is your Captain speaking.

694
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,770
We're about 20 minutes
out of appleton, Wisconsin.

695
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:40,980
Please keep your seat belts buckled,
and thank you for choosing air Chad.

696
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,910
Chad, I have to say,

697
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:49,220
I've always hated you
for having your own plane.

698
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,720
But?

699
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,920
That's it.

700
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,630
Sonny's still not answering.
I'm getting worried.

701
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,030
It's gonna be okay.
We're almost there.

702
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,730
Oh, what's up, cappy?

703
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,570
Thought I'd give you folks a heads up:

704
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,230
You're in for a bumpy ride.

705
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,240
- Hello, my love.
- What?

706
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,270
Excuse me?

707
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,080
I think cappy loves you.

708
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,420
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

709
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:24,090
Penelope! First of all,
thanks for taking the mask off.

710
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,420
And making this only slightly less awkward.

711
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,260
- Secondly, what?!
- Chad,

712
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:30,830
This plan isn't going to
make it to Wisconsin.

713
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,260
What?

714
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:35,100
Ahh! I see
what's going on here.

715
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,330
This is part of
the in-flight entertainment.

716
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,430
Bravo.

717
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,570
Shut it!

718
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,400
There are only two parachutes...

719
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,610
One for me and one for
the man I've always loved.

720
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,380
I knew this day would come.

721
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:57,250
Hey, lover boy, she's not into
you; she's trying to kill you.

722
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,750
Jump with me, Chad, out of this plane.

723
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,760
And into the rest of our lives.

724
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:05,460
Penelope, I'm both flattered
and a little creeped out.

725
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:09,000
- But I have a girlfriend.
- Not for long.

726
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:12,470
As soon as she lowers my cheese-ball
bomb into that cannon of hers.

727
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,540
And blows herself into cheese spread,

728
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,940
You'll be free to date.

729
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:18,940
Your cheese-ball bomb?

730
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:21,240
Of course it was mine, you dimwits.

731
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,450
I did everything!
I switched out the cheese ball.

732
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,850
With the cheese bomb, sent the hate cake,

733
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,150
Mailed the letters, framed Tawni.

734
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,550
I was wrong?

735
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,450
Nice Detective work, Sherlock.

736
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:36,820
I do not deserve this pipe.

737
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,830
What about our coin?

738
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,100
- That line just might work.
- Oh really?

739
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:45,430
If your goal is to die alone.

740
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,670
If you need me, call me.

741
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,910
What about the necklace?

742
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,580
- So what do you think?
- Wow.

743
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,580
Even you can make this top look good.

744
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,720
- Really?
- No.

745
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,750
And how did you find out
about my fortune-cookie secret?

746
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:09,160
Your microphone was on.
We also heard...

747
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:13,090
Ah, you are one pretty man.

748
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,600
I only said that 'cause my fortune
cookie told me I was pretty.

749
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,600
- So...
- Ah.

750
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,400
Okay.

751
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,740
With Sonny gone and Tawni going to jail,

752
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,610
It'll just be you and me.

753
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,940
I have got to get myself a plane.

754
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,040
Whoa!

755
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,050
- Who's flying this plane?
- Nobody!

756
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,020
What? Ah!

757
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,620
What's it gonna be, Chad?

758
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,420
I can't think!

759
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,390
I don't need a cookie
to make this decision.

760
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,100
I choose Sonny.

761
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,870
Yeah! Let's go!

762
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,570
Wrong choice.

763
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,140
'cause if I can't have you, nobody will.

764
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,440
And with you gone,
"MacKenZie Falls" will become.

765
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,410
"Penelope falls!"

766
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,280
Speaking of which,

767
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,350
Ah!

768
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,020
Peace out, suckers!

769
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,950
She left the other parachute!

770
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,130
- Oh no!
- Relax.

771
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,770
It's not like I can't fly my own plane.

772
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,870
I can't fly my own plane.

773
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:43,850
Will you relax? We're gonna get to
your High School in plenty of time.

774
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:47,660
You just had to stop and get your face
carved out of butter, didn't you?

775
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:51,360
Hey, at least that old butter carver
was paying attention to my face.

776
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,360
I'll take what I can get.

777
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,870
I'm Ryan laughlin and
this is Sonny watch...

778
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,530
On the radio!

779
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,470
We are live in West appleton, Wisconsin.

780
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,140
Are you kidding me?
He's there?

781
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,570
I'm here...

782
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:09,710
Waiting for the arrival
of known liar and thief

783
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,280
Sonny Munroe.

784
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:14,820
And it looks like letting down Hollywood.

785
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,820
Wasn't enough.

786
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:21,390
With only 20 minutes left until
the firing of the cheese cannon,

787
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,720
My forecast is...

788
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,060
Very little chance.

789
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:28,560
Of Sonny...

790
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,400
And winds out of the southwest.

791
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,570
Oh yeah?
Well, here's my forecast:

792
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,670
- I'm firing that cannon.
- Yeah!

793
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,970
- Yeah.
- Nothing's gonna stop us now.

794
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:39,570
No way.

795
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:42,310
Oh my gosh,
"just the facts."

796
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:45,510
Just let the butter face
do all the talking.

797
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:55,260
Three things my mom told me.

798
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:57,760
My traveling socks, a ham sandwich.

799
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:00,330
And a clean parachute.

800
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,570
The strap! The strap...
it's starting to rip.

801
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,770
- We're too heavy.
- Get rid of the ham sandwich!

802
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,100
All right.

803
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,700
- No, get rid of it!
- All right.

804
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,450
I can't believe we're not gonna make it.

805
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,510
We traveled all this way for nothing.

806
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:23,780
That's not true. Here's
a little something for you.

807
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,920
Why are you giving me the ticket?
She was the one driving.

808
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,090
Huh. I didn't
even notice you.

809
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,190
The icing on the hate cake.

810
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:35,230
I've lost my good name, my job,
my boyfriend, everything!

811
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,030
- Nico?
- Sonny!

812
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,070
We know you're innocent.

813
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,100
Marshall said you can have your job back.

814
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,410
That's great!

815
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,440
- Zora?
- Penelope framed you.

816
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,110
- She's behind everything.
- That's horrible.

817
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,320
- Grady?
- Has anyone seen a ham sandwich?

818
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,490
Ah! Stop!

819
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:04,630
- Oh!
- Chad?

820
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,960
Sonny, I'm so sorry.
I should have trusted you.

821
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,230
- Please forgive me.
- Oh my gosh!

822
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,170
You flew all the way to Wisconsin.

823
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,570
And fell out of the sky just
so you could apologize.

824
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,800
Nobody's ever done that for me.

825
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,410
How could I not forgive you?

826
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,080
I missed you, short stack.

827
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:23,580
Ew!

828
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:26,680
I missed you too, egg whites
with tomatoes on the side...

829
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,950
But don't let them touch.
Otherwise it's going back.

830
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:32,620
You're Chad Dylan Cooper!

831
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:34,190
Yes, officer, I am.

832
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,190
Before we get a picture of us on your bike,

833
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,790
I'm gonna need a favor.

834
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,030
I'm gonna make it.
Thank you, guys!

835
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,960
Thanks for the picture, Chad.

836
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,770
- Goodbye, Sonny!
- Follow your dreams!

837
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,970
- Bye!
- Get 'em!

838
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,800
Wait a minute. I forgot to
give her the real cheese ball.

839
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,810
That means Sonny's still got the bomb!

840
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,440
- Oh oh oh!
- Sonny! You've got the bomb!

841
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,180
- Wait!
- Hold this.

842
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:00,180
- Oh okay.
- I don't deserve this hat!

843
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,080
Just get in the car!

844
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,490
Oh oh, all right!

845
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:19,100
Students, are you ready
to kick off homecoming.

846
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:22,770
With the West appleton high cheese cannon?

847
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:28,880
- Well, Sonny Munroe isn't.
- Boo!

848
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:32,180
But that doesn't mean we can't
have a good time, right?

849
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:38,120
♪ gouda, havarti, cheddar and Jack ♪

850
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,690
♪ we don't care if
Sonny ever comes back. ♪.

851
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,620
Yeah!

852
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,690
And apparently you can turn anything.

853
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,960
Into a cheer in West appleton.

854
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,470
But this cheese cannon.

855
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,700
Will not go unfired.

856
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,010
Please welcome America's favorite victim,

857
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,410
Vicky sicowitz!

858
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,010
Out from the shadows,

859
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:06,880
Riddled with disease,

860
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:11,650
Comes one very brave young girl.

861
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,290
Hello.
I am Vicky sicowitz...

862
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,060
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

863
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:22,230
... And it is an honor
to fire your cheese cannon.

864
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,470
Hold your fire!

865
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,140
What's this?
West appleton.

866
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:33,640
Seems to be rife with intrigue.

867
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,110
Hello, everybody.

868
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,980
Boo!

869
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:42,880
Sonny Munroe will apparently.

870
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,950
Stop at nothing.

871
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,950
To steal the spotlight.

872
00:43:46,990 --> 00:43:49,490
From this courageous...

873
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,960
And contagious young woman.

874
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:55,360
Look, I know there's been a lot
of things said about me lately.

875
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,700
That may have you questioning who I am.

876
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:01,700
But I'm here to tell you
that I'm still the same honest.

877
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,400
Truthful girl that stood here a year ago.

878
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,540
And promised to come back.

879
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:09,140
And you know, here's
another promise that I kept:

880
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,150
Mr. Henderson,
here is your book report.

881
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,650
"the grapes of wrath"?

882
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,280
But I assigned you
"a raisin in the sun."

883
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,260
Vicky sicowitz,

884
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,760
Are you gonna stand for this?

885
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:28,360
Yes, Ryan, I am.

886
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,600
Because I have a confession to make.

887
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:35,100
Sonny Munroe didn't steal
this character from me.

888
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:38,110
I just made that up to get attention.

889
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:42,410
I tried to tell you.

890
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,780
She's the one who should be
firing the cheese cannon.

891
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,550
Really?

892
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,950
Yes.

893
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,090
That would be cool.

894
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,700
10, nine,

895
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,140
Eight, seven,

896
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,640
Six, five,

897
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,880
Four, three,

898
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:23,480
Two, one!

899
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:30,560
Going somewhere, Penelope?

900
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,630
I don't know what you're talking about.

901
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:34,630
Oh, your face may say Vicky,

902
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,830
But your ugly pilot shoes say Penelope.

903
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,240
Penelope?

904
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:46,010
This is like a bad episode
of "MacKenZie Falls."

905
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:50,010
Or a good one.

906
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:54,820
Tawni figured it out?
$2, 000 and three days of my life for nothing!

907
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:57,650
I don't deserve this coat.

908
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,190
I would have gotten away with it too.

909
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,920
If it weren't for these comfortable shoes.

910
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,290
Come on, let's go.

911
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:05,990
I'll wait for you.

912
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:08,460
Please don't.

913
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,970
Well, everybody, I think
we all owe Sonny Munroe.

914
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,840
A big West appleton apology.

915
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:16,070
Yeah!

916
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,470
Welcome home, Sonny.

917
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,540
Well, as I've been saying all along,

918
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:27,010
Sonny Munroe is the girl.

919
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,350
She said she was.

920
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,180
What?
Unbelievable.

921
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:34,390
Guys like this just lie and lie.
And nothing ever happens to them.

922
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,620
Don't let him spoil your moment.

923
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,130
Here you go, milady...

924
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,230
What's left of your real cheese ball.

925
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,130
Fire away.

926
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,730
Wherever there's injustice or betrayal,

927
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:48,840
I'll be there.

928
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:53,670
Reporting the full story
for "Tween Weekly TV, "

929
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,410
- I'm...
- Whoa!

930
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,250
... Coated with cheese!

931
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:18,530
I can't believe this!

932
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,530
That's a good look on you.

933
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:23,040
And a good taste.

934
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:25,510
Cut. Would you cut?
Turn it off.

935
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:26,770
Keep it rolling.
Keep it rolling.

936
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:31,580
From coated in sleaze to coated in cheese,

937
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:35,250
Looks like Ryan's done lying!

938
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,660
For "Tween Weekly TV, " I'm Tawni Hart.

939
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,700
Oh! Come on!

940
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,100

1
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:47,275
<i>Major. Hey, Major!</i>

3
00:01:49,694 --> 00:01:52,071
<i>What was that'? Virtual reality?</i>

6
00:01:52,113 --> 00:01:55,825
<i>I'm on vacation. Don't be so casual about entering my cyber lobby.</i>

8
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:59,662
<i>My condolences. There's been a terrorist bombing in Nishinouchi.</i>

11
00:01:59,704 --> 00:02:02,248
<i>The vies were an executive at a foreign-owned water company,</i>

13
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,418
<i>a Trade Ministry official, and a domestic weapons manufacturer.</i>

16
00:02:06,377 --> 00:02:08,838
<i>The top-priority entry in the terrorism prediction list</i>

18
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,841
<i>you gave Public Security was right on target.</i>

20
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:15,136
<i>I assume they were in a secret meeting to agree on water prices.</i>

23
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:17,764
<i>Everything's in smithereens, including some Foreign Affairs guards.</i>

25
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:21,601
<i>There was also an explosion at the Yamanote Dam, by the Way.</i>

27
00:02:21,643 --> 00:02:23,144
<i>The dam?</i>

28
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:27,940
<i>Dunno if it's related.</i>

29
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:30,193
<i>But it essentially belongs to a foreign-owned water company,</i>

31
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:33,363
<i>and there's a retired Trade official on staff</i>

34
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:40,453
<i>The bureaucrats' turf wars are intense in that industry.</i>

37
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:44,499
<i>So, who asked for us?</i>

39
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,876
<i>Section 9, as usual.</i>

41
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,880
<i>They failed to put your list to good use, but they did track the perps-</i>

44
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:54,175
<i>They say they can't secure 'em, though. Too outgunned.</i>

47
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,350
<i>Call everyone in. I'm coming too.</i>

50
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:04,519
Work calls?

51
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,856
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:13,528
Five hours, seven minutes. That's a record-length vacation for you.

56
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:18,908
Are you consulting for the police today? Or the Cyberbrain Development Bureau?

61
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:21,411
I'll make it up to you.

63
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:25,832
Don't forget what we talked about.

65
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:25,832
Are you serious?

66
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:26,999
Of course.

67
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:31,713
You should get going. All your customers are impatient types, right?

71
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:34,048
Yes.

72
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:39,721
<i>Wow, you've been with that guy for three months! That's a new record.</i>

77
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,019
<i>Don't be so casual about using that Ghost infiltration key.</i>

80
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:59,425
Your precinct lD'd him as Detective Naoharu Mizuki.

84
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,302
Is that right?

85
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:03,971
Yeah. He's my senior.

87
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:13,815
Is this all he had on him?

89
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,025
His holster was empty.

91
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:19,195
His piece must've been washed away or stolen.

94
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:22,365
It's hard to believe the gun under his jacket would get washed away.

97
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:25,493
And it'd be odd for someone to steal his gun but leave his wallet.

100
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,209
A prosthetics specialist...

101
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,338
He sure doesn't look cyborgized.

103
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,967
Lieutenant, your guys rounded up all the unclaimed property in the area, right?

106
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:43,219
Let's look for something else that ties back to him.

108
00:05:43,302 --> 00:05:45,304
You want me to be your errand boy?

109
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,974
If the darn incident was really an accident, yes.

111
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:52,019
Lieutenant! I found something odd.

114
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:56,524
What are these?

115
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:58,651
They look like prosthetics, but...

117
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,579
Mermaid's Legs...

119
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:17,753
<i>Report.</i>

120
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,551
Lots of injured cops. Six perps still going strong.

124
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:25,344
They're on their way to Ward 4.

125
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:27,930
They see right through the police strategy.

127
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:31,225
They secured an escape route ahead of time.

130
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,853
This group is highly trained.

132
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:37,273
They have a commander somewhere out there. Ishikawa!

135
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,860
<i>I picked up their line!</i>

136
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:47,366
The seventh one. This is their leader.

138
00:07:19,607 --> 00:07:23,152
This is a cutting-edge ghost lock. Don't waste time resisting.

141
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,822
<i>I'll make him order his friends to surrender.</i>

143
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,659
<i>Ishikawa, run a forced recognition program.</i>

145
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,576
<i>Roger.</i>

146
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:35,414
<i>Abort the operation. Throw down your guns and surrender</i>

149
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:40,670
<i>Repeat. Abort the operation and surrender.</i>

153
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,758
Huh?

154
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:50,096
Aw, no shootout?

155
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:54,016
I captured one!

157
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,187
Hey, you're pretty useful!

159
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:02,024
We got the last one.

160
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,860
Good. Hand them all over to Public Security.

162
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,864
A virus alert?

163
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:13,369
It's the man you captured!

164
00:08:28,217 --> 00:08:29,343
This pain...

165
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,060
The ghost lock released?

166
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,229
<i>Major?</i>

167
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,064
<i>Shit! Saito!</i>

168
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:47,486
<i>Don't kill him!</i>

169
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:17,433
No more of that!

170
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:26,108
<i>Damn, it feels gross having someone infiltrate my Ghost then the Major.</i>

175
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,610
<i>Truer words...</i>

176
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,029
Your fault for aiming for the head.

178
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:34,784
Don't hand them over yet. We'll take them to a lockup with cyber facilities.

182
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:36,786
You telling me to play interrogation partner?

183
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:39,371
I'm not interested in fake memories.

185
00:09:39,455 --> 00:09:41,207
Memories?

186
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,460
I'm interested in their contaminated Ghosts.

189
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:56,555
Sorry I had to call you down here.

192
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,308
It's my civic duty.

194
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:03,145
I understand you're in charge of the dam. Let's see...

197
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:07,149
Dr. Zhinzhee Bekka Arr Thied.

199
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:09,985
Please, call me Thied.

201
00:10:10,027 --> 00:10:12,738
You've got quite the tough-looking secretary.

203
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:14,657
He's very reliable.

204
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:19,495
The conflicts continue in the Republic of Kuzan, where you're from.

208
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:25,835
I hear the Qhardi ethnic minority in particular is still waging a war of independence.

214
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,087
It's a heartbreaking war.

216
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,756
You're Qhardi, correct?

218
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:36,679
Yes. Like the majority of my comrades, I wish for a peaceful solution.

223
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,849
So, the explosion at the darn...

224
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:42,518
I'm told it was a valve malfunction.

226
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:47,773
Your company sells water, right? For what type of use?

231
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:53,696
It's for precision machinery businesses. That industry relies on 100% pure water.

236
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:59,201
Precision machinery... Prosthetic manufacturing, for example?

239
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,201
Yes.

240
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,454
Chief...

241
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:05,040
You idiot!

242
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,544
The Trade Ministry got them invited to set up a plant here!

245
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:11,046
You want to make an enemy of the local precinct, too?

247
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,715
But...

248
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:19,805
Stop, that's evidence!

250
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:26,395
I'm very grateful to you for finding the goods stolen from our warehouse.

255
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,814
Please, take them with you.

257
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:29,815
Chief!

258
00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:31,400
Back off!

259
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,236
A detective died, sir.

260
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:36,238
You think I don't know that?

261
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,741
You go to Nishinouchi and get me information.

263
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,243
Nishinouchi? What's there?

264
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:45,497
A bombing, apparently by Qhardi terrorists.

268
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:48,417
Now listen: You consult your superiors before any moves on this case.

270
00:11:48,459 --> 00:11:49,335
Terrorism?

271
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:55,549
If the explosion was intentional, and he wasn't a victim...

275
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:56,926
What?

276
00:11:57,051 --> 00:11:59,261
Yes, sir! I'm on it!

278
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:04,099
Don't make any trouble!

280
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:13,192
They're a Qhardi weapons smuggling gang. I met them on an undercover op.

284
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:16,695
Their goal is to send weapons to their comrades back home.

287
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,114
They've got no reason to attack this country.

289
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,116
Their statements were crystal clear:

290
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:25,120
They're against the pricing agreement, so they bombed the meeting site.

293
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,915
Are you telling me those are planted memories?

295
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,709
I'm betting they're all infected.

297
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:33,796
And that the virus interfered with my ghost lock.

299
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:42,471
Well done. You subdued them brilliantly.

301
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:47,768
We could do it even more easily if you adjusted your comm standards to ours.

306
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,478
I read your report.

307
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,981
A false memory virus that can infiltrate, hack,

309
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:55,150
and brainwash simultaneously?

312
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,820
It's a self-destructing Stuxnet-type.

314
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,990
Other than the symptoms at its onset, it leaves no trace.

317
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:04,994
Electronic manipulation of memory is incredibly difficult.

320
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,329
No one in the world has been confirmed successful.

322
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:12,167
And yet past incidents tell us a maker and a broker clearly exist.

326
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:16,755
Yes. Somewhere out there is the super-wizard-class programmer

330
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:20,009
known as "Fire-Starter" who created this high-level cyber-virus.

333
00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:23,512
But until now, no organization in the world had uncovered his identity.

336
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,014
Did you?

337
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,849
A clue, anyway.

338
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:33,939
What's this?

339
00:13:34,023 --> 00:13:36,692
All the terrorists had the same tattoo.

341
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:42,031
It's a symbol used by Scylla, the hero who once led the Qhardi Separatist Army.

346
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:46,285
I've heard of him. Word is he's a master of cyber warfare.

349
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,037
Is he Fire-Starter?

350
00:13:48,162 --> 00:13:50,873
No way. He died during the war.

352
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:53,208
You're going to find out whether that's true.

354
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,378
I'll authorize limited access to Section 9's database.

357
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,047
Read the details there.

358
00:13:58,172 --> 00:13:59,381
That's all?

359
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,716
You're complaining?

360
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:05,721
I gave you all the Logicomas I have, plus our weapons and permission to use them.

364
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:10,392
Any lists I make are meaningless if the organization can't act.

368
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:11,727
And?

369
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:14,063
I want special authority and an approved budget.

371
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:20,069
And make your flimsy comm lines backward compatible with ours while you're at it.

376
00:14:20,069 --> 00:14:25,491
Enough! Your team isn't regulation size, and I'm graciously turning a blind eye!

381
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:28,410
This unit is standardized to the perfect specs.

383
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,079
We don't need more people.

384
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,998
Then the whole unit will go down the second you get hacked.

386
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:35,084
Just like those terrorists did.

387
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:38,712
Your "perfect specs" don't merit my trust.

389
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,508
If you want authority and a budget, get at least one more member

392
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:45,928
and accept cooperation from someone with different specs.

395
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,473
If they won't give us money, we're stuck in this garbage dump for a while.

399
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,772
I'm just glad we've got a lab to use.

401
00:14:58,232 --> 00:15:03,112
Yeah, high prosthetic performance takes superior maintenance...

405
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:09,284
We'll have to pay for upgrades out of pocket. Costs a lot, though.

409
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,956
Training ground instructors make pretty good money.

411
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:19,545
Top-quality maintenance facilities, authority - we'll get it all.

415
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,463
Stop wasting time bitching and solve our case!

416
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:23,966
His nationality's unknown.

417
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:27,386
He uses multiple bodies to conceal his identity,

420
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:30,806
earning the name Skulla, aka Scylla.

423
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:33,809
That's the name of a monster from Greek mythology.

425
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:37,896
A pro at warfare who led a separatist army, and wiz hacker...

428
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,566
Huh, his specialty is tunnel ops.

430
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:41,984
"Tunnel ops"?

431
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,986
That's when you bomb someplace's lifelines

432
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:47,072
and then infiltrate them electronically during their restoration.

435
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:51,827
Ultimately you wage a destructive cyber-attack from inside their defenses.

439
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:56,165
The forces who tried to prevent independence took a major hit instead.

443
00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,002
But Kuzan joined forces with advanced nations

446
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:02,671
to manipulate the Qhardis in order to contain its neighbors.

448
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:07,176
It was a throwaway war of independence, and this country was especially involved.

452
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:09,678
No one recognized the Qhardis' independence after the war,

454
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,347
and the guerillas were disbanded and slaughtered.

456
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:14,475
But their dead leader was actually alive,

458
00:16:14,475 --> 00:16:18,687
and he developed a special virus ahead of all the world's research institutions,

462
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:22,357
then changed his name to Fire-Starter and began his revenge...

465
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:24,818
I follow the logic, but is it really possible?

467
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:29,198
In a conflict zone, you can do all the human experimentation you want.

471
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:30,824
It's no wonder, really.

472
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,368
Scylla is dead.

474
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:35,329
A successor of his, then?

475
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:39,708
Either way, the broker isn't peddling it without knowing what it does.

479
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:44,880
So he wanted to use those guerrillas to repeat his old tunnel operation here?

484
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:49,843
It bothers me that no one was carrying a detonator.

488
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,720
Borma, check out the crime scene.

489
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,721
Roger.

490
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:57,559
Paz, you and Saito pay the gang a visit. I want to know who trained them.

494
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:00,729
Batou and Ishikawa, you look into the possibility of a tunnel op.

497
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:03,357
Do you plan to dive into the guerillas' cyberbrains

499
00:17:03,357 --> 00:17:05,234
looking for the virus?

500
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,696
I'll get a tune-up on my body first.

502
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:14,910
A tune-up?

503
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:18,247
It's her boyfriend. He's an ex-military prosthetics tech.

506
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,915
No, isn't he a Navy sailor?

507
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,750
That was the last one.

508
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:22,918
They fought on a date,

509
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,546
and she kicked his ass hard enough to put him in the hospital.

511
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:28,590
What about that rich one from the Cyberbrain Bureau?

512
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,926
He didn't last two weeks.

514
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:33,720
So this is the sixth in six months? She's got a sickness.

516
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,349
No, it's instinct. I never sleep with the same woman twice either.

519
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:40,269
Because you always end up a hostage or a target for revenge?

521
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,271
No, because it's my policy.

522
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:45,941
At least do background checks on them! What if one of them's a trap?

525
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,610
It's better than hearing, "I want a family".

527
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:50,946
Yeah, after all, you could die at any time.

529
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,782
This is no job for a family man.

531
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,958
So the late detective's gun wasn't found?

534
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,460
If Detective Mizuki had fired his weapon,

536
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:08,463
it would prove this was a crime, and not an accident.

538
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:11,133
You think someone wanted it to look like an accident?

540
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:15,304
The cause of death was drowning, but he lost a lot of blood antemortem,

544
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:18,307
and some of his bones are missing.

546
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:24,313
So the body's too damaged to tell, but he may have been shot.

551
00:18:24,313 --> 00:18:27,649
Detective Mizuki was investigating weapons smuggling.

554
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:30,652
His most recent meeting was with a Qhardi organization.

556
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:34,489
I suspect he was killed because he found proof.

559
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:40,162
You feel the dam explosion was intentional, set up to bury evidence?

564
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:42,831
You've got a great imagination.

566
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,167
You're turning me down, sir?

568
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,128
No, I like it. I'll allow you to investigate.

570
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:51,673
Try to find a connection between the incidents.

573
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:55,135
All alone?

574
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,135
You're complaining?

575
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,803
I appreciate it, sir!

576
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:04,019
Humans can never perfectly reproduce movements.

579
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:09,149
A slight slope, our distance from our target, a few milligrams' weight difference...

584
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:13,987
The brain calculates all these things to create yet-unknown movements.

588
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,031
You have the most original brain I know of,

590
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,867
and you understand the beauty of uniform standards.

592
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,371
You're exaggerating.

593
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:25,207
There's nothing wrong with you.

595
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:26,708
It still hurts?

596
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,713
Try moving your right leg.

598
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:35,550
Lovely.

599
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:38,178
What's "lovely"?

600
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,721
Your leg.

601
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,394
The pain is gone now.

603
00:19:45,477 --> 00:19:47,229
Send me a bill.

604
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:50,565
I'll give you a discount. In return, don't forget our promise.

607
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:52,234
You're a strange man.

608
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,902
Not as strange as you.

609
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,711
Hey, you. You're blocking my scan.

611
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:12,254
Oh, sorry.

612
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,091
What good are your natural eyes in the cyber age?

615
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:19,094
It's not normally this hard to find the epicenter.

617
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:22,097
You know a lot about the combustion process?

619
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,725
I learned the basics overseas during the war.

621
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:25,934
I see.

622
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,437
Are you a full cyborg?

623
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:31,231
Yeah, pretty close.

625
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:35,235
I'm no expert, but unless you get a specialized skeleton,

628
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,279
aren't the basics the same as a human body's?

630
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:41,450
But his hands stayed open after he burned...

633
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,452
When a natural human burns to death,

634
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:47,289
his muscles contract, so he forms fists and he bends forward.

637
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:50,250
The fetal position, or, you know, the boxer's pose.

639
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,295
Heat rigor? Well, what about it?

642
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:59,468
This guard's corpse is standing up straight, hands open.

648
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:02,804
Must be some property of his prosthetics, or of the bomb.

651
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,264
Prosthetics?

652
00:21:10,604 --> 00:21:12,147
Hello?

653
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,484
Oh, a checkup?

655
00:21:15,484 --> 00:21:16,985
Two weeks?

656
00:21:17,778 --> 00:21:21,323
Got it. No, I'm working right now, sorry.

659
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,450
"Checkup"?

660
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,661
Sorry to bother you.

661
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:39,132
C-4 and dynamite, glycerin, and chemical fertilizer...

664
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:42,177
It's a hideout straight out of a book.

667
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:49,017
Definitely a bomb maniac vibe... but I've got no clue what they actually used.

673
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:51,353
<i>Orders coming down their line!</i>

675
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:54,689
Someone calling himself Scylla just ordered some "Second Army" into action.

678
00:21:54,773 --> 00:21:57,692
Damn bastards! Public Security's moves are being leaked!

680
00:22:03,824 --> 00:22:06,868
<i>The Waterworks Bureau's server blew, and took out the whole floor.</i>

683
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:08,328
<i>What did they use?</i>

684
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:09,996
<i>The accelerant at the Nishinouch crime scene</i>

685
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,333
<i>is spread all the way to the ceiling, even the ducts.</i>

688
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:17,712
<i>We're talking omnidirectional blast. The air itself blew up.</i>

692
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,172
<i>A fuel-air explosive?</i>

693
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:24,177
Then this is a dummy hideout. They've got a more advanced bomb lab somewhere.

697
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:32,060
Damn guerrilla hero is issuing a challenge.

700
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:43,738
<i>The Waterworks Bureau is starting repairs. Odds are the hacker's already in!</i>

705
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,574
<i>Figure out their next target.</i>

706
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:47,742
<i>Don't let them dig any more tunnels.</i>

708
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:10,056
I appreciate your cooperation.

710
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,267
I'm used to police questioning.

712
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:15,270
There've been a lot of prosthetics thefts recently.

714
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:18,732
"Mermaid's Legs", eh?

717
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:21,902
Not a very artistic name, but it's easy to understand.

720
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:24,112
My female customers quite like it.

722
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:26,239
Do you recognize these legs?

724
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,952
They appear to be the mass-production model.

726
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:32,621
Look at the tag.

727
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,916
"Ariel".

728
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:39,461
I've asked around, and there's no such model on the market.

731
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:43,924
I don't carry it, either. It must be a licensed designer's brand name.

735
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:46,259
Designers use the mass-production model as a base

737
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,428
and then innovate to meet customer demands.

739
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,639
Any ideas?

741
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:55,268
I'll give you my list. One moment, please.

745
00:23:55,268 --> 00:23:56,269
Thank you.

746
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:09,282
Cops love lists. He'll be conveniently absorbed in it for a while.

749
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:11,993
Public Security took our dummy safe house.

751
00:24:12,077 --> 00:24:15,455
Are the comm lines here safe, Colonel Hozumi?

754
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:18,667
Don't worry. It's one of intelligence's independent lines.

757
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,294
Why haven't you killed that detective?

759
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:24,506
He's an odd duck, but he doesn't have any powerful backers.

762
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,675
The real issue is that Ariel's been leaked.

764
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,971
We retrieved the sample before it was analyzed, and the factory is taken care of.

768
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:33,348
I didn't expect you to panic and blow it up.

770
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:39,688
We're lucky Ariel was mounted in time. You almost seriously hindered our plan.

776
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:45,652
Ariel is a way to smuggle explosives to the Qhardis! It's not for suicide bombers!

781
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:47,529
Circumstances have changed.

782
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:51,032
If previous overseas weapons development becomes domestic,

785
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:53,535
distribution channels will vanish.

787
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:55,870
The Qhardi soldiers are just sacrificial pawns?

789
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:01,042
We're upgrading. Fire-Starter can create all the soldiers we want.

794
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:04,004
Get the unit that was arrested released.

796
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:06,715
I won't give you the data until then.

798
00:25:06,715 --> 00:25:09,509
They aren't even your compatriots.

800
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:12,178
Scylla would never abandon them.

802
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:18,018
Very well. There are three more usable Ariels.

806
00:25:18,018 --> 00:25:21,354
One of them is in your court.

809
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:23,523
It really has to be her?

811
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:27,736
Have you developed feelings for her? Activate the woman's Ariel.

815
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,864
Release our allies first. Understand?

818
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:57,766
Ride with me.

819
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:07,567
You haven't told anyone that you and I killed Scylla, I trust?

822
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:08,568
No.

823
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:11,279
That op is a stain on both our records.

825
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,948
It would be highly inconvenient for it to come up again now.

827
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:18,578
I see you dived happily into the power games as soon as you made LTC.

831
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:22,749
They used the military-industrial complex to profit from death.

835
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:25,919
I'll wipe them out, make domestic weapons engineering big,

838
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,880
and shut down their trade routes to foreign cartels.

840
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,758
Lt. Col. Mamuro wanted that.

842
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:34,260
I won't play your game.

844
00:26:34,344 --> 00:26:39,974
Scylla is a game you can't quit. She has to stay dead.

849
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:42,769
You used this before.

851
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:46,314
Bury it and whoever's using Scylla's name - permanently this time.

854
00:26:46,397 --> 00:26:49,943
Or else the brass will bury you, and that op with you.

857
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:01,788
Becoming independent of the system doesn't make you free.

860
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:06,793
You're like last century's programmers, who expected too much from the birth of the Net.

864
00:27:06,876 --> 00:27:10,463
Even Section 9 is only letting you have your own way to test you.

867
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:13,007
When they need to, they'll restrain you with a Ghost infiltration key

869
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,676
and dispose of you.

870
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:18,012
I have no intention of letting anyone infiltrate my Ghost again.

873
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:20,014
No matter who they are.

874
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:29,357
That woman is Motoko Kusanagi?

876
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,694
Yes, your senior. Can you win?

879
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:37,657
If you wish.

880
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,643
You really came?

881
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:07,729
I did promise.

882
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,523
I haven't prepared anything.

883
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,066
I figured.

884
00:28:18,323 --> 00:28:20,992
But first, we'll take care of this.

886
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:37,258
I checked out the Qhardi gang, but there's no trace of their tactical commander.

890
00:28:37,342 --> 00:28:41,221
Ah, but I've got the rental server they used.

893
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:43,431
Multiple invaders into a public facility...

895
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,725
Bastards have made good progress on their tunnels.

897
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:47,852
<i>Do you know where they're going yet?</i>

899
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:50,438
<i>It's someplace to do with water and precision machinery.</i>

901
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:53,399
<i>70 places in the city fit that description.</i>

903
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:55,777
<i>Check them all.</i>

905
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:59,948
Damn... I'd make easier money being an Intelligence subcontractor.

909
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:03,117
<i>So, still in your ”tune-up”?</i>

911
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:05,453
<i>Yes. I'm dropping this connection for a While.</i>

913
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:11,793
I can hear noise. Your coworkers are in and out of your lobby nonstop, huh?

918
00:29:11,876 --> 00:29:13,711
I ran them all off.

919
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:17,465
You think I'll ever get to be in your lobby?

922
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:20,051
If you work with me.

924
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:22,929
If I said I needed one more person, would you come?

926
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:28,268
Tuning you up whenever I want is an attractive proposition,

929
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,105
but I don't get involved with the military or the police.

932
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,648
Oh.

933
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,444
I did some first aid on your sensory components.

935
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:41,072
Let's do the detail work in the lab.

937
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:44,659
The pain is gone. I'll do the rest myself.

940
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:50,748
Then let's get started.

941
00:29:57,255 --> 00:30:00,633
I remember when I first met you, you know.

944
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:05,513
All the other engineers said you were the queen of customer complaints.

948
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:08,683
Is that why they handed me off to a freelancer like you?

951
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:12,937
Nope. The truth is, I asked them to.

954
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:21,195
<i>You couldn't decide whether you should treat your body as a thing or a person-</i>

961
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,448
<i>That made me interested in you.</i>

963
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,164
At the facility I was in before,

964
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:35,335
they thought I was an oddball for wanting to sleep in a bed and take showers.

968
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:38,379
When I was prosthetized on the battlefield, they told me,

971
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:43,009
"A cyborg doesn't need everyday life; he needs equipment."

975
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:46,179
That's why I switched to prosthetics engineering.

978
00:30:46,262 --> 00:30:49,349
I wanted to be a tech who'd treat cyborgs like humans.

981
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:55,897
<i>As a kid, they gave me everyday-living training outside the facility.</i>

985
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,025
<i>So I'd learn how to be more human.</i>

988
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:03,821
<i>I don't really remember it. Everything was so bright...</i>

992
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:07,867
I remember I came back ahead of schedule.

995
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,873
But... That day I decided to make my body orthodox.

999
00:31:13,873 --> 00:31:16,000
I wanted to look human.

1001
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,837
Your prosthetic body isn't a thing. It's your real body.

1004
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:23,674
It mustn't be treated as a thing... not by anyone.

1007
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:26,552
Not by me.

1008
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:30,056
I do wish that were true.

1009
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:31,766
I'll show you proof.

1010
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,393
Proof?

1011
00:31:35,853 --> 00:31:37,730
It's a surprise.

1012
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:43,111
<i>We're missing the key piece, the bomb.</i>

1014
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:47,073
<i>How did they get it into a heavily guarded meeting place?</i>

1017
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:48,282
What about the perps?

1018
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:51,035
They say they're the ones who blew it up.

1020
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:54,247
Despite the fact that they have no memory of the bomb.

1023
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,750
They're fall guys. They probably have nothing to do with the bomb.

1026
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:01,879
We'll monitor all 70 locations until we can narrow down their target.

1030
00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:03,631
Are you serious?!

1031
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,758
Contact me if something happens.

1033
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:10,596
You're wearing heels.

1034
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,600
Should we assume the ex-military prosthetics tech is joining the team?

1037
00:32:18,146 --> 00:32:19,897
Maybe that's actually for real.

1038
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:34,245
This is what you wanted to show me?

1040
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:36,289
They're regular customers of mine.

1042
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:38,332
Their average age is 70.

1043
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,627
They're all full-body cyborgs...

1044
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:45,298
The affluent elderly are at the core of cyborg development these days.

1047
00:32:45,381 --> 00:32:46,966
Not soldiers.

1048
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:52,305
They want prosthetic bodies to give them second lives, and fulfilling lifestyles.

1053
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:56,434
More and more foods for cyborgs are being developed to meet their needs, too.

1057
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:05,485
Try it.

1058
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,499
It's good.

1059
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:22,168
Is it your first time allocating memory to your sense of taste?

1061
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:26,547
The new bride is pregnant, by the way.

1063
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:31,469
Exciting, isn't it? A new world of humans that don't distinguish

1066
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:32,470
between prosthetic and flesh.

1067
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,722
Between prosthetic and flesh.

1069
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:37,350
You really are strange.

1071
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:51,489
Some people reject the future. And some are left behind by it, too.

1077
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:58,913
I want to bring the cyborg future to the third world.

1080
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:03,084
Will you come with me?

1081
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:11,259
You should use your power freely, not work under a bunch of master manipulators.

1088
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:15,179
The war is over, you know.

1089
00:34:15,263 --> 00:34:16,931
No, it's still going.

1090
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:20,601
The nations it grew inconvenient for pulled out, that's all.

1093
00:34:23,604 --> 00:34:29,360
I have things to do in this country.

1096
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:29,360
I see.

1097
00:34:29,777 --> 00:34:31,571
Do you have free time later?

1098
00:34:31,696 --> 00:34:35,116
If we share a lobby, we can meet whenever we want.

1101
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:37,451
I might touch your Ghost.

1103
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:39,370
I'll let down my barrier.

1104
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:42,790
- Are you sure?
- If you infiltrate me, I may fry your brain.

1107
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:44,875
It might be worth it.

1108
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:09,817
This is your body.

1109
00:35:11,694 --> 00:35:13,738
These are your hands.

1111
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:41,015
Motoko, run!

1112
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:17,468
Akira!

1113
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:20,805
Are you all right?

1114
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,390
Yeah...

1115
00:36:30,606 --> 00:36:33,484
I'm sorry. This is my fault.

1117
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:14,900
My condolences.

1119
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:17,570
Paz is with Section 9 inspecting the scene.

1121
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,448
Your attacker was a pro, even if he did mess up.

1123
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:22,450
It's unclear whether this was tied to the bombing,

1124
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:25,619
but we'd normally give you police protection at this point.

1127
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:28,080
I don't need it. How is he?

1129
00:37:28,205 --> 00:37:30,458
We'll send him home as soon as we're done questioning him.

1131
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:33,794
I'll assign someone to him, so don't worry.

1133
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:33,794
I see.

1134
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:37,131
The military authorities won't give me any information on Scylla.

1137
00:37:37,214 --> 00:37:39,133
What's your connection to him?

1138
00:37:41,552 --> 00:37:44,096
Call me whenever you need help.

1140
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:49,435
Scylla's revenge, eh?

1141
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,939
Good thing your boyfriend's a civilian. We don't have to suspect a leak.

1145
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,443
<i>They got us.</i>

1146
00:37:57,568 --> 00:38:01,280
<i>Number Three - a materials control center on the coast.</i>

1149
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:05,618
<i>I picked up a go order in Scylla's name 30 seconds before the explosion.</i>

1153
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:09,121
<i>Then the whole line disappeared. At this rate, there's no point in surveillance.</i>

1156
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:12,833
<i>Find a weapons engineer on their customer list who's connected to this.</i>

1159
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,335
<i>Weapons engineer?</i>

1160
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,962
<i>Get info from the first victims, too. Hurry up.</i>

1162
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,507
<i>Find something. The virus, the bombs, the tactical commander,</i>

1164
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:23,594
<i>where the messages from ”Scylla” come from, I don't care what.</i>

1167
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:30,142
How about you finally tell us why you're so sure Scylla's dead?

1172
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,685
Excuse me.

1173
00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:34,021
You!

1174
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:37,024
I was told I could find Major Kusanagi here.

1176
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:38,317
What is it?

1177
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:45,991
State your business.

1178
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:49,829
The list I got from him was a fake.

1181
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,039
And a detective working a weapons trafficking case

1183
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:55,000
was killed right after getting info from him.

1185
00:38:55,125 --> 00:39:01,841
Techs get blamed for prosthetics-related incidents all the time.

1191
00:39:01,966 --> 00:39:06,053
And the manager of the dam that exploded the other day...

1195
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:08,389
Hose outfitted her bodyguard, too.

1196
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:09,849
So what?!

1197
00:39:10,808 --> 00:39:14,395
How did you feel, watching your lover get attacked in front of you?

1200
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:19,525
You're angry at the perp, and you feel guilty.

1203
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:22,361
You think it was your fault he got attacked.

1205
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:29,410
He was the same way. Anger and guilt.

1209
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,579
He's hiding something.

1211
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:36,417
The dam, the dead detective, the prosthetics, and even you, Major...

1215
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,211
Everything links back to Akira Hose.

1217
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:44,925
You're just a cheap detective snooping around with flesh eyes!

1219
00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:47,052
Never show your face here again!

1221
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:52,933
Ouch.

1222
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:16,790
You're an idiot, Colonel!

1224
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:20,085
An attack barrier!

1225
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,795
Keep calm.

1226
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:24,798
If the domestic faction takes away your arms industry rights,

1228
00:40:24,882 --> 00:40:26,800
you'll be killed by the cartels.

1229
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:30,304
Yet you're in a rush to kill me off and steal my data?

1232
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:34,433
So, you act like a heavyweight, but you couldn't get my people released?

1236
00:40:34,558 --> 00:40:36,810
Where is the data?

1238
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:40,105
Our deal is over. I'm thankful for the info on her

1241
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:44,652
and for Scylla's revival, but I'm leaving this country.

1245
00:40:44,735 --> 00:40:45,986
You do the same.

1246
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:47,613
No need.

1247
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:57,957
We've successfully packaged the virus with cyberbrains.

1251
00:41:00,084 --> 00:41:03,671
We'll use your cyberbrain for the final upgrade.

1254
00:41:03,754 --> 00:41:06,465
Become Scylla, just like you wanted to.

1256
00:41:15,432 --> 00:41:18,811
"His hands stayed open after he burned", eh?

1259
00:41:39,707 --> 00:41:41,041
<i>It's just like the call said.</i>

1260
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:44,378
<i>Two Public Security officers killed, and Akira Hose's whereabouts unknown.</i>

1263
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:46,338
<i>The Major wasn't the target?</i>

1264
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:47,965
<i>Hey, look at this list.</i>

1265
00:41:48,382 --> 00:41:54,179
<i>It's only a guess, but i think the FAEs were the prosthetic limbs themselves.</i>

1270
00:41:54,221 --> 00:41:57,558
<i>There was another full-cyborg guard in that part of the building.</i>

1273
00:41:57,641 --> 00:42:00,853
<i>The limbs' admin records have the same signature on them...</i>

1276
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,858
What are you doing?

1278
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,195
Who is this man?!

1279
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:16,744
My attack barrier expands every second.

1281
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:18,912
If you don't want your brain fried, tell me!

1283
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:20,748
He'll die!

1284
00:42:20,873 --> 00:42:25,919
He gave us power... He's the new Scylla!

1289
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:31,842
It was like magic. A battle-learning program left to us by the dead Scylla...

1294
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:35,429
He gave it to my cyberbrain, along with the virus.

1297
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:39,933
I'd never been trained, but now I can fight even your people!

1301
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:41,935
Give me a name.

1302
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:46,190
Akira Hose! He's Japanese, like you!

1306
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,034
Hose escaped. Any idea where?

1308
00:42:57,076 --> 00:42:58,619
Why ask me?

1309
00:42:58,744 --> 00:43:01,288
What are your eyes looking at right now?

1311
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:06,085
Zhinzhee Bekka Arr Thied.

1313
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:12,132
She's boss of a Kuzan water company, and most likely the weapons ring's sponsor.

1318
00:43:12,508 --> 00:43:15,052
<i>So this is the tunnel exit!</i>

1320
00:43:15,094 --> 00:43:18,555
<i>A domestic weapons company - Harimadara Heavy Industries!</i>

1323
00:43:18,972 --> 00:43:22,476
<i>The execs are touring Factory One with the Senior Vice-Minister of Defense!</i>

1326
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:25,479
<i>Recommend a barrier, and give the data to Section 9.</i>

1328
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:28,440
<i>Paz, Borma, Saito, get over there.</i>

1330
00:43:31,068 --> 00:43:33,821
Call the bomb squad and a prosthetics tech.

1332
00:43:33,904 --> 00:43:36,657
A destructive cyber-attack is more than likely.

1334
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:43,831
What's the meaning of this, Chief Aramaki?

1336
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:45,666
Evacuate immediately.

1337
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:48,961
You and this facility are targets.

1340
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:50,754
Wh-What's going on?!

1341
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:56,176
It's a bomb! Run!

1342
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:04,351
- Damn.
- Shit!

1343
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:06,687
Paz, Borma! This way!

1345
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,025
Help me! Help me!

1347
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,703
<i>Crap, the fire's closing up my throat.</i>

1349
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:25,205
<i>Mine too. That was close.</i>

1351
00:44:26,206 --> 00:44:28,375
Vice-Minister, are you all right?

1353
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:30,002
I'm fine.

1354
00:44:35,424 --> 00:44:38,385
<i>- Logicoma.
- Yes, sir!</i>

1356
00:44:40,304 --> 00:44:42,014
That's one of our products...!

1357
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:47,227
Away from the windows!

1358
00:44:51,899 --> 00:44:54,234
That's all the info on Colonel Hozumi.

1360
00:44:54,401 --> 00:44:59,239
That's fine. We get a card, and you get a grace period.

1364
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:02,910
Please tell me what she has to do with Scylla!

1367
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:07,414
Find out from her. Your contaminated brain is intriguing,

1371
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:10,209
but I'm cutting our connection before the infection spreads.

1373
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:16,590
Goodbye.

1374
00:45:26,183 --> 00:45:28,060
Contaminated, eh?

1375
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:31,772
I'm being bankrupted by a special tax on foreign companies?!

1378
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:34,274
How can this be allowed?!

1380
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:36,860
It's the kind of thing the domestic faction would do.

1382
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:41,782
What do you plan to do? Kill the colonel?

1385
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:45,452
She's all washed up. And so are you and I.

1388
00:45:52,626 --> 00:45:55,254
Escape, and obey the domestic faction.

1390
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:59,633
Your company will be crushed under the pretext of this nation's taxes.

1394
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,969
You'll be killed by the cartels if you don't do something.

1396
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:06,598
<i>You okay, Major?</i>

1397
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:10,644
<i>No problems. You go with that detective and subdue the guards.</i>

1400
00:46:11,812 --> 00:46:15,148
<i>I'll take care of Saylla.</i>

1403
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:22,948
Jeez, so stubborn. That's a scary lady.

1405
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:31,164
What? A Mateba, in this day and age?

1407
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:34,668
What's wrong with that?! It's the gun I trust the most.

1410
00:46:45,262 --> 00:46:48,515
Blood traces. Someone was shot.

1413
00:46:54,855 --> 00:46:56,356
A bullet...

1414
00:47:14,374 --> 00:47:17,669
Ariel. So these are the prosthetic bombs.

1417
00:47:36,063 --> 00:47:40,484
That wasn't you just now. Who the hell infiltrated my vision?!

1421
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:42,402
Don't move!

1422
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:50,535
In that quagmire of a war, Scylla was the only soldier I could empathize with.

1427
00:47:50,577 --> 00:47:53,622
I've always wanted to ask you why he was killed.

1430
00:47:55,415 --> 00:47:59,586
You didn't kill Scylla. I finally realized that.

1434
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:06,259
Go home. Or your Ariel will activate.

1438
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:08,095
<i>Even I can't stop it.</i>

1439
00:48:33,954 --> 00:48:39,126
<i>What's going on here? That bastard infiltrated my vision exactly the way you do.</i>

1444
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:40,961
<i>Answer me, Major!</i>

1445
00:48:59,146 --> 00:49:02,482
What's taking the Army so long?! We'll all die like this!

1448
00:49:02,566 --> 00:49:04,317
<i>It's been seized.</i>

1449
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:07,320
<i>It won't stop until we shut down whatever it's packaged with.</i>

1451
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:09,156
<i>Transplanted memories.</i>

1452
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:09,990
<i>What?</i>

1453
00:49:10,282 --> 00:49:13,952
<i>The packaged cyberbrains are the virus's hosts.</i>

1456
00:49:13,994 --> 00:49:18,290
<i>They converted the tactical program I set loose in Qhardistan to memory.</i>

1460
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:19,624
<i>My COPY.</i>

1461
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:26,298
What the hell are you saying?!

1462
00:49:34,431 --> 00:49:35,849
Motoko.

1463
00:50:03,627 --> 00:50:07,714
I came after you, but in the end, you captured me.

1467
00:50:09,216 --> 00:50:12,010
It was my cyberbrain that was packaged.

1469
00:50:12,052 --> 00:50:15,388
If you pull the trigger, you and your comrades will be saved.

1472
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:21,561
What you fell in love with was this world.

1474
00:50:25,315 --> 00:50:28,902
Just keep on going, until the day you're betrayed.

1477
00:50:33,406 --> 00:50:35,742
Scylla...

1479
00:50:35,825 --> 00:50:37,744
I'm glad I met you.

1480
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:07,107
What?

1481
00:51:07,274 --> 00:51:08,942
It stopped...

1482
00:51:18,201 --> 00:51:19,411
It's ironic.

1483
00:51:19,452 --> 00:51:24,082
They manage to survive a world war, then get stuck in an endless one,

1487
00:51:24,124 --> 00:51:25,125
and finally end their own lives.

1488
00:51:25,125 --> 00:51:26,293
And finally end their own lives.

1489
00:51:26,459 --> 00:51:29,462
Apparently there's no other way they can stop.

1491
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:31,464
Weren't you the same?

1492
00:51:32,966 --> 00:51:35,302
Scylla was you.

1494
00:51:35,385 --> 00:51:38,930
You helped the separatist army, then faked your death.

1497
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:42,642
Later, the guerrillas you led were all killed.

1500
00:51:42,726 --> 00:51:46,813
I can see why you wouldn't want to remember that op.

1504
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:50,817
Since then, I've stopped switching bodies so often.

1507
00:51:50,984 --> 00:51:55,989
It gives me an identity crisis. I lose track of who I am...

1511
00:51:56,156 --> 00:52:00,493
...and then I want someone to tell me I'm not a robot.

1515
00:52:03,163 --> 00:52:07,500
<i>Is that why you insist on making original tweaks to your mass-production bases?</i>

1519
00:52:07,584 --> 00:52:11,630
<i>It's amazing you even managed to control so many bodies in such a short time.</i>

1523
00:52:11,671 --> 00:52:14,799
<i>I'm going to sleep a little. You can go.</i>

1526
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:16,676
<i>Call it cyborg solidarity.</i>

1527
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:20,347
<i>I'll keep watch and make sure they don't fit you with any sketchy parts.</i>

1530
00:52:20,513 --> 00:52:22,849
<i>All right, suit yourself</i>

1532
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,852
You could at least say "thanks"!

1533
00:52:29,773 --> 00:52:33,860
The bullet at the scene was fired from the lieutenant's gun.

1537
00:52:34,027 --> 00:52:36,821
I also found Mizuki's weapon at the lieutenant's home.

1539
00:52:36,863 --> 00:52:39,366
There was a huge deposit into his account, too.

1541
00:52:43,203 --> 00:52:46,039
Good work. You can go.

1543
00:52:57,884 --> 00:53:00,553
Arresting a fellow cop will make you some enemies.

1545
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:06,685
You'll be shot from behind by the guys at his local.

1548
00:53:06,726 --> 00:53:10,689
I'll be sure to watch my back. Did you come just to say that?

1551
00:53:12,232 --> 00:53:14,359
Will you join my team?

1553
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:18,822
It's an independent offensive unit with top priority.

1555
00:53:18,947 --> 00:53:21,741
Oh, excuse me.

1557
00:53:22,492 --> 00:53:24,244
Hello?

1558
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:27,372
What?! I thought it'd be another two weeks!

1560
00:53:27,414 --> 00:53:31,209
No, sorry, got it. I'll be right there.

1563
00:53:31,251 --> 00:53:35,380
This is big! Her water broke!

1566
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:37,674
We're gonna have a baby!

1568
00:53:37,799 --> 00:53:39,926
Just wait, I'll be right there!

1570
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:41,845
We'll talk another time.

1571
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:42,929
I'm coming now!

1572
00:53:46,224 --> 00:53:49,602
Natural, married, and a father?

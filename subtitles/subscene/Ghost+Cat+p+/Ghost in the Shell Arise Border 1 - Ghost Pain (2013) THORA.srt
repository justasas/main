1
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,750
I'm amazed we got permission to exhume the body.

2
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,840
It's backwards. They disregarded
our investigation by burying him to begin with.

3
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,740
Yes, sir. Still, a military cemetery...

4
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,850
It's ridiculously expensive to dispose of
a prosthetic body that can't be reused.

5
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,270
Thanks to their cost-cutting,
we can recover the cyberbrain.

6
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,160
Where are the engineers?

7
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,230
Drawing straws at HQ.

8
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,110
Apparently connecting to a dead criminal's
cyberbrain is "creepy".

9
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,090
We don't know yet that he's a criminal.

10
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,180
Chief Aramaki!

11
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,550
We'll check the contents,
then take it back to headquarters.

12
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,370
What are you waiting for?
Put it down!

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,420
Sorry, sir!

14
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,240
Don't open that coffin!

15
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,350
This is from your unit.

16
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,770
Are you military?

17
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,420
I'm Aramaki, with Public Security Section 9.

18
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,240
We're investigating
Lieutenant Colonel Mamuro's murder.

19
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,450
I'm seizing his cyberbrain
and prosthetic body as evidence.

20
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,470
He's also suspected of taking bribes,
and we're investigating that too.

21
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,980
Public Security has no right to ransack this
place.


22
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,400
We'll bury him again when the case is closed.

23
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,820
And how do I know you won't pull a cover-up,
or fabricate evidence?

24
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,670
The military is in the middle of
its first major shakeup since the war.

25
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,870
It would be more suspicious
if this only got an internal investigation.

26
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,890
If he were still with us,
Mamuro would have been the first to say so.

27
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,120
You knew him?

28
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,640
Yes, back when I was an Army man.

29
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,110
There's not a soldier in the world
more squeaky-clean than he was.

30
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,470
Your name and unit?

31
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,180
Major Motoko Kusanagi, Unit 501.

32
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,330
501? So you were his subordinate.

33
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,780
Open it up.

34
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,150
Can I ask your rank?

35
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,780
I was in the old Investigations Section.
That's all.

36
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,510
They sold off whatever wouldn't fit
in the coffin to a junk shop.

37
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,070
That's not his body!

38
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,050
Get down!

39
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,420
Finally back on base, you delinquent?

40
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,340
Why did you authorize Public Security's
involvement?!


41
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,590
Since I can't dismiss the possibility
that Mamuro was corrupt, I had no choice.

42
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,600
Unit 501 should be investigating this!

43
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,290
The higher-ups told us to stay out of it.

44
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,400
Someone set a trap at his grave.

45
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Ignore it.

46
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,420
His cyberbrain is gone!

47
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,070
This isn't the time to
stir up a hornet's nest.

48
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,370
Then you believe that
he was taking dirty money?

49
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,890
He got mugged downtown.
That much is fact.

50
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,520
Not an honorable death, but compared
to indictment, maybe he got lucky.

51
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,340
Thanks to him,
our letters of recommendation are on hold, too.

52
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,920
Concentrate on your work for now.

53
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,820
Work?

54
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,280
I distinctly remember asking you to
analyze that infected hardware.

55
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,750
Not possible.
I just got back to Japan today, you know.

56
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,310
True enough.

57
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,860
I'll do the assignment.

58
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,650
In return, give me leave to go off-base
and authorize direct debit.

59
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,170
Such a problem child.

60
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,930
I'm only going to find out who set the trap.

61
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,640
Very well.
I'll take care of it in Mamuro's place.

62
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,540
Thanks, Kurutsu.

63
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't forget your meeting with the brass.

64
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,210
Giichi Mamuro, member of
a special unit of the GSDA,

65
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,130
was murdered on the fifth of this month.

66
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,680
Lieutenant Colonel Mamuro is suspected of taking
large bribes...


67
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,680
Niihama police say the investigation into
his possible corruption is ongoing.

68
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,290
...while serving as a security official
in Harimadara's weapons export--

69
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,050
Access records of his movements
on the day of his death

70
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,160
and all data from city surveillance cameras.

71
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,980
He was tailed.

72
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,490
Scan anyone who traveled
the same route he did before time of death.

73
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,860
Three...

74
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,250
A fourth?

75
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,000
Three men and a mobile land mine
were following him?

76
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:20,090
Funds transferred.

77
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,220
Funds transferred.

78
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:22,300
Funds transferred.

79
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:22,380
Funds transferred.

80
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,470
Funds transferred.

81
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:22,550
Funds transferred.

82
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:22,590
Funds transferred.

83
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:22,670
Funds transferred.

84
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:22,800
Funds transferred.

85
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:22,920
Funds transferred.

86
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,010
Funds transferred.

87
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:23,050
Funds transferred.

88
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:23,130
Funds transferred.

89
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:23,180
Funds transferred.

90
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,260
Funds transferred.

91
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,340
Funds transferred.

92
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:23,380
Funds transferred.

93
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:23,470
Funds transferred.

94
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:23,550
Funds transferred.

95
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:23,590
Funds transferred.

96
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,680
Funds transferred.

97
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,910
What is this?

98
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,970
Any pain?

99
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,750
Not right now, no.

100
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,170
It's similar to the phantom pain
particular to cyborgs,

101
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,800
but that should not affect you.

102
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,400
Could be a bad contact
in your nervous components.

103
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,590
Any other abnormalities?

104
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,410
No.

105
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,060
We should do a full-body checkup to be safe.

106
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,310
Thank you, but I have a meeting to go to.

107
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,380
Goodness, you have visitors.

108
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,260
They announced themselves
as Public Security Section 9.

109
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,950
Say I'm not here.

110
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,580
As both a Special Cyborg
and a recognized wizard-class programmer,

111
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,170
new regulations apply to you
under the revised Weapons Act.

112
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:27,260
The Prosthetics Maintenance Rule now applies
to issuing identification,

113
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,890
possessing cash, opening bank accounts,
or other ownership of assets.

114
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,500
In Lt. Col. Mamuro's letter
on my reclassification,

115
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,830
he guaranteed my financial autonomy.

116
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:41,940
If he's proven corrupt,
he'll receive a dishonorable discharge,

117
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,800
and all such documents will be void.

118
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,340
You expect me to endure a position

119
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,760
where I have to file paperwork
every time I open my wallet?

120
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:53,830
The cost of prosthetic bodies far exceeds
standard health insurance payouts.

121
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:58,190
You ought to do your duty to the government
which guarantees your right to life.

122
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,900
This is the consent form for your monitoring
and custody post-restructuring.

123
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,710
Make an effort to understand your circumstances.

124
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,770
During the war,
Japan allocated a sky-high budget

125
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,230
to promote cyborg development.

126
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,050
Did they tell you to become
Army property to foot the bill?

127
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,800
There were large deposits
made to Mamuro's accounts.

128
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:37,600
But after his murder,
someone withdrew all that money.

129
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,350
What do you want?

130
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:44,520
Major Kusanagi, of Unit 501.
No criminal record.

131
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:48,260
You work with the Army and Public Security
as a special consultant.

132
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,490
You specialize in solving cybercrimes.

133
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:02,580
I request that you track down the missing money
and analyze the coffin records.

134
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,920
Since it's an official investigation,
you should get leave to go off-base.

135
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,190
What's the pay?

136
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,490
I'll give you the regular consulting fee,
as a civilian.

137
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,930
That'll be an issue, you know.

138
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:18,850
A soldier famous for his integrity being shot
to death in secret is a bigger issue.

139
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,320
Hey!

140
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,260
How dare you?!

141
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,950
Tomorrow morning,
I'll send you a liaison who'll double as a bodyguard.

142
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,600
Think she's in?

143
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,910
She's as in the dark as we are.

144
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,170
If she wants to be free,
she'll have to find out the truth.

145
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,880
Still don't want the 501 to investigate?

146
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,840
Make one wrong move,
and our unit could get dissolved.

147
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,890
Public Security offered me an assignment.

148
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,700
Will you accept?

149
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,160
Lend me a hand.

150
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,750
If you can't get it done alone,
you'll be at the end of the line.

151
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,610
No one else will be able to protect you then.

152
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,110
Being protected isn't what I learned to do here!

153
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,530
I learned to make the most of my strengths!

154
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,490
I'll grant permission for you to use Server 6.

155
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,240
Thanks.

156
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,940
Just don't forget the job I gave you.

157
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,380
List the people working on the case.

158
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,300
But this is clearly related to the LTC's mugging!

159
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,240
We know he met up with the prostitute.
We need a warrant for her cust--

160
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,790
It's military jurisdiction!
You keep out of it!

161
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,170
You just forget this case, you hear me?
That's an order!

162
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:53,240
Then what's a special investigator even for,
dammit?!


163
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:58,580
Mamuro was being followed.

164
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,990
What?!

165
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,200
Hey!

166
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,020
St-Stop right there!

167
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,780
There you are!

168
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,590
Well, if it isn't the little tomboy from the lab.

169
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,010
The one who infiltrated me... is in that car...!

170
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,640
Ow!

171
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,520
You fool! That makes you a deserter!

172
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,090
Stop, Raizo!

173
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,070
All right, Kusanagi?

174
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,450
Instructor Ibachi...

175
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,830
Don't think you can do whatever you want
just because you were Mamuro's favorite!

176
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,270
Your selfish actions put the whole unit in danger!

177
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,230
That's enough!
I'll be the one to lecture her.

178
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,410
That bitch only survived as a test subject.

179
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,180
The number is a fake.
He's a slippery customer.

180
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,090
We've proven there was an infiltrator, at least.

181
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,880
What does Kurutsu say?

182
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,340
"Ignore it."

183
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,150
Is your prosthetic body acting up?

184
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,930
I don't know.

185
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,600
Goodness, another visitor.

186
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,970
You've got a strange one here to see you.

187
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,130
What is this?

188
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,010
It uses signal lights?
How old is this thing?

189
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,870
Here, come with me.

190
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,200
Construct your learning base yourself.

191
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,230
Hello, nice to meet you!

192
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:55,170
I'm an autonomous-follower logistics system--
a "Logistics Conveyer Machine".

193
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,380
You're Section 9's "liaison
who'll double as a bodyguard"?

194
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,530
Chief Aramaki calls me a "Logicoma"!

195
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:07,160
You'll be receiving information through me,
Major Kusanagi.

196
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,790
No synching. Explain things orally or as data.

197
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:16,980
Um... Any Army case information on the group
identified as illicit arms dealers

198
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,070
would be very useful to Chief Aramaki
in tracking down a mobile land mine!

199
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,030
The Army? Arms dealers?

200
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,930
Yes, sir!

201
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,890
You disappear. I'll take it from here.

202
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,400
Order acknowledged!

203
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,420
Optical camouflage?

204
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,410
Stay here and guard my bike.

205
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,680
Right!

206
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,790
Come on, walk straight!
Look, we're almost there.

207
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,280
Hi there!

208
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,850
Come on in.

209
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,930
It's not even dinnertime,
and this guy's three sheets to the wind!

210
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,270
Get him something cold, okay?

211
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,620
Come on, get it together!
Sit straight!

212
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,220
I fold.

213
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,290
Gonna go hit the can.

214
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,000
Hey, no fair!

215
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,730
But you had a great hand!

216
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,670
There.

217
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,600
Warning! Warning!

218
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,990
Someone approaching, extremely close!

219
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,480
Don't move. Who sent you?!

220
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,810
Were you the ones who killed Lt. Col. Mamuro?

221
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:22,000
Huh? Are you Public Security?

222
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,670
Answer me!

223
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:29,660
First you check the Army database!
Code 24, Ops H2976...

224
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,780
...code name Paz!

225
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,640
You're undercover?!

226
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:39,250
Yeah, the group I'm in with was hired for a hit.

227
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,570
They said the target was a full cyborg

228
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:44,610
and his cyberbrain had to be destroyed,
so we'd use mobile land mines.

229
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,670
Three of 'em. And I'm talking military-grade.

230
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,630
Lt. Col. Mamuro's murder?

231
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,410
Who knows?
Apparently somebody beat our guys to it,

232
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,620
and we let the mines get away.

233
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,750
Where did the mines come from?

234
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,960
Maneuver Area 6.

235
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,590
That place is a joke.
Might as well set foxes to guard a henhouse.

236
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,570
Feel like proving it with me?

237
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,010
This ain't the best job,
but I can't just drop it.

238
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:19,140
I'd be in danger,
and I'd cause trouble for my CO.

239
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,270
Is your CO trustworthy?

240
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,040
Used to be.

241
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,460
I see.

242
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,360
Thanks for your cooperation.

243
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,890
I wish I had your freedom of movement.

244
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,570
You can't analyze it?

245
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,030
It might just be noise.

246
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:14,890
No full-body cyborg gets to leave
this organization and go independent.

247
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:19,330
You're just a girl with
a little talent for cyber warfare.

248
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:21,830
Mamuro's death was an inevitability.

249
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,290
Don't step out of line, or I'll take you out.

250
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,190
Kurutsu and Ibachi can't shield you from me.

251
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,010
An inevitability...

252
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,480
Their security's a joke, all right.

253
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,620
All that's left is to connect the dots...

254
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,960
Look, I've got authorization!
And all I'm gonna do is ask questions!

255
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,590
Take your complaints to the station.

256
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:54,760
Where does he get off?
It ain't like I've never been deployed, dammit...

257
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,580
This is bullshit!
They're not even he--

258
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:09,040
Ah, sorry. I'm a special investigator
with the Niihama police.

259
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,750
I was told I could find these two here.

260
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,920
I have some questions for First Lieutenant Moto
Seta


261
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,740
and Captain Amuri Noto here--

262
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,390
Thanks. You just connected some dots.

263
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:27,890
And I see some others just connected.
How about showing yourself?

264
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,940
Batou the Ranger?

265
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:41,410
Long time no see.
Gotta say I didn't figure you for this one.

266
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,850
What do you mean?

267
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:48,730
The man you killed seven days ago
was a comrade of mine!

268
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,380
I just got back to Japan three days ago.

269
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,230
Oh, really?!

270
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:19,400
I've told you your sleepless eye's weakness
is how easy it is to infiltrate.

271
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,100
Still afraid of taking friendly
fire out in the jungle?

272
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,640
I'm an electronic warfare specialist too!

273
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,790
I can't believe you infiltrated me
in the middle of a fight!

274
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:32,100
You're just about the only one who'd infiltrate
me.


275
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,000
So, why are you after me?

276
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,500
Don't play dumb!

277
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,780
You're the one who got this place's
mobile land mines!

278
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,010
What the hell?!

279
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,090
Wait!

280
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,190
Don't shoot! Run!

281
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,200
Don't!

282
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,550
Those guys aren't with you?!

283
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,440
Seriously, what are you talking about?

284
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,110
Hey, look!

285
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,760
They found us!

286
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,520
They want to eliminate us here.

287
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,640
And their excuse will be
"a training exercise accident"?

288
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,270
I can't stop 'em with this puny gun!

289
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,190
We'll just have to run!

290
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,910
Now we climb!

291
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,030
Climb this?!

292
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,600
Damn straight!

293
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,710
We'll hold them off, so get moving!

294
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,620
Okay, fine.

295
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,750
Hello!

296
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,480
What's that?!

297
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,570
We're surrounded.

298
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,150
I told you, move it!

299
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,530
I know, I know!

300
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,830
Get in!

301
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,400
I thought you "couldn't drop it"?

302
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,000
This makes a nice change of pace.

303
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,150
You asked the military police for help?

304
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,960
To escort a suspect.

305
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,130
What's this about?

306
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,580
This makes no sense.

307
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:41,860
First: the missing money went to
your account, Major Kusanagi.

308
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:46,470
And second: the bullet you fired
on the mobile land mine at the graveyard

309
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,360
matched the one that killed Lt. Col. Mamuro.

310
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,160
Seven days ago,
a prostitute here in town was shot to death.

311
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,810
The bullet matched the one
that killed Mamuro.

312
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:00,100
Mamuro had met with her,
and according to the other working girls,

313
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,090
he was asking questions about one of her clients.

314
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,800
Seven days ago, one of my fellow Rangers

315
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,530
was killed by a mobile land mine,
along with his family.

316
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,680
He'd been in contact with Mamuro, too.

317
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:20,600
And when I traced the land mine to its source,
it led me to the major here.

318
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,380
By the way, she says
she got back to Japan three days ago,

319
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:26,980
but Immigration records say it was seven days ago.

320
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,930
The three mines my group was supposed to use

321
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,220
were the same model as the one Section 9
dug up at the graveyard.

322
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,910
Assuming one of those three was buried
and another killed the Ranger,

323
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,600
there's one more left unaccounted for.

324
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,770
At the moment,
all the clues point to you murdering Mamuro

325
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,880
and stealing his money.

326
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:52,590
Right after I landed,
I got a message and an attaché case from him.

327
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:59,310
I'm sorry, Major Kusanagi.
I doubt I'll be in this world much longer.

328
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,770
I wanted to get justice.

329
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,730
I've left your recommendation in someone else's
care.


330
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:12,130
You're the most promising squad member I know.
I wish you luck.

331
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:17,200
In the case, I found data
on an internal weapons exportation racket...

332
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,810
...and this gun.

333
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:23,620
You've moved a lot of money in the past few days.

334
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,960
Who are you sending it to?

335
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,090
The widow of the man who raised me.

336
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:36,080
She's taken care of me since I was little,
but she's in a nursing home now.

337
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,850
What's her name?

338
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,680
What is this woman's name?

339
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,240
Phantom pain, huh?

340
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:02,080
Even after you mechanize your body,
your brain never forgets the original.

341
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,900
Pain in the ass.

342
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,210
I don't have an "original" body.

343
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,650
What?

344
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:11,210
Have you heard of Doctor Bakeru's
emergency medicine system?

345
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:14,010
That thing where someone
with a full prosthetic body

346
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,930
uses their life-support system
on somebody else?

347
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:23,520
The person who raised me used it on me
while I was in my mother's womb.

348
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:34,110
Supposedly a chemical weapon killed
a large number of civilians way back when.

349
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,120
A pregnant woman and the man assumed
to be her husband both died.

350
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,580
We don't even know their names.

351
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,770
Because someone with that particular lifesaver
happened to be on the scene,

352
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,000
the fetus's brain alone survived.

353
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,960
You're saying you were made a full cyborg at
birth?!


354
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,420
I lack any memory of a body.

355
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:57,930
So perhaps you could call this "ghost pain",
created by false memories.

356
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,810
This is surveillance footage from Maneuver Area 6.

357
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,360
Your subordinate is in it.

358
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,090
If you refuse to hand her over,

359
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:16,490
I'll present you with a summons signed by
the Defense Minister himself.

360
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,450
I'll submit a written report at a later date.
I can't hand her over.

361
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,140
Vixen.

362
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,410
I'll make you regret this.

363
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,780
That's Shujiro Kanzaki.
He's in charge of Maneuver Area 6,

364
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,660
and he leads a team of special agents.

365
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,600
He's also the Army's dirty go-between with
the Ministry of Defense.

366
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:46,290
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

367
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,960
What's wrong?

368
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,710
It's nothing.

369
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,170
It's been empty from the beginning?
Then where's the gun?!

370
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:16,150
Why did I think there were
whistle-blowing documents in it?!

371
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,650
And the lieutenant colonel...?

372
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,150
What's real?

373
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,860
What's the truth?

374
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,520
Where's the lieutenant colonel's cyberbrain?

375
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,230
Wait, Kusanagi.

376
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,130
Calm down.

377
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:02,570
The hardware Kurutsu had me analyze
matched his Net synch pattern.

378
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,990
He and I were infected
with the same virus, weren't we?

379
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,620
With something hypothesized
to be a cyber-virus.

380
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,120
We speculate that it's
a self-destructing Stuxnet-type

381
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,850
which causes unknown dysfunction.

382
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,170
"Unknown dysfunction"...
You mean false memories.

383
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,840
It was purely a hypothesis.

384
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,970
At least, until we checked into your behavior.

385
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,990
I just got back to Japan today, you know.

386
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,660
True enough.

387
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,790
When did I come back to Japan?

388
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:34,170
Approximately 180 hours ago.
In other words, seven days.

389
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:39,710
And yet you continue to claim it was
another day altogether.

390
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,010
Route of transmission?

391
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,510
It must have been contact with Mamuro's
cyberbrain.


392
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:46,260
Which is still with his prosthetic body.

393
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:49,390
His coffin was a trap.

394
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,060
And the records Public Security got of his
burial show no signs of tampering.

395
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,920
So that's how it is...

396
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,880
Logicoma, synch with me.

397
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,280
Are you sure?

398
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,720
Just get on with it.
Record my field of vision and play it back in real time.

399
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,740
Roger!

400
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,750
I see things that shouldn't be there.

401
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:26,430
I don't see things that should be there.

402
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,660
Here, the whole time...?

403
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,410
"Special agent" "The LTC is innocent"

404
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,480
This is a warrant for Major Kusanagi's arrest.

405
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,900
Surrender her immediately.

406
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:27,070
"Special agent" "The LTC is innocent"

407
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,300
What happened to this room?!

408
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,530
The records weren't tampered with.

409
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:52,830
They just buried the truth under a lie.

410
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,570
I've found it...

411
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,410
My reality.

412
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,150
Drive.

413
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:56,680
The lieutenant colonel
came to you to blow the whistle.

414
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,350
Didn't he, Mr. Sadamoto, Vice-Minister of Defense?

415
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,440
Yes.

416
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,690
But you ordered a cover-up.

417
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,940
Because it couldn't be made public!

418
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,640
We ignored treaties and sold arms to
Third World countries during the war

419
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,950
to relieve its financial burden on us.

420
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,430
That's governmental weapons smuggling!

421
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:17,980
Harimadara was at the center of it, and as their
security official,


422
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,620
Vice-Minister, what's the matter?

423
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,390
Lt. Col. Mamuro found out about the illegal trade.

424
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,800
Vice-Minister!

425
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,500
What is it?

426
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,080
Do you realize how much

427
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,080
He's in danger!

428
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:26,040
the missile business has helped
our country's finances?!

429
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,730
The lieutenant colonel learned of
your cover-up and investigated.

430
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:32,700
The prostitute you frequented.
The Ranger who escorted you.

431
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,640
When he got info from them,
he decided to blow the whistle on you.

432
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,270
So you ordered Captain Kanzaki to kill him.

433
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,960
I just ordered him to solve the situation!

434
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,710
Yes, a few people suffered,
but I don't know who killed Mamuro.

435
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:50,590
Hell, maybe he really was mugged.

436
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,130
You claim even you don't know?

437
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,200
No, and I don't want to!

438
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,870
That arms dealing will be purged
during restructuring anyway,

439
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:01,260
and we're deliberating next-generation weapons
to replace missiles.

440
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:06,270
But this mess kills the job Harimadara has
lined up for when I leave office!

441
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,880
You're quite the chatterbox.
A desire to confess?

442
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,610
Maybe so. Either way, you'll never tell anyone!

443
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,000
Stop!

444
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,920
Someone help!

445
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,540
Should've blown him away.

446
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:45,140
Wasn't being more than a killing machine
the whole point of getting out?

447
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:48,610
In the end, I had no place to go.

448
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:52,880
They traced us through the remote control.
They're coming.

449
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,240
You go on. They're mine.

450
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,910
There are two of them.

451
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:01,220
Fine with me.
We'll see who's the better killer.

452
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,270
Take care.

453
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,080
You too.

454
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:14,240
I hate to say it, but they're not
the only ones to benefit from his death.

455
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,260
Yes. Thank you.

456
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:23,580
You're the ones who killed the lieutenant colonel!

457
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:00,610
I warned you that if you stepped out of line,
I'd take you out.

458
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,380
That's enough of that.

459
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:50,120
You've reached your limit, Kusanagi.

460
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,440
Raizo and Ibachi were luring the enemy here
with the money as bait.

461
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,470
We've eliminated six spies.

462
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:07,860
That's plenty.

463
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:15,600
Kanzaki funneled money into Mamuro's account,
I moved it... and you used it.

464
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,330
That's right.

465
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:22,150
The gun used on the prostitute was
the beginning of the enemy plot.

466
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:29,260
Blowing up the Ranger, the phony bribery...
All the blame was placed on Mamuro.

467
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:36,940
And he intended to bring
the Vice-Minister down with him.

468
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,440
It was the worst possible choice.

469
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:45,650
Unit 501 would have gone on the Army purge list
in retaliation for the scandal.

470
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,640
So you let him die. All of you.

471
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:14,850
If it weren't for the memory virus,
maybe we could have saved him.

472
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:19,020
But as things stood, the only option was to secure

473
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:23,900
Mamuro's cyberbrain, the mine,
and the money before he got blown up.

474
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:35,160
But what neither we
nor the enemy accounted for was you.

475
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:42,330
As soon as I arrived and got the data,
I went after the lieutenant colonel.

476
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:58,850
And you were infected by his cyberbrain.

477
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:16,080
Even as you gathered the evidence,
you were continually losing memories.

478
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,060
"The LTC is innocent"

479
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,540
What organization developed the virus?

480
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:27,550
Unclear. All we know is that
a foreign broker brought it here

481
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:31,400
and that people call it "Fire-Starter".

482
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,300
Was it a foreign power
that cooked up the scandal?

483
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:38,890
Our enemy is the global
military-industrial complex itself.

484
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:41,940
What would dragging down
one vice-minister accomplish?

485
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:45,860
Did you take the disc he left me?

486
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,400
I did that to protect you.

487
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,960
You used me as bait for the enemy!

488
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,950
I did that to protect the organization.

489
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:54,410
Why did you stand back and watch him die?

490
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:56,620
I did that to protect myself.

491
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:11,590
You stick with me, Kusanagi.
I'll build a future for you.

492
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:23,160
The pain is gone now.

493
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:30,190
Section 9 and the review committee

494
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:33,650
have formally cleared Lt. Col. Mamuro of
suspicion.


495
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:38,800
Thus, as his recommendation was renewed
by a third party, we will implement it.

496
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,370
Due to your excellent record, we also grant you
the post-reorganization major rank.

497
00:49:43,370 --> 00:49:47,540
In addition, in accordance with the will
of your late legal guardian,

498
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,920
you'll receive a testamentary trust.

499
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:53,460
It's an inheritance from the person who raised
you.


500
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,550
A portion of it is earmarked for
the purchase of your prosthetic body.

501
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:59,300
Which means that your body is now your property,

502
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,370
and is outside Army jurisdiction.

503
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,580
You're quite sure about this?

504
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,100
The virus may be an unknown,

505
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:11,440
but we've identified the architecture
of the false memories.

506
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,730
Do it.

507
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:16,380
Very well. We'll attempt memory eradication.

508
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,410
Will you go?

509
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,350
Yes.

510
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,370
Make sure to pay your respects to your parents.

511
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,190
Thanks.

512
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:23,030
I'm going.

513
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,470
We'll find a replacement.

514
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:55,880
Want a ride?

515
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:59,450
Consider it my thanks for telling us
the location of Mamuro's cyberbrain.

516
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,260
I'll take the bus.

517
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,340
Then I'll just give you the results.

518
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:07,930
Captain Kanzaki was replaced.
Mr. Sadamoto will be tried in closed court.

519
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:12,100
I promise to make the lieutenant colonel's
findings public one day.

520
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:18,990
I see. By the way-- are you the one
he gave my recommendation to?

521
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:23,030
Hard to say.
A man in my position gets a lot of those.

522
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:24,990
In fact, one of them outlined plans

523
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:29,520
to create a new special unit within
the international rescue team.

524
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,290
I'd like someone who's got experience
as a special consultant.

525
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:39,260
Intriguing, but I don't want to work
under a man who digs up people's graves.

526
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:43,220
You dug up something even deeper.

527
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:47,330
If you're serious about going independent,
you should have your own team.

528
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:55,580
The regulations say a unit needs
a minimum of one commander and six members.

529
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,170
I'll keep that in mind.

530
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:05,370
May it be a team not for defense of self or state,
but for taking the offensive.

531
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,420
Six people, huh?

532
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:35,220
Hmm, whom shall I scout...?

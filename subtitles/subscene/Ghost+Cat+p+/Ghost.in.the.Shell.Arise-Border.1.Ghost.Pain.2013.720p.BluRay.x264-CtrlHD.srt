1
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,714
I'm amazed we got permission to exhume the body.

2
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:50,760
It's backward. They disregarded
our investigation by burying him to begin with.

3
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:55,389
Yes, sir. Still, a military cemetery...

4
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:59,769
It's ridiculously expensive to dispose of
a prosthetic body that can't be reused.

5
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:03,230
Thanks to their cost-cutting,
we can recover the cyberbrain.

6
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,774
Where are the engineers?

7
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,194
Drawing straws at HQ.

8
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:12,073
Apparently connecting to a dead criminal's
cyberbrain is "creepy".

9
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:14,617
We don't know yet that he's a criminal.

10
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,243
Chief Aramaki!

11
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:18,788
We'll check the contents,
then take it back to headquarters.

12
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:27,379
What are you waiting for?
Put it down!

13
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:30,424
Sorry, sir!

14
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:33,969
Don't open that coffin!

15
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,748
This is from your unit.

16
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,962
Are you military?

17
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:19,385
I'm Aramaki, with Public Security Section 9.

18
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:23,264
We're investigating
Lieutenant Colonel Mamuro's murder.

19
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:25,808
I'm seizing his cyberbrain
and prosthetic body as evidence.

20
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:30,479
He's also suspected of taking bribes,
and we're investigating that too.

21
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,940
Public Security has no right to ransack this place.

22
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:35,317
We'll bury him again when the case is closed.

23
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:38,779
And how do I know you won't pull a cover-up,
or fabricate evidence?

24
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:43,075
The military is in the middle of
its first major shakeup since the war.

25
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:47,830
It would be more suspicious
if this only got an internal investigation.

26
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:51,417
If he were still with us,
Mamuro would have been the first to say so.

27
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,085
You knew him?

28
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:55,671
Yes, back when I was an Army man.

29
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:59,591
There's not a soldier in the world
more squeaky-clean than he was.

30
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:06,473
Your name and unit?

31
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,187
Major Motoko Kusanagi, Unit 501.

32
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:17,776
501? So you were his subordinate.

33
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,697
Open it up.

34
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,116
Can I ask your rank?

35
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,702
I was in the old Investigations Section.
That's all.

36
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:31,540
They sold off whatever wouldn't fit
in the coffin to a junk shop.

37
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,887
That's not his body!

38
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,245
Get down!

39
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:05,384
Finally back on base, you delinquent?

40
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:08,303
Why did you authorize Public Security's involvement?!

41
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:12,558
Since I can't dismiss the possibility
that Mamuro was corrupt, I had no choice.

42
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,602
Unit 501 should be investigating this!

43
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,732
The higher-ups told us to stay out of it.

44
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,318
Someone set a trap at his grave.

45
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,319
Ignore it.

46
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,989
His cyberbrain is gone!

47
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,074
This isn't the time to
stir up a hornet's nest.

48
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:33,328
Then you believe that
he was taking dirty money?

49
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,166
He got mugged downtown.
That much is fact.

50
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:42,754
Not an honorable death, but compared
to indictment, maybe he got lucky.

51
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:46,800
Thanks to him,
our letters of recommendation are on hold, too.

52
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:48,844
Concentrate on your work for now.

53
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,804
Work?

54
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:55,684
I distinctly remember asking you to
analyze that infected hardware.

55
00:07:55,767 --> 00:08:00,606
Not possible.
I just got back to Japan today, you know.

56
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,275
True enough.

57
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,860
I'll do the assignment.

58
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:08,614
In return, give me leave to go off-base
and authorize direct debit.

59
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,532
Such a problem child.

60
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,994
I'm only going to find out who set the trap.

61
00:08:14,036 --> 00:08:17,664
Very well.
I'll take care of it in Mamuro's place.

62
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:19,541
Thanks, Kurutsu.

63
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,004
Don't forget your meeting with the brass.

64
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,135
<i>Giichi Mamuro, member of
a special unit of the GSDA,</i>

65
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:56,096
<i>was murdered on the fifth of this month.</i>

66
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:59,641
<i>- Niihama police say the investigation into
his possible corruption is ongoing.
- Lieutenant Colonel Mamuro is suspected of taking large bribes...</i>

67
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:04,062
<i>... while serving as a security official
in Harimadara's weapons export--</i>

68
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,017
Access records of his movements
on the day of his death

69
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,519
and all data from city surveillance cameras.

70
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,508
He was tailed.

71
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:19,054
Scan anyone who traveled
the same route he did before time of death.

72
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,185
Three...

73
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,822
A fourth?

74
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:13,108
Three men and a mobile land mine
were following him?

75
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,284
"Funds transferred."

76
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,913
What is this?

77
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,542
Any pain?

78
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,711
Not right now, no.

79
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:36,131
It's similar to the phantom pain
particular to cyborgs,

80
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,759
but that should not affect <i>you.</i>

81
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,553
Could be a bad contact
in your nervous components.

82
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,597
Any other abnormalities?

83
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,563
No.

84
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,982
We should do a full-body checkup to be safe.

85
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:58,320
Thank you, but I have a meeting to go to.

86
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:06,161
Goodness, you have visitors.

87
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,497
They announced themselves
as Public Security Section 9.

88
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,956
Say I'm not here.

89
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:18,507
As both a Special Cyborg
and a recognized wizard-class programmer,

90
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:22,135
new regulations apply to you
under the revised Weapons Act.

91
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:27,182
The Prosthetics Maintenance Rule now applies
to issuing identification,

92
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:31,853
possessing cash, opening bank accounts,
or other ownership of assets.

93
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:34,523
In Lt. Col. Mamuro's letter
on my reclassification,

94
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,984
he guaranteed my financial autonomy.

95
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,863
If he's proven corrupt,
he'll receive a dishonorable discharge,

96
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,449
and all such documents will be void.

97
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,701
You expect me to endure a position

98
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:50,038
where I have to file paperwork
every time I open my wallet?

99
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,792
The cost of prosthetic bodies far exceeds
standard health insurance payouts.

100
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:58,338
You ought to do your duty to the government
which guarantees your right to life.

101
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,217
This is the consent form for your monitoring
and custody post-restructuring.

102
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,719
Make an effort to understand your circumstances.

103
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:20,735
During the war,
Japan allocated a sky-high budget

104
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,196
to promote cyborg development.

105
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:27,075
Did they tell you to become
Army property to foot the bill?

106
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,830
There were large deposits
made to Mamuro's accounts.

107
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:37,586
But after his murder,
someone withdrew all that money.

108
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,379
What do you want?

109
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:44,551
Major Kusanagi, of Unit 501.
No criminal record.

110
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:48,221
You work with the Army and Public Security
as a special consultant.

111
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:51,558
You specialize in solving cybercrimes.

112
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:02,611
I request that you track down the missing money
and analyze the coffin records.

113
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:06,948
Since it's an official investigation,
you should get leave to go off-base.

114
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,116
What's the pay?

115
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:12,454
I'll give you the regular consulting fee,
as a civilian.

116
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,372
That'll be an issue, you know.

117
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:19,544
A soldier famous for his integrity being shot
to death in secret is a bigger issue.

118
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,222
- Hey!
- How dare you?!

119
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:36,102
Tomorrow morning,
I'll send you a liaison who'll double as a bodyguard.

120
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,562
Think she's in?

121
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,940
She's as in the dark as we are.

122
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,984
If she wants to be free,
she'll have to find out the truth.

123
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:51,660
Still don't want the 501 to investigate?

124
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:55,163
Make one wrong move,
and our unit could get dissolved.

125
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,332
Public Security offered me an assignment.

126
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:58,667
Will you accept?

127
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,126
Lend me a hand.

128
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,672
If you can't get it done alone,
you'll be at the end of the line.

129
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,633
No one else will be able to protect you then.

130
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:10,178
Being protected isn't what I learned to do here!

131
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,305
I learned to make the most of my strengths!

132
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,019
I'll grant permission for you to use Server 6.

133
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,854
Thanks.

134
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:21,940
Just don't forget the job I gave you.

135
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,783
List the people working on the case.

136
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:35,328
But this is clearly related to the LTC's mugging!

137
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:39,207
We know he met up with the prostitute.
We need a warrant for her cust--

138
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:42,711
It's military jurisdiction!
You keep out of it!

139
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:46,172
You just forget this case, you hear me?
That's an order!

140
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:52,804
Then what's a special investigator even for, dammit?!

141
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:58,143
"Mamuro was being followed."

142
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,687
What?!

143
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,251
- Hey!
- St-Stop right there!

144
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:41,102
There you are!

145
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,448
Well, if it isn't the little tomboy from the lab.

146
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:03,291
The one who infiltrated me... is in that car...!

147
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,883
You fool! That makes you a deserter!

148
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,057
Stop, Raizo!

149
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:21,101
All right, Kusanagi?

150
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,061
Instructor Ibachi...

151
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,732
Don't think you can do whatever you want
just because you were Mamuro's favorite!

152
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:31,236
Your selfish actions put the whole unit in danger!

153
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:35,240
That's enough!
I'll be the one to lecture her.

154
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,411
That bitch only survived as a test subject.

155
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,670
The number is a fake.
He's a slippery customer.

156
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:52,006
We've proven there was an infiltrator, at least.

157
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,842
What does Kurutsu say?

158
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,343
"Ignore it."

159
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,471
Is your prosthetic body acting up?

160
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:02,851
I don't know.

161
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,519
Goodness, another visitor.

162
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:06,980
You've got a strange one here to see you.

163
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,527
What is this?

164
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:21,619
It uses signal lights?
How old is this thing?

165
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:24,873
Here, come with me.

166
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,139
Construct your learning base yourself.

167
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:49,189
Hello, nice to meet you!

168
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:55,403
I'm an autonomous-follower logistics system--
a "Logistics Conveyer Machine".

169
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:59,490
You're Section 9's "liaison
who'll double as a bodyguard"?

170
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:02,493
Chief Aramaki calls me a "Logicoma"!

171
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:07,081
You'll be receiving information through me,
Major Kusanagi.

172
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:11,753
No synching. Explain things orally or as data.

173
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:17,008
Um... Any Army case information on the group
identified as illicit arms dealers

174
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,429
would be very useful to Chief Aramaki
in tracking down a mobile land mine!

175
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,432
The Army? Arms dealers?

176
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,934
Yes, sir!

177
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,856
You disappear. I'll take it from here.

178
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,400
Order acknowledged!

179
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,695
Optical camouflage?

180
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,373
Stay here and guard my bike.

181
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,916
Right!

182
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:57,799
Come on, walk straight!
Look, we're almost there.

183
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,807
Hi there!

184
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,808
Come on in.

185
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,894
It's not even dinnertime,
and this guy's three sheets to the wind!

186
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:12,230
Get him something cold, okay?

187
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:15,650
Come on, get it together!
Sit straight!

188
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,622
I fold.

189
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:31,249
Gonna go hit the can.

190
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:32,959
Hey, no fair!

191
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:35,086
But you had a great hand!

192
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,677
There.

193
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,518
Warning! Warning!

194
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,979
Someone approaching, extremely close!

195
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:58,484
Don't move. Who sent you?!

196
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,048
Were you the ones who killed Lt. Col. Mamuro?

197
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,966
Huh? Are you Public Security?

198
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,634
Answer me!

199
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:29,682
First you check the Army database!
Code 24, Ops H2976...

200
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,893
...code name Paz!

201
00:22:32,935 --> 00:22:34,645
You're undercover?!

202
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:40,068
Yeah, the group I'm in with was hired for a hit.

203
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,527
They said the target was a full cyborg

204
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,572
and his cyberbrain had to be destroyed,
so we'd use mobile land mines.

205
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:47,700
Three of 'em--and I'm talking military-grade.

206
00:22:47,742 --> 00:22:50,078
Lt. Col. Mamuro's murder?

207
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:54,374
Who knows?
Apparently somebody beat our guys to it,

208
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:56,584
and we let the mines get away.

209
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,711
Where did the mines come from?

210
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,922
Maneuver Area 6.

211
00:23:00,963 --> 00:23:05,593
That place is a joke.
Might as well set foxes to guard a henhouse.

212
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,847
Feel like proving it with me?

213
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,936
This ain't the best job,
but I can't just drop it.

214
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:19,107
I'd be in danger,
and I'd cause trouble for my CO.

215
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,275
Is your CO trustworthy?

216
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,278
Used to be.

217
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:27,949
I see.

218
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,369
Thanks for your cooperation.

219
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:35,456
I wish I had your freedom of movement.

220
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,969
You can't analyze it?

221
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,720
It might just be noise.

222
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:14,912
No full-body cyborg gets to leave
this organization and go independent.

223
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:19,333
You're just a girl with
a little talent for cyber warfare.

224
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:21,836
Mamuro's death was an inevitability.

225
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,298
Don't step out of line, or I'll take you out.

226
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:29,302
Kurutsu and Ibachi can't shield you from me.

227
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,013
An inevitability...

228
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,484
Their security's a joke, all right.

229
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:42,583
All that's left is to connect the dots...

230
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:46,921
Look, I've got authorization!
And all I'm gonna do is ask questions!

231
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:49,549
Take your complaints to the station.

232
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:54,762
Where does he get off?
It ain't like I've never been deployed, dammit...

233
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,521
This is bullshit!
They're not even he--

234
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:10,027
Ah, sorry. I'm a special investigator
with the Niihama police.

235
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:13,030
I was told I could find these two here.

236
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,241
I have some questions for First Lieutenant Moto Seta

237
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:17,702
and Captain Amuri Noto here--

238
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:21,706
Thanks. You just connected some dots.

239
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:27,628
And I see some others just connected.
How about showing yourself?

240
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,971
Batou the Ranger?

241
00:26:37,054 --> 00:26:42,226
Long time no see.
Gotta say I didn't figure <i>you</i> for this one.

242
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:43,811
What do you mean?

243
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:48,649
The man you killed seven days ago
was a comrade of mine!

244
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:51,444
I just got back to Japan three days ago.

245
00:26:51,485 --> 00:26:53,237
Oh, really?!

246
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:19,347
I've told you your sleepless eye's weakness
is how easy it is to infiltrate.

247
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:23,017
Still afraid of taking friendly
fire out in the jungle?

248
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,603
I'm an electronic warfare specialist too!

249
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:28,814
I can't believe you infiltrated me
in the middle of a fight!

250
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:32,109
You're just about the only one who'd infiltrate me.

251
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:35,154
So, why are you after me?

252
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:36,489
Don't play dumb!

253
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,784
You're the one who got this place's
mobile land mines!

254
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,873
What the hell?!

255
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,049
Wait!

256
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:56,884
Don't shoot! Run!

257
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,147
Don't!

258
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:38,509
Those guys aren't with you?!

259
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,344
Seriously, what are you talking about?

260
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:41,929
Hey, look!

261
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,768
They found us!

262
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,438
They want to eliminate us here.

263
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:52,606
And their excuse will be
a "training exercise accident"?

264
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:55,276
I can't stop 'em with <i>this</i> puny gun!

265
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,197
We'll just have to run!

266
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:06,871
Now we climb!

267
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:07,955
Climb this?!

268
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:10,082
Damn straight!

269
00:29:10,124 --> 00:29:12,626
We'll hold them off, so get moving!

270
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,712
- Okay, fine.
- Hello!

271
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:16,255
What's that?!

272
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,884
We're surrounded.

273
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,054
I told you, move it!

274
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,973
I know, I know!

275
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,817
Get in!

276
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,506
I thought you "couldn't drop it"?

277
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:01,008
This makes a nice change of pace.

278
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:23,113
You asked the military police for help?

279
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:26,283
To escort a suspect.

280
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,827
What's this about?

281
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,544
This makes no sense.

282
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:42,132
Firstly: the missing money went to
your account, Major Kusanagi.

283
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:46,387
Secondly: the bullet you fired
on the mobile land mine at the graveyard

284
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,640
matched the one that killed Lt. Col. Mamuro.

285
00:30:49,682 --> 00:30:53,894
Seven days ago,
a prostitute here in town was shot to death.

286
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:56,730
The bullet matched the one
that killed Mamuro.

287
00:30:56,814 --> 00:31:00,067
Mamuro had met with her,
and according to the other working girls,

288
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:03,362
he was asking questions about one of her clients.

289
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:06,866
Seven days ago, one of my fellow Rangers

290
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,535
was killed by a mobile land mine,
along with his family.

291
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:15,916
He'd been in contact with Mamuro, too.

292
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,088
And when I traced the land mine to its source,
it led me to the major here.

293
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,341
By the way, she says
she got back to Japan three days ago,

294
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:27,011
but Immigration records say it was seven days ago.

295
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,930
The three mines my group was supposed to use

296
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:33,183
were the same model as the one Section 9
dug up at the graveyard.

297
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:37,271
Assuming one of those three was buried
and another killed the Ranger,

298
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:39,607
there's one more left unaccounted for.

299
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:43,736
At the moment,
all the clues point to you murdering Mamuro

300
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:46,113
and stealing his money.

301
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:53,370
Right after I landed,
I got a message and an attaché case from him.

302
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:58,459
I'm sorry, Major Kusanagi.
I doubt I'll be in this world much longer.

303
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:03,088
I wanted to get justice.

304
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:07,092
I've left your recommendation in someone else's care.

305
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:12,139
You're the most promising squad member I know.
I wish you luck.

306
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:17,478
In the case, I found data
on an internal weapons exportation racket...

307
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:19,772
...and this gun.

308
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:24,318
You've moved a lot of money in the past few days.

309
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:26,987
Who are you sending it to?

310
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:30,658
The widow of the man who raised me.

311
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:35,996
She's taken care of me since I was little,
but she's in a nursing home now.

312
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,082
What's her name?

313
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,336
What is this woman's name?

314
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,476
Phantom pain, huh?

315
00:32:57,518 --> 00:33:02,106
Even after you mechanize your body,
your brain never forgets the original.

316
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,857
Pain in the ass.

317
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,193
I don't have an "original" body.

318
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:07,611
What?

319
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:11,490
Have you heard of Doctor Bakeru's
emergency medicine system?

320
00:33:11,532 --> 00:33:13,951
That thing where someone
with a full prosthetic body

321
00:33:13,993 --> 00:33:16,870
uses their life-support system
on somebody else?

322
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:23,377
The person who raised me used it on me
while I was in my mother's womb.

323
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:34,221
Supposedly a chemical weapon killed
a large number of civilians way back when.

324
00:33:34,263 --> 00:33:38,058
A pregnant woman and the man assumed
to be her husband both died.

325
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,060
We don't even know their names.

326
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:43,731
Because someone with that particular lifesaver
happened to be on the scene,

327
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,400
the fetus's brain alone survived.

328
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:49,403
You're saying you were made a full cyborg at birth?!

329
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:52,406
I lack any memory of a body.

330
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:58,245
So perhaps you could call this "ghost pain",
created by false memories.

331
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:08,005
This is surveillance footage from Maneuver Area 6.

332
00:34:08,047 --> 00:34:10,716
Your subordinate is in it.

333
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:13,052
If you refuse to hand her over,

334
00:34:13,093 --> 00:34:16,597
I'll present you with a summons signed by
the Defense Minister himself.

335
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,434
I'll submit a written report at a later date.
I can't hand her over.

336
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,103
Vixen.

337
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,938
I'll make you regret this.

338
00:34:32,613 --> 00:34:36,742
That's Shujiro Kanzaki.
He's in charge of Maneuver Area 6,

339
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:39,620
and he leads a team of special agents.

340
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:42,915
He's also the Army's dirty go-between with
the Ministry of Defense.

341
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:46,293
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

342
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:50,964
What's wrong?

343
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:53,717
It's nothing.

344
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:12,653
It's been empty from the beginning?
Then where's the gun?!

345
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:16,115
Why did I think there were
whistle-blowing documents in it?!

346
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:17,658
And the lieutenant colonel...?

347
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:37,845
What's real?

348
00:35:38,262 --> 00:35:39,805
<i>What's the truth?</i>

349
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,522
Where's the lieutenant colonel's cyberbrain?

350
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:54,194
Wait, Kusanagi.

351
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:56,655
Calm down.

352
00:35:56,697 --> 00:36:02,536
The hardware Kurutsu had me analyze
matched his Net synch pattern.

353
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:05,956
He and I were infected
with the same virus, weren't we?

354
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:08,542
With something hypothesized
to be a cyber-virus.

355
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,044
We speculate that it's
a self-destructing Stuxnet-type

356
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:14,006
which causes unknown dysfunction.

357
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:18,135
"Unknown dysfunction"...
You mean false memories.

358
00:36:18,177 --> 00:36:19,803
It was purely a hypothesis.

359
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:22,890
At least, until we checked into your behavior.

360
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:25,976
<i>I just got back to Japan today, you know.</i>

361
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,187
<i>True enough.</i>

362
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,814
When did I come back to Japan?

363
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:34,067
Approximately 180 hours ago.
In other words, seven days.

364
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:39,573
And yet you continue to claim it was
another day altogether.

365
00:36:39,615 --> 00:36:40,908
Route of transmission?

366
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:43,368
It must have been contact with Mamuro's cyberbrain.

367
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,246
Which is still with his prosthetic body.

368
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:50,083
His coffin was a trap.

369
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:54,046
And the records Public Security got of his
burial show no signs of tampering.

370
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:57,925
So that's how it is...

371
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:01,845
Logicoma, synch with me.

372
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,347
Are you sure?

373
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:08,685
Just get on with it.
Record my field of vision and play it back in real time.

374
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,896
Roger!

375
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,359
I see things that shouldn't be there.

376
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,119
I don't see things that should be there.

377
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:52,479
Here, the whole time...?

378
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:55,440
"Special agent" "The LTC is innocent"

379
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:17,629
This is a warrant for Major Kusanagi's arrest.

380
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,175
Surrender her immediately.

381
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,553
"Special agent" "The LTC is innocent"

382
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:26,305
"Special agent" "The LTC is innocent"
What happened to this room?!

383
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:27,097
"Special agent" "The LTC is innocent"

384
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,493
The records weren't tampered with.

385
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:52,831
They just buried the truth under a lie.

386
00:39:27,074 --> 00:39:28,575
I've found it...

387
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,412
My reality.

388
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,839
Drive.

389
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:56,603
The lieutenant colonel
came to you to blow the whistle.

390
00:39:56,686 --> 00:40:00,273
Didn't he, Mr. Sadamoto, Vice-Minister of Defense?

391
00:40:00,357 --> 00:40:01,400
Yes.

392
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:03,610
But you ordered a cover-up.

393
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:05,904
Because it couldn't be made public!

394
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:08,532
We ignored treaties and sold arms to
Third World countries during the war

395
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,910
to relieve its financial burden on us.

396
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:14,413
That's governmental weapons smuggling!

397
00:40:14,454 --> 00:40:17,624
- Harimadara was at the center of it,
and as their security official,
- Vice-Minister, what's the matter?

398
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:20,460
- Lt. Col. Mamuro found out about the illegal trade.
- Vice-Minister!

399
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:21,461
What is it?

400
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:23,046
- Do you realize how much
- He's in danger!

401
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,966
the missile business has helped
our country's finances?!

402
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:28,552
The lieutenant colonel learned of
your cover-up and investigated.

403
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:32,597
The prostitute you frequented.
The Ranger who escorted you.

404
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,601
When he got info from them,
he decided to blow the whistle on you.

405
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:40,230
So you ordered Captain Kanzaki to kill him.

406
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:42,816
I just ordered him to solve the situation!

407
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:47,612
Yes, a few people suffered,
but I don't know who killed Mamuro.

408
00:40:47,654 --> 00:40:50,490
Hell, maybe he really was mugged.

409
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,325
You claim even you don't know?

410
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,161
No, and I don't want to!

411
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:57,831
That arms dealing will be purged
during restructuring anyway,

412
00:40:57,873 --> 00:41:01,001
and we're deliberating next-generation weapons
to replace missiles.

413
00:41:01,084 --> 00:41:06,173
But this mess kills the job Harimadara has
lined up for when I leave office!

414
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:09,843
You're quite the chatterbox.
A desire to confess?

415
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:14,931
Maybe so. Either way, you'll never tell anyone!

416
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,315
Stop!

417
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,776
Someone help!

418
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,499
Should've blown him away.

419
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:45,212
Wasn't being more than a killing machine
the whole point of getting out?

420
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:48,715
In the end, I had no place to go.

421
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:52,844
They traced us through the remote control.
They're coming.

422
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:56,056
You go on. They're mine.

423
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,849
There are two of them.

424
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:01,228
Fine with me.
We'll see who's the better killer.

425
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,232
Take care.

426
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,567
You too.

427
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:14,199
I hate to say it, but they're not
the only ones to benefit from his death.

428
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:16,576
Yes. Thank you.

429
00:43:21,474 --> 00:43:24,144
You're the ones who killed the lieutenant colonel!

430
00:43:55,717 --> 00:44:01,598
I warned you that if you stepped out of line,
I'd take you out.

431
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,531
That's enough of that.

432
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:50,123
You've reached your limit, Kusanagi.

433
00:45:57,005 --> 00:46:01,634
Raizo and Ibachi were luring the enemy here
with the money as bait.

434
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:06,473
We've eliminated six spies.

435
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:08,141
That's plenty.

436
00:46:08,183 --> 00:46:15,565
Kanzaki funneled money into Mamuro's account,
I moved it... and you used it.

437
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,150
That's right.

438
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:22,113
The gun used on the prostitute was
the beginning of the enemy plot.

439
00:46:22,155 --> 00:46:28,578
Blowing up the Ranger, the phony bribery...
All the blame was placed on Mamuro.

440
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:37,086
And he intended to bring
the Vice-Minister down with him.

441
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,339
It was the worst possible choice.

442
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:46,137
Unit 501 would have gone on the Army purge list
in retaliation for the scandal.

443
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:50,642
So you let him die. All of you.

444
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:15,625
If it weren't for the memory virus,
maybe we could have saved him.

445
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:18,878
But as things stood, the only option was to secure

446
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:24,175
Mamuro's cyberbrain, the mine,
and the money before he got blown up.

447
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:36,396
But what neither we
nor the enemy accounted for was you.

448
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:42,193
As soon as I arrived and got the data,
I went after the lieutenant colonel.

449
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:59,252
And you were infected by his cyberbrain.

450
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:16,060
Even as you gathered the evidence,
you were continually losing memories.

451
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,062
"The LTC is innocent"

452
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,443
What organization developed the virus?

453
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:27,447
Unclear. All we know is that
a foreign broker brought it here

454
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:31,367
and that people call it "Fire-Starter".

455
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:35,246
Was it a foreign power
that cooked up the scandal?

456
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:38,791
Our enemy is the global
military-industrial complex itself.

457
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:41,794
What would dragging down
one vice-minister accomplish?

458
00:48:41,878 --> 00:48:45,757
Did you take the disc he left me?

459
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:47,258
I did that to protect you.

460
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,928
You used me as bait for the enemy!

461
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,930
I did that to protect the organization.

462
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:54,474
Why did you stand back and watch him die?

463
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,935
I did that to protect myself.

464
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:11,783
You stick with me, Kusanagi.
I'll build a future for you.

465
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:23,169
The pain is gone now.

466
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:29,968
Section 9 and the review committee

467
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:33,680
have formally cleared Lt. Col. Mamuro of suspicion.

468
00:49:33,763 --> 00:49:38,768
Thus, as his recommendation was renewed
by a third party, we will implement it.

469
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:43,272
Due to your excellent record, we also grant you
the post-reorganization major rank.

470
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:46,985
In addition, in accordance with the will
of your late legal guardian,

471
00:49:47,026 --> 00:49:49,320
you'll receive a testamentary trust.

472
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:53,449
It's an inheritance from the person who raised you.

473
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:56,369
A portion of it is earmarked for
the purchase of your prosthetic body.

474
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:59,288
Which means that your body is now your property,

475
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,374
and is outside Army jurisdiction.

476
00:50:04,168 --> 00:50:06,546
You're quite sure about this?

477
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:08,047
The virus may be an unknown,

478
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:11,342
but we've identified the architecture
of the false memories.

479
00:50:11,384 --> 00:50:13,011
Do it.

480
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:16,389
Very well. We'll attempt memory eradication.

481
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:05,938
Will you go?

482
00:51:06,022 --> 00:51:07,273
Yes.

483
00:51:07,356 --> 00:51:09,942
Make sure to pay your respects to your parents.

484
00:51:11,694 --> 00:51:13,196
Thanks.

485
00:51:21,496 --> 00:51:23,039
I'm going.

486
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:46,479
We'll find a replacement.

487
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:56,155
Want a ride?

488
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:59,408
Consider it my thanks for telling us
the location of Mamuro's cyberbrain.

489
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,160
I'll take the bus.

490
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:03,162
Then I'll just give you the results.

491
00:52:03,246 --> 00:52:07,792
Captain Kanzaki was replaced.
Mr. Sadamoto will be tried in closed court.

492
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:12,004
I promise to make the lieutenant colonel's
findings public one day.

493
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:18,845
I see. By the way--are you the one
he gave my recommendation to?

494
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:22,849
Hard to say.
A man in my position gets a lot of those.

495
00:52:22,932 --> 00:52:24,767
In fact, one of them outlined plans

496
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:29,480
to create a new special unit within
the international rescue team.

497
00:52:29,522 --> 00:52:34,277
I'd like someone who's got experience
as a special consultant.

498
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:39,490
Intriguing, but I don't want to work
under a man who digs up people's graves.

499
00:52:39,532 --> 00:52:43,369
You dug up something even deeper.

500
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:47,290
If you're serious about going independent,
you should have your own team.

501
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:55,548
The regulations say a unit needs
a minimum of one commander and six members.

502
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,175
I'll keep that in mind.

503
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:04,140
May it be a team not for defense of self or state,
but for taking the offensive.

504
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:32,616
Six people, huh?

505
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:35,161
Hmm, whom shall I scout...?

Hospital

10

Wing 3

11
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:03,252
It's an evil night... those footsteps...

12
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:09,092
No one but me has reason
to come to this lab...

13
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:13,631
...but footsteps draw near
from the direction I've come.

14
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:19,540
Who is it walking down
that dim hallway?

15
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:25,412
Who else knows it well enough
to walk it on a dark night?

16
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,644
Of course I don't believe
in ghosts.

17
00:04:29,487 --> 00:04:34,481
But at times we can be seized
by a weird feeling...

18
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:37,690
...like the one I have now.

19
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:42,799
Six years ago, something strange
like that happened.

20
00:04:53,757 --> 00:04:59,627
My wife had tuberculosis,
and needed a change of climate.

21
00:05:00,331 --> 00:05:04,734
We moved to the small town
in Kyushu where she's from.

22
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:08,028
We left Tokyo behind
for a while.

23
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:14,334
Her elder brother had arranged
things for when we arrived.

24
00:05:39,436 --> 00:05:41,028
Does it hurt, Yoriko?

25
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:43,263
I'm fine, Kenichi.

26
00:05:44,475 --> 00:05:46,602
Shouldn't she have an operation?

27
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:48,672
This isn't the time.

28
00:05:49,013 --> 00:05:53,040
An operation could spread
the bacilli further.

29
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:56,119
We'll wait and see for now.

30
00:05:56,887 --> 00:06:02,848
I hate to see a man of your talent
dragged way down here, though.

31
00:06:03,127 --> 00:06:08,326
I'm happy to work somewhere
with clean air and a slower pace.

32
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:31,052
What a scare!

33
00:06:31,288 --> 00:06:32,277
That was close.

34
00:06:33,324 --> 00:06:36,293
I'm sorry. A black cat
ran right out in front of me.

35
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:38,485
Did you hit it?

36
00:06:38,796 --> 00:06:40,161
No. It's fine.

37
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:42,193
Good!

38
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:19,126
It's in pretty bad shape.
It's well over a century old.

39
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:22,472
The shutters haven't been opened
for years.

40
00:07:23,107 --> 00:07:25,940
Around here they call it
'the haunted mansion'.

41
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:28,542
A haunted house
in this day and age!

42
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:33,283
Yoriko...

43
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:36,576
...shouldn't you wait in the car?

44
00:07:37,788 --> 00:07:42,191
I'd like to see the place,
if I'm going to live here.

45
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:18,698
What a mess!

46
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,230
It gives me the shivers. They say
crows gather where there's death.

47
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:26,463
That's not true.

48
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:29,336
They can smell it.

49
00:08:29,545 --> 00:08:31,341
I hate the noise they make.

50
00:08:31,713 --> 00:08:33,476
It's not very cheerful.

51
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:53,233
A cat...

52
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:57,765
It scared me half to death!
I hate cats!

53
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:00,371
Let's look inside.

54
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:29,002
Tetsuichiro!

55
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:31,539
What?

56
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:33,737
There's someone there!

57
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,112
No,
there isn't.

58
00:09:46,822 --> 00:09:48,482
I'm sure there was!

59
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,317
You're seeing things.

60
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,665
Look!
Footprints!

61
00:11:07,535 --> 00:11:08,764
A tramp, maybe.

62
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,875
That's strange..
. they disappear.

63
00:11:25,486 --> 00:11:27,182
You're right.

64
00:11:28,323 --> 00:11:29,914
You're so high-strung...

65
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:33,317
This place is so eerie!

66
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:36,885
The living-room...

67
00:11:37,432 --> 00:11:39,957
These old places
were sure built to last.

68
00:11:40,334 --> 00:11:42,826
You couldn't build
like this now.

69
00:11:43,072 --> 00:11:44,197
That's right.

70
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:53,780
Tetsuichiro!

71
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:57,111
That looks like
blood on the wall!

72
00:11:57,852 --> 00:12:00,650
It's not blood.
We'll paint it over.

73
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,136
Kuzumi Clinic

74
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:34,516
Sort yesterday's files,
would you?

75
00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:44,563
How are you,
Yoriko?

76
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:50,371
This rain depresses me.

77
00:12:51,308 --> 00:12:54,276
A big house is so dark
when it rains...

78
00:12:54,544 --> 00:12:56,341
It'll stop.

79
00:12:56,746 --> 00:13:00,808
When it does, this place will be
much better for you than Tokyo.

80
00:13:01,385 --> 00:13:06,583
It's like my brother said... this
really could be a haunted house.

81
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:10,659
Since I came I've been having
strange dreams.

82
00:13:11,227 --> 00:13:13,890
Last night I dreamed of
a weird old lady...

83
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,597
Well,
it's a new place...

84
00:13:19,236 --> 00:13:22,764
What's wrong with Taro?
He doesn't usually bark like that.

85
00:13:23,439 --> 00:13:25,067
It's all nerves!

86
00:13:25,608 --> 00:13:27,872
No.
He sounds strange.

87
00:13:36,452 --> 00:13:38,579
Taro! Taro!
Quiet!

88
00:13:40,222 --> 00:13:42,317
Taro, stop it!

89
00:13:43,492 --> 00:13:44,459
Taro!

90
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:28,002
You scared me!

91
00:14:28,572 --> 00:14:30,597
Don't sneak in like that!

92
00:14:32,241 --> 00:14:33,401
Can I help you?

93
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:39,742
Don't you hear very well?

94
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:45,213
You're soaking wet!

95
00:14:46,021 --> 00:14:48,683
I'll get the doctor.
You wait here.

96
00:14:52,862 --> 00:14:53,760
Doctor...

97
00:14:55,664 --> 00:14:56,790
A patient.

98
00:14:57,467 --> 00:14:59,832
A really strange old lady.

99
00:15:10,746 --> 00:15:12,375
There's no one here.

100
00:15:12,882 --> 00:15:16,045
That's strange... I'll go look
out front.

101
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,153
She's not here.

102
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,433
Who are you?!

103
00:16:16,947 --> 00:16:17,914
Yoriko!

104
00:16:18,448 --> 00:16:19,745
Yoriko!

105
00:16:20,418 --> 00:16:23,510
That weird old lady was in here!

106
00:16:24,688 --> 00:16:26,121
There's no one here.

107
00:16:26,356 --> 00:16:27,653
She was here!

108
00:16:27,924 --> 00:16:28,913
You imagined it.

109
00:16:29,391 --> 00:16:32,155
But the nurse said
the same thing!

110
00:16:32,395 --> 00:16:33,656
You're seeing things.

111
00:16:34,097 --> 00:16:37,327
Don't get too excited.
It's bad for you.

112
00:17:06,894 --> 00:17:09,625
Tetsuichiro!

113
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:11,528
What's wrong?

114
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:14,031
Can you hear footsteps?

115
00:17:16,073 --> 00:17:17,005
No.

116
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:28,240
I can... it's that
horrible old lady again!

117
00:17:29,218 --> 00:17:31,708
You're imagining things.
And I'm here.

118
00:17:32,255 --> 00:17:33,813
Go back to sleep.

119
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:36,852
I'm scared,
Tetsuichiro!

120
00:18:04,219 --> 00:18:05,413
Who's there?

121
00:18:05,787 --> 00:18:07,949
A child's sick.

122
00:18:08,623 --> 00:18:13,720
The Sudos need the doctor
over in Higashi Matsumura.

123
00:18:14,295 --> 00:18:16,265
The Sudos?

124
00:18:16,931 --> 00:18:18,332
Just a minute.

125
00:19:06,748 --> 00:19:08,181
Mr. Sudo!

126
00:19:09,486 --> 00:19:10,815
Dr Kuzumi's here!

127
00:19:11,053 --> 00:19:12,019
Coming!

128
00:19:15,891 --> 00:19:17,756
Oh, hello,
Doctor...

129
00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:20,859
We didn't call you,
though...

130
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:23,153
So nobody called the doctor?

131
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,229
Maybe another house...

132
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:27,025
No,
she said here.

133
00:19:27,268 --> 00:19:28,461
I'm afraid not.

134
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:00,166
It's me, Yoriko.
Open the door.

135
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:01,369
Yes?

136
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:08,369
Hurry up! I'll catch
my death of cold out here!

137
00:20:18,621 --> 00:20:19,644
Tetsuichiro?

138
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:21,121
Yeah, it's me.

139
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:25,592
That didn't take long.
Wait while I open the gate.

140
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,673
Taro! Taro!

141
00:20:52,854 --> 00:20:53,843
Taro?

142
00:21:20,582 --> 00:21:22,048
Taro!

143
00:21:23,486 --> 00:21:24,451
Taro!

144
00:21:36,564 --> 00:21:37,758
Yoriko!

145
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:39,432
Yoriko!

146
00:21:40,201 --> 00:21:42,102
What's wrong?
Yoriko!

147
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,961
Wake up!
Yoriko!

148
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:46,507
Yoriko!

149
00:21:57,085 --> 00:21:58,053
Yoriko...

150
00:21:59,823 --> 00:22:02,346
Kenichi?
Is that you?

151
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:08,390
I was so scared!
I keep having nightmares...

152
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:15,227
All these cats come
and start biting me...

153
00:22:15,571 --> 00:22:19,439
Don't try to talk.
You'll tire yourself out.

154
00:22:20,342 --> 00:22:21,707
Lay back and sleep.

155
00:22:21,977 --> 00:22:25,003
But what if I start
dreaming again?

156
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:29,108
The doctor's here.
Relax and go to sleep.

157
00:22:44,632 --> 00:22:45,622
How is she?

158
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:48,932
She's fine now.

159
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:53,403
But another shock like that
could kill her.

160
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:55,230
Really?

161
00:22:56,246 --> 00:22:58,406
I've been thinking...

162
00:22:59,281 --> 00:23:00,304
Yes?

163
00:23:00,949 --> 00:23:06,477
I'm told there are reasons
they say this house is haunted.

164
00:23:08,457 --> 00:23:13,758
The priest at Ryofukuji Temple
once told me...

165
00:23:14,763 --> 00:23:19,861
...the best thing to do with
this place was tear it down.

166
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:24,567
I can't help but think
there's a connection.

167
00:23:25,842 --> 00:23:28,536
The nurse saw an old lady,
too.

168
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:32,071
And then there's your dog...

169
00:23:33,148 --> 00:23:37,175
I'm wondering if you might
come talk to the priest with me.

170
00:23:52,801 --> 00:23:56,566
It's just what I thought it was.

171
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,006
It's a cat-spirit
seeking revenge.

172
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,276
A ghost cat?

173
00:24:03,512 --> 00:24:04,500
Yes.

174
00:24:04,746 --> 00:24:08,977
It's a tale of karma
from long, long ago.

175
00:24:10,084 --> 00:24:13,884
On one side of the house
was a bed of spiraea flowers.

176
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:17,281
It was called 'Spiraea Mansion'.

177
00:24:18,361 --> 00:24:25,788
In it lived Ishido Sakon no Shogen,
castle-warden of the Omura Clan.

178
00:24:26,502 --> 00:24:31,303
He was a man famous
for his very short temper.

179
00:24:33,875 --> 00:24:35,775
Saheiji!
Where are you?!

180
00:24:35,878 --> 00:24:36,969
Coming!

181
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:39,037
Yes, Milord?

182
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:41,373
Pick up those stones!

183
00:24:43,486 --> 00:24:45,451
Is Kokingo really coming?

184
00:24:46,086 --> 00:24:48,817
He's late!
Where is he?!

185
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:50,887
He won't be here yet,
Sire.

186
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:51,650
Why not?

187
00:24:51,893 --> 00:24:56,125
His lady mother is blind,
you will recall.

188
00:24:56,698 --> 00:24:58,666
He must tend to her.

189
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,926
Yes,
I know that!

190
00:25:03,372 --> 00:25:07,035
Why do you cry so?
I'll be home soon.

191
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,776
Here, Mother.
Take Tama.

192
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:20,083
Kokingo... don't you feel
she wants to tell you something?

193
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:25,324
I have a bad feeling myself.

194
00:25:26,695 --> 00:25:32,156
Have no fear. I'm simply going
to teach him the game of Go.

195
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:36,233
But Lord Shogen is such
a difficult person...

196
00:25:37,605 --> 00:25:40,096
Bear my words in mind...

197
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:42,065
...and hurry back.

198
00:25:42,442 --> 00:25:45,880
I will.
I'll be going now.

199
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:49,148
Be very careful.

200
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:50,351
I will.

201
00:25:57,258 --> 00:26:00,421
Don't cry, Tama.
I'll be back soon.

202
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:07,832
What's keeping him?!

203
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,871
What manner of samurai
cannot be on time?!

204
00:26:12,006 --> 00:26:14,169
Have patience,
Milord.

205
00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:17,400
Does he think his reputation
as a Go master...

206
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,778
...allows him to scorn me?!

207
00:26:20,881 --> 00:26:24,977
Of course not, Milord.
You see too much in this.

208
00:26:25,286 --> 00:26:27,188
Are you telling me...

209
00:26:27,488 --> 00:26:29,821
...I don't know when
I've been insulted?!

210
00:26:29,925 --> 00:26:33,622
Not at all! I mean only
that you should calm yourself.

211
00:26:33,728 --> 00:26:37,756
Make sport of me
and I'll have your head!

212
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:40,301
Milord!
Forgive me!

213
00:26:41,102 --> 00:26:41,900
Forgive me!

214
00:26:42,005 --> 00:26:43,494
Halt!

215
00:26:44,707 --> 00:26:46,265
Father, wait!

216
00:26:46,374 --> 00:26:48,672
Stand aside!

217
00:26:48,776 --> 00:26:49,801
I will not.

218
00:26:50,144 --> 00:26:54,878
Saheiji is a valued retainer.
For my sake, spare him!

219
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:56,311
No!
Stand aside!

220
00:26:56,852 --> 00:27:00,448
Whatever he has done,
it cannot be worth his life!

221
00:27:01,122 --> 00:27:04,820
Your temper is a matter
of regret to me.

222
00:27:05,294 --> 00:27:08,854
Saheiji... at Shinnojo's request,
your life is spared.

223
00:27:09,332 --> 00:27:10,263
Be careful!

224
00:27:10,364 --> 00:27:11,263
Milord!

225
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:15,467
Now I can leave in confidence
for the castle.

226
00:27:15,938 --> 00:27:17,734
You stand night watch?

227
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:18,601
I do.

228
00:27:18,707 --> 00:27:20,605
Look to your duty.

229
00:27:20,842 --> 00:27:21,671
I will.

230
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,900
Kokingo!

231
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:49,900
Welcome.
My father awaits.

232
00:27:50,138 --> 00:27:52,265
Angry that I'm late?

233
00:27:52,506 --> 00:27:56,034
You know him well.
Be easy on him when you play.

234
00:27:56,277 --> 00:27:57,335
I am warned.

235
00:27:57,813 --> 00:28:02,545
Later we can talk a while...
perhaps of your marriage.

236
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,810
Tonight I stand night watch.

237
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:07,816
That's too bad.
Another time, then.

238
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:08,817
Forgive me.

239
00:28:24,272 --> 00:28:25,238
Grandmother...

240
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:28,275
Ah, Shinnojo...

241
00:28:28,377 --> 00:28:29,365
Yes.

242
00:28:33,949 --> 00:28:36,815
I have a favor to ask.

243
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:40,244
What is it?

244
00:28:40,488 --> 00:28:44,448
Kokingo will play Go
with Father today.

245
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:50,162
I'm concerned Father's temper
might make him impolite.

246
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:55,565
I thought that
a word to you before...

247
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:06,940
It's not polite to your opponent
to choose stones without asking!

248
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:09,878
But I was asked
to instruct you...

249
00:29:10,118 --> 00:29:10,880
Instruct me?!

250
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:14,679
That is what Shinnojo said.

251
00:29:14,922 --> 00:29:18,791
He doesn't know how good I am.
Today we play a game!

252
00:29:27,201 --> 00:29:29,295
Might I take back that stone?

253
00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:31,005
Not in a real game...

254
00:29:31,238 --> 00:29:32,170
No?

255
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:35,243
All right!

256
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:41,582
Tama...

257
00:29:42,351 --> 00:29:44,648
...why do you wail so?

258
00:29:46,586 --> 00:29:50,080
Are you so lonely
without Kokingo?

259
00:29:51,993 --> 00:29:54,221
Your medicine,
ma'am.

260
00:29:55,832 --> 00:29:57,196
Thank you.

261
00:30:05,474 --> 00:30:07,669
Kokingo is late.

262
00:30:08,343 --> 00:30:12,574
Yes. And he said
he would return early.

263
00:30:12,913 --> 00:30:16,007
His opponent is a difficult man.

264
00:30:17,686 --> 00:30:22,519
I told him to let Lord Shogen win
and to hurry home.

265
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:27,659
But he's as stubborn as
his father was.

266
00:30:29,363 --> 00:30:31,228
I pray nothing happens.

267
00:30:35,371 --> 00:30:37,929
I didn't see that move!

268
00:30:38,172 --> 00:30:40,333
Let me take back my stone!

269
00:30:40,574 --> 00:30:41,371
This is a game.

270
00:30:41,476 --> 00:30:43,102
Yes, I know,
but...

271
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,006
'But'?

272
00:30:44,112 --> 00:30:45,874
Let me take back my move!

273
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,969
I will not!

274
00:30:53,988 --> 00:30:56,457
Let me take that back!

275
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,384
Milord!
I will take my leave.

276
00:30:58,627 --> 00:31:02,084
Before the game is done?
What is the meaning of this?!

277
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,923
I will not play against a cheat!

278
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:08,430
You dare use that word
to one of my position?!

279
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:11,160
I say it again.
A cheat is a cheat!

280
00:31:11,273 --> 00:31:11,762
Silence!

281
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,170
You disgrace your position!

282
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:15,969
You insolent pup!

283
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,872
What did you say?!

284
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,346
You old fool!

285
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:25,015
Halt!

286
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,786
Pup!

287
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:31,980
Villain!

288
00:32:33,188 --> 00:32:35,747
Milord!
What's happened?!

289
00:32:36,157 --> 00:32:37,123
Saheiji!

290
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:44,056
You cannot see this and live!
Prepare yourself!

291
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:47,865
Or will you help me?

292
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:52,198
What will it be?
Think well on it!

293
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:53,872
I will.

294
00:32:54,642 --> 00:32:56,439
I'll help you!

295
00:33:03,017 --> 00:33:05,419
You are Kokingo's attendant?

296
00:33:05,653 --> 00:33:07,554
Yes, Milord.
I am Hachirota.

297
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:11,114
Go quickly and tell
the Lady Miyaji...

298
00:33:11,593 --> 00:33:14,619
...that Kokingo, mortified by
his defeat at Go...

299
00:33:14,894 --> 00:33:20,458
...has left immediately to study
further in Kyoto and Osaka.

300
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:27,939
He is a rash young man.
Convey my regrets to his mother.

301
00:33:28,877 --> 00:33:29,843
Yes, Milord.

302
00:33:31,579 --> 00:33:35,448
Are you sure there
is no mistake?

303
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:37,384
Yes.

304
00:33:37,884 --> 00:33:41,948
Those are His Lordship's words.
There is no mistake.

305
00:35:08,443 --> 00:35:09,876
Kokingo!

306
00:35:12,114 --> 00:35:14,775
Why do you appear as a corpse?!

307
00:35:17,085 --> 00:35:18,313
Who killed you?

308
00:35:20,755 --> 00:35:24,282
Who was it?
Speak his name!

309
00:35:29,797 --> 00:35:31,096
Lord Shogen?

310
00:35:33,802 --> 00:35:35,030
Lord Shogen?

311
00:35:49,018 --> 00:35:51,009
Kokingo!
Kokingo!

312
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:59,489
Satsuki!
Where are you?!

313
00:35:59,893 --> 00:36:00,860
Coming!

314
00:36:03,398 --> 00:36:05,126
Yes, ma'am?

315
00:36:05,532 --> 00:36:09,333
Tell me what
this piece of cloth is.

316
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,971
Blood!

317
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:14,235
It bears the
three-diamond crest!

318
00:36:15,108 --> 00:36:16,509
Shogen's crest?

319
00:36:20,148 --> 00:36:22,445
Then it's true!

320
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:33,937
Lady Miyaji, you're as beautiful
as ever.

321
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:38,743
Seeing you now
it seems like only yesterday...

322
00:36:39,118 --> 00:36:41,085
...you were always
in my thoughts.

323
00:36:41,855 --> 00:36:47,223
I'm sure Kokingo's leaving
is a great disappointment to you.

324
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,426
Lord Shogen...

325
00:36:50,196 --> 00:36:54,995
...is it really true that Kokingo
has left on a journey of study?

326
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:00,732
Do you doubt my word?
A samurai does not lie.

327
00:37:08,681 --> 00:37:11,513
And what is this,
Lady Miyaji?

328
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:14,685
Are you saying you do not know?

329
00:37:15,087 --> 00:37:17,078
I do not.
What is it?

330
00:37:18,022 --> 00:37:19,716
Then I'll tell you.

331
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,261
Kokingo's ghost has come
to tell me you have killed him!

332
00:37:26,397 --> 00:37:27,489
A ghost?!

333
00:37:30,935 --> 00:37:32,629
I'm sure it was a dream.

334
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:37,138
Great worry sometimes
brings us strange dreams.

335
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:40,107
Put your heart at ease.

336
00:37:40,212 --> 00:37:44,408
Will you drink with me?
What do you say?

337
00:37:45,884 --> 00:37:49,446
Where's the harm in it?
There's no one else here.

338
00:37:49,788 --> 00:37:50,518
Die!

339
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,087
Have you gone mad?

340
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:56,125
Revenge!

341
00:38:00,299 --> 00:38:01,288
Lady Miyaji...

342
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,562
You filth!

343
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:44,772
Hear me, Tama!

344
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:48,277
Listen well!

345
00:38:50,915 --> 00:38:54,281
Kokingo, who was
so good to you...

346
00:38:55,221 --> 00:38:57,085
...has met cruel death...

347
00:38:57,788 --> 00:39:00,553
...at the hands of Lord Shogen.

348
00:39:03,361 --> 00:39:06,922
And more, Shogen has violated
my honor!

349
00:39:07,832 --> 00:39:09,823
I cannot bear to live!

350
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:22,504
Hear me, for you are wise,
beast though you are.

351
00:39:23,948 --> 00:39:27,111
Kokingo and I make
this request of you.

352
00:39:30,855 --> 00:39:37,259
Avenge us on Sakon no Shogen
and on his children, and theirs...

353
00:39:37,495 --> 00:39:40,395
...until his line is extinct!

354
00:39:45,703 --> 00:39:51,107
This is the last thing
I will ever ask you.

355
00:39:52,442 --> 00:39:57,971
Tama! Lap my blood,
and imbibe my hate!

356
00:40:36,953 --> 00:40:37,817
Saheiji!

357
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,020
Yes, Milord?

358
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:42,022
It's blood!

359
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,326
Quickly!
Wipe it away!

360
00:41:12,022 --> 00:41:13,047
Who's there?

361
00:41:13,857 --> 00:41:16,223
Sato?

362
00:41:17,163 --> 00:41:22,062
I won't need you tonight.
You may retire.

363
00:41:22,933 --> 00:41:27,393
You may not have use of me...

364
00:41:28,105 --> 00:41:33,201
...but I have use of you.

365
00:41:34,681 --> 00:41:35,770
What?!

366
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:50,421
Lady Miyaji!

367
00:42:51,253 --> 00:42:55,588
What brings you here
at this hour of the night?

368
00:42:55,925 --> 00:42:58,052
Your Ladyship...

369
00:43:00,494 --> 00:43:04,296
...Lord Shogen,
without cause...

370
00:43:05,802 --> 00:43:09,568
...has most cruelly cut down...

371
00:43:10,173 --> 00:43:15,041
...my only son,
Kokingo.

372
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,805
And as well...

373
00:43:19,682 --> 00:43:25,119
...though I am blind,
he has abused my person.

374
00:43:27,423 --> 00:43:29,325
May the hatred I bear...

375
00:43:30,293 --> 00:43:37,700
...curse the house of Ishido
and all who bear its name...

376
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:41,061
...unto the last of its line!

377
00:43:41,637 --> 00:43:43,834
I know nothing of this!

378
00:43:44,807 --> 00:43:46,434
I know nothing of it!

379
00:43:46,907 --> 00:43:50,436
Lady Miyaji! I know
nothing of this!

380
00:43:53,182 --> 00:43:57,117
Forgive me,
Lady Miyaji!

381
00:44:45,665 --> 00:44:46,632
Yae...

382
00:44:46,967 --> 00:44:52,531
...I have to pick the right time
to ask Father to let us marry.

383
00:44:53,373 --> 00:44:54,339
You know that.

384
00:44:54,973 --> 00:44:55,942
Yes.

385
00:44:58,545 --> 00:45:02,413
I'm very happy,
Shinnojo...

386
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:09,112
...but your father won't let you
marry a woman of my station.

387
00:45:09,322 --> 00:45:14,386
Don't you understand
how much I love you?

388
00:45:14,694 --> 00:45:16,719
Yes, but...

389
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:19,857
...I am not well-born.

390
00:45:21,168 --> 00:45:25,969
To be here with you like this
is all the happiness...

391
00:45:26,706 --> 00:45:28,299
...I need.

392
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:29,440
Yae!

393
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:31,406
Shinnojo!

394
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:55,266
Yae!

395
00:45:55,735 --> 00:45:56,703
Yae!

396
00:45:57,938 --> 00:45:58,665
Yes?

397
00:45:58,906 --> 00:46:02,136
His Lordship wants you.

398
00:46:02,674 --> 00:46:04,802
I'll go to him now!

399
00:46:37,078 --> 00:46:42,777
This is a game.
I do not play against cheats.

400
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,549
Kokingo!
Go back to hell!

401
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:50,857
Who's there?

402
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,351
Yae, Milord.

403
00:46:52,592 --> 00:46:56,460
I'm glad you've come.
Enter.

404
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:57,598
Yes, Milord.

405
00:47:01,703 --> 00:47:04,295
Will you massage my back?

406
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:26,918
You're a very beautiful girl,
Yae.

407
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,089
You jest,
Milord!

408
00:47:29,194 --> 00:47:32,357
Not at all!
Come here...

409
00:47:32,464 --> 00:47:33,728
I mustn't,
Milord!

410
00:47:33,967 --> 00:47:34,694
Please!

411
00:47:34,799 --> 00:47:39,636
Don't be so formal!
There's no one else here.

412
00:47:39,906 --> 00:47:41,636
Keep your voice down!

413
00:47:41,873 --> 00:47:42,897
No! Please!

414
00:47:44,578 --> 00:47:45,567
Please!

415
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:52,985
Marry Yae?

416
00:47:53,853 --> 00:47:56,376
You are heir to this house!

417
00:47:56,956 --> 00:47:59,356
A 3,000-koku samurai!

418
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:02,085
Think of your position,
you fool!

419
00:48:02,393 --> 00:48:05,592
Forgive my impertinence
in disagreeing.

420
00:48:06,097 --> 00:48:07,893
We have pledged our love.

421
00:48:08,634 --> 00:48:12,568
I would not be the first
to marry below my station.

422
00:48:13,202 --> 00:48:15,400
Grandmother gives her blessing.

423
00:48:16,275 --> 00:48:18,139
I ask you for yours.

424
00:48:18,376 --> 00:48:22,871
Shinnojo, you're old enough now
not to go mad...

425
00:48:23,248 --> 00:48:24,577
...over a woman!

426
00:48:24,817 --> 00:48:25,280
Father!

427
00:48:25,384 --> 00:48:26,213
Enough!

428
00:48:39,963 --> 00:48:41,056
Shinnojo...

429
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:42,891
Grandmother...

430
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:45,126
What did he say?

431
00:48:45,438 --> 00:48:48,373
I asked to marry Yae...

432
00:48:48,972 --> 00:48:50,373
...and he got angry.

433
00:48:50,606 --> 00:48:54,409
Why would a great man
like Shogen...

434
00:48:54,713 --> 00:48:55,806
...do such a thing?

435
00:48:56,048 --> 00:48:58,277
Just because of her birth!

436
00:49:00,251 --> 00:49:03,117
Perhaps there's something else.

437
00:49:03,956 --> 00:49:05,048
Something else?

438
00:49:05,588 --> 00:49:06,577
Yes.

439
00:49:07,126 --> 00:49:09,594
It's rumored among
the servants...

440
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:14,831
...Shogen summoned Yae
to his chamber late at night.

441
00:49:15,101 --> 00:49:16,896
Yae?!

442
00:49:28,447 --> 00:49:29,471
No, Milord!

443
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:30,043
Yae!

444
00:49:30,146 --> 00:49:31,443
Let go!

445
00:49:32,385 --> 00:49:33,409
Milord!

446
00:49:34,518 --> 00:49:35,487
Blood!

447
00:49:42,027 --> 00:49:42,958
Father!

448
00:49:43,527 --> 00:49:45,463
After what you said to me!

449
00:49:45,798 --> 00:49:48,164
What?!

450
00:49:50,235 --> 00:49:52,067
Kokingo!

451
00:49:53,304 --> 00:49:54,271
Father!

452
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:01,911
Stand aside!

453
00:50:02,914 --> 00:50:04,539
Miyaji!

454
00:50:04,784 --> 00:50:06,376
Let go!

455
00:50:09,789 --> 00:50:10,755
Yae!

456
00:50:14,193 --> 00:50:15,181
Father!

457
00:50:16,094 --> 00:50:17,027
Yae!

458
00:50:18,664 --> 00:50:20,824
Yae!
Speak to me!

459
00:50:21,967 --> 00:50:22,934
Yae!

460
00:50:25,304 --> 00:50:26,396
Fiend!

461
00:50:43,956 --> 00:50:44,923
Fiend!

462
00:50:52,126 --> 00:50:53,093
Blood!

463
00:51:19,921 --> 00:51:23,755
Who is it out there?

464
00:51:24,189 --> 00:51:25,555
Sato.

465
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:29,756
If there's something you want,
come in.

466
00:51:51,218 --> 00:51:54,244
You saw,
didn't you.

467
00:51:54,456 --> 00:51:58,789
No, Milady! I thought
you might be in distress!

468
00:51:59,026 --> 00:51:59,959
Liar!

469
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:05,195
You've seen. I cannot
leave you alive.

470
00:52:05,867 --> 00:52:08,858
Come to me!

471
00:52:09,371 --> 00:52:10,735
Forgive me!

472
00:53:40,552 --> 00:53:41,521
Yae!

473
00:54:46,385 --> 00:54:50,514
Mother took a carp from the pond
and went under the house?!

474
00:54:50,756 --> 00:54:52,552
Yes, Milord.

475
00:54:52,959 --> 00:54:57,090
Those strange things last night,
and now my mother...

476
00:54:58,164 --> 00:55:01,827
Saheiji! Tonight we'll go
and look into this!

477
00:55:15,514 --> 00:55:17,380
It's Sato and Her Ladyship!

478
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:42,372
Oh, Shogen...

479
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:45,977
What brings you here
at this hour?

480
00:55:46,213 --> 00:55:47,077
Silence, fiend!

481
00:55:47,314 --> 00:55:50,372
You killed my mother!
Now you'll die!

482
00:56:18,276 --> 00:56:19,267
Fiend!

483
00:56:35,994 --> 00:56:38,485
Father!
Why is your sword drawn?

484
00:56:38,731 --> 00:56:41,458
Have you seen anything strange?

485
00:56:43,436 --> 00:56:44,561
Speak!

486
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:50,137
Kokingo!
Go back to hell!

487
00:56:50,842 --> 00:56:52,706
Father!
Are you mad?!

488
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:54,541
Father!

489
00:56:58,217 --> 00:57:00,014
Father!
What are you doing?!

490
00:57:00,385 --> 00:57:02,284
Father!

491
00:58:59,034 --> 00:59:00,005
Father!

492
00:59:51,523 --> 00:59:53,514
Milord!

493
01:00:39,346 --> 01:00:45,755
This is the story that has long
been told of Spiraea Mansion.

494
01:00:46,288 --> 01:00:48,257
A frightening tale.

495
01:00:49,293 --> 01:00:51,920
But why is my sister involved?

496
01:00:52,163 --> 01:00:53,891
Yes.
Why Yoriko?

497
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:57,586
According to this
Register of Deaths...

498
01:00:59,603 --> 01:01:05,007
...Saheiji, the servant there,
was your ancestor.

499
01:01:05,442 --> 01:01:06,431
Really?

500
01:01:06,677 --> 01:01:09,644
I've never told anybody that.

501
01:01:10,278 --> 01:01:11,373
Is that so?

502
01:01:12,913 --> 01:01:18,114
Cats have always been held
to have magical powers.

503
01:01:18,889 --> 01:01:24,293
That's why I once said
you should tear the place down.

504
01:01:25,759 --> 01:01:30,288
But vengeful spirits abhor
the name of the Lord Buddha.

505
01:01:32,201 --> 01:01:34,326
I'll give you this charm.

506
01:01:35,836 --> 01:01:37,931
Hang it in your house.

507
01:01:38,509 --> 01:01:39,873
Thank you!

508
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:27,538
Tetsuichiro,
don't leave me.

509
01:02:27,777 --> 01:02:28,902
I won't.

510
01:02:29,509 --> 01:02:32,240
The nurse will watch
the patients.

511
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:35,315
And the priest gave me
that charm.

512
01:02:35,817 --> 01:02:37,547
There's nothing to fear.

513
01:02:40,153 --> 01:02:43,056
When I was a girl,
when I got sick...

514
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:47,019
...my mother would get
a charm like that.

515
01:02:48,394 --> 01:02:51,630
It's strange, but I'd always
get better.

516
01:02:51,865 --> 01:02:53,768
You're so superstitious!

517
01:02:54,538 --> 01:02:57,335
But if you get better,
that's fine.

518
01:03:19,025 --> 01:03:19,927
Tetsuichiro!

519
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:21,956
Yoriko!
Calm down!

520
01:03:26,735 --> 01:03:30,331
I'm scared!
Close the shutters!

521
01:03:30,438 --> 01:03:31,563
All right.

522
01:05:02,831 --> 01:05:03,592
Yoriko!

523
01:05:04,264 --> 01:05:05,097
Yoriko!

524
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:08,159
Yoriko!

525
01:05:15,342 --> 01:05:16,331
Yoriko!

526
01:05:55,193 --> 01:05:57,423
Who is it?
Who's there?

527
01:06:08,635 --> 01:06:10,131
Oh, it's you...

528
01:06:10,376 --> 01:06:12,068
I brought you some dinner.

529
01:06:12,309 --> 01:06:14,575
Thanks. Did it scare you
when the power went out?

530
01:06:14,680 --> 01:06:16,943
Yes.
I kept my eyes shut.

531
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:18,843
But you got here...

532
01:06:19,852 --> 01:06:26,280
Tonight even I started thinking
about that house down in Kyushu...

533
01:06:26,526 --> 01:06:27,617
That time?

534
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:30,626
Yes.
I thought you were dead.

535
01:06:31,363 --> 01:06:33,160
That certainly was strange.

536
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:37,327
We buried the mummy
and the old lady vanished.

537
01:06:37,903 --> 01:06:40,300
Hatred is a terrible thing.

538
01:06:42,508 --> 01:06:44,164
A cat!

539
01:06:51,251 --> 01:06:52,271
It's so cute!

540
01:06:52,385 --> 01:06:54,376
What,
you like cats now?

541
01:06:55,088 --> 01:06:56,577
Can we keep it?

542
01:06:56,689 --> 01:06:58,122
Sure. Why not?

543
01:07:16,075 --> 01:07:23,673
The End

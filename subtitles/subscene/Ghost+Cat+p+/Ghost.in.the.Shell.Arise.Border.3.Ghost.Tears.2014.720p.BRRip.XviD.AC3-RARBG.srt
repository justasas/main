1
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,441
<i>Major. Hey, Major!</i>

2
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,237
<i>What was that? Virtual reality?</i>

3
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,991
<i>I'm on vacation. Don't be so casual
about entering my cyber lobby.</i>

4
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,828
<i>My condolences. There's been a
terrorist bombing in Nishinouchi.</i>

5
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,414
<i>The vies were an executive at a
foreign-owned water company,</i>

6
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,584
<i>a Trade Ministry official, and
a domestic weapons manufacturer.</i>

7
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,004
<i>The top-priority entry in the
terrorism prediction list</i>

8
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:12,007
<i>you gave Public Security
was right on target.</i>

9
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:15,302
<i>I assume they were in a secret
meeting to agree on water prices.</i>

10
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:17,985
<i>Everything's in smithereens, including
some Foreign Affairs guards.</i>

11
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:21,767
<i>There was also an explosion at
the Yamanote Dam, by the way.</i>

12
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,310
<i>The dam?</i>

13
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,106
<i>Dunno if it's related.</i>

14
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,359
<i>But it essentially belongs to a
foreign-owned water company,</i>

15
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,529
<i>and there's a retired
Trade official on staff.</i>

16
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:40,619
<i>The bureaucrats' turf wars are
intense in that industry.</i>

17
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,665
<i>So, who asked for us?</i>

18
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:47,042
<i>Section 9, as usual.</i>

19
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:51,046
<i>They failed to put your list to good
use, but they did track the preps.</i>

20
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:54,341
<i>They say they can't secure
'em, though. Too outgunned.</i>

21
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:02,516
<i>Call everyone in. I'm coming too.</i>

22
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,685
Work calls?

23
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,022
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:13,694
Five hours, seven minutes.
That's a record-length vacation for you.

25
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:19,074
Are you consulting for the police today?
Or the Cyberbrain Development Bureau?

26
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,577
I'll make it up to you.

27
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,580
Don't forget what we talked about.

28
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:25,998
Are you serious?

29
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,165
Of course.

30
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,879
You should get going. All your
customers are impatient types, right?

31
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:34,214
Yes.

32
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:39,887
<i>Wow, you've been with that guy for
three months! That's a new reorder.</i>

33
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,185
<i>Don't be so casual about using
that Ghost infiltration key.</i>

34
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:59,591
Your precinct ID'd him as
Detective Naoharu Mizuki.

35
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,468
Is that right?

36
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,137
Yeah. He's my senior.

37
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:13,981
Is this all he had on him?

38
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,191
His holster was empty.

39
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:19,361
His piece must've been
washed away or stolen.

40
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,531
It's hard to believe the gun under
his jacket would get washed away.

41
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,659
And it'd be odd for someone to steal
his gun but leave his wallet.

42
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:33,375
A prosthetic specialist...

43
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:37,504
He sure doesn't look cyborg.

44
00:05:37,546 --> 00:05:41,133
Lieutenant, your guys rounded up all the
unclaimed property in the area, right?

45
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,385
Let's look for something
else that ties back to him.

46
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,470
You want me to be your errand boy?

47
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,140
If the darn incident was
really an accident, yes.

48
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:52,185
Lieutenant! I found something odd.

49
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,690
What are these?

50
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,817
They look like prosthetic, but...

51
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,745
Mermaid's Legs...

52
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:17,919
<i>Report.</i>

53
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:23,717
Lots of injured cops.
Six perps still going strong.

54
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,510
They're on their way to Ward 4.

55
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,096
They see right through
the police strategy.

56
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:31,391
They secured an escape
route ahead of time.

57
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,019
This group is highly trained.

58
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:37,439
They have a commander somewhere
out there. Ishikawa!

59
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,026
<i>I picked up their line!</i>

60
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,532
The seventh one.
This is their leader.

61
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,318
This is a cutting-edge ghost lock.
Don't waste time resisting.

62
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,986
<i>I'll make him order his
friends to surrender.</i>

63
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:29,825
<i>Ishikawa, run a forced
recognition program.</i>

64
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,742
<i>Roger.</i>

65
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:35,580
<i>Abort the operation. Throw
down your guns and surrender.</i>

66
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:40,836
<i>Repeat." Abort the
operation and surrender.</i>

67
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,924
Huh?

68
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,262
Aw, no shootout?

69
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:54,182
I captured one!

70
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,353
Hey, you're pretty useful!

71
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:02,190
We got the last one.

72
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,026
Good. Hand them all over
to Public Security.

73
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,030
A virus alert?

74
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:13,535
It's the man you captured!

75
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,509
This pain...

76
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,226
The ghost lock released?

77
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,395
<i>Major?</i>

78
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,230
<i>Shit. Saito!</i>

79
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,652
<i>Don't kill him!</i>

80
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,599
No more of that!

81
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:26,274
<i>Damn, it feels gross having someone
infiltrate my Ghost-even the Major.</i>

82
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,775
<i>Truer words...</i>

83
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,195
Your fault for aiming for the head.

84
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:34,950
Don't hand them over yet. We'll take
them to a lockup with cyber facilities.

85
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,952
You telling me to play
interrogation partner?

86
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,537
I'm not interested
in fake memories.

87
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,373
Memories?

88
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:44,626
I'm interested in their
contaminated Ghosts.

89
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:56,721
Sorry I had to call you down here.

90
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,473
It's my civic duty.

91
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:03,311
I understand you're in charge
of the dam. Let's see...

92
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,315
Dr. Zhinzhee Bekka Arr Thied.

93
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,151
Please, call me Thied.

94
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,904
You've got quite the
tough-looking secretary.

95
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,823
He's very reliable.

96
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:19,661
The conflicts continue in the Republic
of Kuzan, where you're from.

97
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:26,001
I hear the Qhardi ethnic minority in particular
is still waging a war of independence.

98
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,253
It's a heartbreaking war.

99
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,922
You're Qhardi, correct?

100
00:10:31,006 --> 00:10:36,845
Yes. Like the majority of my comrades,
I wish for a peaceful solution.

101
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,015
So, the explosion at the darn...

102
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,684
I'm told it was a
valve malfunction.

103
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:47,939
Your company sells water, right?
For what type of use?

104
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:53,862
It's for precision machinery businesses.
That industry relies on 100% pure water.

105
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,866
Precision machinery... Prosthetic
manufacturing, for example?

106
00:10:57,867 --> 00:10:59,367
Yes.

107
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,620
Chief...

108
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,206
You idiot!

109
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,710
The Trade Ministry got them
invited to set up a plant here!

110
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,212
You want to make an enemy
of the local precinct, too?

111
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:12,881
But...

112
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,971
Stop, that's evidence!

113
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:26,561
I'm very grateful to you for finding
the goods stolen from our warehouse.

114
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,980
Please, take them with you.

115
00:11:29,064 --> 00:11:29,981
Chief!

116
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,566
Back off!

117
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,402
A detective died, sir.

118
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,404
You think I don't know that?

119
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,907
You go to Nishinouchi
and get me information.

120
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,409
Nishinouchi? What's there?

121
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,663
A bombing, apparently
by Qhardi terrorists.

122
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,583
Now listen: You consult your superiors
before any moves on this case.

123
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:49,501
Terrorism?

124
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:55,715
If the explosion was intentional,
and he wasn't a victim...

125
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,092
What?

126
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,427
Yes, sir! I'm on it!

127
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,265
Don't make any trouble!

128
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:13,358
They're a Qhardi weapons smuggling gang.
I met them on an undercover op.

129
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,861
Their goal is to send weapons
to their comrades back home.

130
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:19,278
They've got no reason
to attack this country.

131
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,280
Their statements
were crystal clear:

132
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:25,286
They're against the pricing agreement,
so they bombed the meeting site.

133
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:28,081
Are you telling me those
are planted memories?

134
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,875
I'm betting they're all infected.

135
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,962
And that the virus interfered
with my ghost lock.

136
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,637
Well done. You subdued
them brilliantly.

137
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:47,934
We could do it even more easily if you
adjusted your comm standards to ours.

138
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,644
I read your report.

139
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:52,147
A false memory virus that
can infiltrate, hack,

140
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:55,316
and brainwash simultaneously?

141
00:12:55,358 --> 00:12:57,986
It's a self-destructing
Stuxnet-type.

142
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,156
Other than the symptoms at its
onset, it leaves no trace.

143
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:05,160
Electronic manipulation of
memory is incredibly difficult.

144
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,495
No one in the world has
been confirmed successful.

145
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:12,332
And yet past incidents tell us a
maker and a broker clearly exist.

146
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:16,921
Yes. Somewhere out there is the
super-wizard-class programmer

147
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,173
known as "Fire-Starter" who created
this high-level cyber-virus.

148
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:23,678
But until now, no organization in the
world had uncovered his identity.

149
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,180
Did you?

150
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,015
A clue, anyway.

151
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,105
What's this?

152
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,858
All the terrorists
had the same tattoo.

153
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:42,197
It's a symbol used by Scylla, the hero
who once led the Qhardi Separatist Army.

154
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:46,451
I've heard of him. Word is he's
a master of cyber warfare.

155
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,203
Is he Fire-Starter?

156
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,038
No way. He died during the war.

157
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,374
You're going to find out
whether that's true.

158
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,544
I'll authorize limited access
to Section 9's database.

159
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,213
Read the details there.

160
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,546
That's all?

161
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,881
You're complaining?

162
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:05,887
I gave you all the Logicomas I have, plus
our weapons and permission to use them.

163
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:10,558
Any lists I make are meaningless
if the organization can't act.

164
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,893
And?

165
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,229
I want special authority
and an approved budget.

166
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:20,234
And make your flimsy comm lines backward
compatible with ours while you're at it.

167
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:25,657
Enough! Your team isn't regulation size,
and I'm graciously turning a blind eye!

168
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,576
This unit is standardized
to the perfect specs.

169
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,245
We don't need more people.

170
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,164
Then the whole unit will go
down the second you get hacked.

171
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,250
Just like those terrorists did.

172
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,878
Your "perfect specs"
don't merit my trust.

173
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:42,674
If you want authority and a budget,
get at least one more member

174
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:46,094
and accept cooperation from
someone with different specs.

175
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:52,600
If they won't give us money, we're stuck
in this garbage dump for a while.

176
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,938
I'm just glad we've
got a lab to use.

177
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:03,278
Yeah, high prosthetic performance
takes superior maintenance...

178
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:09,450
We'll have to pay for upgrades out
of pocket. Costs a lot, though.

179
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,122
Training ground instructors
make pretty good money.

180
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,711
Top-quality maintenance facilities,
authority-we'll get it all.

181
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:21,635
Stop wasting time bitching
and solve our case!

182
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,132
His nationality's unknown.

183
00:15:24,133 --> 00:15:27,552
He uses multiple bodies
to conceal his identity,

184
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,972
earning the name
Skulla, aka Scylla.

185
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,975
That's the name of a monster
from Greek mythology.

186
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,062
A pro at warfare who led a
separatist army, and whiz hacker...

187
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,732
Huh, his specialty is tunnel ops.

188
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,149
"Tunnel ops"?

189
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,152
That's when you bomb
someplace's lifelines

190
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,238
and then infiltrate them electronically
during their restoration.

191
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:51,993
Ultimately you wage a destructive
cyber-attack from inside their defenses.

192
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:56,331
The forces who tried to prevent
independence took a major hit instead.

193
00:15:56,456 --> 00:16:00,167
But Kuzan joined forces
with advanced nations

194
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,837
to manipulate the Qhardis in
order to contain its neighbors.

195
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:07,342
It was a throwaway war of independence,
and this country was especially involved.

196
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:09,842
No one recognized the Qhardis'
independence after the war,

197
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,513
and the guerillas were
disbanded and slaughtered.

198
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,639
But their dead leader
was actually alive,

199
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,853
and he developed a special virus ahead of
all the world's research institutions,

200
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,523
then changed his name to Fire-Starter
and began his revenge...

201
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,982
I follow the logic, but
is it really possible?

202
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:29,364
In a conflict zone, you can do all
the human experimentation you want.

203
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,990
It's no wonder, really.

204
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,534
Scylla is dead.

205
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,494
A successor of his, then?

206
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:39,874
Either way, the broker isn't peddling
it without knowing what it does.

207
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:45,046
So he wanted to use those guerillas to
repeat his old tunnel operation here?

208
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:50,008
It bothers me that no one
was carrying a detonator.

209
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,886
Borma, check out the crime scene.

210
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:52,886
Roger.

211
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:57,723
Paz, you and Saito pay the gang a visit.
I want to know who trained them.

212
00:16:57,724 --> 00:17:00,895
Batou and Ishikawa, you look into
the possibility of a tunnel op.

213
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,523
Do you plan to dive into
the guerillas' cyberbrains

214
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,400
looking for the virus?

215
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,862
I'll get a tune-up
on my body first.

216
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,076
A tune-Up?

217
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,413
It's her boyfriend. He's an
ex-military prosthetics tech.

218
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,081
No, isn't he a Navy sailor?

219
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,916
That was the last one.

220
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,084
They fought on a date,

221
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,712
and she kicked his ass hard enough
to put him in the hospital.

222
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,878
What about that rich one
from the Cyberbrain Bureau?

223
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,092
He didn't last two weeks.

224
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,884
So this is the sixth in six months?
She's got a sickness.

225
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:37,515
No, it's instinct. I never sleep
with the same woman twice either.

226
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,435
Because you always end up a
hostage or a target for revenge?

227
00:17:40,436 --> 00:17:42,437
No, because it's my policy.

228
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:46,107
At least do background checks on them!
What if one of them's a trap?

229
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,776
It's better than hearing,
"I want a family".

230
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,112
Yeah, after all, you
could die at any time.

231
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,948
This is no job for a family man.

232
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,124
So the late detective's
gun wasn't found?

233
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,626
If Detective Mizuki
had fired his weapon,

234
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:08,629
it would prove this was a
crime, and not an accident.

235
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:11,299
You think someone wanted it
to look like an accident?

236
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:15,470
The cause of death was drowning, but
he lost a lot of blood antemortem,

237
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:18,473
and some of his bones are missing.

238
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:24,478
So the body's too damaged to
tell, but he may have been shot.

239
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:27,815
Detective Mizuki was
investigating weapons smuggling.

240
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,818
His most recent meeting was
with a Qhardi organization.

241
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:34,654
I suspect he was killed
because he found proof.

242
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:40,328
You feel the dam explosion was
intentional, set up to bury evidence?

243
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,997
You've got a great imagination.

244
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,333
You're turning me down, sir?

245
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,294
No, I like it. I'll allow
you to investigate.

246
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:51,839
Try to find a connection
between the incidents.

247
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,465
All alone?

248
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:55,300
You're complaining?

249
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,969
I appreciate it, sir!

250
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:04,185
Humans can never perfectly
reproduce movements.

251
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:09,315
A slight slope, our distance from our target,
a few milligrams' weight difference...

252
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:14,152
The brain calculates all these things
to create yet-unknown movements.

253
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,197
You have the most
original brain I know of,

254
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,033
and you understand the
beauty of uniform standards.

255
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,537
You're exaggerating.

256
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,372
There's nothing wrong with you.

257
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,874
It still hurts?

258
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:31,879
Try moving your right leg.

259
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,716
Lovely.

260
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38,343
What's "lovely"?

261
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,887
Your leg.

262
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,560
The pain is gone now.

263
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,394
Send me a bill.

264
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,731
I'll give you a discount.
In return, don't forget our promise.

265
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,400
You're a strange man.

266
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,068
Not as strange as you.

267
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,876
Hey, you. You're blocking my scan.

268
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,420
Oh, sorry.

269
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,255
What good are your natural
eyes in the cyber age?

270
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,260
It's not normally this hard
to find the epicenter.

271
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,263
You know a lot about the
combustion process?

272
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,891
I learned the basics
overseas during the war.

273
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,100
I see.

274
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,603
Are you a full cyborg?

275
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,396
Yeah, pretty close.

276
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:35,400
I'm no expert, but unless you
get a specialized skeleton,

277
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,445
aren't the basics the
same as a human body's?

278
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,239
But his hands stayed
open after he burned...

279
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,616
What?

280
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,618
When a natural human
burns to death,

281
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:47,453
his muscles contract, so he forms
fists and he bends forward.

282
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,416
The fetal position, or, you
know, the boxer's pose.

283
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:53,461
Heat rigor? Well, what about it?

284
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:59,634
This guard's corpse is standing
up straight, hands open.

285
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,970
Must be some property of his
prosthetics, or of the bomb.

286
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,430
Prosthetics?

287
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,313
Hello?

288
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,649
Oh, a checkup?

289
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,151
Two weeks?

290
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:21,489
Got it. No, I'm working
right now, sorry.

291
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,616
"Checkup"?

292
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,827
Sorry to bother you.

293
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:39,297
C-4 and dynamite, glycerin,
and chemical fertilizer...

294
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,343
It's a hideout straight
out of a book.

295
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:49,183
Definitely a bomb maniac vibe... but I've
got no clue what they actually used.

296
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,519
<i>Orders coming down their line!</i>

297
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,855
Someone calling himself Scylla just
ordered some "Second Army" into action.

298
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:57,858
Damn bastards! Public Security's
moves are being leaked!

299
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:07,034
<i>The Waterworks Bureau's server blew,
and took out the whole floor.</i>

300
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,493
<i>What did they use?</i>

301
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:10,160
<i>The accelerant at the
Nishinouchi crime scene</i>

302
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:13,499
<i>is spread all the way to the
ceiling, even the ducts.</i>

303
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:17,878
<i>We're talking omnidirectional blast.
The air itself blew up.</i>

304
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,336
<i>A fuel-air explosive?</i>

305
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:24,343
Then this is a dummy hideout. They've
got a more advanced bomb lab somewhere.

306
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:32,226
Damn guerilla hero is
issuing a challenge.

307
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:43,904
<i>The Waterworks Bureau is starting
repairs. Odds are the hacker's already in!</i>

308
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,740
<i>Figure out their next target.</i>

309
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,908
<i>Don't let them dig
any more tunnels.</i>

310
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,221
I appreciate your cooperation.

311
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,433
I'm used to police questioning.

312
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,436
There've been a lot of
prosthetics thefts recently.

313
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,897
"Mermaid's Legs", eh?

314
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:22,066
Not a very artistic name, but
it's easy to understand.

315
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,278
My female customers quite like it.

316
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,405
Do you recognize these legs?

317
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,118
They appear to be the
mass-production model.

318
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,787
Look at the tag.

319
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,081
"Ariel".

320
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:39,627
I've asked around, and there's
no such model on the market.

321
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:44,088
I don't carry it, either. It must be
a licensed designer's brand name.

322
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,423
Designers use the
mass-production model as a base

323
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:48,594
and then innovate to
meet customer demands.

324
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,805
Any ideas?

325
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:55,433
I'll give you my list.
One moment, please.

326
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,435
Thank you.

327
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:09,446
Cops love lists. He'll be conveniently
absorbed in it for a while.

328
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,159
Public Security took
our dummy safe house.

329
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:15,620
Are the comm lines here
safe, Colonel Hozumi?

330
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,833
Don't worry. It's one of
intelligence's independent lines.

331
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:21,458
Why haven't you killed
that detective?

332
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:24,672
He's an odd duck, but he doesn't
have any powerful backers.

333
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,841
The real issue is that
Ariel's been leaked.

334
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:31,135
We retrieved the sample before it was
analyzed, and the factory is taken care of.

335
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,514
I didn't expect you to
panic and blow it up.

336
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:39,854
We're lucky Ariel was mounted in time.
You almost seriously hindered our plan.

337
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:45,817
Ariel is a way to smuggle explosives to
the Qhardis! It's not for suicide bombers!

338
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,694
Circumstances have changed.

339
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:51,198
If previous overseas weapons
development becomes domestic,

340
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,701
distribution channels will vanish.

341
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:56,036
The Qhardi soldiers are
just sacrificial pawns?

342
00:24:56,037 --> 00:25:01,207
We're upgrading. Fire-Starter can
create all the soldiers we want.

343
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,169
Get the unit that was
arrested released.

344
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,880
I won't give you the
data until then.

345
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:09,674
They aren't even your compatriots.

346
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:12,344
Scylla would never abandon them.

347
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:18,183
Very well. There are three
more usable Ariels.

348
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:21,520
One of them is in your court.

349
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:23,688
It really has to be her?

350
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:27,902
Have you developed feelings for her?
Activate the woman's Ariel.

351
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:31,030
Release our allies first.
Understand?

352
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:57,932
Ride with me.

353
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:07,733
You haven't told anyone that you
and I killed Scylla, I trust?

354
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:08,734
No.

355
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,445
That op is a stain
on both our records.

356
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,114
It would be highly inconvenient
for it to come up again now.

357
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:18,744
I see you dived happily into the
power games as soon as you made LTC.

358
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:22,913
They used the military-industrial
complex to profit from death.

359
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:26,083
I'll wipe them out, make domestic
weapons engineering big,

360
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,046
and shut down their trade
routes to foreign cartels.

361
00:26:29,047 --> 00:26:31,923
Lt. Col. Mamuro wanted that.

362
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,426
I won't play your game.

363
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:40,140
Scylla is a game you can't quit.
She has to stay dead.

364
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,935
You used this before.

365
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,480
Bury it and whoever's using Scylla's
name-permanently this time.

366
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:50,109
Or else the brass will bury
you, and that op with you.

367
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,952
Becoming independent of the
system doesn't make you free.

368
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:06,959
You're like last century's programmers, who
expected too much from the birth of the Net.

369
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,629
Even Section 9 is only letting you
have your own way to test you.

370
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:13,173
When they need to, they'll restrain
you with a Ghost infiltration key

371
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,842
and dispose of you.

372
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:18,178
I have no intention of letting
anyone infiltrate my Ghost again.

373
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,180
No matter who they are.

374
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,523
That woman is Motoko Kusanagi?

375
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,860
Yes, your senior. Can you win?

376
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,823
If you wish.

377
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,809
You really came?

378
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,895
I did promise.

379
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,689
I haven't prepared anything.

380
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,232
I figured.

381
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:21,158
But first, we'll take care of this.

382
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:37,424
I checked out the Qhardi gang, but there's
no trace of their tactical commander.

383
00:28:37,508 --> 00:28:41,387
Ah, but I've got the
rental server they used.

384
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,597
Multiple invaders into
a public facility...

385
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,889
Bastards have made good
progress on their tunnels.

386
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,016
<i>Do you know where they're going yet?</i>

387
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,604
<i>It's someplace to do with water
and precision machinery.</i>

388
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,565
<i>78 places in the city
fit that description.</i>

389
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,943
<i>Check them all.</i>

390
00:28:56,026 --> 00:29:00,114
Damn... I'd make easier money being
an Intelligence subcontractor.

391
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,283
<i>So, still in your "tune-up"?</i>

392
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:05,619
<i>Yes. I'm dropping this
connection for a while.</i>

393
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:11,959
I can hear noise. Your coworkers are
in and out of your lobby nonstop, huh?

394
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,876
I ran them all off.

395
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:17,631
You think I'll ever get
to be in your lobby?

396
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,216
If you work with me.

397
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:23,095
If I said I needed one more
person, would you come?

398
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:28,434
Tuning you up whenever I want
is an attractive proposition,

399
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:32,271
but I don't get involved with
the military or the police.

400
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:33,814
Oh.

401
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,610
I did some first aid on
your sensory components.

402
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:41,237
Let's do the detail
work in the lab.

403
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:44,825
The pain is gone. I'll
do the rest myself.

404
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,914
Then let's get started.

405
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:00,798
I remember when I first
met you, you know.

406
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,679
All the other engineers said you were
the queen of customer complaints.

407
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,849
Is that why they handed me off
to a freelancer like you?

408
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,642
Nope. The truth is,
I asked them to.

409
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,103
What?

410
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:21,361
<i>You couldn't decide whether you should
treat your body as a thing or a person.</i>

411
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:23,614
<i>That made me interested in you.</i>

412
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,330
At the facility I was in before,

413
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:35,499
they thought I was an oddball for wanting
to sleep in a bed and take showers.

414
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,545
When I was prosthetized on the
battlefield, they told me,

415
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:43,174
"A cyborg doesn't need everyday
life; he needs equipment."

416
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:46,345
That's why I switched to
prosthetics engineering.

417
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,515
I wanted to be a tech who'd
treat cyborgs like humans.

418
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:56,063
<i>As a kid, they gave me everyday-living
training outside the facility.</i>

419
00:30:56,146 --> 00:30:59,191
<i>So I'd learn how to be more human.</i>

420
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:03,987
<i>I don't really remember it.
Everything was so bright...</i>

421
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,033
I remember I came back
ahead of schedule.

422
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:14,038
But... That day I decided
to make my body orthodox.

423
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,165
I wanted to look human.

424
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:20,003
Your prosthetic body isn't a
thing. It's your real body.

425
00:31:20,004 --> 00:31:23,840
It mustn't be treated as a thing...
not by anyone.

426
00:31:25,175 --> 00:31:26,718
Not by me.

427
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,221
I do wish that were true.

428
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,932
I'll show you proof.

429
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,559
Proof?

430
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,896
It's a surprise.

431
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,277
<i>We're missing the key
piece: the bomb.</i>

432
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,239
<i>How did they get it into a
heavily guarded meeting place?</i>

433
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,448
What about the perps?

434
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:51,199
They say they're the
ones who blew it up.

435
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,413
Despite the fact that they
have no memory of the bomb.

436
00:31:54,496 --> 00:31:57,916
They're fall guys. They probably
have nothing to do with the bomb.

437
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,045
We'll monitor all 78 locations until
we can narrow down their target.

438
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,797
Are you serious?!

439
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,924
Contact me if something happens.

440
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,762
You're wearing heels...

441
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:14,766
Should we assume the ex-military
prosthetics tech is joining the team?

442
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,063
Maybe that's actually for real.

443
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:34,409
This is what you wanted to show me?

444
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,455
They're regular customers of mine.

445
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,498
Their average age is 70.

446
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,793
They're all full-body cyborgs...

447
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:45,464
The affluent elderly are at the core
of cyborg development these days.

448
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,132
Not soldiers.

449
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:52,469
They want prosthetic bodies to give them
second lives, and fulfilling lifestyles.

450
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,600
More and more foods for cyborgs are being
developed to meet their needs, too.

451
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,651
Try it.

452
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,664
It's good.

453
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:22,334
Is it your first time allocating
memory to your sense of taste?

454
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,713
The new bride is
pregnant, by the way.

455
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:31,635
Exciting, isn't it? A new world
of humans that don't distinguish

456
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:34,888
between prosthetic and flesh.

457
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:37,516
You really are strange.

458
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:51,655
Some people reject the future.
And some are left behind by it, too.

459
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:59,079
I want to bring the cyborg
future to the third world.

460
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,250
Will you come with me?

461
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:11,425
You should use your power freely, not work
under a bunch of master manipulators.

462
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,345
The war is over, you know.

463
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,097
No, it's still going.

464
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:20,767
The nations it grew inconvenient
for pulled out, that's all.

465
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:27,107
I have things to do
in this country.

466
00:34:28,108 --> 00:34:29,526
I see.

467
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,737
Do you have free time later?

468
00:34:31,862 --> 00:34:35,282
If we share a lobby, we can
meet whenever we want.

469
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,617
I might touch your Ghost.

470
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,536
I'll let down my barrier.

471
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,956
- Are you sure? - If you infiltrate
me, I may fry your brain.

472
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:45,041
It might be worth it.

473
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:09,983
This is your body.

474
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,904
These are your hands.

475
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,181
Motoko, run!

476
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,634
Akira!

477
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,971
Are you all right?

478
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:22,556
Yeah...

479
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:33,650
I'm sorry. This is my fault.

480
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:15,066
My condolences.

481
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,736
Paz is with Section 9
inspecting the scene.

482
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,614
Your attacker was a pro,
even if he did mess up.

483
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,657
It's unclear whether this
was tied to the bombing,

484
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,785
but we'd normally give you
police protection at this point.

485
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,246
I don't need it. How is he?

486
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:30,652
We'll send him home as soon as
we're done questioning him.

487
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,918
I'll assign someone to
him, so don't worry.

488
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:33,960
I see.

489
00:37:34,044 --> 00:37:37,297
The military authorities won't
give me any information on Scylla.

490
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,299
What's your connection to him?

491
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:44,262
Call me whenever you need help.

492
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,601
Scylla's revenge, eh?

493
00:37:49,726 --> 00:37:54,105
Good thing your boyfriend's a civilian.
We don't have to suspect a leak.

494
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,609
<i>They got us.</i>

495
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:01,446
<i>Number Three: a materials
control center on the coast.</i>

496
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:05,784
<i>I picked up a go order in Scylla's
name 30 seconds before the explosion.</i>

497
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:09,287
<i>Then the whole line disappeared. At this
rate, there's no point in surveillance.</i>

498
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:12,999
<i>Find a weapons engineer on their
customer list who's connected to this.</i>

499
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,501
<i>Weapons engineer?</i>

500
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:17,128
<i>Get info from the first
victims, too. Hurry up.</i>

501
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,673
<i>Find something. The virus, the
bombs, the tactical commander,</i>

502
00:38:19,756 --> 00:38:23,760
<i>where the messages from "Scylla"
come from... I don't care what.</i>

503
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:30,308
How about you finally tell us why
you're so sure Scylla's dead?

504
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,851
Excuse me.

505
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:34,187
You!

506
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,190
I was told I could find
Major Kusanagi here.

507
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,483
What is it?

508
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:46,157
State your business.

509
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:49,995
The list I got from him was a fake.

510
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,205
And a detective working a
weapons trafficking case

511
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:55,166
was killed right after
getting info from him.

512
00:38:55,291 --> 00:39:02,007
Techs get blamed for prosthetics
-related incidents all the time.

513
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:06,219
And the manager of the dam
that exploded the other day...

514
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,555
Hose outfitted her bodyguard, too.

515
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,015
So what?!

516
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:14,561
How did you feel, watching your
lover get attacked in front of you?

517
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:19,691
You're angry at the perp,
and you feel guilty.

518
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:22,527
You think it was your
fault he got attacked.

519
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:29,576
He was the same way.
Anger and guilt.

520
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,745
He's hiding something.

521
00:39:31,828 --> 00:39:36,583
The dam, the dead detective, the
prosthetics, and even you, Major...

522
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:39,377
Everything links
back to Akira Hose.

523
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:45,112
You're just a cheap detective
snooping around with flesh eyes!

524
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:47,218
Never show your face here again!

525
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:53,099
Ouch.

526
00:40:14,704 --> 00:40:16,956
You're an idiot, Colonel!

527
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,251
An attack barrier!

528
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,961
Keep calm.

529
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:24,964
If the domestic faction takes
away your arms industry rights,

530
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,966
you'll be killed by the cartels.

531
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,470
Yet you're in a rush to kill
me off and steal my data?

532
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:34,599
So, you act like a heavyweight, but
you couldn't get my people released?

533
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,976
Where is the data?

534
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,271
Our deal is over. I'm
thankful for the info on her

535
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:44,818
and for Scylla's revival,
but I'm leaving this country.

536
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,152
You do the same.

537
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:47,779
No need.

538
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:58,123
We've successfully packaged
the virus with cyberbrains.

539
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,837
We'll use your cyberbrain
for the final upgrade.

540
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,631
Become Scylla, just
like you wanted to.

541
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,977
"His hands stayed open
after he burned", eh?

542
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:41,207
<i>It's just like the call said.</i>

543
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:44,544
<i>Two Public Security officers killed,
and Akira Hose's whereabouts unknown.</i>

544
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,504
<i>The Major wasn't the target?</i>

545
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,131
<i>Hey, look at this list.</i>

546
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:54,345
<i>It's only a guess, but I think the FAEs
were the prosthetic limbs themselves.</i>

547
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:57,724
<i>There was another full-cyborg guard
in that part of the building.</i>

548
00:41:57,807 --> 00:42:01,019
<i>The limbs' admin records have
the same signature on them...</i>

549
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:06,024
What are you doing?

550
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,361
Who is this man?!

551
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,910
My attack barrier
expands every second.

552
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,078
If you don't want your
brain fried, tell me!

553
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,914
He'll die!

554
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:26,085
He gave us power...
He's the new Scylla!

555
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:32,008
It was like magic. A battle-learning
program left to us by the dead Scylla...

556
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,595
He gave it to my cyberbrain,
along with the virus.

557
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,099
I'd never been trained, but now
I can fight even your people!

558
00:42:40,225 --> 00:42:42,101
Give me a name.

559
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:46,356
Akira Hose!
He's Japanese, like you!

560
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,200
Hose escaped. Any idea where?

561
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:58,785
Why ask me?

562
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,454
What are your eyes
looking at right now?

563
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,251
Zhinzhee Bekka Arr Thied.

564
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:12,298
She's boss of a Kuzan water company, and
most likely the weapons ring's sponsor.

565
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:15,218
<i>So this is the tunnel exit!</i>

566
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,721
<i>A domestic weapons company...
Harimadara Heavy Industries!</i>

567
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:22,642
<i>The execs are touring Factory One with
the Senior Vice-Minister of Defense!</i>

568
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:25,645
<i>Recommend a barrier, and
give the data to Section 9.</i>

569
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:28,606
<i>Paz, Borma, Saito, get over there.</i>

570
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,987
Call the bomb squad and
a prosthetics tech.

571
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,823
A destructive cyber-attack
is more than likely.

572
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,997
What's the meaning of
this, Chief Aramaki?

573
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,832
Evacuate immediately.

574
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:49,127
You and this facility are targets.

575
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,920
Wh... What's going on?!

576
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,342
It's a bomb! Run!

577
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,517
- Damn.
- Shit!

578
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,853
Paz, Borma! This way!

579
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:12,191
Help me! Help me!

580
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,869
<i>Crap, the fire's
closing up my throat.</i>

581
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:25,371
<i>Mine too. That was close.</i>

582
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:28,541
Vice-Minister, are you all right?

583
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:30,168
I'm fine.

584
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,551
- Log/coma.
- Yes, sir!

585
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,180
That's one of our products...!

586
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,393
Away from the windows!

587
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:54,400
That's all the info
on Colonel Hozumi.

588
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:59,405
That's fine. We get a card,
and you get a grace period.

589
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:03,076
Please tell me what she
has to do with Scylla!

590
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:07,580
Find out from her. Your
contaminated brain is intriguing,

591
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:10,375
but I'm cutting our connection
before the infection spreads.

592
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,756
Goodbye.

593
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,226
Contaminated, eh?

594
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:31,938
I'm being bankrupted by a special
tax on foreign companies?!

595
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:34,440
How can this be allowed?!

596
00:45:34,524 --> 00:45:37,026
It's the kind of thing the
domestic faction would do.

597
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:41,948
What do you plan to do?
Kill the colonel?

598
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:45,618
She's all washed up.
And so are you and I.

599
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:55,420
Escape, and obey the
domestic faction.

600
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:59,799
Your company will be crushed under
the pretext of this nation's taxes.

601
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:02,247
You'll be killed by the cartels
if you don't do something.

602
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:06,764
<i>You okay, Major?</i>

603
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:10,810
<i>No problems. You go with that
detective and subdue the guards.</i>

604
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:15,314
<i>I'll take care of Scylla.</i>

605
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:23,114
Jeez, so stubborn.
That's a scary lady.

606
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:31,330
What? A Mateba,
in this day and age?

607
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:34,834
What's wrong with that?!
It's the gun I trust the most.

608
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:48,681
Blood traces. Someone was shot.

609
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,522
A bullet...

610
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:17,835
Ariel. So these are
the prosthetic bombs.

611
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:40,650
That wasn't you just now.
Who the hell infiltrated my vision?!

612
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,568
Don't move!

613
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:50,701
In that quagmire of a war, Scylla was
the only soldier I could empathize with.

614
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:53,788
I've always wanted to ask
you why he was killed.

615
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:59,752
You didn't kill Scylla.
I finally realized that.

616
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:06,425
Go home. Or your
Ariel will activate.

617
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,261
<i>Even I can't stop it.</i>

618
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:39,292
<i>What's going on here? That bastard
infiltrated my vision exactly the way you do!</i>

619
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,127
<i>Answer me, Major!</i>

620
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:02,648
What's taking the Army so long?!
We'll all die like this!

621
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:04,483
<i>It's been seized.</i>

622
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:07,486
<i>It won't stop until we shut down
whatever it's packaged with.</i>

623
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,322
<i>Transplanted memories.</i>

624
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,156
<i>What?</i>

625
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:14,118
<i>The packaged cyberbrains
are the virus's hosts.</i>

626
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,456
<i>They converted the tactical program
I set loose in Qhardistan to memory.</i>

627
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,790
<i>My copy</i>

628
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,464
What the hell are you saying?!

629
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:36,015
Motoko.

630
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:07,880
I came after you, but in
the end, you captured me.

631
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:12,176
It was my cyberbrain
that was packaged.

632
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:15,554
If you pull the trigger, you and
your comrades will be saved.

633
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:21,727
What you fell in love
with was this world.

634
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:29,068
Just keep on going, until
the day you're betrayed.

635
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,908
Scylla...

636
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,910
I'm glad I met you.

637
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,273
What?

638
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,108
It stopped...

639
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:19,577
It's ironic.

640
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:24,248
They manage to survive a world war,
then get stuck in an endless one,

641
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,459
and finally end their own lives.

642
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,628
Apparently there's no
other way they can stop.

643
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,630
Weren't you the same?

644
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:35,468
Scylla was you.

645
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:39,096
You helped the separatist
army, then faked your death.

646
00:51:39,138 --> 00:51:42,808
Later, the guerillas you
led were all killed.

647
00:51:42,892 --> 00:51:46,979
I can see why you wouldn't
want to remember that op.

648
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:50,983
Since then, I've stopped
switching bodies so often.

649
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:56,155
It gives me an identity crisis.
I lose track of who I am...

650
00:51:56,322 --> 00:52:00,659
and then I want someone to
tell me I'm not a robot.

651
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:07,666
<i>Is that why you insist on making original
tweaks to your mass-production bases?</i>

652
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:11,796
<i>It's amazing you even managed to control
so many bodies in such a short time.</i>

653
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,965
<i>I'm going to sleep a little.
You can go.</i>

654
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:16,842
<i>Call it cyborg solidarity.</i>

655
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:20,513
<i>I'll keep watch and make sure they
don't fit you with any sketchy parts.</i>

656
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,015
<i>All right, suit yourself.</i>

657
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:26,018
You could at least say "thanks"!

658
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:34,026
The bullet at the scene was fired
from the lieutenant's gun.

659
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:36,987
I also found Mizuki's weapon
at the lieutenant's home.

660
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:39,532
There was a huge deposit
into his account, too.

661
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:46,205
Good work. You can go.

662
00:52:58,050 --> 00:53:00,719
Arresting a fellow cop will
make you some enemies.

663
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:06,851
You'll be shot from behind
by the guys at his local.

664
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:10,855
I'll be sure to watch my back.
Did you come just to say that?

665
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,525
Will you join my team?

666
00:53:16,235 --> 00:53:18,988
It's an independent offensive
unit with top priority.

667
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,907
Oh, excuse me.

668
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:24,410
Hello?

669
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:27,538
What?! I thought it'd
be another two weeks!

670
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:31,375
No, sorry, got it.
I'll be right there.

671
00:53:31,417 --> 00:53:33,919
This is big! Her water broke!

672
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:35,546
Huh?

673
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,840
We're gonna have a baby!

674
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,092
Just wait, I'll be right there!

675
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,011
We'll talk another time.

676
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,095

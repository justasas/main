1
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:24,149
Per the Special Anti-Terrorism Measures Act,

2
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,653
we now place all terminals in the designated area
under Public Security's electronic control.

3
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:28,904
"Give back our water!"

4
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,531
<i>Anticipating that cyberterrorism against
Harimadara Heavy Industries will lead</i>

5
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:34,035
- <i>to a shutdown of operations, Home Affairs has...</i>
- <i>HQ to Squad 357.</i>

6
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:36,579
<i>Transfer command to Section 9.</i>

7
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,706
<i>This is Priority One.</i>

8
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,918
Murderers!

9
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:45,087
Murderers!!

10
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:46,756
Give back our water!

11
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,591
<i>- Give back our water!! - Despite increasingly
fierce protests, a contract has just been signed</i>

12
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:51,260
- <i>Despite increasingly fierce protests,
a contract has just been signed</i>

13
00:00:51,302 --> 00:00:55,431
<i>between a Kuzan water company
and the Japanese giant Harimadara.</i>

14
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,075
"Give water to the war orphans!!"

15
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:16,535
"Give water to the war orphans!"

16
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:27,254
It's starting.

17
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,799
All channels within the revised limits are clear.

18
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:32,635
All Home Affairs
and MLIT lines now under our control.

19
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:33,969
Ready for domination.

20
00:01:34,011 --> 00:01:35,179
Begin.

21
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:59,662
All lifelines, surveillance, etc.
for the building and roads now dominated.

22
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:04,166
Profiling cyberbrains and terminals of
4,022 people in the area.

23
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,002
1,102 require follow-up.

24
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:11,340
<i>Aramaki! I'm not giving you my crime scene!</i>

25
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:15,511
<i>This is Section 6.
Who said you could infiltrate our comm lines?!</i>

26
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:20,599
We need to prevent casualties,
not play departmental musical chairs!

27
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:24,478
Or will you take the fall when we can't
even pin down their means of attack?!

28
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:28,190
<i>Chief Aramaki, explain yourself.</i>

29
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:30,276
Vice-Minister Kitahara.

30
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:34,196
I thought you were attending the celebratory banquet?

31
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,866
<i>What you warned me of is happening, then?</i>

32
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:42,705
We got an anonymous tip that
a Qhardi group mobilized three hours ago.

33
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:43,956
<i>Anonymous?</i>

34
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:45,916
<i>Can you trust it?</i>

35
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:52,214
<i>Yes. The Yotsubashi Building area is
definitely the target.</i>

36
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:57,219
The old ape's sure fired up,
considering we're flying blind here.

37
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,723
Batou, this is the outfit
we've been after ever since

38
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:03,559
the cyber-contamination at Harimadara
four months ago.

39
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,812
"We"? You mean you.

40
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,732
Did you make this, Major?

41
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,401
It ain't a toy, rookie.

42
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:15,070
It's a military-grade virtual comm link.

43
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:17,489
It's almost impossible for hackers to listen in.

44
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,077
Section 9 forced the domination through.
We'll have orders soon.

45
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:26,916
Nab one of the terrorists.
I want bait to draw out our prey.

46
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:32,379
Is it that super-wizard-class hacker,
Fire-Starter?

47
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,842
<i>Isn't that just what you want?</i>

48
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:40,930
<i>We don't even know if there's really
someone pulling the strings.</i>

49
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,433
<i>What I want is to formally establish
my spec ops team.</i>

50
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,186
<i>If you're scared of unknown enemies, drop out.</i>

51
00:03:47,228 --> 00:03:48,729
<i>Piss off.</i>

52
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:56,278
"Corporate Killers"

53
00:03:56,987 --> 00:04:00,199
Our status as an independent
offensive unit is riding on this.

54
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:03,953
Public Security handles the incident,
and we handle what caused it.

55
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,454
Go.

56
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,271
The enemy just gave the go-ahead.

57
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:13,188
Capture them!

58
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:23,782
You deserve this...
Greedy rich-country bastards!

59
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:36,211
Today, we've followed the principle
of free trade

60
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:39,923
to maintain fair prices that will spur
postwar economic recovery.

61
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,849
This was his only weapon.
Something's fishy.

62
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,868
The riot squad opened fire?!

63
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,980
<i>The west team's slaughtering protesters.</i>

64
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,732
Some are even shooting other cops!

65
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,111
It's the biggest simultaneous Ghost Hack ever.

66
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,114
It's crazy, but it's the only explanation.

67
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:48,534
There's no tech that'd control
100 people at once.

68
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:51,036
The perps on my watch are all dead, too.

69
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:54,915
Check the riot squad's lines
and find out what caused the attack.

70
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,959
There's a log that might be Starter's, but...

71
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,545
Then this isn't hacking.
It's a virus.

72
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,922
I don't see one in the sequence.

73
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:04,800
It's a self-destructing Stuxnet-type.

74
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:09,721
Someone must be sending packaged
actions meant to control groups.

75
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,159
You,eh?

76
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:43,464
I made a deal with the devil
for the sake of rebuilding and independence!

77
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,467
Just like you wanted!

78
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:49,845
And it invited a second slaughter
by water and e-money

79
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:53,682
to follow the first slaughter with guns!

80
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:56,351
- You said cyberbrain tech and the prosthetics industry
- I want a media blackout now.

81
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:57,686
- Would build us a future,
- This is Priority One!

82
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:02,024
But hope wasn't
what they brought to Qhardistan!

83
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:04,651
They merely sowed the seeds of betrayal

84
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,362
that would grow to bleed away my people's pride!

85
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:10,532
Have a taste of what that felt like!

86
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:14,369
Then you'll have no choice
but to grant me asylum!

87
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:18,040
Because this is a civilized, pacifist nation!

88
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,042
<i>Oh, is it?</i>

89
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:58,872
Optical camouflage!

90
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:02,793
<i>You can't stop Fire-Starter.</i>

91
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,837
Someone hacked my line?!

92
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:18,475
<i>Major?!</i>

93
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:19,935
<i>Saito!</i>

94
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,740
Shit.

95
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,421
Hello!

96
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,091
Give me a weapon!

97
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,426
Okay!

98
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,469
<i>Major, I'll be right there!</i>

99
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,806
<i>Don't be stupid.
Go after the one who hacked me!</i>

100
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,656
On your knees!

101
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,994
I'll shoot you dead if you resist.

102
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,096
That was outta nowhere!

103
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,016
This was your job, moron!

104
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,812
Sorry! That was an accident.

105
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,356
Equip some handrails!

106
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,527
<i>Do it, Saito.</i>

107
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,207
<i>I let him get away, sorry!</i>

108
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,471
"Section 9 Office"

109
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:25,977
You finally take the job,
and then you execute someone on the national Net?

110
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,064
Who, me? You have no proof.

111
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:31,316
Are you claiming you had no choice?

112
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,528
You're a super-wizard-class hacker
in an ace unit.

113
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:38,573
Was the Army overestimating you
when it rated you five stars?

114
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,328
Tell me about the virus and that heavy cyborg girl.

115
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:47,916
No cyber-virus was detected.
The girl's name is Emma Tsuda.

116
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:52,170
Apparently she's famous on the Net
as a game app maker.

117
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,923
Nine hours after her arrest,
that's all you've got?

118
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,760
I guess a former Special A Rank inspector
for the Army like you

119
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,430
gets to have lots of talented subordinates.

120
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:06,476
My people's dedicated effort got
multiple perps captured alive.

121
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:11,106
Wow, great work arresting
some mindless packaged drones.

122
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,194
We could've stopped it
if we'd had special authority.

123
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:21,283
Then stop playing gangsters and join Section 9.

124
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,201
Unless you work directly for Home Affairs,

125
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:27,205
you <i>do</i> get official oversight
and you <i>don't</i> get secrecy.

126
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:30,208
Can you guarantee I'd be able to stay myself?

127
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,045
Cutting-edge equipment can protect
cyberbrains and prosthetic bodies.

128
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,631
And my Ghost? My beliefs?

129
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:40,927
Depends on how skilled you are.
I'll even consider a budget.

130
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,805
Create an international counterterrorist agency for us

131
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,974
with the same budget as the Rangers.

132
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:52,230
I'm gonna go eat.

133
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:56,651
Aramaki, it's been a while.

134
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:03,784
Colonel Hozumi.
What brings Army intelligence here?

135
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:08,455
I'll take the girl now.

136
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:09,664
Care to explain?

137
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:14,336
They're from a squad I trust.

138
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:20,133
Ex-major Motoko Kusanagi, of the 501.

139
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:23,345
Hated your master so much
you became a stray, eh?

140
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:26,306
Your intel's dated.
They recreated my rank.

141
00:13:28,391 --> 00:13:33,355
The cyber-virus used is crucial for us to investigate.

142
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,358
Explain why it's crucial, please.

143
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:41,696
It's a triple package of brainwashing,
Ghost infiltration, and false memory creation.

144
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:46,034
False memory? Last I checked,
the government doesn't admit that's possible,

145
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,495
despite all the reports.

146
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:54,459
Virus units entered this country via a certain broker.

147
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:59,714
Trust me: You won't even manage to indict that girl.

148
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:03,552
Unfortunately, she's been transferred to Unit 501.

149
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:04,636
When?

150
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:08,306
The moment I agreed to their request for cooperation.

151
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,893
I've never thought you were clever, but this?

152
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:15,647
You'll regret any foolish stubbornness.

153
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:27,242
Terror by false memories...

154
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:30,537
Your claims are finally proven, Major.

155
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:34,124
So is the existence of a virus
that enables Ghost-hacking.

156
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:38,545
Here's your next job: Escort the girl to Unit 501.

157
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:41,089
What? There was really a request?

158
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:45,719
Signed by the Defense Minister.
Now give me one of your men in exchange.

159
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,222
Did your scary ex-colleague make you want a guard?

160
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:52,726
I want information sharing.
Go renew old workplace friendships.

161
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:54,936
Can I ask one thing?

162
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,438
What is it?

163
00:14:56,521 --> 00:15:00,025
Assuming I did shoot her...

164
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,862
...why didn't you use my Ghost
infiltration key to stop me?

165
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:08,658
I can't answer hypothetical questions.

166
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,119
I see.

167
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:16,875
This is Dr. Zhinzhee Bekka Arr Thied,
the one the Major killed.

168
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:20,921
She's Qhardi, but she graduated
from Kuzan Royal University as Valedictorian.

169
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:25,759
A big player in Kuzan water importation
since the provisional government days.

170
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,640
But she supported terrorism when she realized
the world would forsake her people, eh?

171
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:35,393
She's smart and she's got motive,
but she's not a hacker.

172
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,229
Someone else packaged this.

173
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,732
What about the girl we captured?

174
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:45,320
Her name's Emma Tsuda.
A 17-year-old war orphan.

175
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:50,158
She makes hit cyberbrain games,
which she copyrights under the name "Tin Man".

176
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:53,119
<i>"Tin Man"... As in The Wizard of Oz?</i>

177
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,829
What's that?

178
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:59,626
- <i>In spite of everything, I still believe</i>
- <i>Supposing</i> she's a <i>teenage super-hacker, how does she fit in?</i>

179
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,170
- <i>that people are really good at heart</i>
- <i>Don't tell me</i> she's <i>the one you're after?</i>

180
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:06,174
- I wish to go on living even after my death.
- I'll know when I dive into her Ghost.

181
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:10,095
Ishikawa, stay on the virus and the girl.
Saito, you go to Section 9.

182
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:12,472
Paz and Borma, you release the bait.

183
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:16,017
Batou, Togusa, and I will escort the girl.

184
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,811
We're starting the second round.

185
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:24,025
Suggestion for you,
Miss "Hothead Who Charges In Blind".

186
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:28,863
How about I become team leader
and lead us in a sensible retreat?

187
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:32,158
Brave thing to say in my cyberbrain space.

188
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:38,164
Step outside and let's fight!

189
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:41,793
Whoa, knock it off, you guys!

190
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,903
He's finally on the move.

191
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,989
Thought I'd die of boredom!

192
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,166
It might be cool if we could ride in you.

193
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:25,420
The Major requested a personnel transport shaft
from the Maintenance Department!

194
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,589
Will we pilot you from inside?

195
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,718
Isn't that our mobile arsenal?
Where would the weapons go?

196
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:37,599
We can just resupply each other.
If we armed this guy, he could be our backup.

197
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,601
Backup,eh?

198
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:43,063
Why are we using an outdated Logistics model?

199
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:48,109
Ape-Face couldn't get the budget the Major wanted,
so he gave us these bots.

200
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:51,946
Neurochip-type Als are hard to hack or infect, anyway.

201
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,449
So basically, it was us or the junkyard?

202
00:17:54,532 --> 00:18:00,872
What? Not good enough
for the ex-cop still wearing a <i>necktie?</i>

203
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:05,752
My late father said looking classy
shows faith in yourself.

204
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,131
Watching you, ex-Ranger,
I see what he meant.

205
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,634
Bold words, kid.

206
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:20,141
Mr. Batou suggested modifying us
so people could ride us!

207
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:24,979
I think it's a really great idea!
What do you think, Major?

208
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:31,111
Don't talk nonsense. I hate machines
who pretend to have personalities.

209
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:34,155
She's here.

210
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:51,172
Did you hack my line to
deliberately get yourself caught?

211
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:56,344
What is "Fire-Starter"?
Is it really the name of a hacker?

212
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:02,642
Intelligence wants you.
Military courts don't do plea bargains, you know.

213
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,772
I smell seawater.

214
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:13,153
We aren't even allowed near the sea.

215
00:19:13,194 --> 00:19:18,449
Programmers are like weapons:
We're forbidden by law from moving freely.

216
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:22,120
So you are the group's hacker.
What are you after?

217
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:28,543
Long ago, glassblowers had no freedom,
because glasswork funded the state.

218
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:33,298
If they left the country,
they were blinded first.

219
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:36,676
You're a refugee?
That's why you started a massacre?

220
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:42,348
Do you think cyberbrains make people happy?

221
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:51,774
Are your memories trustworthy?
Or were they planted by someone?

222
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:59,908
When micromachine-based cyberization came to pass,
experts worldwide warned us:

223
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:03,578
"False memories will be used to commit crimes".

224
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,333
Every organization wants that technology.
My technology.

225
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:12,420
You mean you successfully made
memory-manipulation tech?

226
00:20:12,462 --> 00:20:15,757
Your memories might even be...

227
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:20,511
I'm diving right here, right now!

228
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,513
Saw that coming.

229
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:27,518
We don't know what this virus is.
What if you're infected?

230
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,230
I'll blow it away, and her cyberbrain with it.

231
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:35,860
A hacker who commits mass murder
just to escape deserves assassination.

232
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,528
During your dive?!

233
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,240
Your cyber warfare style is twisted.

234
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:43,284
I prefer the term "super-wizard-class".

235
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:48,206
"Wizard"... Magician.
Magician who can't go home...

236
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,084
I'm diving straight in through her line.

237
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,086
Uh-huh, ignore protocol.

238
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,964
Hey, something's weird.

239
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:02,262
You're being hacked!
They're doing it through her cyberbrain!

240
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:06,641
What's going on?
This isn't just backfire!

241
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:10,270
Emma... Danger... Emma...

242
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,943
You...

243
00:21:25,827 --> 00:21:27,328
Major!

244
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:35,044
I'm sorry, Emma... I'm sorry.

245
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:38,548
It's okay. I wanted this.

246
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,175
Don't cry, Brinda.

247
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:46,097
There are two Ghosts in there?

248
00:21:56,024 --> 00:21:58,860
I heard about Section 9's meddling.

249
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:02,864
You couldn't have shot her
before she started blabbing about asylum?

250
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:06,534
That shooting is currently under investigation,
Deputy Director Amagata.

251
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:12,165
I can imagine the profound effects
this incident will have

252
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:16,836
on the Next-Generation Weapons
Review Committee you serve on.

253
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,630
The year-end industry fair has been cancelled.

254
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,299
And thanks to pressure from
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

255
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,802
we won't be unveiling
our prototype weapons, either.

256
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,513
It's shaking the foundations of the company.

257
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:33,061
I hear you're pressing for large-scale water sales
even after Dr. Thied's death.

258
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:35,730
I have a duty to fulfill my contract.

259
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:40,485
And effective use of resources is key
for an international company.

260
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:44,155
There are some out there
who can't even secure drinking water.

261
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:48,076
If you just want to criticize my economics,
I'm going back to work.

262
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,920
You're not cut out for government work.

263
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:02,757
Start an NPO and go live
in some refugee camp.

264
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:09,430
He's annoying.

265
00:23:09,472 --> 00:23:13,768
He's a classic ex-politician,
and he owes me one from my intelligence days.

266
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:16,437
Which means he's a reliable source.

267
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:21,442
NPOs, camps... and Foreign Affairs?

268
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,278
The council on weapons development!

269
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:28,574
Was that the objective behind
the cyberterrorism against Harimadara?

270
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,284
Lately there's a debate about
whether next-gen weapons

271
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:34,455
should be produced domestically
or developed abroad.

272
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:39,710
The overseas faction'd be thrilled
if a domestic manufacturer got attacked.

273
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:43,965
Here we go: an NPO that
"treats cyberization disorders".

274
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,551
They disseminated cyberization and learning devices

275
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:49,720
in refugee camps in Kuzan during the war.

276
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,389
And domestically?

277
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:55,810
Got a hit on that girl
in the same NPO's treatment records.

278
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:58,104
Cyberization rejection syndrome.

279
00:23:58,146 --> 00:23:59,814
Apparently she ran away

280
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,316
from a war orphan facility
because she rejected being cyberized.

281
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:05,820
Not wanting a cyberbrain means you're sick?

282
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:09,282
The white paper on cyberization
the MHLW released after the war

283
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,492
classifies it with anorexia.

284
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:13,703
That's news to me.

285
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:17,832
The cyberization business is insanely big money.

286
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:23,087
Pretty predictable that people
who don't want it get treated as sick.

287
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:26,257
Could she be a genuine multiple personality?

288
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:31,179
The prevailing theory is that
personalities split but Ghosts don't.

289
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,264
The issue is, what did that NPO

290
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:37,685
have to do with a business deal motivated
by military development?

291
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:41,689
Go at the military-industrial complex from
both ends: soldiers and companies.

292
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:56,037
It's me. The others got caught.

293
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:03,252
Don't worry, you'll see them in the afterlife.

294
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:09,425
Hello!

295
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:11,719
Y-You a cop?

296
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:20,061
L-I prepared a confession.
Let me call my lawyer--

297
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:24,398
You're not getting that chance.

298
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,403
You killed our bait,
so you're gonna tell us everything.

299
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,371
Started to miss your old home?

300
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:44,252
I'm only hereto bring in your witness,
Lt. Col. Kurutsu.

301
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:48,589
Tsumugi is standing by.
Dive if you want to.

302
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:51,050
Assuming she has a Ghost, that is.

303
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:52,927
What do you mean?

304
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,720
I'm stepping out.

305
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:59,016
As a member of the committee,
I need to be at Harimadara's product inspection.

306
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:02,353
Still obsessed with getting promoted?

307
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:05,022
It's something you ran away without doing.

308
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,758
Nice to see you, Kusanagi.

309
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,720
I didn't think we'd have
another chance to work with you.

310
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,305
Are these your men?

311
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,266
Yes. Batou and Togusa.

312
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:44,812
This is Tsumugi Dokuro.
They're both cyber warfare tactical officers.

313
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:48,816
"Both"?
Are they sharing a body?

314
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:52,153
She says they're two identical twins
in one conjoined body.

315
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:55,156
I dunno how they move.

316
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,532
The world's full of surprises.

317
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,455
Let's get started.

318
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:13,633
So, only the body came back.

319
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,176
What do you mean?

320
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:18,804
She's a technical officer in
Lt. Col. Kurutsu's command.

321
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:24,018
She was investigating a hacker
with a special neurochip-type cyberbrain.

322
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,811
He's known as "Scarecrow",

323
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:29,190
and he's a suspect in the terrorist
attack on Harimadara.

324
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:32,318
Another Oz character?

325
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,110
Huh?

326
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:39,033
Our conclusion is that he's a special spy
based on postwar tech.

327
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,786
Emma was the one who reasoned it out.

328
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:45,373
She hypothesized a hacker
with the same disorder she had.

329
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,792
Someone who had to incrementally
replace his brain with neurochips

330
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,877
and prosthetize his body to survive.

331
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:52,588
She had that disorder?

332
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:57,510
Personality attenuates, and self hood can't be
retained without auxiliary cyberbrains.

333
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,182
Emma transformed her impairment
into her signature trait, as did Scarecrow.

334
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:06,560
Emma regularly used advanced cyberization
to structure her self hood,

335
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,562
but Scarecrow is different.

336
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:11,857
To compensate for his attenuated personality,
he dubs the Ghosts of others,

337
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,652
steals their bodies,
and assumes their identities.

338
00:28:14,694 --> 00:28:18,406
Like the scarecrow who can't think
inserting a false brain into his head.

339
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,157
Seriously?

340
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,368
In other words, this is...

341
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:27,164
The body is Emma's,
but it's being operated by a man's brain

342
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:31,335
which is only one-third the normal size
and cyberized with neurochips.

343
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:35,840
So what I dived into was
the girl's dubbed Ghost.

344
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:38,426
What happened to her brain?

345
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,511
Ghost Dubbing would've degraded it.

346
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:44,098
It's either in the trash or sliced up
in his research lab.

347
00:28:44,181 --> 00:28:45,349
That's awful...

348
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,062
Poor Emma. I'm sorry.

349
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:53,023
It's okay, Junior. Don't be afraid.

350
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,902
I know the lions will come.
The people with courage...

351
00:28:56,944 --> 00:29:00,406
Who are you?
Tell me who you work for.

352
00:29:00,448 --> 00:29:04,285
I am a scarecrow.
My brain is fading away.

353
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:07,371
I am tin.
My heart is fading away.

354
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:12,293
Is that Emma talking, or her dubbed Ghost?

355
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:15,129
Tin Girl, give me the scarecrow man's name.

356
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:23,095
His name is Brinda Jr.
Please, don't blame him.

357
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:30,227
<i>Got a hit at a postwar nursing home./
And the same NPO is involved with it.</i>

358
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:32,313
<i>Brinda Jr., age 32.</i>

359
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:35,649
<i>After he was cyberized,
he became an accountant at an employment agency.</i>

360
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,151
<i>His personality's thin,</i>

361
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:40,488
<i>but he memorized a ZOO-digit number
in two seconds for an IO fest.</i>

362
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,908
<i>That's textbook for someone with
special cognitive abilities.</i>

363
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:46,994
<i>Find out' which organization
set' him up as a hacker.</i>

364
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:48,496
<i>Roger.</i>

365
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:51,999
I'm diving into that man's Ghost.

366
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:55,461
There are only a handful of
proven double Ghosts in existence.

367
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:57,922
We don't know the dangers.

368
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:01,175
I want to know which Ghost has motive.

369
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:04,261
You're doubting Emma?
She's the victim here.

370
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,013
Then I'll confirm that.

371
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:09,433
Batou, be my backup
in case they back-hack me.

372
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:12,353
Two against two, eh?

373
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:19,985
Togusa. Get all the records copied.

374
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:24,615
Roger. Oh, here...
Sorry, it's a call from my dad.

375
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:29,036
Hey Dad, it's been a while. Yeah.

376
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,872
Batou! Restrain Togusa!

377
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:34,959
Got it. I'll become the Lion.

378
00:30:40,214 --> 00:30:42,049
A Mateba, still?

379
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:45,052
Don't move!

380
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,399
Major!

381
00:30:58,482 --> 00:30:59,984
Let's go.

382
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:07,366
<i>This is crazy! I found a Starter log
on his comm-it's the virus!</i>

383
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:11,996
He must have kept the virus inactive
within his neurochips.

384
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:14,081
His infiltration was unexpectedly quick.

385
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:17,793
So, it combines victims' memories of past hostility
with objects in front of them

386
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:21,422
to plant instantaneous false memories?

387
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,953
I can get deadly, right?

388
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:55,122
That was your last breath if you don't.

389
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:59,293
Don't underestimate me!

390
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:06,967
<i>The scarecrow is the virus's host
and Togusa's brain is the package, right?</i>

391
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:10,387
Yep. But the infection route's disturbingly selective.

392
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,806
Only people around you are being infected.

393
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:17,937
<i>Does that mean the onset can be regulated?</i>

394
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:21,482
<i>That'd be impossible without
a third party to switch it on.</i>

395
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:25,235
<i>Which I guess means it's a virus
whose damage can be controlled.</i>

396
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:29,782
<i>Then it's military.
Reanalyze yesterday's infection data.</i>

397
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:33,285
<i>We don't want to chase the virus;
we want to chase the enemy in possession of it.</i>

398
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:37,122
<i>I wish to go on living even after my death.</i>

399
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:38,457
Hidden data?

400
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:45,464
<i>For these 620 reasons,
we oppose cyberization without free choice.</i>

401
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:48,926
<i>Reason: We submit that software
within the cyberbrain</i>

402
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:54,139
<i>is vulnerable to third-party tampering.</i>

403
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:59,144
<i>Reason: Electronic alteration of
memory causes abnormalities</i>

404
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:03,524
<i>in the totality of our independent
will referred to as the ”Ghost'”.</i>

405
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:09,530
Do you actually think a world
without infection and infiltration is possible?!

406
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:13,450
<i>Tsumugi! You alive?</i>

407
00:33:14,201 --> 00:33:17,329
<i>I'm running a sim of the scarecrow's brain.
Help me.</i>

408
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:21,208
<i>You have Emma Tsuda's Ghost infiltration key,
don't you? Make me a backdoor.</i>

409
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,878
I see, you're going to use
Scarecrow's cyberbrain structure

410
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,880
to approximate a vaccine?

411
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:45,983
Reason: There are currently seventeen
possible ways to alter our memories.

412
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:46,984
Shit!

413
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:51,864
Major! Why won't you use my Ghost
infiltration key to stop this?!

414
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:55,075
It's no use.
Brinda won't let her.

415
00:33:55,784 --> 00:34:00,748
I will become anyone.
I've inputted and erased many Ghosts.

416
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:04,585
I disappeared, too... Who am I?

417
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:10,382
Was Unit 501 a target, too?
Aren't you a victim after all?!

418
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:12,301
There was no other way.

419
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,720
What are you after?

420
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,236
Don't disappear, Emma.

421
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,994
Let's go on living after our deaths, together.

422
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,373
They're here.

423
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:52,299
<i>An attack barrier!</i>

424
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:54,885
Major!

425
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:56,845
Colonel!

426
00:34:57,554 --> 00:35:02,434
They fought each other with attack barriers.
One of them got forwarded.

427
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:05,062
I can't believe it was stronger than ours...

428
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:07,731
You were infiltrated for a moment.

429
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:11,151
Delete all relevant operational headquarters
from the cyberbrain Net.

430
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:13,570
Go after Brinda.
There's nothing left to do here.

431
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,493
Damn stray dog...

432
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:30,170
Looks like we pulled it off.

433
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:32,798
The host and Starter are still active.

434
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,275
We can see the ocean, Emma.

435
00:35:52,943 --> 00:35:55,863
This creeps even me out, Major.

436
00:35:55,904 --> 00:35:57,197
Report.

437
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:01,285
Col. Hozumi from Army intelligence
was the one to recruit Brinda Jr.

438
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:05,289
"Scarecrow" is an op cooked up
by their old Investigations Section

439
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,834
during a period when they were
working on Ghost Dub devices.

440
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:14,381
Hozumi got on the Next-Gen Weapons
Review Committee through Foreign Affairs.

441
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:19,469
But she wasn't there long,
and Kurutsu of Unit 501 took her seat

442
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:23,056
at Vice-Minister Kitahara's recommendation.

443
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:27,895
Unit 501 got a hold on Hozumi
through military musical chairs, eh?

444
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:31,565
<i>Reason." We can prove that false memories</i>

445
00:36:31,607 --> 00:36:37,529
<i>- compel us to commit murder, suicide,
and other criminal acts.</i>

446
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,907
- Which <i>one built the pod?</i> - <i>compel us to commit'
murder, suicide, and other criminal acts.</i>

447
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:46,246
Unknown. But Army intelligence decided to
rally by interfering with the Review Committee.

448
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:49,917
I'd guess that somewhere in there,
the two hackers became aware of each other.

449
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,003
The attack on Harimadara is the connection?

450
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:55,923
There's no evidence they did it.

451
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:59,593
But Hozumi is in the overseas
weapons development faction,

452
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:02,095
and Harimadara's a domestic faction stronghold.

453
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:04,223
Who shot our bait?

454
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:10,729
A Kuzan water cartel hit man.
Hozumi's playing with serious fire.

455
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:13,023
She used the pretext of wartime industry

456
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:16,777
to interfere in Kuzan's affairs while
she was stationed there during the war.

457
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:21,114
If she can't subdue the domestic faction
and give the cartel the profits she promised,

458
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,700
it'll retaliate against her.

459
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,452
Starter analysis results?

460
00:37:25,535 --> 00:37:28,038
Couldn't pin down the trigger,
but I got my answer

461
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,124
from the fact that we couldn't find
the infection route into the building

462
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:35,796
even though Section 9 had domination over it.

463
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,382
It was a C4ISR network.

464
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:40,801
A military communications system.

465
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,761
Things are starting to come clear.

466
00:37:42,803 --> 00:37:44,805
Col. Hozumi's the one who activated Starter

467
00:37:44,846 --> 00:37:49,643
and patched the virus through
to infect the VIP room's security.

468
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:51,979
She was after the woman the guard shot.

469
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,565
Senior Vice-Minister Kitahara,
who's with the domestic faction.

470
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,652
That massacre was a smokescreen
for one murder?!

471
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,779
Guess she's a born war-lover.

472
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:03,323
Why snipe Tin Girl?

473
00:38:03,407 --> 00:38:04,324
That was a bluff.

474
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:09,329
She must've wanted to get rid of us
and get Tin Girl safely to the 501 .

475
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:12,582
So her little visit to Section 9
was a smokescreen, too?

476
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:17,004
She backed down so easily
because she was after Unit 501 from the start.

477
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:21,925
So she could set up anti-cyberbrainist
Emma Tsuda as the massacre's ringleader.

478
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:28,265
Harimadara, the Vice-Minister, the 501
She had a threefold plan to take them all out!

479
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:30,434
What about the Ghost of the girl
who got dubbed?

480
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:35,522
If she does have her own will,
why'd she knowingly let Hozumi use her?

481
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:40,527
Just from the circumstances,
the scarecrow is the one you've been after.

482
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:44,990
He didn't necessarily write the virus.
Hozumi said there was a broker.

483
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:48,994
If she told the truth,
someone out there made and sold it.

484
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:50,620
That's who I'm after.

485
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:56,877
This is all speculation.
Right now, there's only one way for us to get proof.

486
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,213
I assume you have Togusa's location.
We'll meet en route.

487
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:04,051
We're going to capture both Ghosts-
the scarecrow's, and the girl's.

488
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,845
Togusa's the problem.

489
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:11,183
Blowing a married teammate's
brains out ain't my job.

490
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:14,478
We know for sure this infection
plants false memories, right?

491
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,314
You saw him talking to his dead father.

492
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:19,900
There should be a shared form.

493
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:24,404
I'll get infected, so you ID it
and version up your makeshift vaccine.

494
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:26,406
You want to mirror your own brain?

495
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:29,326
Worst case scenario, blow my brains out.

496
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,578
So that's my job?

497
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:35,082
If you don't like it, make me the leader.

498
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:36,750
A checkpoint?

499
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:40,921
You're on the wanted list
as a suspected terrorist!

500
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:44,591
Shit, it's Section 9!
The ape used to be in Army intelligence.

501
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:47,260
He cut a deal with Hozumi,
and he's framing us!

502
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:52,224
She may just want us to think so.
I'll send Section 9 our intel.

503
00:39:52,641 --> 00:39:55,185
After all this, you're still relying on him?!

504
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:58,021
- No.
- Why, then?!

505
00:39:58,063 --> 00:40:01,274
My Ghost is whispering that I should do it.

506
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:20,001
Wait! Where are you going?!

507
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,130
Stop!

508
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:27,426
We promised we'd go far away.

509
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:35,308
Goodbye.

510
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,790
I released the package!

511
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,335
I'm going on ahead.

512
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:06,131
I told you to shoot if things went south!
Take a damn gun with you...

513
00:41:08,842 --> 00:41:10,343
Major...

514
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,432
She's in pieces!

515
00:41:15,474 --> 00:41:17,809
If she's a neurochip version,
she's still alive.

516
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:23,315
We'll go on living.

517
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:35,577
It's a Ghost Dub, not a transfer?!

518
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,881
That's a Harimadara prototype!

519
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:51,968
Major!

520
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,888
Two Ghosts have been
dubbed into that thing.

521
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:57,682
We're going to stop it! Logicomas,
give me everything you've got!

522
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,518
Yes, sir!

523
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:06,024
Where the hell would they abandon
their own lives to go?

524
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:08,109
The ocean.

525
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:09,319
Huh?

526
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:12,864
They're not going anywhere!
This ends here!

527
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:02,122
Next-gen weapon or not,
its brains are rookies.

528
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,624
Aim for the eyes and legs,
and it's a piece of cake.

529
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:19,264
For real?!

530
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,065
Got you now!

531
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:22,994
What's that?

532
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:26,331
It's Army intelligence!
The bastards requested an artillery strike!

533
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:36,216
You've cut off your sensory system?!

534
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:37,008
Crap!

535
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,895
You discarded intensity regions...

536
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:53,900
Recognition systems, memory fields,
the Net that maintains your architecture...

537
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:17,257
You even jettisoned your own Ghost!

538
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:20,760
You want a life you've stripped
all meaning from?!

539
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,170
Goodbye.

540
00:47:05,698 --> 00:47:07,200
It's over.

541
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:10,995
Return to base.
We're going to Kuzan, by way of Benares.

542
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:16,709
The world's cyber economy has only just begun.

543
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:19,504
I'll pay whatever it takes to reconcile with the cartel--

544
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,977
On your knees, hands in the air!

545
00:47:35,478 --> 00:47:38,982
Oh, the wanted poster.
Told you so.

546
00:47:46,573 --> 00:47:48,825
You're just like that Section 9 chief.

547
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:53,580
Never happy unless you're digging up
what's dead and buried.

548
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,416
It's something you ran away without doing.

549
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:01,421
Nothing's going to change, Kusanagi.

550
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:05,675
We're an independent offensive unit.

551
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:07,343
We stand independent of the system,

552
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:12,098
and we have truly discrete personalities
that don't get packaged.

553
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:15,393
When we're officially approved
as top priority, we'll root out

554
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:19,606
all the sorry bastards who conspire
because they're afraid of a scandal.

555
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:24,777
And you count me as one of them?

556
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:33,036
I never changed your channel.
Contact me whenever you want to come home.

557
00:48:45,632 --> 00:48:49,802
You're free to go. We voided
the wanted notice Col. Hozumi put out.

558
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:54,557
Vice-Minister of Defense Kitahara
wants to thank you.

559
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,976
Is that some sort of joke?

560
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:58,603
A political one.

561
00:48:59,354 --> 00:49:02,649
Section 9 just went through
Col. Hozumi's possessions

562
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:07,236
and confiscated a Ghost Dub device
and an outline of the Scarecrow op.

563
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:09,405
They couldn't arrest her, though.

564
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:11,783
No-but then she confessed.

565
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:21,125
Her chopper was shot down
with Kuzan weapons.

566
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:23,503
She's afraid enough of the cartel's revenge

567
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:26,839
to request protective custody
and a plea bargain.

568
00:49:26,923 --> 00:49:28,675
So she'll get let off scat-free.

569
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:30,343
I'll make sure she doesn't.

570
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:35,306
The NPO she worked with is a front
for dirty cyberbrain business.

571
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:41,020
Not only that, we've detected Starter
in her cyberbrain, just like your intel said.

572
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:44,691
She got a lot of people injured or killed,
and I'll make her pay for that-

573
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:48,444
even if I can't take her to court yet.

574
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,697
Where did she get the virus?

575
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:56,285
Through a broker, she says.
She claims to know nothing about its author.

576
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,036
I see.

577
00:49:58,371 --> 00:50:01,708
Was it really the cartel
who tried to kill Hozumi?

578
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:05,837
Even if it was someone who wanted to
prevent us from investigating her,

579
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:08,214
I'm sure any trace of them is long gone.

580
00:50:21,185 --> 00:50:22,395
Major.

581
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:27,817
All of you came?
I didn't know I had such admirable subordinates.

582
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:31,696
You could've been attacked
while in custody.

583
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:34,532
We've been keeping an eye on
all the suspicious characters who came by.

584
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,995
One more thing.
I told the Minister of Home Affairs

585
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:43,041
that your team contributed to deterring the virus.

586
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:48,421
Use your vaunted cyberbrain to read
Public Security Commission report N2077.

587
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:52,008
As of tomorrow, you get special authority.

588
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,552
<i>Without</i> official oversight.

589
00:50:54,594 --> 00:50:57,096
This case isn't over.

590
00:50:57,138 --> 00:51:01,684
Investigate the high-level hacking virus
and any organizations involved,

591
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:04,520
and plan to attend plenty of funerals
along the way.

592
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,272
I shot Thied.

593
00:51:07,065 --> 00:51:09,942
You must have had a hunch that
an intelligence bigwig was behind this,

594
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:13,279
meaning you would've wanted
an intel advantage at any cost.

595
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:16,240
So why didn't you stop me?!

596
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:19,911
Because I don't have
your Ghost infiltration key.

597
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:26,459
No organization will ever have it.

598
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:30,421
I promised your late commander that.

599
00:51:54,654 --> 00:51:57,782
Bottom line, all we figured out
was that someone out there

600
00:51:57,824 --> 00:52:04,997
used a couple of anti-cyberbrainist hackers
and a miserable water company chick.

601
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,167
We may be looking for a crime
worth sacrificing lives over,

602
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:10,586
but all we have are money-mad war profiteers

603
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:13,673
and a man and girl obsessed
with casting things away.

604
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,341
For now, that is.

605
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:24,684
Which one had agency, the man or the girl?
Did they even have real will?

606
00:52:26,144 --> 00:52:30,022
When they blocked my infiltration, at least.

607
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:36,696
But they fled with nowhere to go,
then had to transfer into that weapon.

608
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:41,534
That think-tank's cyberbrain had
a massive output system.

609
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,119
Hmm?

610
00:52:43,161 --> 00:52:46,289
What if the reason they cast away
what made them themselves

611
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:50,334
was to output the last thing left into the Net?

612
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:53,212
You think that's where they were going?

613
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:58,176
Pouring the last shreds of their Ghosts
into the Net... Is that even possible?

614
00:52:59,302 --> 00:53:02,805
It's been researched,
but it's impossible to prove.

615
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:10,021
But in the moment their Ghosts were lost,
I got the feeling they'd fused.

616
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:12,732
That two lives had become one...

617
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:18,070
That isn't like you. Ghosts are
the most independent things in this world.

618
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:22,158
Even the ones being controlled are fundamentally,
eternally standalone.

619
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:24,368
Like our squad, yeah?

620
00:53:27,955 --> 00:53:29,749
Yeah.

621
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:34,587
Well? The floaters are all ready.
I got a set of two.

622
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,590
Even someone with
a titanium skull wouldn't drown.

623
00:53:37,632 --> 00:53:40,593
You seriously want to swim
in the ocean in midwinter?

624
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:43,763
Gotta shake off those memories
of almost drowning.

625
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:46,766
Plus it ain't too often
I get to see you in a swimsuit.

626
00:53:46,849 --> 00:53:48,184
That's your real goal?

627
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:50,061
- Huh?
- Unbelievable.

628
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:53,439
No, no! I'm doing this all for you!

629
00:53:55,733 --> 00:53:57,610
I'll take a rain check.

630
00:53:57,693 --> 00:54:00,279
I'm telling you, you got it all wrong!

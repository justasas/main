1
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,190
Per the Special Anti-Terrorism Measures Act,

2
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,650
we now place all terminals in the designated area
under Public Security's electronic control.

3
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,900
"Give back our water!"

4
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,570
Anticipating that cyberterrorism against
Harimadara Heavy Industries will lead

5
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,070
to a shutdown of operations, Home Affairs has...

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,070
HQ to Squad 357.

7
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,220
Transfer command to Section 9.

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,700
This is Priority One.

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,640
Murderers!

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,080
Murderers!!

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,790
Give back our water!

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,300
Despite increasingly fierce protests,
a contract has just been signed

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,990
between a Kuzan water company
and the Japanese giant Harimadara.

14
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,090
"Give water to the war orphans!!"

15
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,530
"Give water to the war orphans!"

16
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,100
It's starting.

17
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,560
All channels within the revised limits are clear.

18
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,710
All Home Affairs
and MLIT lines now under our control.

19
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,820
Ready for domination.

20
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,150
Begin.

21
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,660
All lifelines, surveillance, etc.
for the building and roads now dominated.

22
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,970
Profiling cyberbrains and terminals of
4,022 people in the area.

23
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,040
1,102 require follow-up.

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,230
Aramaki! I'm not giving you my crime scene!

25
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,590
This is Section 6.
Who said you could infiltrate our comm lines?!

26
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,200
We need to prevent casualties,
not play departmental musical chairs!

27
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,470
Or will you take the fall when we can't
even pin down their means of attack?!

28
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,190
Chief Aramaki, explain yourself.

29
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,670
Vice-Minister Kitahara.

30
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,230
I thought you were attending the celebratory banquet?

31
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,630
What you warned me of is happening, then?

32
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:42,700
We got an anonymous tip that
a Qhardi group mobilized three hours ago.

33
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,930
Anonymous?

34
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,890
Can you trust it?

35
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,250
Yes. The Yotsubashi Building area is
definitely the target.

36
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:57,260
The old ape's sure fired up,
considering we're flying blind here.

37
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,760
Batou, this is the outfit
we've been after ever since

38
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,120
the cyber-contamination at Harimadara
four months ago.

39
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,580
"We"? You mean you.

40
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,540
Did you make this, Major?

41
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,480
It ain't a toy, rookie.

42
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,040
It's a military-grade virtual comm link.

43
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,480
It's almost impossible for hackers to listen in.

44
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,470
Section 9 forced the domination through.
We'll have orders soon.

45
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,430
Nab one of the terrorists.
I want bait to draw out our prey.

46
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:32,390
Is it that super-wizard-class hacker,
Fire-Starter?

47
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,820
Isn't that just what you want?

48
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,440
We don't even know if there's really
someone pulling the strings.

49
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,430
What I want is to formally establish
my spec ops team.

50
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,220
If you're scared of unknown enemies, drop out.

51
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,720
Piss off.

52
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,340
"Corporate Killers"

53
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,050
Driving during a cyber-meeting?
You're gonna crash.

54
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:56,340
You're the only one that green.

55
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,240
Our status as an independent
offensive unit is riding on this.

56
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,930
Public Security handles the incident,
and we handle what caused it.

57
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,450
Go.

58
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,740
The enemy just gave the go-ahead.

59
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Capture them!

60
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:23,780
You deserve this...
Greedy rich-country bastards!

61
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,310
Today, we've followed the principle
of free trade

62
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:39,900
to maintain fair prices that will spur
postwar economic recovery.

63
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,910
This was his only weapon.
Something's fishy.

64
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,880
The riot squad opened fire?!

65
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,020
The west team's slaughtering protesters.

66
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,750
Some are even shooting other cops!

67
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,150
It's the biggest simultaneous Ghost Hack ever.

68
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,150
It's crazy, but it's the only explanation.

69
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,570
There's no tech that'd control
100 people at once.

70
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,070
The perps on my watch are all dead, too.

71
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,180
Check the riot squad's lines
and find out what caused the attack.

72
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,950
There's a log that might be Starter's, but...

73
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,580
Then this isn't hacking.
It's a virus.

74
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,960
I don't see one in the sequence.

75
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,270
It's a self-destructing Stuxnet-type.

76
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,740
Someone must be sending packaged
actions meant to control groups.

77
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,130
You, eh?

78
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,310
I made a deal with the devil
for the sake of rebuilding and independence!

79
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,520
Just like you wanted!

80
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,880
And it invited a second slaughter
by water and e-money

81
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,700
to follow the first slaughter with guns!

82
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,350
You said cyberbrain tech and the prosthetics industry

83
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,350
I want a media blackout now.

84
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,680
would build us a future,

85
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,680
This is Priority One!

86
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:02,060
but hope wasn't
what they brought to Qhardistan!

87
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,690
They merely sowed the seeds of betrayal

88
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,360
that would grow to bleed away my people's pride!

89
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,550
Have a taste of what that felt like!

90
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:13,970
Then you'll have no choice
but to grant me asylum!

91
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,010
Because this is a civilized, pacifist nation!

92
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,810
Oh, is it?

93
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,850
Optical camouflage!

94
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,790
You can't stop Fire-Starter.

95
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,830
Someone hacked my line?!

96
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,450
Major?!

97
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,910
Saito!

98
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,740
Shit.

99
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,420
Hello!

100
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,130
Give me a weapon!

101
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,270
Okay!

102
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,230
Major, I'll be right there!

103
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,160
Don't be stupid.
Go after the one who hacked me!

104
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,650
On your knees!

105
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,990
I'll shoot you dead if you resist.

106
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,610
That was outta nowhere!

107
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,320
This was your job, moron!

108
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,850
Sorry! That was an accident.

109
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,620
Equip some handrails!

110
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,420
Do it, Saito.

111
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:05,200
I let him get away, sorry!

112
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,440
"Section 9 Office"

113
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,440
Idiots!

114
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:25,910
You finally take the job,
and then you execute someone on the national Net?

115
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:29,100
Who, me? You have no proof.

116
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,250
Are you claiming you had no choice?

117
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,460
You're a super-wizard-class hacker
in an ace unit.

118
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:38,420
Was the Army overestimating you
when it rated you five stars?

119
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,050
Tell me about the virus and that heavy cyborg girl.

120
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,910
No cyber-virus was detected.
The girl's name is Emma Tsuda.

121
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,210
Apparently she's famous on the Net
as a game app maker.

122
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,920
Nine hours after her arrest,
that's all you've got?

123
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,800
I guess a former Special A Rank inspector
for the Army like you

124
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,030
gets to have lots of talented subordinates.

125
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,530
My people's dedicated effort got
multiple perps captured alive.

126
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:11,100
Wow, great work arresting
some mindless packaged drones.

127
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,710
We could've stopped it
if we'd had special authority.

128
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,170
Then stop playing gangsters and join Section 9.

129
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,180
Unless you work directly for Home Affairs,

130
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:27,240
you do get official oversight
and you don't get secrecy.

131
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,680
Can you guarantee I'd be able to stay myself?

132
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,080
Cutting-edge equipment can protect
cyberbrains and prosthetic bodies.

133
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,560
And my Ghost? My beliefs?

134
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,520
Depends on how skilled you are.
I'll even consider a budget.

135
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,840
Create an international counterterrorist agency for us

136
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,990
with the same budget as the Rangers.

137
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,370
I'm gonna go eat.

138
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,120
Aramaki, it's been a while.

139
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:03,300
Colonel Hozumi.
What brings Army intelligence here?

140
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,390
I'll take the girl now.

141
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,640
Care to explain?

142
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,330
They're from a squad I trust.

143
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:20,170
Ex-major Motoko Kusanagi, of the 501.

144
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,860
Hated your master so much
you became a stray, eh?

145
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,320
Your intel's dated.
They recreated my rank.

146
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:33,040
The cyber-virus used is crucial for us to investigate.

147
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,440
Explain why it's crucial, please.

148
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,250
It's a triple package of brainwashing,
Ghost infiltration, and false memory creation.

149
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:48,470
False memory? Last I checked, the government doesn't admit that's possible, despite all the reports.

150
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,220
Virus units entered this country via a certain broker.

151
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:59,750
Trust me: You won't even manage to indict that girl.

152
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,550
Unfortunately, she's been transferred to Unit 501.

153
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,190
When?

154
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,650
The moment I agreed to their request for cooperation.

155
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:11,240
I've never thought you were clever, but this?

156
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,640
You'll regret any foolish stubbornness.

157
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,280
Terror by false memories...

158
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,570
Your claims are finally proven, Major.

159
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,140
So is the existence of a virus
that enables Ghost-hacking.

160
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,100
Here's your next job: Escort the girl to Unit 501.

161
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,810
What? There was really a request?

162
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,760
Signed by the Defense Minister.
Now give me one of your men in exchange.

163
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,260
Did your scary ex-colleague make you want a guard?

164
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,780
I want information sharing.
Go renew old workplace friendships.

165
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,930
Can I ask one thing?

166
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,430
What is it?

167
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,060
Assuming I did shoot her...

168
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,000
...why didn't you use my Ghost
infiltration key to stop me?

169
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,720
I can't answer hypothetical questions.

170
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,110
I see.

171
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:16,140
This is Dr. Zhinzhee Bekka Arr Thied,
the one the Major killed.

172
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:20,960
She's Qhardi, but she graduated
from Kuzan Royal University as valedictorian.

173
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,800
A big player in Kuzan water importation
since the provisional government days.

174
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,680
But she supported terrorism when she realized
the world would forsake her people, eh?

175
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,430
She's smart and she's got motive,
but she's not a hacker.

176
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,270
Someone else packaged this.

177
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,730
What about the girl we captured?

178
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:45,360
Her name's Emma Tsuda.
A 17-year-old war orphan.

179
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,150
She makes hit cyberbrain games,
which she copyrights under the name "Tin Man".

180
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,160
"Tin Man"... As in The Wizard of Oz?

181
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,180
What's that?

182
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,350
Supposing she's a teenage super-hacker, how does she fit in?

183
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,350
In spite of everything, I still believe

184
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,250
Don't tell me she's the one you're after?

185
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,250
that people are really good at heart.

186
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,810
I'll know when I dive into her Ghost.

187
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,810
I wish to go on living even after my death.

188
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:10,130
Ishikawa, stay on the virus and the girl.
Saito, you go to Section 9.

189
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:12,510
Paz and Borma, you release the bait.

190
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:16,050
Batou, Togusa, and I will escort the girl.

191
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,530
We're starting the second round.

192
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:24,060
Suggestion for you,
Miss "Hothead Who Charges In Blind".

193
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,940
How about I become team leader
and lead us in a sensible retreat?

194
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,150
Brave thing to say in my cyberbrain space.

195
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,760
Step outside and let's fight!

196
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,790
Whoa, knock it off, you guys!

197
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,940
He's finally on the move.

198
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,960
Thought I'd die of boredom!

199
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,180
It might be cool if we could ride in you.

200
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:25,460
The Major requested a personnel transport shaft
from the Maintenance Department!

201
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,670
Will we pilot you from inside?

202
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,730
Isn't that our mobile arsenal?
Where would the weapons go?

203
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,570
We can just resupply each other.
If we armed this guy, he could be our backup.

204
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:39,600
Backup, eh?

205
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,100
Why are we using an outdated Logistics model?

206
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:47,880
Ape-Face couldn't get the budget the Major wanted,
so he gave us these bots.

207
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,980
Neurochip-type Als are hard to hack or infect, anyway.

208
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,170
So basically, it was us or the junkyard?

209
00:17:54,530 --> 00:18:00,910
What? Not good enough
for the ex-cop still wearing a necktie?

210
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:05,730
My late father said looking classy
shows faith in yourself.

211
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,690
Watching you, ex-Ranger,
I see what he meant.

212
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:12,650
Bold words, kid.

213
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:20,220
Mr. Batou suggested modifying us
so people could ride us!

214
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,620
I think it's a really great idea!
What do you think, Major?

215
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,580
Don't talk nonsense. I hate machines
who pretend to have personalities.

216
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,500
She's here.

217
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,170
Did you hack my line to
deliberately get yourself caught?

218
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,320
What is "Fire-Starter"?
Is it really the name of a hacker?

219
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:02,280
Intelligence wants you.
Military courts don't do plea bargains, you know.

220
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,750
I smell seawater.

221
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,190
We aren't even allowed near the sea.

222
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:18,490
Programmers are like weapons:
We're forbidden by law from moving freely.

223
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,970
So you are the group's hacker.
What are you after?

224
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:28,540
Long ago, glassblowers had no freedom,
because glasswork funded the state.

225
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:32,690
If they left the country,
they were blinded first.

226
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,150
You're a refugee?
That's why you started a massacre?

227
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,340
Do you think cyberbrains make people happy?

228
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:51,790
Are your memories trustworthy?
Or were they planted by someone?

229
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:59,900
When micromachine-based cyberization came to pass,
experts worldwide warned us:

230
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,610
"False memories will be used to commit crimes".

231
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,970
Every organization wants that technology.
My technology.

232
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,180
You mean you successfully made
memory-manipulation tech?

233
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,900
Your memories might even be...

234
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,550
I'm diving right here, right now!

235
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,550
Saw that coming.

236
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,530
We don't know what this virus is.
What if you're infected?

237
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,270
I'll blow it away, and her cyberbrain with it.

238
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:35,500
A hacker who commits mass murder
just to escape deserves assassination.

239
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,570
During your dive?!

240
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,960
Your cyber warfare style is twisted.

241
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,320
I prefer the term "super-wizard-class".

242
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,180
"Wizard"... Magician.
Magician who can't go home...

243
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,890
I'm diving straight in through her line.

244
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,080
Uh-huh, ignore protocol.

245
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,850
Hey, something's weird.

246
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:02,240
You're being hacked!
They're doing it through her cyberbrain!

247
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,660
What's going on?
This isn't just backfire!

248
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,620
Emma... Danger... Emma...

249
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,940
You...

250
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,320
Major!

251
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:35,160
I'm sorry, Emma... I'm sorry.

252
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,520
It's okay. I wanted this.

253
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,170
Don't cry, Brinda.

254
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,090
There are two Ghosts in there?

255
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,830
I heard about Section 9's meddling.

256
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,900
You couldn't have shot her
before she started blabbing about asylum?

257
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,550
That shooting is currently under investigation,
Deputy Director Amagata.

258
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:12,140
I can imagine the profound effects
this incident will have

259
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,520
on the Next-Generation Weapons
Review Committee you serve on.

260
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,670
The year-end industry fair has been cancelled.

261
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:22,720
And thanks to pressure from
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

262
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,840
we won't be unveiling
our prototype weapons, either.

263
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,490
It's shaking the foundations of the company.

264
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:33,100
I hear you're pressing for large-scale water sales
even after Dr. Thied's death.

265
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,770
I have a duty to fulfill my contract.

266
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,960
And effective use of resources is key
for an international company.

267
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,190
There are some out there
who can't even secure drinking water.

268
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:48,260
If you just want to criticize my economics,
I'm going back to work.

269
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,910
You're not cut out for government work.

270
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:03,360
Start an NPO and go live
in some refugee camp.

271
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,470
He's annoying.

272
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:13,830
He's a classic ex-politician,
and he owes me one from my intelligence days.

273
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,790
Which means he's a reliable source.

274
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,420
NPOs, camps... and Foreign Affairs?

275
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,270
The council on weapons development!

276
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,130
Was that the objective behind
the cyberterrorism against Harimadara?

277
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,420
Lately there's a debate about
whether next-gen weapons

278
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,490
should be produced domestically
or developed abroad.

279
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:39,750
The overseas faction'd be thrilled
if a domestic manufacturer got attacked.

280
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:44,000
Here we go: an NPO that
"treats cyberization disorders".

281
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,320
They disseminated cyberization and learning devices

282
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:49,760
in refugee camps in Kuzan during the war.

283
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,430
And domestically?

284
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,850
Got a hit on that girl
in the same NPO's treatment records.

285
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,140
Cyberization rejection syndrome.

286
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,850
Apparently she ran away

287
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:02,290
from a war orphan facility
because she rejected being cyberized.

288
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,810
Not wanting a cyberbrain means you're sick?

289
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:09,320
The white paper on cyberization
the MHLW released after the war

290
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,220
classifies it with anorexia.

291
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:13,680
That's news to me.

292
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,910
The cyberization business is insanely big money.

293
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:23,120
Pretty predictable that people
who don't want it get treated as sick.

294
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,110
Could she be a genuine multiple personality?

295
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:31,240
The prevailing theory is that
personalities split but Ghosts don't.

296
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,300
The issue is, what did that NPO

297
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,330
have to do with a business deal motivated
by military development?

298
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,790
Go at the military-industrial complex from
both ends: soldiers and companies.

299
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,030
It's me. The others got caught.

300
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:03,270
Don't worry, you'll see them in the afterlife.

301
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,400
Hello!

302
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,710
Y-You a cop?

303
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:20,060
I-I prepared a confession.
Let me call my lawyer--

304
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,500
You're not getting that chance.

305
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,460
You killed our bait,
so you're gonna tell us everything.

306
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,390
Started to miss your old home?

307
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:44,290
I'm only here to bring in your witness,
Lt. Col. Kurutsu.

308
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:48,630
Tsumugi is standing by.
Dive if you want to.

309
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,110
Assuming she has a Ghost, that is.

310
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:53,010
What do you mean?

311
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,760
I'm stepping out.

312
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,450
As a member of the committee,
I need to be at Harimadara's product inspection.

313
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,390
Still obsessed with getting promoted?

314
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,020
It's something you ran away without doing.

315
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,360
Nice to see you, Kusanagi.

316
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,760
I didn't think we'd have
another chance to work with you.

317
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,320
Are these your men?

318
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,300
Yes. Batou and Togusa.

319
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,540
This is Tsumugi Dokuro.
They're both cyber warfare tactical officers.

320
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:48,850
"Both"?
Are they sharing a body?

321
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:52,230
She says they're two identical twins
in one conjoined body.

322
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,050
I dunno how they move.

323
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,510
The world's full of surprises.

324
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:02,680
Let's get started.

325
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,670
So, only the body came back.

326
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,250
What do you mean?

327
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,320
She's a technical officer in
Lt. Col. Kurutsu's command.

328
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,060
She was investigating a hacker
with a special neurochip-type cyberbrain.

329
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,530
He's known as "Scarecrow",

330
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:29,230
and he's a suspect in the terrorist
attack on Harimadara.

331
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,210
Another Oz character?

332
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:33,130
Huh?

333
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:39,110
Our conclusion is that he's a special spy
based on postwar tech.

334
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,820
Emma was the one who reasoned it out.

335
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,370
She hypothesized a hacker
with the same disorder she had.

336
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,830
Someone who had to incrementally
replace his brain with neurochips

337
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,850
and prosthetize his body to survive.

338
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,560
She had that disorder?

339
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:57,750
Personality attenuates, and selfhood can't be
retained without auxiliary cyberbrains.

340
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:03,220
Emma transformed her impairment
into her signature trait, as did Scarecrow.

341
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,600
Emma regularly used advanced cyberization
to structure her selfhood,

342
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,640
but Scarecrow is different.

343
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,890
To compensate for his attenuated personality,
he dubs the Ghosts of others,

344
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,690
steals their bodies,
and assumes their identities.

345
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,000
Like the scarecrow who can't think
inserting a false brain into his head.

346
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,710
Seriously?

347
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,300
In other words, this is...

348
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:27,200
The body is Emma's,
but it's being operated by a man's brain

349
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,370
which is only one-third the normal size
and cyberized with neurochips.

350
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,940
So what I dived into was
the girl's dubbed Ghost.

351
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,500
What happened to her brain?

352
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,400
Ghost Dubbing would've degraded it.

353
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:44,090
It's either in the trash or sliced up
in his research lab.

354
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,360
That's awful...

355
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,100
Poor Emma. I'm sorry.

356
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,060
It's okay, Junior. Don't be afraid.

357
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,790
I know the lions will come.
The people with courage...

358
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:00,440
Who are you?
Tell me who you work for.

359
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,320
I am a scarecrow.
My brain is fading away.

360
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,260
I am tin.
My heart is fading away.

361
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:12,330
Is that Emma talking, or her dubbed Ghost?

362
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,100
Tin Girl, give me the scarecrow man's name.

363
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:22,320
His name is Brinda Jr.
Please, don't blame him.

364
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,260
Got a hit at a postwar nursing home!
And the same NPO is involved with it.

365
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,310
Brinda Jr., age 32.

366
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:35,040
After he was cyberized,
he became an accountant at an employment agency.

367
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,190
His personality's thin,

368
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:40,500
but he memorized a 200-digit number
in two seconds for an IQ test.

369
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,940
That's textbook for someone with
special cognitive abilities.

370
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,030
Find out which organization
set him up as a hacker.

371
00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:48,530
Roger.

372
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,990
I'm diving into that man's Ghost.

373
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,500
There are only a handful of
proven double Ghosts in existence.

374
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,960
We don't know the dangers.

375
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,250
I want to know which Ghost has motive.

376
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,940
You're doubting Emma?
She's the victim here.

377
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,900
Then I'll confirm that.

378
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,410
Batou, be my backup
in case they back-hack me.

379
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,370
Two against two, eh?

380
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,020
Togusa. Get all the records copied.

381
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:24,210
Roger. Oh, here...
Sorry, it's a call from my dad.

382
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,880
Hey Dad, it's been a while. Yeah.

383
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,950
Batou! Restrain Togusa!

384
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,180
Got it. I'll become the Lion.

385
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,400
A Mateba, still?

386
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,050
Don't move!

387
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,000
Major!

388
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,960
Let's go.

389
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:07,340
This is crazy! I found a Starter log
on his comm - it's the virus!

390
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:12,030
He must have kept the virus inactive
within his neurochips.

391
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,240
His infiltration was unexpectedly quick.

392
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,910
So, it combines victims' memories of past hostility
with objects in front of them

393
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:21,420
to plant instantaneous false memories?

394
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,030
I can get deadly, right?

395
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,100
That was your last breath if you don't.

396
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,680
Don't underestimate me!

397
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:07,000
The scarecrow is the virus's host
and Togusa's brain is the package, right?

398
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,420
Yep. But the infection route's disturbingly selective.

399
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,780
Only people around you are being infected.

400
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,970
Does that mean the onset can be regulated?

401
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:21,520
That'd be impossible without
a third party to switch it on.

402
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,250
Which I guess means it's a virus
whose damage can be controlled.

403
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,460
Then it's military.
Reanalyze yesterday's infection data.

404
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,280
We don't want to chase the virus;
we want to chase the enemy in possession of it.

405
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,680
I wish to go on living even after my death.

406
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,390
Hidden data?

407
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:44,850
For these 620 reasons,
we oppose cyberization without free choice.

408
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,960
Reason: We submit that software
within the cyberbrain

409
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,180
is vulnerable to third-party tampering.

410
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:59,180
Reason: Electronic alteration of
memory causes abnormalities

411
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:03,540
in the totality of our independent
will referred to as the "Ghost".

412
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,500
Do you actually think a world
without infection and infiltration is possible?!

413
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,420
Tsumugi! You alive?

414
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:17,370
I'm running a sim of the scarecrow's brain.
Help me.

415
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,240
You have Emma Tsuda's Ghost infiltration key,
don't you? Make me a backdoor.

416
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,920
I see, you're going to use
Scarecrow's cyberbrain structure

417
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,900
to approximate a vaccine?

418
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:45,910
Reason: There are currently seventeen
possible ways to alter our memories.

419
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,000
Shit!

420
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,980
Major! Why won't you use my Ghost
infiltration key to stop this?!

421
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,070
It's no use.
Brinda won't let her.

422
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:00,830
I will become anyone.
I've inputted and erased many Ghosts.

423
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,390
I disappeared, too... Who am I?

424
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:10,420
Was Unit 501 a target, too?
Aren't you a victim after all?!

425
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,360
There was no other way.

426
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,720
What are you after?

427
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,250
Don't disappear, Emma.

428
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,970
Let's go on living after our deaths, together.

429
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,390
They're here.

430
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,150
An attack barrier!

431
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:54,860
Major!

432
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:56,820
Colonel!

433
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:02,470
They fought each other with attack barriers.
One of them got forwarded.

434
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,100
I can't believe it was stronger than ours...

435
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,770
You were infiltrated for a moment.

436
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:11,190
Delete all relevant operational headquarters
from the cyberbrain Net.

437
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,540
Go after Brinda.
There's nothing left to do here.

438
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,470
Damn stray dog...

439
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,210
Looks like we pulled it off.

440
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,790
The host and Starter are still active.

441
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,330
We can see the ocean, Emma.

442
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,290
This creeps even me out, Major.

443
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,230
Report.

444
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:01,260
Col. Hozumi from Army intelligence
was the one to recruit Brinda Jr.

445
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:05,330
"Scarecrow" is an op cooked up
by their old Investigations Section

446
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,870
during a period when they were
working on Ghost Dub devices.

447
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:14,420
Hozumi got on the Next-Gen Weapons
Review Committee through Foreign Affairs.

448
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:19,510
But she wasn't there long,
and Kurutsu of Unit 501 took her seat

449
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,090
at Vice-Minister Kitahara's recommendation.

450
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:27,950
Unit 501 got a hold on Hozumi
through military musical chairs, eh?

451
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:31,600
Reason: We can prove that false memories

452
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:39,670
compel us to commit murder, suicide, and other criminal acts.

453
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,670
Which one built the pod?

454
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:46,280
Unknown. But Army intelligence decided to
rally by interfering with the Review Committee.

455
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:49,990
I'd guess that somewhere in there,
the two hackers became aware of each other.

456
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:53,040
The attack on Harimadara is the connection?

457
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,000
There's no evidence they did it.

458
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,630
But Hozumi is in the overseas
weapons development faction,

459
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,610
and Harimadara's a domestic faction stronghold.

460
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,070
Who shot our bait?

461
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:10,540
A Kuzan water cartel hit man.
Hozumi's playing with serious fire.

462
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,060
She used the pretext of wartime industry

463
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,770
to interfere in Kuzan's affairs while
she was stationed there during the war.

464
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:21,130
If she can't subdue the domestic faction
and give the cartel the profits she promised,

465
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:23,740
it'll retaliate against her.

466
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,450
Starter analysis results?

467
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:28,070
Couldn't pin down the trigger,
but I got my answer

468
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:32,280
from the fact that we couldn't find
the infection route into the building

469
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,790
even though Section 9 had domination over it.

470
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:38,420
It was a C4ISR network.

471
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,520
A military communications system.

472
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,800
Things are starting to come clear.

473
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,840
Col. Hozumi's the one who activated Starter

474
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,240
and patched the virus through
to infect the VIP room's security.

475
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,020
She was after the woman the guard shot.

476
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,210
Senior Vice-Minister Kitahara,
who's with the domestic faction.

477
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,650
That massacre was a smokescreen
for one murder?!

478
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:00,420
Guess she's a born war-lover.

479
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,320
Why snipe Tin Girl?

480
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:03,880
That was a bluff.

481
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:09,370
She must've wanted to get rid of us
and get Tin Girl safely to the 501.

482
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:12,620
So her little visit to Section 9
was a smokescreen, too?

483
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,600
She backed down so easily
because she was after Unit 501 from the start.

484
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:21,570
So she could set up anti-cyberbrainist
Emma Tsuda as the massacre's ringleader.

485
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:28,300
Harimadara, the Vice-Minister, the 501...
She had a threefold plan to take them all out!

486
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,470
What about the Ghost of the girl
who got dubbed?

487
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:35,560
If she does have her own will,
why'd she knowingly let Hozumi use her?

488
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,560
Just from the circumstances,
the scarecrow is the one you've been after.

489
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,010
He didn't necessarily write the virus.
Hozumi said there was a broker.

490
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,030
If she told the truth,
someone out there made and sold it.

491
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,470
That's who I'm after.

492
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:56,870
This is all speculation.
Right now, there's only one way for us to get proof.

493
00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:00,290
I assume you have Togusa's location.
We'll meet en route.

494
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:04,190
We're going to capture both Ghosts-
the scarecrow's, and the girl's.

495
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,970
Togusa's the problem.

496
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:10,700
Blowing a married teammate's
brains out ain't my job.

497
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,450
We know for sure this infection
plants false memories, right?

498
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,370
You saw him talking to his dead father.

499
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,940
There should be a shared form.

500
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,480
I'll get infected, so you ID it
and version up your makeshift vaccine.

501
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,440
You want to mirror your own brain?

502
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,340
Worst case scenario, blow my brains out.

503
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,620
So that's my job?

504
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:35,080
If you don't like it, make me the leader.

505
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,810
A checkpoint?

506
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,000
You're on the wanted list
as a suspected terrorist!

507
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,670
Shit, it's Section 9!
The ape used to be in Army intelligence.

508
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:47,230
He cut a deal with Hozumi,
and he's framing us!

509
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:52,200
She may just want us to think so.
I'll send Section 9 our intel.

510
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,120
After all this, you're still relying on him?!

511
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,080
No.

512
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,870
Why, then?!

513
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,750
My Ghost is whispering that I should do it.

514
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,060
Wait! Where are you going?!

515
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,020
Stop!

516
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,730
We promised we'd go far away.

517
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,300
Goodbye.

518
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,260
I released the package!

519
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,330
I'm going on ahead.

520
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,150
I told you to shoot if things went south!
Take a damn gun with you...

521
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,340
Major...

522
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,470
She's in pieces!

523
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,800
If she's a neurochip version,
she's still alive.

524
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,160
We'll go on living.

525
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,680
It's a Ghost Dub, not a transfer?!

526
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,400
That's a Harimadara prototype!

527
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,010
Major!

528
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,880
Two Ghosts have been
dubbed into that thing.

529
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,720
We're going to stop it! Logicomas,
give me everything you've got!

530
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,280
Yes, sir!

531
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:05,660
Where the hell would they abandon
their own lives to go?

532
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:08,120
The ocean.

533
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,330
Huh?

534
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,840
They're not going anywhere!
This ends here!

535
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,120
Next-gen weapon or not,
its brains are rookies.

536
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:04,180
Aim for the eyes and legs,
and it's a piece of cake.

537
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,240
For real?!

538
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,060
Got you now!

539
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,030
What's that?

540
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:26,140
It's Army intelligence!
The bastards requested an artillery strike!

541
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:36,210
You've cut off your sensory system?!

542
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,020
Crap!

543
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:48,830
You discarded intensity regions...

544
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:53,900
Recognition systems, memory fields,
the Net that maintains your architecture...

545
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,290
You even jettisoned your own Ghost!

546
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:20,360
You want a life you've stripped
all meaning from?!

547
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,170
Goodbye.

548
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:07,240
It's over.

549
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,390
Return to base.
We're going to Kuzan, by way of Benares.

550
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:16,790
The world's cyber economy has only just begun.

551
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:19,060
I'll pay whatever it takes to reconcile with the cartel--

552
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:33,450
On your knees, hands in the air!

553
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:38,410
Oh, the wanted poster.
Told you so.

554
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:48,800
You're just like that Section 9 chief.

555
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,550
Never happy unless you're digging up
what's dead and buried.

556
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:56,410
It's something you ran away without doing.

557
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,520
Nothing's going to change, Kusanagi.

558
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,710
We're an independent offensive unit.

559
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,380
We stand independent of the system,

560
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,490
and we have truly discrete personalities
that don't get packaged.

561
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,430
When we're officially approved
as top priority, we'll root out

562
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:19,450
all the sorry bastards who conspire
because they're afraid of a scandal.

563
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:25,380
And you count me as one of them?

564
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:33,030
I never changed your channel.
Contact me whenever you want to come home.

565
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:49,940
You're free to go. We voided
the wanted notice Col. Hozumi put out.

566
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:54,590
Vice-Minister of Defense Kitahara
wants to thank you.

567
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:56,410
Is that some sort of joke?

568
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,620
A political one.

569
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:02,730
Section 9 just went through
Col. Hozumi's possessions

570
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:07,270
and confiscated a Ghost Dub device
and an outline of the Scarecrow op.

571
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:09,440
They couldn't arrest her, though.

572
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,840
No - but then she confessed.

573
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:21,160
Her chopper was shot down
with Kuzan weapons.

574
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,540
She's afraid enough of the cartel's revenge

575
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:26,830
to request protective custody
and a plea bargain.

576
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,750
So she'll get let off scot-free.

577
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,380
I'll make sure she doesn't.

578
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:35,340
The NPO she worked with is a front
for dirty cyberbrain business.

579
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:41,100
Not only that, we've detected Starter
in her cyberbrain, just like your intel said.

580
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:44,730
She got a lot of people injured or killed,
and I'll make her pay for that-

581
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:48,380
even if I can't take her to court yet.

582
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,770
Where did she get the virus?

583
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:56,320
Through a broker, she says.
She claims to know nothing about its author.

584
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,090
I see.

585
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,060
Was it really the cartel
who tried to kill Hozumi?

586
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:05,870
Even if it was someone who wanted to
prevent us from investigating her,

587
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,020
I'm sure any trace of them is long gone.

588
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,410
Major.

589
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:27,870
All of you came?
I didn't know I had such admirable subordinates.

590
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:31,130
You could've been attacked
while in custody.

591
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:34,550
We've been keeping an eye on
all the suspicious characters who came by.

592
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:39,030
One more thing.
I told the Minister of Home Affairs

593
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:43,080
that your team contributed to deterring the virus.

594
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:48,020
Use your vaunted cyberbrain to read
Public Security Commission report N2077.

595
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:52,040
As of tomorrow, you get special authority.

596
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,980
Without official oversight.

597
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:57,130
This case isn't over.

598
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:01,720
Investigate the high-level hacking virus
and any organizations involved,

599
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:04,450
and plan to attend plenty of funerals
along the way.

600
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:06,450
I shot Thied.

601
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,710
You must have had a hunch that
an intelligence bigwig was behind this,

602
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:13,210
meaning you would've wanted
an intel advantage at any cost.

603
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,210
So why didn't you stop me?!

604
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:19,910
Because I don't have
your Ghost infiltration key.

605
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:25,810
No organization will ever have it.

606
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:30,020
I promised your late commander that.

607
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:57,820
Bottom line, all we figured out
was that someone out there

608
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:05,030
used a couple of anti-cyberbrainist hackers
and a miserable water company chick.

609
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:08,200
We may be looking for a crime
worth sacrificing lives over,

610
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,620
but all we have are money-mad war profiteers

611
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:13,750
and a man and girl obsessed
with casting things away.

612
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,340
For now, that is.

613
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:24,620
Which one had agency, the man or the girl?
Did they even have real will?

614
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:30,100
When they blocked my infiltration, at least.

615
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:36,590
But they fled with nowhere to go,
then had to transfer into that weapon.

616
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:41,610
That think-tank's cyberbrain had
a massive output system.

617
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:43,050
Hmm?

618
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:46,330
What if the reason they cast away
what made them themselves

619
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:50,310
was to output the last thing left into the Net?

620
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,250
You think that's where they were going?

621
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:58,170
Pouring the last shreds of their Ghosts
into the Net... Is that even possible?

622
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,990
It's been researched,
but it's impossible to prove.

623
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:10,060
But in the moment their Ghosts were lost,
I got the feeling they'd fused.

624
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:12,770
That two lives had become one...

625
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:18,110
That isn't like you. Ghosts are
the most independent things in this world.

626
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:22,400
Even the ones being controlled are fundamentally,
eternally standalone.

627
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,360
Like our squad, yeah?

628
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:29,350
Yeah.

629
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:34,670
Well? The floaters are all ready.
I got a set of two.

630
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,630
Even someone with
a titanium skull wouldn't drown.

631
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:40,670
You seriously want to swim
in the ocean in midwinter?

632
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:43,320
Gotta shake off those memories
of almost drowning.

633
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,760
Plus it ain't too often
I get to see you in a swimsuit.

634
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,220
That's your real goal?

635
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:48,980
Huh?

636
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,100
Unbelievable.

637
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,430
No, no! I'm doing this all for you!

638
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:57,690
I'll take a rain check.

639
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,270
I'm telling you, you got it all wrong!

1
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,250
<i>Major. Hey, Major!</i>

2
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,110
<i>What was that? Virtual reality?</i>

3
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,820
<i>I'm on vacation. Don't be so casual</i>
<i>about entering my cyber lobby.</i>

4
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,700
<i>My condolences. There's been</i>
<i>a terrorist bombing in Nishinouchi.</i>

5
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,180
<i>The vics were an executive at</i>
<i>a foreign-owned water company,</i>

6
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,430
<i>a Trade Ministry official,</i>
<i>and a domestic weapons manufacturer.</i>

7
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,870
<i>The top-priority entry in</i>
<i>the terrorism prediction list</i>

8
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,400
<i>you gave Public Security</i>
<i>was right on target.</i>

9
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,170
<i>I assume they were in a secret</i>
<i>meeting to agree on water prices.</i>

10
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,360
<i>Everything's in smithereens,</i>
<i>including some Foreign Affairs guards.</i>

11
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,640
<i>There was also an explosion at</i>
<i>the Yamanote Dam, by the way.</i>

12
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,320
<i>The dam?</i>

13
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,980
<i>Dunno if it's related.</i>

14
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,020
<i>But it essentially belongs to</i>
<i>a foreign-owned water company,</i>

15
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,540
<i>and there's a retired Trade official on staff.</i>

16
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,970
<i>The bureaucrats' turf wars</i>
<i>are intense in that industry.</i>

17
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,140
<i>So, who asked for us?</i>

18
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,100
<i>Section 9, as usual.</i>

19
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:50,920
<i>They failed to put your list to good use,</i>
<i>but they did track the perps.</i>

20
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,170
<i>They say they can't secure 'em,</i>
<i>though. Too outgunned.</i>

21
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,340
<i>Call everyone in. I'm coming too.</i>

22
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:04,370
Work calls?

23
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,890
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,560
Five hours, seven minutes.
That's a record-length vacation for you.

25
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,670
Are you consulting for the police today?
Or the Cyberbrain Development Bureau?

26
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,450
I'll make it up to you.

27
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,090
Don't forget what we talked about.

28
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,870
Are you serious?

29
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,560
Of course.

30
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,710
You should get going. All your
customers are impatient types, right?

31
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,020
Yes.

32
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,720
<i>Wow, you've been with that guy for</i>
<i>three months! That's a new record.</i>

33
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,010
<i>Don't be so casual about using</i>
<i>that Ghost infiltration key.</i>

34
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,060
Your precinct ID'd him as
Detective Naoharu Mizuki.

35
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,520
Is that right?

36
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,970
Yeah. He's my senior.

37
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,370
ls this all he had on him?

38
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,330
His holster was empty.

39
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,790
His piece must've been washed away or stolen.

40
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,710
It's hard to believe the gun under
his jacket would get washed away.

41
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,720
And it'd be odd for someone to
steal his gun but leave his wallet.

42
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,200
A prosthetics specialist...

43
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,370
He sure doesn't look cyborgized.

44
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,810
Lieutenant, your guys rounded up
all the unclaimed property in the area, right?

45
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,360
Let's look for something else
that ties back to him.

46
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,340
You want me to be your errand boy?

47
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,970
If the dam incident was really an accident, yes.

48
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,580
Lieutenant! I found something odd.

49
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,560
What are these?

50
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,000
They look like prosthetics, but...

51
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,570
Mermaid's Legs...

52
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,770
<i>Report.</i>

53
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,230
Lots of injured cops.
Six perps still going strong.

54
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,380
They're on their way to Ward 4.

55
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,690
They see right through the police strategy.

56
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,910
They secured an escape route ahead of time.

57
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,370
This group is highly trained.

58
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,330
They have a commander
somewhere out there. Ishikawa!

59
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,830
<i>I picked up their line!</i>

60
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,360
The seventh one. This is their leader.

61
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,620
This is a cutting-edge ghost lock.
Don't waste time resisting.

62
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,820
<i>I'll make him order his friends to surrender.</i>

63
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,690
<i>Ishikawa, run a forced recognition program.</i>

64
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,550
<i>Roger.</i>

65
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,410
<i>Abort the operation. Throw down</i>
<i>your guns and surrender.</i>

66
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,660
<i>Repeat: Abort the operation and surrender.</i>

67
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:44,480
Huh?

68
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,150
Aw, no shootout?

69
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,110
I captured one!

70
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,180
Hey, you're pretty useful!

71
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,020
We got the last one.

72
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,580
Good. Hand them all over to Public Security.

73
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,860
A virus alert?

74
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,800
It's the man you captured!

75
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,320
This pain...

76
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,950
The ghost lock released?

77
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,270
<i>Major?</i>

78
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,870
<i>Shit. Saito!</i>

79
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,480
<i>Don't kill him!</i>

80
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,430
No more of that!

81
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:26,140
<i>Damn, it feels gross having someone</i>
<i>infiltrate my Ghost- even the Major.</i>

82
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,370
<i>Truer words...</i>

83
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,210
Your fault for aiming for the head.

84
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,900
Don't hand them over yet. We'll take
them to a lockup with cyber facilities.

85
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,780
You telling me to play interrogation partner?

86
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,930
I'm not interested in fake memories.

87
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,930
Memories?

88
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,450
I'm interested in their contaminated Ghosts.

89
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,940
Sorry I had to call you down here.

90
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,300
It's my civic duty.

91
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,140
I understand you're in charge
of the dam. Let's see...

92
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,190
Dr. Zhinzhee Bekka Arr Thied.

93
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,370
Please, call me Thied.

94
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,730
You've got quite the tough-looking secretary.

95
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,340
He's very reliable.

96
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:19,490
The conflicts continue in the Republic
of Kuzan, where you're from.

97
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:25,060
I hear the Qhardi ethnic minority in particular
is still waging a war of independence.

98
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:28,080
It's a heartbreaking war.

99
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,480
You're Qhardi, correct?

100
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:36,670
Yes. Like the majority of my comrades,
l wish for a peaceful solution.

101
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,970
So, the explosion at the dam...

102
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,510
I'm told it was a valve malfunction.

103
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:47,770
Your company sells water, right?
For what type of use?

104
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:53,820
It's for precision machinery businesses.
That industry relies on 100% pure water.

105
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,690
Precision machinery...
Prosthetic manufacturing, for example?

106
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,200
Yes.

107
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,430
Chief...

108
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:04,760
You idiot!

109
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:08,660
The Trade Ministry got them
invited to set up a plant here!

110
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,280
You want to make an enemy
of the local precinct, too?

111
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,710
But...

112
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,900
Stop, that's evidence!

113
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:25,830
I'm very grateful to you for finding
the goods stolen from our warehouse.

114
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,890
Please, take them with you.

115
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,810
Chief!

116
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,400
Back off!

117
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,270
A detective died, sir.

118
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,790
You think I don't know that?

119
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,760
You go to Nishinouchi and get me information.

120
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,360
Nishinouchi? What's there?

121
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,490
A bombing, apparently by Qhardi terrorists.

122
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,450
Now listen: You consult your superiors
before any moves on this case.

123
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,600
Terrorism?

124
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,610
If the explosion was intentional,
and he wasn't a victim...

125
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,050
What?

126
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,260
Yes, sir! I'm on it!

127
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,110
Don't make any trouble!

128
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,790
They're a Qhardi weapons smuggling gang.
I met them on an undercover op.

129
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,690
Their goal is to send weapons
to their comrades back home.

130
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:19,110
They've got no reason to attack this country.

131
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,110
Their statements were crystal clear:

132
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,800
They're against the pricing agreement,
so they bombed the meeting site.

133
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,910
Are you telling me those are planted memories?

134
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,270
I'm betting they're all infected.

135
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,270
And that the virus interfered
with my ghost lock.

136
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:42,280
Well done. You subdued them brilliantly.

137
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,240
We could do it even more easily if you
adjusted your comm standards to ours.

138
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,470
I read your report.

139
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:54,750
A false memory virus that can infiltrate,
 hack, and brainwash simultaneously?

140
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,860
It's a self-destructing Stuxnet-type.

141
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,710
Other than the symptoms at
its onset, it leaves no trace.

142
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,990
Electronic manipulation of
memory is incredibly difficult.

143
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:07,370
No one in the world has
been confirmed successful.

144
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,600
And yet past incidents tell us a
maker and a broker clearly exist.

145
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,750
Yes. Somewhere out there is
the super-wizard-class programmer

146
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,520
known as "Fire-Starter" who created
this high-level cyber-virus.

147
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,550
But until now, no organization in
the world had uncovered his identity.

148
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,490
Did you?

149
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,950
A clue, anyway.

150
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,370
What's this?

151
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,730
All the terrorists had the same tattoo.

152
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:42,050
It's a symbol used by Scylla, the hero
who once led the Qhardi Separatist Army.

153
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,280
I've heard of him. Word is he's
a master of cyber warfare.

154
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,030
Is he Fire-Starter?

155
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,550
No way. He died during the war.

156
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,240
You're going to find out whether that's true.

157
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,410
l'll authorize limited access
to Section 9's database.

158
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,170
Read the details there.

159
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,020
That's all?

160
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,710
You're complaining?

161
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:05,490
l gave you all the Logicomas I have,
plus our weapons and permission to use them.

162
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,950
Any lists I make are meaningless
if the organization can't act.

163
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,760
And?

164
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,060
I want special authority
and an approved budget.

165
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:20,060
And make your flimsy comm lines backward
compatible with ours while you're at it.

166
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:25,010
Enough! Your team isn't regulation size,
and l'm graciously turning a blind eye!

167
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,340
This unit is standardized to the perfect specs.

168
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,120
We don't need more people.

169
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,990
Then the whole unit will go down
the second <i>you</i> get hacked.

170
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,470
Just like those terrorists did.

171
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,690
Your "perfect specs" don't merit my trust.

172
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,590
If you want authority and a budget,
get at least one more member

173
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,400
and accept cooperation from
someone with different specs.

174
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,410
If they won't give us money, we're stuck
in this garbage dump for a while.

175
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,450
I'm just glad we've got a lab to use.

176
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:02,630
Yeah, high prosthetic performance
takes superior maintenance...

177
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,800
We'll have to pay for upgrades
out of pocket. Costs a lot, though.

178
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,470
Training ground instructors
make pretty good money.

179
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,540
Top-quality maintenance facilities,
authority - we'll get it all.

180
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,480
Stop wasting time bitching and solve our case!

181
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,960
His nationality's unknown.

182
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,620
He uses multiple bodies to conceal his identity,

183
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,930
earning the name Skulla, aka Scylla.

184
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,410
That's the name of a monster
from Greek mythology.

185
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,890
A pro at warfare who led
a separatist army, and whiz hacker...

186
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,560
Huh, his specialty is tunnel ops.

187
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,620
"Tunnel ops"?

188
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:44,020
That's when you bomb someplace's lifelines

189
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,090
and then infiltrate them
electronically during their restoration.

190
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:51,760
Ultimately you wage a destructive
cyber-attack from inside their defenses.

191
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:56,280
The forces who tried to prevent
independence took a major hit instead.

192
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,860
But Kuzan joined forces with advanced nations

193
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,560
to manipulate the Qhardis in
order to contain its neighbors.

194
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,300
It was a throwaway war of independence,
and this country was especially involved.

195
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,780
No one recognized the Qhardis'
independence after the war,

196
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,490
and the guerillas were
disbanded and slaughtered.

197
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,660
But their dead leader was actually alive,

198
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,830
and he developed a special virus ahead
of all the world's research institutions,

199
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:22,480
then changed his name to
Fire-Starter and began his revenge...

200
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,500
I follow the logic, but is it really possible?

201
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:29,190
In a conflict zone, you can do all
the human experimentation you want.

202
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,820
It's no wonder, really.

203
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,970
Scylla is dead.

204
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,320
A successor of his, then?

205
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,790
Either way, the broker isn't peddling
it without knowing what it does.

206
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,690
So he wanted to use those guerillas
to repeat his old tunnel operation here?

207
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,480
lt bothers me that no one
was carrying a detonator.

208
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,720
Borma, check out the crime scene.

209
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
Roger.

210
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,160
Paz, you and Saito pay the gang a visit.
I want to know who trained them.

211
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00,330
Batou and Ishikawa, you look into
the possibility of a tunnel op.

212
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:04,830
Do you plan to dive into the guerillas' cyberbrains looking for the virus?

213
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,840
I'll get a tune-up on my body first.

214
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,720
A tune-up?

215
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,320
It's her <i>boyfriend.</i>
He's an ex-military prosthetics tech.

216
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,040
No, isn't he a Navy sailor?

217
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,560
That was the last one.

218
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,100
They fought on a date,

219
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,020
and she kicked his ass hard enough
to put him in the hospital.

220
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,690
What about that rich one
from the Cyberbrain Bureau?

221
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,860
He didn't last two weeks.

222
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,780
So this is the sixth in six months?
She's got a sickness.

223
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,360
No, it's instinct. I never sleep
with the same woman twice either.

224
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,260
Because you always end up a hostage
or a target for revenge?

225
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,910
No, because it's my policy.

226
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,080
At least do background checks on them!
What if one of them's a trap?

227
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,600
It's better than hearing, "I want a family".

228
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,940
Yeah, after all, you could die at any time.

229
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:53,780
This is no job for a family man.

230
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,040
So the late detective's gun wasn't found?

231
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,540
If Detective Mizuki had fired his weapon,

232
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,310
it would prove this was a crime,
and not an accident.

233
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,020
You think someone wanted
it to look like an accident?

234
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:15,300
The cause of death was drowning,
but he lost a lot of blood antemortem,

235
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,990
and some of his bones are missing.

236
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:24,310
So the body's too damaged to tell,
but he may have been shot.

237
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,730
Detective Mizuki was
investigating weapons smuggling.

238
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:30,650
His most recent meeting was
with a Qhardi organization.

239
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,960
I suspect he was killed because he found proof.

240
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,930
You feel the dam explosion was intentional,
set up to bury evidence?

241
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,950
You've got a great imagination.

242
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,240
You're turning me down, sir?

243
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,770
No, I like it. I'll allow you to investigate.

244
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,480
Try to find a connection between the incidents.

245
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,290
All alone?

246
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,130
You're complaining?

247
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,800
I appreciate it, sir!

248
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,100
Humans can never perfectly
reproduce movements.

249
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:09,140
A slight slope, our distance from our target,
a few milligrams' weight difference...

250
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:13,880
The brain calculates all these things
to create yet-unknown movements.

251
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,960
You have the most original brain I know of,

252
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,080
and you understand the beauty
of uniform standards.

253
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,140
You're exaggerating.

254
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:25,200
There's nothing wrong with you.

255
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,100
It still hurts?

256
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,100
Try moving your right leg.

257
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,550
Lovely.

258
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,170
What's "lovely"?

259
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:39,720
Your leg.

260
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,910
The pain is gone now.

261
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,220
Send me a bill.

262
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,560
I'll give you a discount.
In return, don't forget our promise.

263
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,350
You're a strange man.

264
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,900
Not as strange as you.

265
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,710
Hey, you. You're blocking my scan.

266
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,270
Oh, sorry.

267
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,090
What good are your natural
eyes in the cyber age?

268
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,210
It's not normally this hard to find the epicenter.

269
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,170
You know a lot about the combustion process?

270
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,720
I learned the basics overseas during the war.

271
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,990
l see.

272
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,530
Are you a full cyborg?

273
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,230
Yeah, pretty close.

274
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,230
I'm no expert, but unless you
get a specialized skeleton,

275
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,400
aren't the basics the same as a human body's?

276
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,070
But his hands stayed open after he burned...

277
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,960
What?

278
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,630
When a natural human burns to death,

279
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:47,280
his muscles contract, so he forms
fists and he bends forward.

280
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,180
The fetal position, or,
you know, the boxer's pose.

281
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,930
Heat rigor? Well, what about it?

282
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:59,360
This guard's corpse is standing
up straight, hands open.

283
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,860
Must be some property of
his prosthetics, or of the bomb.

284
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,490
Prosthetics?

285
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,410
Hello?

286
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,480
Oh, a checkup?

287
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,380
Two weeks?

288
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,340
Got it. No, I'm working right now, sorry.

289
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,300
"Checkup"?

290
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,510
Sorry to bother you.

291
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,900
C-4 and dynamite, glycerin,
and chemical fertilizer...

292
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,170
It's a hideout straight out of a book.

293
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:48,820
Definitely a bomb maniac vibe...
but I've got no clue what they actually used.

294
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,780
<i>Orders coming down their line!</i>

295
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,500
Someone calling himself Scylla just
ordered some "Second Army" into action.

296
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,710
Damn bastards! Public Security's
moves are being leaked!

297
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,950
<i>The Waterworks Bureau's server blew,</i>
<i>and took out the whole floor.</i>

298
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,320
<i>What did they use?</i>

299
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,990
<i>The accelerant at the Nishinouchi crime scene</i>

300
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,330
<i>is spread all the way to</i>
<i>the ceiling, even the ducts.</i>

301
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:17,790
<i>We're talking omnidirectional blast.</i>
<i>The air itself blew up.</i>

302
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,980
<i>A fuel-air explosive?</i>

303
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:23,940
Then this is a dummy hideout. They've got
a more advanced bomb lab somewhere.

304
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,050
Damn guerilla hero is issuing a challenge.

305
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:43,860
<i>The Waterworks Bureau is starting repairs.</i>
<i>Odds are the hacker's already in!</i>

306
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,650
<i>Figure out their next target.</i>

307
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,260
<i>Don't let them dig any more tunnels.</i>

308
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,320
I appreciate your cooperation.

309
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,390
I'm used to police questioning.

310
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:14,780
There've been a lot of
prosthetics thefts recently.

311
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,290
"Mermaid's Legs", eh?

312
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,500
Not a very artistic name,
but it's easy to understand.

313
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:24,110
My female customers quite like it.

314
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,210
Do you recognize these legs?

315
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,380
They appear to be the mass-production model.

316
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,620
Look at the tag.

317
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:35,300
"Ariel".

318
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,580
I've asked around, and there's
no such model on the market.

319
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,270
I don't carry it, either. It must be
a licensed designer's brand name.

320
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,250
Designers use
the mass-production model as a base

321
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,420
and then innovate to
meet customer demands.

322
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,610
Any ideas?

323
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:55,200
l'll give you my list. One moment, please.

324
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,240
Thank you.

325
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,280
Cops love lists. He'll be conveniently
absorbed in it for a while.

326
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,840
Public Security took our dummy safe house.

327
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,140
Are the comm lines here safe, Colonel Hozumi?

328
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,810
Don't worry. It's one of
lntelligence's independent lines.

329
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,100
Why haven't you killed that detective?

330
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,060
He's an odd duck, but he doesn't
have any powerful backers.

331
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,790
The real issue is that Ariel's been leaked.

332
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,970
We retrieved the sample before it was
analyzed, and the factory is taken care of.

333
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,340
I didn't expect you to panic and blow it up.

334
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:39,290
We're lucky Ariel was mounted in time.
You almost seriously hindered our plan.

335
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,830
Ariel is a way to smuggle explosives to
the Qhardis! It's not for suicide bombers!

336
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,520
Circumstances have changed.

337
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,030
If previous overseas weapons
development becomes domestic,

338
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,050
distribution channels will vanish.

339
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,510
The Qhardi soldiers are just sacrificial pawns?

340
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:01,040
We're upgrading. Fire-Starter can
create all the soldiers we want.

341
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,230
Get the unit that was arrested released.

342
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:06,710
I won't give you the data until then.

343
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,690
They aren't even your compatriots.

344
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,860
Scylla would never abandon them.

345
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:17,620
Very well. There are three more usable Ariels.

346
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:20,580
One of them is in your court.

347
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,040
It really has to be her?

348
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,250
Have you developed feelings for her?
Activate the woman's Ariel.

349
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:30,860
Release our allies first. Understand?

350
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,030
Ride with me.

351
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,560
You haven't told anyone that
you and I killed Scylla, I trust?

352
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
No.

353
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,360
That op is a stain on both our records.

354
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,030
It would be highly inconvenient
for it to come up again now.

355
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,930
I see you dived happily into the power
games as soon as you made LTC.

356
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:22,720
They used the military-industrial
complex to profit from death.

357
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,910
I'll wipe them out, make domestic
weapons engineering big,

358
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:28,870
and shut down their trade
routes to foreign cartels.

359
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:31,150
Lt. Col. Mamuro wanted that.

360
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,820
I won't play your game.

361
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:40,030
Scylla is a game you can't quit.
She has to stay dead.

362
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,530
You used this before.

363
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,390
Bury it and whoever's using
Scylla's name - permanently this time.

364
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:49,940
Or else the brass will bury you,
and that op with you.

365
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,780
Becoming independent of
the system doesn't make you free.

366
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:06,060
You're like last century's programmers,
who expected too much from the birth of the Net.

367
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,460
Even Section 9 is only letting you
have your own way to test you.

368
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:13,000
When they need to, they'll restrain
you with a Ghost infiltration key

369
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,750
and dispose of you.

370
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,090
I have no intention of letting
anyone infiltrate my Ghost again.

371
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,780
No matter who they are.

372
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,290
That woman is Motoko Kusanagi?

373
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,210
Yes, your senior. Can you win?

374
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,650
lf you wish.

375
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,620
You really came?

376
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:07,700
I did promise.

377
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,520
I haven't prepared anything.

378
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,660
l figured.

379
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,550
But first, we'll take care of this.

380
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:37,340
I checked out the Qhardi gang, but there's
no trace of their tactical commander.

381
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,570
Ah, but I've got the rental server they used.

382
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,510
Multiple invaders into a public facility...

383
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:45,720
Bastards have made good
progress on their tunnels.

384
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,530
<i>Do you know where they're going yet?</i>

385
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,520
<i>It's someplace to do with</i>
<i>water and precision machinery.</i>

386
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,480
<i>78 places in the city fit that description.</i>

387
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,040
<i>Check them all.</i>

388
00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:00,000
Damn... I'd make easier money
being an Intelligence subcontractor.

389
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:03,200
<i>So, still in your "tune-up"?</i>

390
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,470
<i>Yes. I'm dropping this connection for a while.</i>

391
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:11,870
I can hear noise. Your coworkers are
in and out of your lobby nonstop, huh?

392
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,310
I ran them all off.

393
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,270
You think l'll ever get to be in your lobby?

394
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:20,050
If you work with me.

395
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,940
If I said I needed one
more person, would you come?

396
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,700
Tuning you up whenever I want
is an attractive proposition,

397
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:32,180
but I don't get involved with
the military or the police.

398
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,640
Oh.

399
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,440
I did some first aid on
your sensory components.

400
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,000
Let's do the detail work in the lab.

401
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,380
The pain is gone. I'll do the rest myself.

402
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,220
Then let's get started.

403
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,560
I remember when I first met you, you know.

404
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:05,280
All the other engineers said you were
the queen of customer complaints.

405
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,990
ls that why they handed me
off to a freelancer like you?

406
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,950
Nope. The truth is, I asked them to.

407
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,910
What?

408
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:19,880
<i>You couldn't decide whether you should</i>
<i>treat your body as a thing or a person.</i>

409
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,440
<i>That made me interested in you.</i>

410
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,240
At the facility I was in before,

411
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,720
they thought I was an oddball for wanting
to sleep in a bed and take showers.

412
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:38,370
When I was prosthetized on
the battlefield, they told me,

413
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,730
"A cyborg doesn't need everyday life;
he needs equipment."

414
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,900
That's why I switched to
prosthetics engineering.

415
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:49,360
l wanted to be a tech who'd
treat cyborgs like humans.

416
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,970
<i>As a kid, they gave me everyday-living</i>
<i>training outside the facility.</i>

417
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:58,330
<i>So I'd learn how to be more human.</i>

418
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,820
<i>I don't really remember it.</i>
<i>Everything was so bright...</i>

419
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,860
I remember I came back ahead of schedule.

420
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:13,390
But... That day I decided
to make my body orthodox.

421
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,990
l wanted to look human.

422
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:19,830
Your prosthetic body isn't a thing.
It's your real body.

423
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:23,150
It mustn't be treated as a thing...
not by anyone.

424
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,550
Not by me.

425
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,050
I do wish that were true.

426
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,760
I'll show you proof.

427
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,780
Proof?

428
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,730
It's a surprise.

429
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,830
<i>We're missing the key piece: the bomb.</i>

430
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:47,070
<i>How did they get it into a heavily</i>
<i>guarded meeting place?</i>

431
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,050
What about the perps?

432
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:50,510
They say they're the ones who blew it up.

433
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:53,970
Despite the fact that they
have no memory of the bomb.

434
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,830
They're fall guys. They probably
have nothing to do with the bomb.

435
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:01,870
We'll monitor all 78 locations until
we can narrow down their target.

436
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,710
Are you serious?!

437
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,940
Contact me if something happens.

438
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,690
You're wearing heels-

439
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:14,740
Should we assume the ex-military
prosthetics tech is joining the team?

440
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,890
Maybe that's actually for real.

441
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,240
This is what you wanted to show me?

442
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,890
They're regular customers of mine.

443
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,350
Their average age is 70.

444
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,310
They're all full-body cyborgs...

445
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,380
The affluent elderly are at the core
of cyborg development these days.

446
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,520
Not soldiers.

447
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:51,240
They want prosthetic bodies to give them
second lives, and fulfilling lifestyles.

448
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,120
More and more foods for cyborgs are
being developed to meet their needs, too.

449
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,670
Try it.

450
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,850
It's good.

451
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,160
Is it your first time allocating
memory to your sense of taste?

452
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,810
The new bride is pregnant, by the way.

453
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:31,460
Exciting, isn't it? A new world
of humans that don't distinguish

454
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,280
between prosthetic and flesh.

455
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,340
You really are strange.

456
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:51,460
Some people reject the future.
And some are left behind by it, too.

457
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:59,060
I want to bring the cyborg
future to the third world.

458
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,220
Will you come with me?

459
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:11,400
You should use your power freely, not work
under a bunch of master manipulators.

460
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,260
The war is over, you know.

461
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,970
No, it's still going.

462
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:20,780
The nations it grew inconvenient
for pulled out, that's all.

463
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,940
I have things to do in this country.

464
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,350
I see.

465
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,420
Do you have free time later?

466
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:35,280
lf we share a lobby, we can
meet whenever we want.

467
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,380
I might touch your Ghost.

468
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:39,450
I'll let down my barrier.

469
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:40,440
Are you sure?

470
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,100
If you infiltrate me, I may fry your brain.

471
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,870
It might be worth it.

472
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,810
This is your body.

473
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,730
These are your hands.

474
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,010
Motoko, run!

475
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,860
Akira!

476
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,920
Are you all right?

477
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,450
Yeah...

478
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,370
l'm sorry. This is my fault.

479
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,620
My condolences.

480
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,830
Paz is with Section 9 inspecting the scene.

481
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,050
Your attacker was a pro,
even if he did mess up.

482
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,670
It's unclear whether this
was tied to the bombing,

483
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,680
but we'd normally give you
police protection at this point.

484
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,070
I don't need it. How is he?

485
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,540
We'll send him home as soon
as we're done questioning him.

486
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,520
I'll assign someone to him, so don't worry.

487
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:33,790
I see.

488
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:37,130
The military authorities won't
give me any information on Scylla.

489
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,130
What's your connection to him?

490
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,490
Call me whenever you need help.

491
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:49,430
Scylla's revenge, eh?

492
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:53,930
Good thing your boyfriend's a civilian.
We don't have to suspect a leak.

493
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,790
<i>They got us.</i>

494
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,790
<i>Number Three: a materials</i>
<i>control center on the coast.</i>

495
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,590
<i>I picked up a go order in Scylla's name</i>
<i>30 seconds before the explosion.</i>

496
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,160
<i>Then the whole line disappeared.</i>
<i>At this rate, there's no point in surveillance.</i>

497
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,910
<i>Find a weapons engineer on their</i>
<i>customer list who's connected to this.</i>

498
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,410
<i>Weapons engineer?</i>

499
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:16,520
<i>Get info from the first victims, too. Hurry up.</i>

500
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,580
<i>Find something. The virus,</i>
<i>the bombs, the tactical commander,</i>

501
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,690
<i>where the messages from "Scylla"</i>
<i>come from - I don't care what.</i>

502
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:30,140
How about you finally tell us
why you're so sure Scylla's dead?

503
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,820
Excuse me.

504
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:34,020
You!

505
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,100
I was told I could find Major Kusanagi here.

506
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,290
What is it?

507
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,710
State your business.

508
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:49,720
The list I got from him was a fake.

509
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,120
And a detective working
a weapons trafficking case

510
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,680
was killed right after getting info from him.

511
00:38:55,020 --> 00:39:01,150
Techs get blamed for
prosthetics-related incidents all the time.

512
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,150
And the manager of the dam
that exploded the other day...

513
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,470
Hose outfitted her bodyguard, too.

514
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,860
So what?!

515
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,830
How did you feel, watching your
lover get attacked in front of you?

516
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,560
You're angry at the perp,
and you feel guilty.

517
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,790
You think it was your fault he got attacked.

518
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,800
He was the same way. Anger and guilt.

519
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,570
He's hiding something.

520
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,760
The dam, the dead detective,
the prosthetics, and even you, Major...

521
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:39,230
Everything links back to Akira Hose.

522
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:45,000
You're just a cheap detective
snooping around with flesh eyes!

523
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,610
Never show your face here again!

524
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,070
Ouch.

525
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,260
You're an idiot, Colonel!

526
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,210
An attack barrier!

527
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,230
Keep calm.

528
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:24,880
If the domestic faction takes
away your arms industry rights,

529
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,880
you'll be killed by the cartels.

530
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,380
Yet you're in a rush to kill
me off and steal my data?

531
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:34,200
So, you act like a heavyweight,
but you couldn't get my people released?

532
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:36,370
Where is the data?

533
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:40,040
Our deal is over.
I'm thankful for the info on her

534
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:44,580
and for Scylla's revival,
but I'm leaving this country.

535
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,060
You do the same.

536
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,670
No need.

537
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,600
We've successfully packaged
the virus with cyberbrains.

538
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:03,440
We'll use your cyberbrain for the final upgrade.

539
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,900
Become Scylla, just like you wanted to.

540
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,030
"His hands stayed open after he burned", eh?

541
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,120
<i>It's just like the call said.</i>

542
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,180
<i>Two Public Security officers killed,</i>
<i>and Akira Hose's whereabouts unknown.</i>

543
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,330
<i>The Major wasn't the target?</i>

544
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,270
<i>Hey, look at this list.</i>

545
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:53,990
<i>It's only a guess, but I think the FAEs</i>
<i>were the prosthetic limbs themselves.</i>

546
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:57,410
<i>There was another full-cyborg guard</i>
<i>in that part of the building.</i>

547
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:00,240
<i>The limbs' admin records have</i>
<i>the same signature on them...</i>

548
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,080
What are you doing?

549
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,420
Who is this man?!

550
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,860
My attack barrier expands every second.

551
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,800
If you don't want your brain fried, tell me!

552
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,550
He'll die!

553
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:25,560
He gave us power... He's the new Scylla!

554
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:31,880
It was like magic. A battle-learning
program left to us by the dead Scylla...

555
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,550
He gave it to my cyberbrain,
along with the virus.

556
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,910
I'd never been trained, but now
I can fight even your people!

557
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,370
Give me a name.

558
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:45,830
Akira Hose! He's Japanese, like you!

559
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:57,070
Hose escaped. Any idea where?

560
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,740
Why ask me?

561
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,340
What are your eyes looking at right now?

562
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,310
Zhinzhee Bekka Arr Thied.

563
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:12,230
She's boss of a Kuzan water company,
and most likely the weapons ring's sponsor.

564
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,480
<i>So this is the tunnel exit!</i>

565
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:18,150
<i>A domestic weapons company -</i>
<i>Harimadara Heavy Industries!</i>

566
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:22,370
<i>The execs are touring Factory One with</i>
<i>the Senior Vice-Minister of Defense!</i>

567
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,000
<i>Recommend a barrier,</i>
<i>and give the data to Section 9.</i>

568
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,290
<i>Paz, Borma, Saito, get over there.</i>

569
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:33,900
Call the bomb squad and a prosthetics tech.

570
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,760
A destructive cyber-attack is more than likely.

571
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,930
What's the meaning of this, Chief Aramaki?

572
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:45,310
Evacuate immediately.

573
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,270
You and this facility are targets.

574
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,730
Wh-What's going on?!

575
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,190
It's a bomb! Run!

576
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,180
Damn.

577
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,350
Shit!

578
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,660
Paz, Borma! This way!

579
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,330
Help me! Help me!

580
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,860
<i>Crap, the fire's closing up my throat.</i>

581
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:25,180
<i>Mine too. That was close.</i>

582
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,430
Vice-Minister, are you all right?

583
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:30,000
I'm fine.

584
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:36,740
<i>Logicoma.</i>

585
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:37,570
Yes, sir!

586
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,030
That's one of our products...!

587
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,410
Away from the windows!

588
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,040
That's all the info on Colonel Hozumi.

589
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:58,750
That's fine. We get a card,
and you get a grace period.

590
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,470
Please tell me what she has to do with Scylla!

591
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,490
Find out from her.
Your contaminated brain is intriguing,

592
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:09,810
but I'm cutting our connection
before the infection spreads.

593
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,150
Goodbye.

594
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,620
Contaminated, eh?

595
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:31,120
I'm being bankrupted by a special
tax on foreign companies?!

596
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:34,270
How can this be allowed?!

597
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,830
It's the kind of thing
the domestic faction would do.

598
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,010
What do you plan to do? Kill the colonel?

599
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:45,970
She's all washed up. And so are you and I.

600
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,350
Escape, and obey the domestic faction.

601
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:59,060
Your company will be crushed under
the pretext of this nation's taxes.

602
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,360
You'll be killed by the cartels
if you don't do something.

603
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,530
<i>You okay, Major?</i>

604
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:10,740
<i>No problems. You go with that</i>
<i>detective and subdue the guards.</i>

605
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:14,950
<i>I'll take care of Scylla.</i>

606
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:22,420
Jeez, so stubborn. That's a scary lady.

607
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:31,330
What? A Mateba, in this day and age?

608
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:34,660
What's wrong with that?!
It's the gun I trust the most.

609
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,510
Blood traces. Someone was shot.

610
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:55,500
A bullet...

611
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:17,390
Ariel. So these are the prosthetic bombs.

612
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:40,500
That wasn't you just now.
Who the hell infiltrated my vision?!

613
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:42,420
Don't move!

614
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,920
In that quagmire of a war, Scylla was
the only soldier I could empathize with.

615
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:53,640
I've always wanted to ask
you why he was killed.

616
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:59,100
You <i>didn't</i> kill Scylla. I finally realized that.

617
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:05,480
Go home. Or your Ariel will activate.

618
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,090
<i>Even I can't stop it.</i>

619
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:39,120
<i>What's going on here? That bastard</i>
<i>infiltrated my vision exactly the way you do!</i>

620
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,480
<i>Answer me, Major!</i>

621
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:02,120
What's taking the Army so long?!
We'll all die like this!

622
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,310
<i>It's been seized.</i>

623
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:07,480
<i>It won't stop until we shut down</i>
<i>whatever it's packaged with.</i>

624
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,150
<i>Transplanted memories.</i>

625
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:09,960
<i>What?</i>

626
00:49:10,170 --> 00:49:13,170
<i>The packaged cyberbrains are the virus's hosts.</i>

627
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:17,680
<i>They converted the tactical program</i>
<i>I set loose in Qhardistan to memory.</i>

628
00:49:18,180 --> 00:49:19,600
<i>My copy.</i>

629
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:26,400
What the hell are you saying?!

630
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:35,820
Motoko.

631
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,710
I came after you, but in the end,
you captured me.

632
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:12,050
It was my cyberbrain that was packaged.

633
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:15,380
If you pull the trigger,
you and your comrades will be saved.

634
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:21,560
What you fell in love with was this world.

635
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:29,000
Just keep on going,
until the day you're betrayed.

636
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:34,670
Scylla...

637
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:37,630
I'm glad I met you.

638
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,100
What?

639
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,940
It stopped...

640
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:19,450
It's ironic.

641
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:24,010
They manage to survive a world war,
then get stuck in an endless one,

642
00:51:24,010 --> 00:51:26,180
and finally end their own lives.

643
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,460
Apparently there's no other way they can stop.

644
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,270
Weren't you the same?

645
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:35,300
Scylla was you.

646
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,900
You helped the separatist army,
then faked your death.

647
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,740
Later, the guerillas you led were all killed.

648
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:45,400
I can see why you wouldn't
want to remember that op.

649
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:50,710
Since then, I've stopped
switching bodies so often.

650
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:55,670
It gives me an identity crisis.
I lose track of who I am...

651
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,490
...and then I want someone
to tell me I'm not a robot.

652
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:06,680
<i>Is that why you insist on making original</i>
<i>tweaks to your mass-production bases?</i>

653
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:11,100
<i>It's amazing you even managed to control</i>
<i>so many bodies in such a short time.</i>

654
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,110
<i>I'm going to sleep a little. You can go.</i>

655
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:16,670
<i>Call it cyborg solidarity.</i>

656
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:19,610
<i>I'll keep watch and make sure they</i>
<i>don't fit you with any sketchy parts.</i>

657
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,840
<i>All right, suit yourself.</i>

658
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:26,030
You could at least say "thanks"!

659
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:33,170
The bullet at the scene was fired
from the lieutenant's gun.

660
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,750
I also found Mizuki's weapon
at the lieutenant's home.

661
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:39,130
There was a huge deposit into his account, too.

662
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,030
Good work. You can go.

663
00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:00,230
Arresting a fellow cop will
make you some enemies.

664
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,200
You'll be shot from behind
by the guys at his local.

665
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,910
l'll be sure to watch my back.
Did you come just to say that?

666
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,870
Will you join my team?

667
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,940
It's an independent offensive
unit with top priority.

668
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:21,800
Oh, excuse me.

669
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,360
Hello?

670
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:27,260
What?! I thought it'd be another two weeks!

671
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:30,850
No, sorry, got it. l'll be right there.

672
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:33,430
This is big! Her water broke!

673
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,390
Huh?

674
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:37,700
We're gonna have a baby!

675
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,920
Just wait, I'll be right there!

676
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,360
We'll talk another time.

677
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,070
I'm coming now!

678
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:49,600
Natural, married<i>, and</i> a father?

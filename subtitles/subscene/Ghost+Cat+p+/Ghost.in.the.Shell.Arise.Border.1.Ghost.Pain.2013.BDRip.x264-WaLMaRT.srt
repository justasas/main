1
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:45,547
I'm amazed we got permission
to exhume the body.

2
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:49,634
It's backward. They disregarded our
investigation by burying him to begin with.

3
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:54,222
Yes, sir. Still, a military cemetery...

4
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:58,643
It's ridiculously expensive to dispose
of a prosthetic body that can't be reused.

5
00:00:58,852 --> 00:01:02,063
Thanks to their cost-cutting,
we can recover the cyberbrain.

6
00:01:02,272 --> 00:01:03,773
Where are the engineers?

7
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:07,026
Drawing straws at HQ.

8
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:10,905
Apparently, connecting to a
dead criminal's cyberbrain is "creepy."

9
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:13,491
We don't know yet that he's a criminal.

10
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,076
Chief Aramaki!

11
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:17,787
We'll check the contents,
then take it back to headquarters.

12
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:26,379
What are you waiting for? Put it down!

13
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:29,424
Sorry, sir!

14
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,969
Don't open that coffin!

15
00:03:22,662 --> 00:03:24,747
This is from your unit.

16
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:12,003
Are you military?

17
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:18,217
I'm Aramaki, with Public Security Section 9.

18
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:22,096
We're investigating
Lieutenant Colonel Mamuro's murder.

19
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:24,641
I'm seizing his cyberbrain
and prosthetic body as evidence.

20
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:29,354
He's also suspected of taking bribes,
and we're investigating that too.

21
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,773
Public Security has no
right to ransack this place.

22
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:34,192
We'll bury him again when the case is closed.

23
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,612
And how do I know you won't pull
a cover-up, or fabricate evidence?

24
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,908
The military is in the middle of its
first major shakeup since the war.

25
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:46,663
It would be more suspicious if
this only got an internal investigation.

26
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:50,249
If he were still with us, Mamuro
would have been the first to say so.

27
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,918
You knew him?

28
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,504
Yes, back when I was an Army man.

29
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:58,591
There's not a soldier in the
world more squeaky-clean than he was.

30
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,473
Your name and unit?

31
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,229
Major Motoko Kusanagi, Unit 501.

32
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,776
501? So you were his subordinate.

33
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,571
Open it up.

34
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,949
Can I ask your rank?

35
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:25,576
I was in the old
Investigations Section. That's all.

36
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:30,581
They sold off whatever wouldn't
fit in the coffin to a junk shop.

37
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:43,886
That's not his body!

38
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:09,287
Get down!

39
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:04,217
Finally back on base, you delinquent?

40
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:07,136
Why did you authorize
Public Security's involvement?!

41
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:11,390
Since I can't dismiss the possibility that
Mamuro was corrupt, I had no choice.

42
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,602
Unit 501 should be investigating this!

43
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:19,565
The higher-ups told us to stay out of it.

44
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:22,193
Someone set a trap at his grave.

45
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:23,194
Ignore it.

46
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:25,822
His cyberbrain is gone!

47
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,074
This isn't the time to stir up a hornet's nest.

48
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:32,161
Then you believe that he
was taking dirty money?

49
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,040
He got mugged downtown. That much is fact.

50
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:41,587
Not an honorable death, but compared
to indictment, maybe he got lucky.

51
00:07:41,796 --> 00:07:45,633
Thanks to him, our letters of
recommendation are on hold, too.

52
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:47,718
Concentrate on your work for now.

53
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:49,637
Work?

54
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:54,559
I distinctly remember asking you
to analyze that infected hardware.

55
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:59,605
Not possible. I just got
back to Japan today, you know.

56
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:02,108
True enough.

57
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:03,734
I'll do the assignment.

58
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:07,446
In return, give me leave to go
off-base and authorize direct debit.

59
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:09,407
Such a problem child.

60
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:12,827
I'm only going to find out who set the trap.

61
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:16,497
Very well. I'll take care
of it in Mamuro's place.

62
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:18,583
Thanks, Kurutsu.

63
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:23,004
Don't forget your meeting with the brass.

64
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,009
Giichi Mamuro, member of
a special unit of the GSDA,

65
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:54,929
was murdered on the fifth of this month.

66
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:58,474
--Niihama police say the investigation into his possible corruption is
ongoing. --Lieutenant Colonel Mamuro is suspected of taking large bribes...

67
00:09:58,683 --> 00:10:03,062
...while serving as a security official
in Harimadara's weapons export--

68
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:40,850
Access records of his movements
on the day of his death

69
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:43,561
and all data from city surveillance cameras.

70
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,341
He was tailed.

71
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:18,054
Scan anyone who traveled the same
route he did before time of death.

72
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,185
Three...

73
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,821
A fourth?

74
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:12,149
Three men and a mobile
land mine were following him?

75
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:21,242
"Funds transferred."

76
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:25,913
What is this?

77
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,375
Any pain?

78
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,544
Not right now, no.

79
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:34,964
It's similar to the phantom
pain particular to cyborgs,

80
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:37,591
but that shouldn't affect you.

81
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,386
Could be a bad contact in
your nervous components.

82
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,596
Any other abnormalities?

83
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:50,396
No.

84
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,857
We should do a full-body checkup to be safe.

85
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:57,361
Thank you, but I have a meeting to go to.

86
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:04,994
Goodness, you have visitors.

87
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,371
They announced themselves
as Public Security Section 9.

88
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,956
Say I'm not here.

89
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:17,381
As both a Special Cyborg and a
recognized wizard-class programmer,

90
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,968
new regulations apply to you
under the revised Weapons Act.

91
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:26,056
The Prosthetics Maintenance Rule
now applies to issuing identification,

92
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:30,686
possessing cash, opening bank accounts,
or other ownership of assets.

93
00:13:30,895 --> 00:13:33,355
In Lt. Col. Mamuro's letter
on my reclassification,

94
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,817
he guaranteed my financial autonomy.

95
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:40,738
If he's proven corrupt,
he'll receive a dishonorable discharge,

96
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:43,282
and all such documents will be void.

97
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:45,576
You expect me to endure a position

98
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:48,913
where I have to file paperwork
every time I open my wallet?

99
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:52,625
The cost of prosthetic bodies far exceeds
standard health insurance payouts.

100
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:57,171
You ought to do your duty to the government
which guarantees your right to life.

101
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:01,050
This is the consent form for your monitoring
and custody post-restructuring.

102
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,719
Make an effort to understand
your circumstances.

103
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,568
During the war,
Japan allocated a sky-high budget

104
00:14:19,777 --> 00:14:22,029
to promote cyborg development.

105
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:26,116
Did they tell you to become
Army property to foot the bill?

106
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,663
There were large deposits
made to Mamuro's accounts.

107
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:36,460
But after his murder,
someone withdrew all that money.

108
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:38,212
What do you want?

109
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,384
Major Kusanagi, of Unit 501. No criminal record.

110
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:47,054
You work with the Army and
Public Security as a special consultant.

111
00:14:47,263 --> 00:14:50,558
You specialize in solving cybercrimes.

112
00:14:57,773 --> 00:15:01,443
I request that you track down the missing
money and analyze the coffin records.

113
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:05,781
Since it's an official investigation,
you should be given leave to go off-base.

114
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,991
<i>What's the pay?</i>

115
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,287
I'll give you the regular
consulting fee, as a civilian.

116
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:13,205
That'll be an issue, you know.

117
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:18,544
A soldier famous for his integrity being
shot to death in secret is a bigger issue.

118
00:15:28,596 --> 00:15:30,055
--Hey!
--How dare you?!

119
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:34,935
Tomorrow morning, I'll send you a
liaison who'll double as a bodyguard.

120
00:15:35,144 --> 00:15:36,395
Think she's in?

121
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:38,772
She's as in the dark as we are.

122
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:41,984
If she wants to be free,
she'll have to find out the truth.

123
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:50,492
Still don't want the 501 to investigate?

124
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:54,038
Make one wrong move,
and our unit could get dissolved.

125
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,206
Public Security offered me an assignment.

126
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,499
Will you accept?

127
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:58,959
Lend me a hand.

128
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:02,546
If you can't get it done alone,
you'll be at the end of the line.

129
00:16:02,755 --> 00:16:05,466
No one else will be able to protect you then.

130
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:09,011
Being protected isn't what I learned to do here!

131
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:11,305
I learned to make the most of my strengths!

132
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,852
I'll grant permission for you to use Server 6.

133
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:18,729
Thanks.

134
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,939
Just don't forget the job <i>I</i> gave you.

135
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:30,616
List the people working on the case.

136
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:34,161
But this is clearly related
to the LTC's mugging!

137
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,040
We know he met up with the prostitute.
We need a warrant for her cust-

138
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:41,585
It's military jurisdiction! You keep out of it!

139
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:45,172
You just forget this case,
you hear me? That's an order!

140
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:51,804
Then what's a special
investigator even for, dammit?!

141
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:57,267
"Mamuro was being followed."

142
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,687
What?!

143
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:22,251
--Hey!
--St-Stop right there!

144
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:40,144
There you are!

145
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,448
Well, if it isn't the little
tomboy from the lab.

146
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:02,332
The one who infiltrated me... is in that car...!

147
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,883
You fool! That makes you a deserter!

148
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,890
Stop, Raizo!

149
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,933
You all right, Kusanagi?

150
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,894
Instructor lbachi...

151
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:26,565
Don't think you can do whatever you want
just because you were Mamuro's favorite!

152
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:30,068
Your selfish actions put
the whole unit in danger!

153
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:34,239
That's enough! I'll be the one to lecture her.

154
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:39,411
That bitch only survived as a test subject.

155
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,503
The number is a fake. He's a slippery customer.

156
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:50,881
We've proven there was an infiltrator, at least.

157
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:52,674
What does Kurutsu say?

158
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,384
"Ignore it."

159
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,471
ls your prosthetic body acting up?

160
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,725
I don't know.

161
00:19:01,934 --> 00:19:03,393
Goodness, another visitor.

162
00:19:03,602 --> 00:19:05,979
You've got a strange one here to see you.

163
00:19:10,025 --> 00:19:11,527
What is this?

164
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:20,619
It uses signal lights? How old is this thing?

165
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:23,914
Here, come with me.

166
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,138
Construct your learning base yourself.

167
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,021
Hello, nice to meet you!

168
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:54,278
I'm an autonomous-follower logistics system--
a "Logistics Conveyer Machine."

169
00:19:54,486 --> 00:19:58,323
You're Section 9's "liaison
who'll double as a bodyguard"?

170
00:19:58,532 --> 00:20:01,326
Chief Aramaki calls me a "Logicoma"!

171
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:05,956
You'll be receiving information
through me, Major Kusanagi.

172
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:10,586
No synching. Explain things orally or as data.

173
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:15,841
Um... Any Army case information on
the group identified as illicit arms dealers

174
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:20,304
would be very useful to Chief Aramaki
in tracking down a mobile land mine!

175
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:23,265
The Army? Arms dealers?

176
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:24,975
Yes, sir!

177
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,689
You disappear. I'll take it from here.

178
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:33,400
Order acknowledged!

179
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:36,695
Optical camouflage?

180
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,205
Stay here and guard my bike.

181
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:48,916
Right!

182
00:20:52,753 --> 00:20:56,798
Come on, walk straight!
Look, we're almost there.

183
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:04,681
Hi there!

184
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:05,641
Come on in.

185
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:08,727
It's not even dinnertime, and
this guy's three sheets to the wind!

186
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:11,063
Get him something cold, okay?

187
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:14,691
Come on, get it together! Sit straight!

188
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:28,455
I fold.

189
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:30,082
Gonna go hit the can.

190
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,792
Hey, no fair!

191
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,086
But you had a great hand!

192
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,677
There.

193
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,393
Warning! Warning!

194
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:51,979
Someone approaching, extremely close!

195
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:57,484
Don't move. Who sent you?!

196
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:18,880
Were you the ones who killed Lt. Col. Mamuro?

197
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,799
Huh? Are you Public Security?

198
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:22,467
Answer me!

199
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:28,515
First you check the Army database!
Code 24, Ops H2976...

200
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:30,934
...code name Paz!

201
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,645
You're undercover?!

202
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:38,900
Yeah, the group I'm in with was hired for a hit.

203
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,360
They said the target was a full cyborg

204
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:43,405
and his cyberbrain had to be destroyed,
so we'd use mobile land mines.

205
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,533
Three of 'em--and I'm talking military-grade.

206
00:22:46,742 --> 00:22:48,952
Lt. Col. Mamuro's murder?

207
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:53,206
Who knows? Apparently
somebody beat our guys to it,

208
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:55,417
and we let the mines get away.

209
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,544
Where did the mines come from?

210
00:22:57,753 --> 00:22:59,755
Maneuver Area 6.

211
00:22:59,963 --> 00:23:04,593
That place is a joke. Might as well
set foxes to guard a henhouse.

212
00:23:06,428 --> 00:23:08,847
Feel like proving it with me?

213
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:13,810
This ain't the best job,
but I can't just drop it.

214
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:17,939
I'd be in danger, and I'd
cause trouble for my CO.

215
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:20,317
Is your CO trustworthy?

216
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:23,320
Used to be.

217
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:26,948
I see.

218
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:30,368
Thanks for your cooperation.

219
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:34,498
I wish I had your freedom of movement.

220
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,802
You can't analyze it?

221
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,720
It might just be noise.

222
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:13,745
No full-body cyborg gets to leave
this organization and go independent.

223
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:18,208
You're just a girl with a little
talent for cyber warfare.

224
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:20,710
Mamuro's death was an inevitability.

225
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:24,297
Don't step out of line, or I'll take you out.

226
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:28,301
Kurutsu and lbachi can't shield you from me.

227
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,054
An inevitability...

228
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,258
"Maneuver Area 6"

229
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:25,483
Their security's a joke, all right.

230
00:25:38,788 --> 00:25:41,416
All that's left is to connect the dots...

231
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:45,754
Look, I've got authorization!
And all I'm gonna do is ask questions!

232
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,589
Take your complaints to the station.

233
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:53,970
Where does he get off? It ain't like
I've never been deployed, dammit...

234
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:02,395
This is bullshit! They're not even he--

235
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:08,735
Ah, sorry. I'm a special investigator
with the Niihama police.

236
00:26:08,944 --> 00:26:11,738
I was told I could find these two here.

237
00:26:11,947 --> 00:26:13,949
I have some questions for
First Lieutenant Moto Seta

238
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:16,409
and Captain Amuri Noto here--

239
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:20,705
Thanks. You just connected some dots.

240
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:26,795
And I see some others just connected.
How about showing yourself?

241
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:35,887
Batou the Ranger?

242
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:41,101
Long time no see. Gotta say I
didn't figure you for this one.

243
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:42,686
What do you mean?

244
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:47,565
The man you killed seven days
ago was a comrade of mine!

245
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:50,318
I just got back to Japan three days ago.

246
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:52,279
Oh, really?!

247
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:18,263
I've told you your sleepless eye's
weakness is how easy it is to infiltrate.

248
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:21,933
Still afraid of taking friendly
fire out in the jungle?

249
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:24,477
I'm an electronic warfare specialist too!

250
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:27,689
I can't believe you infiltrated
me in the middle of a fight!

251
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:31,443
You're just about the only
one who'd infiltrate me.

252
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:34,029
So, why are you after me?

253
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:35,363
Don't play dumb!

254
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:38,825
You're the one who got this
place's mobile land mines!

255
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:44,914
What the hell?!

256
00:27:53,006 --> 00:27:53,923
Wait!

257
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:55,967
Don't shoot! Run!

258
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:09,105
Don't!

259
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,384
Those guys aren't with you?!

260
00:28:37,592 --> 00:28:39,219
Seriously, what are you talking about?

261
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:41,012
Hey, look!

262
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:47,769
They found us!

263
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:49,354
They want to eliminate us here.

264
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:51,481
And their excuse will be a
"training exercise accident"?

265
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:54,359
I can't stop 'em with this puny gun!

266
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:59,239
We'll just have to run!

267
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:05,745
Now we climb!

268
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:06,871
Climb this?!

269
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,957
Damn straight!

270
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,543
We'll hold them off, so get moving!

271
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,586
--Okay, fine.
--Hello!

272
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,296
What's that?!

273
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:18,925
We're surrounded.

274
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:22,929
I told you, move it!

275
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:25,056
I know, I know!

276
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,443
Get in!

277
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,422
I thought you couldn't drop your job?

278
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,049
This makes a nice change of pace.

279
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:21,988
You asked the military police for help?

280
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:25,158
To escort a suspect.

281
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:26,868
What's this about?

282
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,418
This makes no sense.

283
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:41,007
Firstly: the missing money went
to your account, Major Kusanagi.

284
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:45,303
Secondly: the bullet you fired on
the mobile land mine at the graveyard

285
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:48,515
matched the one that killed Lt. Col. Mamuro.

286
00:30:48,723 --> 00:30:52,769
Seven days ago, a prostitute
here in town was shot to death.

287
00:30:52,977 --> 00:30:55,647
The bullet matched the one that killed Mamuro.

288
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:58,942
Mamuro had met with her,
and according to the other working girls,

289
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,237
he was asking questions
about one of her clients.

290
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:05,740
Seven days ago, one of my fellow Rangers

291
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:08,576
was killed by a mobile land mine,
along with his family.

292
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:14,832
He'd been in contact with Mamuro, too.

293
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:19,963
And when I traced the land mine to
its source, it led me to the major here.

294
00:31:20,171 --> 00:31:23,216
By the way, she says she got
back to Japan three days ago,

295
00:31:23,424 --> 00:31:25,885
but Immigration records
say it was seven days ago.

296
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:28,846
The three mines my group was supposed to use

297
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:32,058
were the same model as the one
Section <i>9</i> dug up at the graveyard.

298
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:36,187
Assuming one of those three was
buried and another killed the Ranger,

299
00:31:36,396 --> 00:31:38,523
there's one more left unaccounted for.

300
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:42,610
At the moment, all the clues
point to you murdering Mamuro

301
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:45,154
and stealing his money.

302
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:52,245
Right after I landed, I got a message
and an attache' case from him.

303
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:57,542
I'm sorry, Major Kusanagi. I doubt
I'll be in this world much longer.

304
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:01,963
I wanted to get justice.

305
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:05,967
I've left your recommendation
in someone else's care.

306
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:11,180
You're the most promising squad
member I know. I wish you luck.

307
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:16,769
In the case, I found data on an internal
weapons exportation racket...

308
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,646
...and this gun.

309
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:23,234
You've moved a lot of money
in the past few days.

310
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:25,862
Who are you sending it to?

311
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,532
The widow of the man who raised me.

312
00:32:29,741 --> 00:32:34,912
She's taken care of me since I was little,
but she's in a nursing home now.

313
00:32:35,121 --> 00:32:37,123
What's her name?

314
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,377
What is this woman's name?

315
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,351
Phantom pain, huh?

316
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:00,980
Even after you mechanize your body,
your brain never forgets the original.

317
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:02,732
Pain in the ass.

318
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,068
I don't have an "original" body.

319
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:06,486
What?

320
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:10,365
Have you heard of Doctor Bakeru's
emergency medicine system?

321
00:33:10,573 --> 00:33:12,825
That thing where someone
with a full prosthetic body

322
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:16,788
uses their life-support
system on somebody else?

323
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:22,377
The person who raised me used it on
me while I was in my mother's womb.

324
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:33,054
Supposedly a chemical weapon killed a
large number of civilians way back when.

325
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:36,891
A pregnant woman and the man
assumed to be her husband both died.

326
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,893
We don't even know their names.

327
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:42,563
Because someone with that particular
lifesaver happened to be on the scene,

328
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:45,233
the fetus's brain alone survived.

329
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:48,277
You're saying you were
made a full cyborg at birth?!

330
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:51,280
I lack any memory of a body.

331
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:57,286
So perhaps you could call this "ghost pain,"
created by false memories.

332
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:06,921
This is surveillance footage
from Maneuver Area 6.

333
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,632
Your subordinate is in it.

334
00:34:09,841 --> 00:34:11,968
If you refuse to hand her over,

335
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:15,555
I'll present you with a summons
signed by the Defense Minister himself.

336
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:20,143
I'll submit a written report at a
later date. I can't hand her over.

337
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:22,019
Vixen .

338
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:24,021
I'll make you regret this.

339
00:34:31,696 --> 00:34:35,658
That's Shujiro Kanzaki. He's in
charge of Maneuver Area 6,

340
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:38,536
and he leads a team of special agents.

341
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:41,831
He's also the Army's dirty go-between
with the Ministry of Defense.

342
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:45,418
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

343
00:34:48,546 --> 00:34:50,089
What's wrong?

344
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:52,800
It's nothing.

345
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:11,611
It's been empty from the beginning?
Then where's the gun?!

346
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:15,031
Why did I think there were
whistle-blowing documents in it?!

347
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,783
And the lieutenant colonel...?

348
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:39,263
What's real? What's the truth?

349
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:47,814
Where's Mamuro's cyberbrain?

350
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:53,110
Wait, Kusanagi.

351
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:55,571
Calm down.

352
00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:01,452
The hardware Kurutsu had me analyze
matched his Net synch pattern.

353
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:04,872
He and I were infected with
the same virus, weren't we?

354
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:07,500
With something hypothesized
to be a cyber-virus.

355
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:10,002
We speculate that it's a
self-destructing Stuxnet-type

356
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:12,922
which causes unknown dysfunction.

357
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:17,051
"Unknown dysfunction"...
You mean false memories.

358
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,719
It was purely a hypothesis.

359
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:21,848
At least, until we checked into your behavior.

360
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:24,892
I just got back to Japan today, you know.

361
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:27,395
True enough.

362
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:29,730
When did I come back to Japan?

363
00:36:29,939 --> 00:36:32,984
Approximately 180 hours ago.
In other words, seven days.

364
00:36:33,192 --> 00:36:38,489
And yet you continue to claim
it was another day altogether.

365
00:36:38,698 --> 00:36:39,866
Route of transmission?

366
00:36:40,074 --> 00:36:42,285
It must have been contact
with Mamuro's cyberbrain.

367
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:45,329
Which is still with his prosthetic body.

368
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:49,041
His coffin was a trap.

369
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,129
And the records Public Security got of
his burial show no signs of tampering.

370
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:57,008
So that's how it is...

371
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:00,761
Logicoma, synch with me.

372
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:02,263
Are you sure?

373
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:07,602
Just get on with it. Record my field
of vision and play it back in real time.

374
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,979
Roger!

375
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:14,442
I see things that shouldn't be there.

376
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:25,202
I don't see things that should be there.

377
00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:51,562
Here, the whole time...?

378
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:54,398
"Special agent" "The LTC is innocent"

379
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:16,712
This is a warrant for Major Kusanagi's arrest.

380
00:38:19,048 --> 00:38:21,258
Surrender her immediately.

381
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:26,055
"Special agent" "The LTC is innocent"

382
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:47,410
The records weren't tampered with.

383
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:51,914
They just buried the truth under a lie.

384
00:39:26,157 --> 00:39:27,658
I've found it...

385
00:39:29,035 --> 00:39:31,537
My reality.

386
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:41,922
Drive.

387
00:39:52,141 --> 00:39:55,561
The lieutenant colonel came
to you to blow the whistle.

388
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:59,231
Didn't he, Mr. Sadamoto,
Vice-Minister of Defense?

389
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,316
Yes.

390
00:40:00,524 --> 00:40:02,568
But you ordered a cover-up.

391
00:40:02,777 --> 00:40:04,820
Because it couldn't be made public!

392
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:07,448
We ignored treaties and sold arms to
Third World countries during the war

393
00:40:07,656 --> 00:40:10,826
to relieve its financial burden on us.

394
00:40:11,035 --> 00:40:13,329
That's governmental weapons smuggling!

395
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:16,582
--Harimadara was at the center of it, and as their
security official, --Vice-Minister, what's the matter?

396
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:19,376
--Lt. Col. Mamuro found out about
the illegal trade. --Vice-Minister!

397
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:20,377
What is it?

398
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:21,962
--Do you realize how much
--He's in danger!

399
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:24,924
The missile business has helped
our country's finances?!

400
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:27,468
The lieutenant colonel learned of
your cover-up and investigated.

401
00:40:27,676 --> 00:40:31,514
The prostitute you frequented.
The Ranger who escorted you.

402
00:40:31,722 --> 00:40:35,518
When he got info from them,
he decided to blow the whistle on you.

403
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:39,146
So you ordered Captain Kanzaki to kill him.

404
00:40:39,355 --> 00:40:41,774
I just ordered him to solve the situation!

405
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:46,529
Yes, a few people suffered, but I
don't know who killed Mamuro.

406
00:40:46,737 --> 00:40:49,406
Hell, maybe he really was mugged.

407
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:51,283
You claim even you don't know?

408
00:40:51,492 --> 00:40:53,077
No, and I don't want to!

409
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:56,747
That arms dealing will be purged
during restructuring anyway,

410
00:40:56,956 --> 00:40:59,959
and we're deliberating next-generation
weapons to replace missiles.

411
00:41:00,167 --> 00:41:05,131
But this mess kills the job Harimadara
has lined up for when I leave office!

412
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:08,759
You're quite the chatterbox.
A desire to confess?

413
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:14,014
Maybe so. Either way, you'll never tell anyone!

414
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:22,398
Stop!

415
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:25,860
Someone help!

416
00:41:37,413 --> 00:41:39,415
Should've blown him away.

417
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:44,170
Wasn't being more than a killing
machine the whole point of getting out?

418
00:41:44,378 --> 00:41:47,673
In the end, I had no place to go.

419
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:51,760
They traced us through the
remote control. They're coming.

420
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:55,014
You go on. They're mine.

421
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:56,765
There are two of them.

422
00:41:56,974 --> 00:42:00,352
Fine with me. We'll see who's the better killer.

423
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,148
Take care.

424
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:06,483
You too.

425
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:13,115
I hate to say it, but they're not the
only ones to benefit from his death.

426
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:15,701
Yes. Thank you.

427
00:43:20,557 --> 00:43:23,227
You're the ones who killed
the lieutenant colonel!

428
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,681
I warned you that if you stepped
out of line, I'd take you out.

429
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:40,614
That's enough of that.

430
00:45:45,536 --> 00:45:49,248
You've reached your limit, Kusanagi.

431
00:45:56,088 --> 00:46:00,717
Raizo and lbachi were luring the
enemy here with the money as bait.

432
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:05,431
We've eliminated six spies.

433
00:46:05,639 --> 00:46:07,057
That's plenty.

434
00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:14,481
Kanzaki funneled money into Mamuro's
account, I moved it... and you used it.

435
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:16,108
That's right.

436
00:46:16,316 --> 00:46:21,029
The gun used on the prostitute was
the beginning of the enemy plot.

437
00:46:21,238 --> 00:46:27,661
Blowing up the Ranger, the phony bribery...
All the blame was placed on Mamuro.

438
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:36,003
And he intended to bring the
Vice-Minister down with him.

439
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:38,297
It was the worst possible choice.

440
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:45,053
Unit 501 would have gone on the Army
purge list in retaliation for the scandal.

441
00:46:45,262 --> 00:46:49,725
So you let him die. All of you.

442
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:14,541
If it weren't for the memory virus,
maybe we could have saved him.

443
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,836
But as things stood,
the only option was to secure

444
00:47:18,045 --> 00:47:23,258
Mamuro's cyberbrain, the mine,
and the money before he got blown up.

445
00:47:28,263 --> 00:47:35,312
But what neither we nor the
enemy accounted for was you.

446
00:47:35,521 --> 00:47:41,276
As soon as I arrived and got the data,
I went after the lieutenant colonel.

447
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:58,335
And you were infected by his cyberbrain.

448
00:48:09,263 --> 00:48:15,185
Even as you gathered the evidence,
you were continually losing memories.

449
00:48:15,185 --> 00:48:17,020
"The LTC is innocent"

450
00:48:19,523 --> 00:48:22,401
What organization developed the virus?

451
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:26,363
Unclear. All we know is that a
foreign broker brought it here

452
00:48:26,572 --> 00:48:30,284
and that people call it "Fire-Starter."

453
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:34,162
Was it a foreign power
that cooked up the scandal?

454
00:48:34,371 --> 00:48:37,708
Our enemy is the global
military-industrial complex itself.

455
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:40,752
What would dragging down
one vice-minister accomplish?

456
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:44,673
Did you take the disc he left me?

457
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:46,174
I did that to protect you.

458
00:48:46,383 --> 00:48:48,844
You used me as bait for the enemy!

459
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:50,846
I did that to protect the organization.

460
00:48:51,054 --> 00:48:53,390
Why did you stand back and watch him die?

461
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,018
I did that to protect myself.

462
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:10,866
You stick with me, Kusanagi.
I'll build a future for you.

463
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:22,252
The pain is gone now.

464
00:49:26,715 --> 00:49:28,884
Section <i>9</i> and the review committee

465
00:49:29,092 --> 00:49:32,638
have formally cleared
Lt. Col. Mamuro of suspicion.

466
00:49:32,846 --> 00:49:37,684
Thus, as his recommendation was renewed
by a third party, we will implement it.

467
00:49:37,893 --> 00:49:42,189
Due to your excellent record, we also grant
you the post-reorganization major rank.

468
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:45,901
In addition, in accordance with
the will of your late legal guardian,

469
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:48,403
you'll receive a testamentary trust.

470
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:52,366
It's an inheritance from
the person who raised you.

471
00:49:52,574 --> 00:49:55,327
A portion of it is earmarked for the
purchase of your prosthetic body.

472
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:58,205
Which means that your
body is now your property,

473
00:49:58,413 --> 00:50:00,499
and is outside Army jurisdiction.

474
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:05,462
You're quite sure about this?

475
00:50:05,671 --> 00:50:07,005
The virus may be an unknown,

476
00:50:07,214 --> 00:50:10,258
but we've identified the
architecture of the false memories.

477
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:11,927
Do it.

478
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:15,514
Very well. We'll attempt memory eradication.

479
00:51:03,395 --> 00:51:04,896
Will you go?

480
00:51:05,105 --> 00:51:06,231
Yes.

481
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,025
Make sure to pay your respects to your parents.

482
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:12,279
Thanks.

483
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:22,122
I'm going.

484
00:51:43,602 --> 00:51:45,604
We'll find a replacement.

485
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:55,113
Want a ride?

486
00:51:55,322 --> 00:51:58,325
Consider it my thanks for telling us
the location of Mamuro's cyberbrain.

487
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,118
I'll take the bus.

488
00:52:00,327 --> 00:52:02,120
Then I'll just give you the results.

489
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:06,708
Captain Kanzaki was replaced.
Mr. Sadamoto will be tried in closed court.

490
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:10,962
I promise to make the lieutenant
colonel's findings public one day.

491
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:17,761
I see. By the way--are you the one
he gave my recommendation to?

492
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:21,807
Hard to say. A man in my
position gets a lot of those.

493
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:23,683
In fact, one of them outlined plans

494
00:52:23,892 --> 00:52:28,396
to create a new special unit within
the international rescue team.

495
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:33,193
I'd like someone who's got
experience as a special consultant.

496
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:38,406
Intriguing, but I don't want to work under
a man who digs up people's graves.

497
00:52:38,615 --> 00:52:42,327
You dug up something even deeper.

498
00:52:42,536 --> 00:52:46,206
If you're serious about going independent,
you should have your own team.

499
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:54,464
The regulations say a unit needs a minimum
of one commander and six members.

500
00:52:54,673 --> 00:52:56,258
I'll keep that in mind.

501
00:52:58,385 --> 00:53:03,390
May it be a team not for defense of self
or state, but for taking the offensive.

502
00:53:04,391 --> 00:53:10,105
<i>(mem mem mem mem mem)</i>

503
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:16,570

00:53:58,612 --> 00:54:06,661

00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:36,775
<i>Why am I not there? Why am I not there?
Why am I not there? Why am I not there?</i>

514
00:54:36,983 --> 00:54:50,205
<i>Fragmented beautiful memories</i>

515
00:54:50,413 --> 00:55:00,799
<i>Look right (look left); where is this (place)?</i>

516
00:55:01,007 --> 00:55:07,555
<i>Buildings, streets, hustle and bustle</i>

517
00:55:07,764 --> 00:55:15,730
<i>I walk (and walk) through it all</i>

518
00:55:15,939 --> 00:55:23,571
<i>But I'm nowhere to be found</i>

519
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:32,580
<i>The world, the world, the world, the world</i>

520
00:55:32,789 --> 00:55:37,085
<i>The world, the world</i>

521
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:44,217
<i>The world, the world, the world...</i>

522
00:55:44,426 --> 00:55:50,265
<i>(Just) keeps on going</i>

523
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:56,354
<i>Sweeping (skies)</i>

524
00:55:56,563 --> 00:56:02,318
<i>Vibrant (greenery)</i>

525
00:56:02,527 --> 00:56:08,366
<i>Mountains and (seas and)</i>

526
00:56:08,575 --> 00:56:14,330
<i>The wind (from the past)</i>

527
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:20,211
<i>To the future (blows)</i>

528
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:26,259
<i>Leaving me (behind)</i>

529
00:56:26,468 --> 00:56:32,140
<i>Deserted here (all alone)</i>

530
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:35,143
<i>Whoosh</i>

531
00:56:40,273 --> 00:56:46,446
<i>(me me me me)</i>

532
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:52,118
<i>(me me why me why me)</i>

533
00:56:52,327 --> 00:56:56,623
<i>Why am I not there?
Why am I not there?</i>

534
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:05,632
<i>Why am I not there? Why am I not there?
Why am I not there? Why am I not there?</i>

535
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:10,136
<i>Why am I not there?
Why am I not there?</i>

536
00:57:10,345 --> 00:57:19,062
<i>Why am I not there? Why am I not there?
Why am I not there? Why am I not there?</i>

537
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:22,065
<i>Why am I not there?</i>

538
00:57:29,364 --> 00:57:31,533
Six people, huh?

539
00:57:31,741 --> 00:57:34,244
Hmm, whom shall I scout...?

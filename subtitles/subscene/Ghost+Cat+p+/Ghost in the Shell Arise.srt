1
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:46,710
I'm amazed we got permission to exhume the body.

2
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,750
It's backward. They disregarded
our investigation by burying him to begin with.

3
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,380
Yes, sir. Still, a military cemetery...

4
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,760
It's ridiculously expensive to dispose of
a prosthetic body that can't be reused.

5
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,220
Thanks to their cost-cutting,
we can recover the cyberbrain.

6
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,770
Where are the engineers?

7
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:08,190
Drawing straws at HQ.

8
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,070
Apparently connecting to a dead criminal's
cyberbrain is "creepy".

9
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,610
We don't know yet that he's a criminal.

10
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,240
Chief Aramaki!

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,780
We'll check the contents,
then take it back to headquarters.

12
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,370
What are you waiting for?
Put it down!

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,420
Sorry, sir!

14
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,960
Don't open that coffin!

15
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,740
This is from your unit.

16
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,960
Are you military?

17
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,380
I'm Aramaki, with Public Security Section 9.

18
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,260
We're investigating
Lieutenant Colonel Mamuro's murder.

19
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,800
I'm seizing his cyberbrain
and prosthetic body as evidence.

20
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,470
He's also suspected of taking bribes,
and we're investigating that too.

21
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,930
Public Security has no right to ransack this place.

22
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,310
We'll bury him again when the case is closed.

23
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,770
And how do I know you won't pull a cover-up,
or fabricate evidence?

24
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,070
The military is in the middle of
its first major shakeup since the war.

25
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:47,820
It would be more suspicious
if this only got an internal investigation.

26
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,410
lf he were still with us,
Mamuro would have been the first to say so.

27
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,080
You knew him?

28
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,660
Yes, back when I was an Army man.

29
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,590
There's not a soldier in the world
more squeaky-clean than he was.

30
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,470
Your name and unit?

31
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,180
Major Motoko Kusanagi, Unit 501 .

32
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,770
501 ? So you were his subordinate.

33
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,690
Open it up.

34
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,110
Can l ask your rank?

35
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,700
I was in the old Investigations Section.
That's all.

36
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:31,530
They sold off whatever wouldn't fit
in the coffin to a junk shop.

37
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,880
That's not his body!

38
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,240
Get down!

39
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,380
Finally back on base, you delinquent?

40
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,300
Why did you authorize Public Security's involvement?!

41
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:12,550
Since l can't dismiss the possibility
that Mamuro was corrupt, l had no choice.

42
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:15,600
Unit 501 should be investigating this!

43
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,730
The higher-ups told us to stay out of it.

44
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,310
Someone set a trap at his grave.

45
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,310
lgnore it.

46
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,980
His cyberbrain is gone!

47
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,070
This isn't the time to
stir up a hornet's nest.

48
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,320
Then you believe that
he was taking dirty money?

49
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,160
He got mugged downtown.
That much is fact.

50
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,750
Not an honorable death, but compared
to indictment, maybe he got lucky.

51
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,790
Thanks to him,
our letters of recommendation are on hold, too.

52
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,840
Concentrate on your work for now.

53
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,800
Work?

54
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,680
l distinctly remember asking you to
analyze that infected hardware.

55
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,600
Not possible.
l just got back to Japan today, you know.

56
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,270
True enough.

57
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,850
l'll do the assignment.

58
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,610
ln return, give me leave to go off-base
and authorize direct debit.

59
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,530
Such a problem child.

60
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,990
I'm only going to find out who set the trap.

61
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,660
νery well.
I'll take care of it in Mamuro's place.

62
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,540
Thanks, Kurutsu.

63
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't forget your meeting with the brass.

64
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,130
Giichi Mamuro, member of
a special unit of the GSDA,

65
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,090
was murdered on the fifth of this month.

66
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,640
- Niihama police say the investigation into
his possible corruption is ongoing.
- Lieutenant Colonel Mamuro is suspected of taking large bribes...

67
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,060
...while serving as a security official
in Harimadara's weapons export—

68
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,010
Access records of his movements
on the day of his death

69
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,510
and all data from city surveillance cameras.

70
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,500
He was tailed.

71
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,050
Scan anyone who traveled
the same route he did before time of death.

72
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,180
Three...

73
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,820
A fourth?

74
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:13,100
Three men and a mobile land mine
were following him?

75
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,280
"Funds transferred."

76
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,910
What is this?

77
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,540
Any pain?

78
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,700
Not right now, no.

79
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,120
It's similar to the phantom pain
particular to cyborgs,

80
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:38,750
but that should not affect you.

81
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,550
Could be a bad contact
in your nervous components.

82
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,590
Any other abnormalities?

83
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,560
No.

84
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,980
We should do a full-body checkup to be safe.

85
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,310
Thank you, but I have a meeting to go to.

86
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,150
Goodness, you have visitors.

87
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,490
They announced themselves
as Public Security Section 9.

88
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,950
Say l'm not here.

89
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:18,500
As both a Special Cyborg
and a recognized wizard-class programmer,

90
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,130
new regulations apply to you
under the revised Weapons Act.

91
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:27,180
The Prosthetics Maintenance Rule now applies
to issuing identification,

92
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,850
possessing cash, opening bank accounts,
or other ownership of assets.

93
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:34,520
ln Lt. Col. Mamuro's letter
on my reclassification,

94
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,980
he guaranteed my financial autonomy.

95
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,860
lf he's proven corrupt,
he'll receive a dishonorable discharge,

96
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,440
and all such documents will be void.

97
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,700
You expect me to endure a position

98
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,030
where l have to file paperwork
every time l open my wallet?

99
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,790
The cost of prosthetic bodies far exceeds
standard health insurance payouts.

100
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:58,330
You ought to do your duty to the government
which guarantees your right to life.

101
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,210
This is the consent form for your monitoring
and custody post-restructuring.

102
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,710
Make an effort to understand your circumstances.

103
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,730
During the war,
Japan allocated a sky-high budget

104
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,190
to promote cyborg development.

105
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,070
Did they tell you to become
Army property to foot the bill?

106
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,820
There were large deposits
made to Mamuro's accounts.

107
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:37,580
But after his murder,
someone withdrew all that money.

108
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,370
What do you want?

109
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,540
Major Kusanagi, of Unit 501 .
No criminal record.

110
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:48,220
You work with the Army and Public Security
as a special consultant.

111
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:51,550
You specialize in solving cybercrimes.

112
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,600
l request that you track down the missing money
and analyze the coffin records.

113
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,940
Since it's an official investigation,
you should get leave to go off-base.

114
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,110
What's the pay?

115
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,450
I'll give you the regular consulting fee,
as a civilian.

116
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,370
That'll be an issue, you know.

117
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:19,540
A soldier famous for his integrity being shot
to death in secret is a bigger issue.

118
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,220
- Hey!
- How dare you?!

119
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,100
Tomorrow morning,
l'll send you a liaison who'll double as a bodyguard.

120
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,560
Think she's in?

121
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,930
She's as in the dark as we are.

122
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,980
If she wants to be free,
she'll have to find out the truth.

123
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,650
Still don't want the 501 to investigate?

124
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,160
Make one wrong move,
and our unit could get dissolved.

125
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,330
Public Security offered me an assignment.

126
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,660
Will you accept?

127
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,120
Lend me a hand.

128
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,670
lf you can't get it done alone,
you'll be at the end of the line.

129
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,630
No one else will be able to protect you then.

130
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,170
Being protected isn't what I learned to do here!

131
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,300
l learned to make the most of my strengths!

132
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:18,010
I'll grant permission for you to use Server 6.

133
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,850
Thanks.

134
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,930
Just don't forget the job l gave you.

135
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,780
List the people working on the case.

136
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,320
But this is clearly related to the LTC's mugging!

137
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,200
We know he met up with the prostitute.
We need a warrant for her cust—

138
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,700
lt's military jurisdiction!
You keep out of it!

139
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:46,170
You just forget this case, you hear me?
That's an order!

140
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,800
Then what's a special investigator even for, dammit?!

141
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:58,140
"Mamuro was being followed."

142
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,680
What?!

143
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,250
- Hey!
- St-Stop right there!

144
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,100
There you are!

145
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:53,440
Well, if it isn't the little tomboy from the lab.

146
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,290
The one who infiltrated me... is in that car...!

147
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,880
You fool! That makes you a deserter!

148
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,050
Stop, Raizo!

149
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,090
All right, Kusanagi?

150
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:23,050
lnstructor lbachi...

151
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,730
Don't think you can do whatever you want
just because you were Mamuro's favorite!

152
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:31,230
Your selfish actions put the whole unit in danger!

153
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:35,230
That's enough!
l'll be the one to lecture her.

154
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,410
That bitch only survived as a test subject.

155
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:48,660
The number is a fake.
He's a slippery customer.

156
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,000
We've proven there was an infiltrator, at least.

157
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,840
What does Kurutsu say?

158
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,340
"lgnore it."

159
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,470
Is your prosthetic body acting up?

160
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,840
I don't know.

161
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,510
Goodness, another visitor.

162
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,970
You've got a strange one here to see you.

163
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,520
What is this?

164
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,610
lt uses signal lights?
How old is this thing?

165
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,870
Here, come with me.

166
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:41,130
Construct your learning base yourself.

167
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,180
Hello, nice to meet you!

168
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:55,400
l'm an autonomous-follower logistics system—
a "Logistics Conveyer Machine".

169
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,480
You're Section 9's "liaison
who'll double as a bodyguard"?

170
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,490
Chief Aramaki calls me a "Logicoma"!

171
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:07,080
You'll be receiving information through me,
Major Kusanagi.

172
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,750
No synching. Explain things orally or as data.

173
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:17,000
Um... Any Army case information on the group
identified as illicit arms dealers

174
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,420
would be very useful to Chief Aramaki
in tracking down a mobile land mine!

175
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,430
The Army? Arms dealers?

176
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,930
Yes, sir!

177
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,850
You disappear. l'll take it from here.

178
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,390
Order acknowledged!

179
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,690
Optical camouflage?

180
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,370
Stay here and guard my bike.

181
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,910
Right!

182
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,790
Come on, walk straight!
Look, we're almost there.

183
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,800
Hi there!

184
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,800
Come on in.

185
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,890
It's not even dinnertime,
and this guy's three sheets to the wind!

186
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:12,220
Get him something cold, okay?

187
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,640
Come on, get it together!
Sit straight!

188
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,620
l fold.

189
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,240
Gonna go hit the can.

190
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,950
Hey, no fair!

191
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,080
But you had a great hand!

192
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,670
There.

193
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,510
Warning! Warning!

194
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,970
Someone approaching, extremely close!

195
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,480
Don't move. Who sent you?!

196
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,040
Were you the ones who killed Lt. Col. Mamuro?

197
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,960
Huh? Are you Public Security?

198
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,630
Answer me!

199
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:29,680
First you check the Army database!
Code 24, Ops H2976...

200
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,890
...code name Paz!

201
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,640
You're undercover?!

202
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,060
Yeah, the group l'm in with was hired for a hit.

203
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,520
They said the target was a full cyborg

204
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,570
and his cyberbrain had to be destroyed,
so we'd use mobile land mines.

205
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:47,690
Three of 'em—and I'm talking military-grade.

206
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,070
Lt. Col. Mamuro's murder?

207
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,370
Who knows?
Apparently somebody beat our guys to it,

208
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,580
and we let the mines get away.

209
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,710
Where did the mines come from?

210
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,920
Maneuver Area 6.

211
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,590
That place is a joke.
Might as well set foxes to guard a henhouse.

212
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,840
Feel like proving it with me?

213
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,930
This ain't the best job,
but I can't just drop it.

214
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:19,100
l'd be in danger,
and l'd cause trouble for my CO.

215
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,270
ls your CO trustworthy?

216
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:24,270
Used to be.

217
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,940
l see.

218
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,360
Thanks for your cooperation.

219
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,450
l wish l had your freedom of movement.

220
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,960
You can't analyze it?

221
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,710
lt might just be noise.

222
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:14,910
No full-body cyborg gets to leave
this organization and go independent.

223
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,330
You're just a girl with
a little talent for cyber warfare.

224
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,830
Mamuro's death was an inevitability.

225
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:25,290
Don't step out of line, or I'll take you out.

226
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,300
Kurutsu and lbachi can't shield you from me.

227
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,010
An inevitability...

228
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,480
Their security's a joke, all right.

229
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,580
All that's left is to connect the dots...

230
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,910
Look, l've got authorization!
And all l'm gonna do is ask questions!

231
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,540
Take your complaints to the station.

232
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:54,760
Where does he get off?
It ain't like I've never been deployed, dammit...

233
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,510
This is bullshit!
They're not even he—

234
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:10,020
Ah, sorry. I'm a special investigator
with the Niihama police.

235
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,020
l was told l could find these two here.

236
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,230
I have some questions for First Lieutenant Moto Seta

237
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,700
and Captain Amuri Noto here—

238
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,700
Thanks. You just connected some dots.

239
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:27,620
And l see some others just connected.
How about showing yourself?

240
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,960
Batou the Ranger?

241
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:42,220
Long time no see.
Gotta say l didn't figure you for this one.

242
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,810
What do you mean?

243
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:48,640
The man you killed seven days ago
was a comrade of mine!

244
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,440
I just got back to Japan three days ago.

245
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,230
Oh, really?!

246
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:19,340
I've told you your sleepless eye's weakness
is how easy it is to infiltrate.

247
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,010
Still afraid of taking friendly
fire out in the jungle?

248
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,600
l'm an electronic warfare specialist too!

249
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,810
I can't believe you infiltrated me
in the middle of a fight!

250
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:32,100
You're just about the only one who'd infiltrate me.

251
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,150
So, why are you after me?

252
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,480
Don't play dumb!

253
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,780
You're the one who got this place's
mobile land mines!

254
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,870
What the hell?!

255
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,040
Wait!

256
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,880
Don't shoot! Run!

257
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,140
Don't!

258
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,500
Those guys aren't with you?!

259
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,340
Seriously, what are you talking about?

260
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,920
Hey, look!

261
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,760
They found us!

262
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,430
They want to eliminate us here.

263
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,600
And their excuse will be
a "training exercise accident"?

264
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,270
I can't stop 'em with this puny gun!

265
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,190
We'll just have to run!

266
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,860
Now we climb!

267
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:07,950
Climb this?!

268
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:10,080
Damn straight!

269
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,620
We'll hold them off, so get moving!

270
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,710
- Okay, fine.
- Hello!

271
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,250
What's that?!

272
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,880
We're surrounded.

273
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,050
I told you, move it!

274
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,970
I know, I know!

275
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:36,810
Get in!

276
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,500
l thought you "couldn't drop it"?

277
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,000
This makes a nice change of pace.

278
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:23,110
You asked the military police for help?

279
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:26,280
To escort a suspect.

280
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,820
What's this about?

281
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,540
This makes no sense.

282
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:42,130
Firstly: the missing money went to
your account, Major Kusanagi.

283
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:46,380
Secondly: the bullet you fired
on the mobile land mine at the graveyard

284
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,630
matched the one that killed Lt. Col. Mamuro.

285
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,890
Seven days ago,
a prostitute here in town was shot to death.

286
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:56,720
The bullet matched the one
that killed Mamuro.

287
00:30:56,810 --> 00:31:00,060
Mamuro had met with her,
and according to the other working girls,

288
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,360
he was asking questions about one of her clients.

289
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:06,860
Seven days ago, one of my fellow Rangers

290
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,530
was killed by a mobile land mine,
along with his family.

291
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:15,910
He'd been in contact with Mamuro, too.

292
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:21,080
And when l traced the land mine to its source,
it led me to the major here.

293
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,340
By the way, she says
she got back to Japan three days ago,

294
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,000
but Immigration records say it was seven days ago.

295
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:29,920
The three mines my group was supposed to use

296
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:33,180
were the same model as the one Section 9
dug up at the graveyard.

297
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,260
Assuming one of those three was buried
and another killed the Ranger,

298
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,600
there's one more left unaccounted for.

299
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,730
At the moment,
all the clues point to you murdering Mamuro

300
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,110
and stealing his money.

301
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:53,360
Right after l landed,
l got a message and an attaché case from him.

302
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:58,450
I'm sorry, Major Kusanagi.
I doubt I'll be in this world much longer.

303
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,080
I wanted to get justice.

304
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:07,090
l've left your recommendation in someone else's care.

305
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:12,130
You're the most promising squad member l know.
l wish you luck.

306
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:17,470
In the case, I found data
on an internal weapons exportation racket...

307
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,770
...and this gun.

308
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:24,310
You've moved a lot of money in the past few days.

309
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,980
Who are you sending it to?

310
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,650
The widow of the man who raised me.

311
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:35,990
She's taken care of me since l was little,
but she's in a nursing home now.

312
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,080
What's her name?

313
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,330
What is this woman's name?

314
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,470
Phantom pain, huh?

315
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:02,100
Even after you mechanize your body,
your brain never forgets the original.

316
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,850
Pain in the ass.

317
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,190
I don't have an "original" body.

318
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,610
What?

319
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:11,480
Have you heard of Doctor Bakeru's
emergency medicine system?

320
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,940
That thing where someone
with a full prosthetic body

321
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:16,860
uses their life-support system
on somebody else?

322
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:23,370
The person who raised me used it on me
while I was in my mother's womb.

323
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:34,220
Supposedly a chemical weapon killed
a large number of civilians way back when.

324
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,050
A pregnant woman and the man assumed
to be her husband both died.

325
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,050
We don't even know their names.

326
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,720
Because someone with that particular lifesaver
happened to be on the scene,

327
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,390
the fetus's brain alone survived.

328
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,400
You're saying you were made a full cyborg at birth?!

329
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,400
I lack any memory of a body.

330
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,240
So perhaps you could call this "ghost pain",
created by false memories.

331
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:08,000
This is surveillance footage from Maneuver Area 6.

332
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,710
Your subordinate is in it.

333
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,050
If you refuse to hand her over,

334
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:16,590
I'll present you with a summons signed by
the Defense Minister himself.

335
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,430
I'll submit a written report at a later date.
I can't hand her over.

336
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,100
Vixen.

337
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,930
l'll make you regret this.

338
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:36,740
That's Shujiro Kanzaki.
He's in charge of Maneuver Area 6,

339
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,610
and he leads a team of special agents.

340
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,910
He's also the Army's dirty go-between with
the Ministry of Defense.

341
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:46,290
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

342
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,960
What's wrong?

343
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,710
It's nothing.

344
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:12,650
lt's been empty from the beginning?
Then where's the gun?!

345
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:16,110
Why did I think there were
whistle-blowing documents in it?!

346
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,650
And the lieutenant colonel...?

347
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,840
What's real?

348
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,800
What's the truth?

349
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,520
Where's the lieutenant colonel's cyberbrain?

350
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,190
Wait, Kusanagi.

351
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,650
Calm down.

352
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:02,530
The hardware Kurutsu had me analyze
matched his Net synch pattern.

353
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,950
He and I were infected
with the same virus, weren't we?

354
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,540
With something hypothesized
to be a cyber-virus.

355
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,040
We speculate that it's
a self-destructing Stuxnet-type

356
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,000
which causes unknown dysfunction.

357
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,130
"Unknown dysfunction"...
You mean false memories.

358
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,800
It was purely a hypothesis.

359
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,880
At least, until we checked into your behavior.

360
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,970
I just got back to Japan today, you know.

361
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,180
True enough.

362
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,810
When did I come back to Japan?

363
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:34,060
Approximately 1 80 hours ago.
In other words, seven days.

364
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:39,570
And yet you continue to claim it was
another day altogether.

365
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:40,900
Route of transmission?

366
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,360
lt must have been contact with Mamuro's cyberbrain.

367
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:46,240
Which is still with his prosthetic body.

368
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,080
His coffin was a trap.

369
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,040
And the records Public Security got of his
burial show no signs of tampering.

370
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,920
So that's how it is...

371
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,840
Logicoma, synch with me.

372
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,340
Are you sure?

373
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:08,680
Just get on with it.
Record my field of vision and play it back in real time.

374
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,890
Roger!

375
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,350
I see things that shouldn't be there.

376
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,110
I don't see things that should be there.

377
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,470
Here, the whole time...?

378
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,430
"Special agent" "The LTC is innocent"

379
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,620
This is a warrant for Major Kusanagi's arrest.

380
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,170
Surrender her immediately.

381
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,550
"Special agent" "The LTC is innocent"

382
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,490
The records weren't tampered with.

383
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:52,830
They just buried the truth under a lie.

384
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:28,570
l've found it...

385
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,410
My reality.

386
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,830
Drive.

387
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:56,600
The lieutenant colonel
came to you to blow the whistle.

388
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:00,270
Didn't he, Mr. Sadamoto, νice-Minister of Defense?

389
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,390
Yes.

390
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,600
But you ordered a cover-up.

391
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,900
Because it couldn't be made public!

392
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,530
We ignored treaties and sold arms to
Third World countries during the war

393
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:11,900
to relieve its financial burden on us.

394
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:14,410
That's governmental weapons smuggling!

395
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,620
- Harimadara was at the center of it,
and as their security official,
- νice-Minister, what's the matter?

396
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,450
- Lt. Col. Mamuro found out about the illegal trade.
- νice-Minister!

397
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,460
What is it?

398
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,040
- Do you realize how much
- He's in danger!

399
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,960
the missile business has helped
our country's finances?!

400
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,550
The lieutenant colonel learned of
your cover-up and investigated.

401
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:32,590
The prostitute you frequented.
The Ranger who escorted you.

402
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,600
When he got info from them,
he decided to blow the whistle on you.

403
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,220
So you ordered Captain Kanzaki to kill him.

404
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,810
l just ordered him to solve the situation!

405
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:47,610
Yes, a few people suffered,
but I don't know who killed Mamuro.

406
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:50,480
Hell, maybe he really was mugged.

407
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,320
You claim even you don't know?

408
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,150
No, and I don't want to!

409
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,820
That arms dealing will be purged
during restructuring anyway,

410
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,990
and we're deliberating next-generation weapons
to replace missiles.

411
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:06,170
But this mess kills the job Harimadara has
lined up for when I leave office!

412
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,840
You're quite the chatterbox.
A desire to confess?

413
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:14,930
Maybe so. Either way, you'll never tell anyone!

414
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:23,310
Stop!

415
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,770
Someone help!

416
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,490
Should've blown him away.

417
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:45,210
Wasn't being more than a killing machine
the whole point of getting out?

418
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,710
ln the end, l had no place to go.

419
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:52,840
They traced us through the remote control.
They're coming.

420
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,050
You go on. They're mine.

421
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,840
There are two of them.

422
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,220
Fine with me.
We'll see who's the better killer.

423
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,230
Take care.

424
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,560
You too.

425
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:14,190
I hate to say it, but they're not
the only ones to benefit from his death.

426
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,570
Yes. Thank you.

427
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:24,140
You're the ones who killed the lieutenant colonel!

428
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:01,590
I warned you that if you stepped out of line,
I'd take you out.

429
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,520
That's enough of that.

430
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:50,120
You've reached your limit, Kusanagi.

431
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,630
Raizo and Ibachi were luring the enemy here
with the money as bait.

432
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,470
We've eliminated six spies.

433
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,130
That's plenty.

434
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:15,560
Kanzaki funneled money into Mamuro's account,
l moved it... and you used it.

435
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,140
That's right.

436
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:22,110
The gun used on the prostitute was
the beginning of the enemy plot.

437
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:28,570
Blowing up the Ranger, the phony bribery...
All the blame was placed on Mamuro.

438
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:37,080
And he intended to bring
the νice-Minister down with him.

439
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,330
It was the worst possible choice.

440
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:46,130
Unit 501 would have gone on the Army purge list
in retaliation for the scandal.

441
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:50,640
So you let him die. All of you.

442
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:15,620
lf it weren't for the memory virus,
maybe we could have saved him.

443
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:18,870
But as things stood, the only option was to secure

444
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:24,170
Mamuro's cyberbrain, the mine,
and the money before he got blown up.

445
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:36,390
But what neither we
nor the enemy accounted for was you.

446
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:42,190
As soon as I arrived and got the data,
I went after the lieutenant colonel.

447
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,250
And you were infected by his cyberbrain.

448
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:16,050
Even as you gathered the evidence,
you were continually losing memories.

449
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,060
"The LTC is innocent"

450
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,440
What organization developed the virus?

451
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,440
Unclear. All we know is that
a foreign broker brought it here

452
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:31,360
and that people call it "Fire-Starter".

453
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,240
Was it a foreign power
that cooked up the scandal?

454
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,790
Our enemy is the global
military-industrial complex itself.

455
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,790
What would dragging down
one vice-minister accomplish?

456
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:45,750
Did you take the disc he left me?

457
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:47,250
l did that to protect you.

458
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,920
You used me as bait for the enemy!

459
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,920
l did that to protect the organization.

460
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,470
Why did you stand back and watch him die?

461
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:56,930
l did that to protect myself.

462
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:11,780
You stick with me, Kusanagi.
I'll build a future for you.

463
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,160
The pain is gone now.

464
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,960
Section 9 and the review committee

465
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,670
have formally cleared Lt. Col. Mamuro of suspicion.

466
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:38,760
Thus, as his recommendation was renewed
by a third party, we will implement it.

467
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,270
Due to your excellent record, we also grant you
the post-reorganization major rank.

468
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:46,980
In addition, in accordance with the will
of your late legal guardian,

469
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:49,310
you'll receive a testamentary trust.

470
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,440
It's an inheritance from the person who raised you.

471
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,360
A portion of it is earmarked for
the purchase of your prosthetic body.

472
00:49:56,450 --> 00:49:59,280
Which means that your body is now your property,

473
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,370
and is outside Army jurisdiction.

474
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,540
You're quite sure about this?

475
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,040
The virus may be an unknown,

476
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:11,340
but we've identified the architecture
of the false memories.

477
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,000
Do it.

478
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:16,380
νery well. We'll attempt memory eradication.

479
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,930
Will you go?

480
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:07,270
Yes.

481
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:09,940
Make sure to pay your respects to your parents.

482
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:13,190
Thanks.

483
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:23,030
I'm going.

484
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,470
We'll find a replacement.

485
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:56,150
Want a ride?

486
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:59,400
Consider it my thanks for telling us
the location of Mamuro's cyberbrain.

487
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:01,150
I'll take the bus.

488
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:03,160
Then l'll just give you the results.

489
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,790
Captain Kanzaki was replaced.
Mr. Sadamoto will be tried in closed court.

490
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:12,000
I promise to make the lieutenant colonel's
findings public one day.

491
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:18,840
l see. By the way—are you the one
he gave my recommendation to?

492
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,840
Hard to say.
A man in my position gets a lot of those.

493
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:24,760
ln fact, one of them outlined plans

494
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,470
to create a new special unit within
the international rescue team.

495
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:34,270
l'd like someone who's got experience
as a special consultant.

496
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:39,480
lntriguing, but l don't want to work
under a man who digs up people's graves.

497
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:43,360
You dug up something even deeper.

498
00:52:43,450 --> 00:52:47,280
If you're serious about going independent,
you should have your own team.

499
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:55,540
The regulations say a unit needs
a minimum of one commander and six members.

500
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,170
l'll keep that in mind.

501
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:04,130
May it be a team not for defense of self or state,
but for taking the offensive.

502
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,610
Six people, huh?

503
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:35,150
Hmm, whom shall l scout...?

00:00:23,794 --> 00:00:25,690
I'm the co-pilot. The co-pilot.

3
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,451
- Hey, Tae Ho!
- Yeah, I'm over here!

4
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:31,628
- Hey, Choi Tae Ho!
- Do you want to live?

5
00:00:31,628 --> 00:00:33,652
If you want to live, listen to me.

6
00:00:33,652 --> 00:00:38,087
I don't know about those people,
but I can save you, okay?

7
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:40,694
I can help you get out of here!

8
00:00:41,414 --> 00:00:43,945
What the hell are you saying?

9
00:00:44,819 --> 00:00:47,759
<i>There's a lifeboat on a beach nearby.</i>

10
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:50,878
- A lifeboat?
- But...

11
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,423
The boat can only hold four people.
That's why I was watching you guys.

12
00:00:56,191 --> 00:00:58,838
I was looking for people
to escape this island with.

13
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:04,760
<i>Two people.</i>

14
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,378
<i>You're saying we just need
two more people, right?</i>

15
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:10,093
Isn't that Tae Ho?

16
00:01:10,093 --> 00:01:13,540
- Hey, seriously!
- What the heck?

17
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,670
- Where were you?
- Wow, seriously.

18
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,515
You should have said something
before leaving!

19
00:01:17,515 --> 00:01:19,045
Let's go together next time, okay?

20
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:22,409
You're a top star!
Take care of yourself...

21
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,787
Let's go together next time.
It's dangerous, okay?

22
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,522
<i>[Episode 5]</i>

23
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:38,534
Who do you have in mind?

24
00:01:43,094 --> 00:01:46,737
People who can be of help to us,
of course.

25
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:53,094
So Hee, here's your snack. Enjoy.

26
00:01:56,388 --> 00:02:02,134
<i>We have to exclude people who think
we all need to survive together.</i>

27
00:02:05,332 --> 00:02:09,050
- Joon Oh! Have some chocolate!
<i>- No weak-hearted people...</i>

28
00:02:10,534 --> 00:02:12,762
<i>And we must exclude people
we can't understand...</i>

29
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:18,318
- Tae Ho.
- Oh. Thanks.

30
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:19,836
Sure.

31
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:24,365
How are you feeling?

32
00:02:24,365 --> 00:02:28,206
Geez, you're still pale.

33
00:02:28,206 --> 00:02:30,973
It's okay.
It's something I have to live with.

34
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:34,609
I have Ki Joon. I have my boyfriend too.

35
00:02:36,486 --> 00:02:37,905
Eat.

36
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:51,568
<i>No physically weak people...</i>

37
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:55,086
Okay.

38
00:02:55,086 --> 00:02:58,383
Here I go... Damn it!

39
00:02:58,383 --> 00:03:00,371
- You stepped on it three times.
- The chocolate?

40
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:04,175
- The chocolate touched it. So--
- Hey, no!

41
00:03:04,175 --> 00:03:05,783
Joon Oh.

42
00:03:06,723 --> 00:03:08,573
- You stepped on it!
- Hey, Joon Oh!

43
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:12,551
We can step on that part! If you pass
half of it, the lines don't matter!

44
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:14,415
You have 10 seconds to go or stay.

45
00:03:14,415 --> 00:03:16,859
- If I take one off...
<i>- No one who is full of themselves...</i>

46
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:20,669
No, in hopscotch, you have to speak
correctly, and stay off the lines.

47
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:24,092
<i>- No one who thinks they're all that...</i>
- Did you speak correctly or not?

48
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:29,962
Someone who is appropriately dirty,
and appropriately selfish.

49
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:36,193
Someone who cares about their own safety
more than anyone else.

50
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:45,919
CEO Hwang.

51
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,354
Can we talk for a moment?

52
00:03:50,003 --> 00:03:51,361
Right now?

53
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,748
Don't you think someone like that
will be helpful to us?

54
00:04:02,538 --> 00:04:04,485
Really?

55
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:07,649
Yes. I'm certain.

56
00:04:07,649 --> 00:04:10,396
So the man that you followed...

57
00:04:10,396 --> 00:04:12,419
was our co-pilot.

58
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,884
And he has a lifeboat,
but it's only for four people?

59
00:04:14,884 --> 00:04:16,427
- Yes.
- Really?

60
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:18,942
How many times do I have to tell you?

61
00:04:19,517 --> 00:04:22,418
You, me, and the co-pilot...

62
00:04:22,418 --> 00:04:24,230
Who's the fourth person?

63
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:30,285
Well, for now...
I'm thinking about Secretary Tae...

64
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:32,386
But if you can decide for us--

65
00:04:32,386 --> 00:04:33,937
I want to go too.

66
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:40,694
So Hee, what brings you here?

67
00:04:40,694 --> 00:04:43,004
I'm not somewhere I'm not supposed to be.

68
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:46,065
I want to go too.

69
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,586
So Hee, I know how you feel...

70
00:04:52,468 --> 00:04:54,557
But it's not that easy.

71
00:04:54,557 --> 00:04:57,747
There's no guarantee that we'll live
if we get in the lifeboat...

72
00:04:57,747 --> 00:05:01,593
And if one of us gets tired and
stops rowing, we could all die out there.

73
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,990
- So Hee, that's why--
- You want me to wait here?

74
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:08,478
And you'll get help if you get out?

75
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:11,351
- Yeah.
- Do you even know where we are?

76
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:14,091
You don't know. So how are you
going to get help?

77
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:17,968
- If we look, it's all possible--
- How can I trust you?

78
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,970
I saw what you did.

79
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:27,708
What did you see?

80
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,776
Do you want me to say it right now?

81
00:05:34,196 --> 00:05:36,095
So Hee, what is it that you saw?

82
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:44,694
Okay, let's go, So Hee.

83
00:05:52,329 --> 00:05:54,654
What did So Hee see?

84
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:58,509
Did you... record some kind of footage?

85
00:05:59,343 --> 00:06:00,906
No.

86
00:06:01,668 --> 00:06:04,382
Don't worry about it, CEO Hwang.

87
00:06:04,382 --> 00:06:09,052
Anyway, we're going to leave
tomorrow, so please get ready.

88
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:10,540
Tae Ho.

89
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:16,584
Do you feel guilty?

90
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,473
Of course. We're leaving the kids here.

91
00:06:18,473 --> 00:06:20,666
We'll send a rescue team for them.

92
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,627
You want to look for that person?

93
00:06:31,627 --> 00:06:35,476
Yeah. I was unable
to catch him yesterday.

94
00:06:36,184 --> 00:06:37,709
Why?

95
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,523
Why do you have to talk like that?

96
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:48,995
If there's another survivor,
we should find them.

97
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:52,949
That's not like you.

98
00:06:54,528 --> 00:06:56,809
Is something going on?

99
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,552
Do we need a reason to save someone?

100
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:15,261
Okay, let's do it.

101
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:19,404
Let's start tomorrow at sunrise.

102
00:07:20,244 --> 00:07:22,725
I stared at the fire for too long...

103
00:07:30,142 --> 00:07:33,869
Rest well. You worked hard.

104
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:50,160
Everyone's here.

105
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,904
We have nine people,
so let's move in groups of three.

106
00:07:54,904 --> 00:07:56,999
I'll...

107
00:07:56,999 --> 00:08:00,901
go with CEO Hwang and So Hee.
Are you both okay with that?

108
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:02,490
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

109
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,867
- You're okay with it, right?
- Sure, whatever you're comfortable with.

110
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:09,761
I'll go with Ra Bong Hee...
and Yeol.

111
00:08:09,761 --> 00:08:12,427
Ki Joon, Secretary Tae, and Ji Ah.
Ki Joon, is that okay?

112
00:08:12,427 --> 00:08:15,720
Yeah, I'm okay with it, but...
Will you be okay?

113
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,357
Why would it be a problem if my boyfriend
is going with other people too? Let's go.

114
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:21,247
We'll be back soon.

115
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,339
See you when we get back. Don't get hurt.

116
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:24,552
Okay, you too.

117
00:08:24,552 --> 00:08:27,791
Don't forget to be back
before sunset. Let's go.

118
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,853
- Okay.
- This way.

119
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,645
- Hey, aren't you going?
- Yeah, we're going.

120
00:08:34,645 --> 00:08:37,876
- Let's go CEO Hwang.
- Secretary Tae!

121
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:41,388
Take care of yourself. Stay healthy.

122
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,274
Okay, CEO Hwang.

123
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:47,519
- You look healthy enough to me.
- Stay healthy!

124
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,985
Let's go.

125
00:09:02,255 --> 00:09:04,051
Is something the matter?

126
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,784
No, it's not that...

127
00:09:07,784 --> 00:09:09,535
Then what's wrong?

128
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:13,467
I'm bothered by
what So Hee said yesterday.

129
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:15,568
Why? What did she say?

130
00:09:17,075 --> 00:09:19,802
She told me to rest,
and that I worked hard.

131
00:09:19,802 --> 00:09:23,147
Rest well. You worked hard.

132
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:28,130
But it felt like...
I wasn't going to see her again.

133
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:36,236
So Hee.

134
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:39,198
What did you see?

135
00:09:39,784 --> 00:09:43,005
Do I have to say it?
We both know what I saw.

136
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:48,988
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

137
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,604
If we get out of here, that is.

138
00:09:53,923 --> 00:09:56,318
<i>My younger sister died.</i>

139
00:09:57,202 --> 00:10:02,828
<i>To be more exact, she was murdered.</i>

140
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:05,067
<i>When it came to my feelings...</i>

141
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:10,350
<i>I was sad at first,
but I calmed down over time.</i>

142
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:16,562
I feel calm inside.

143
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:18,129
Am I weird?

144
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:22,568
No, not at all. That is understandable.

145
00:10:22,568 --> 00:10:27,854
The same goes for physical wounds.
They heal slowly, over time.

146
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:30,087
No, I think you misunderstood me.

147
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:35,508
My wounds are not healed, they're getting
deeper. I think about it more and more.

148
00:10:35,508 --> 00:10:39,458
The reason why I'm calm...

149
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:45,471
<i>Is because I'm thinking about
what I should do when I meet her killer.</i>

150
00:10:45,471 --> 00:10:48,691
<i>I'm wondering if I should
kill that person...</i>

151
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:52,202
<i>Or if I should put that person
through more pain...</i>

152
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:55,691
<i>I wonder if I should use a knife
to get my revenge...</i>

153
00:10:55,691 --> 00:10:59,418
<i>Or if I should use handcuffs
for a public trial.</i>

154
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:01,171
Let's go that way.

155
00:11:02,596 --> 00:11:04,927
These are my thoughts.

156
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:09,799
Let me ask you again, Doctor.

157
00:11:11,284 --> 00:11:13,645
Am I weird?

158
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:19,950
My younger sister's name was Yoon So Hee.

159
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:25,096
I'm Prosecutor Yoon Tae Young of the
western district prosecutor's office.

160
00:11:25,996 --> 00:11:29,654
I've found the right place
for a consultation, right?

161
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:35,506
Regarding what's going on between
Chairwoman Jo, you, and Ra Bong Hee

162
00:11:35,506 --> 00:11:40,458
and what you're hiding, I don't know
very much. That's why I came to find out.

163
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:46,677
Well, um... I don't know how I can help--

164
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:49,975
It seems like you've misunderstood.
I don't need your help.

165
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:55,721
All you have to do is go for lunch.
That's all you need to do.

166
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,317
You won't refuse, will you?
It's a prosecutor's request.

167
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:04,433
Well, um...

168
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:08,505
I'm trying to help you out right now.

169
00:12:08,505 --> 00:12:11,774
The Republic of Korea
is a constitutional nation.

170
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:15,477
The attacker should be punished,
and the victim should be protected.

171
00:12:15,477 --> 00:12:18,361
Concealing the truth is a crime.

172
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:22,755
But going for lunch isn't a crime, is it?

173
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:31,174
Which way
would you like to go, Doctor Kim?

174
00:12:31,174 --> 00:12:34,559
Would you like to become
the attacker or the victim?

175
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:36,758
What will you choose?

176
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:02,280
<i>[Treatment Records]</i>

177
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,966
<i>[Ra Bong Hee]</i>

178
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,008
<i>A necklace.</i>

179
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:19,238
<i>Do you remember who owns...</i>

180
00:13:19,238 --> 00:13:21,597
<i>that necklace?</i>

181
00:13:25,003 --> 00:13:27,298
- Tae Ho!
- Yes?

182
00:13:30,832 --> 00:13:32,804
I don't want to go.

183
00:13:32,804 --> 00:13:36,743
You guys can go.
I want to stay with my kids.

184
00:13:36,743 --> 00:13:39,520
- CEO Hwang.
- Go before I change my mind.

185
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:43,160
- CEO Hwang!
- Tae Ho.

186
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:47,629
If he tells the others, it'll get
complicated. We should go.

187
00:13:49,852 --> 00:13:51,269
Is it okay if we have three people?

188
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:54,544
Let's hurry up and go
before they show up.

189
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,590
What? What is it?

190
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:17,668
Oh, I was wondering if this is So Hee's.

191
00:14:17,668 --> 00:14:19,678
- Is it So Hee's necklace?
- Yes.

192
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:21,729
She said she lost it
in the woods not too long ago.

193
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:24,298
That's good. When we return later today--

194
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:27,609
- No, I should give it to her now.
- Right now?

195
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:32,256
I'm still bothered by what she said
yesterday, and she's having a hard time.

196
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:36,038
This will give her strength.
She won't think so negatively either.

197
00:14:36,038 --> 00:14:37,614
Let's go.

198
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:00,889
Geez, seriously.

199
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:07,019
Hurry up! Hurry up!

200
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:17,722
- Hurry up!
- One, two, three! Lift!

201
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:30,067
CEO Hwang!

202
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:36,761
What are you doing here, CEO Hwang?

203
00:15:37,538 --> 00:15:41,727
I've... sinned. I've done you wrong.

204
00:15:42,328 --> 00:15:43,880
I'm sorry!

205
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:55,799
Geez, if you go into the ocean now,
you'll die!

206
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:57,832
- I didn't know, Punk!
- Wow, really...

207
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,605
So... So where did they go?

208
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,916
That way! Over there!

209
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,816
Joon Oh!

210
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:08,787
- Ki Joon, Tae Ho caused trouble!
- What?

211
00:16:08,787 --> 00:16:10,205
Let's go.

212
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:15,239
Hey, don't get too pissed when you see
Tae Ho! You're still a patient!

213
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:17,065
Choi Tae Ho's dead.

214
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,596
- No!
- Hey!

215
00:16:21,596 --> 00:16:23,698
- Tae Ho!
- Tae Ho!

216
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:25,164
No!

217
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:33,541
What are you doing? Row! Like that.

218
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:36,597
No! Hey, you bastard! Choi Tae Ho!

219
00:16:36,597 --> 00:16:39,860
- Tae Ho!, no! Get out! Hurry!
- No!

220
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,486
Get out! If you're
going to be like that, get out!

221
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:46,269
You can't go right now!

222
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:49,376
- Keep paddling!
- No! Stop!

223
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:52,539
Me too... Take me with you!

224
00:16:55,293 --> 00:16:57,361
Secretary Tae!

225
00:16:59,331 --> 00:17:01,217
Row already!

226
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:05,221
Hey! Hey, don't move!

227
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:10,306
- Secretary Tae!
- Let go! Let go!

228
00:17:11,982 --> 00:17:15,810
- Hey, stop it!
- Let go! What are you doing?

229
00:17:16,372 --> 00:17:19,152
What are you doing instead of rowing?

230
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:21,862
- I told you to stay still!
- Hey, seriously!

231
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:24,778
Geez, damn it!

232
00:17:30,405 --> 00:17:32,240
- The boat!
- Damn it!

233
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:36,577
- Stay here...
- Choi Tae Ho!

234
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:39,575
- Joon Oh!
- No!

235
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:42,968
- Joon Oh!
- Joon Oh!

236
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,362
Take me with you!

237
00:17:53,228 --> 00:17:57,315
- Ho Hang!
- Wait! Take me with you!

238
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,150
Come to your senses, you punk!

239
00:18:03,613 --> 00:18:06,685
Geez, what do we do about our kids?

240
00:18:11,582 --> 00:18:14,777
Hey, Tae Ho! Choi Tae Ho!

241
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:25,994
Wait! Hey!

242
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:27,877
Wait, no!

243
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:43,980
- Help...
- So Hee!

244
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:52,644
Tae Ho!

245
00:18:56,859 --> 00:18:58,865
What the hell?

246
00:19:00,134 --> 00:19:03,314
Who the hell are you,
and why did you faint?

247
00:19:03,314 --> 00:19:04,938
Damn it!

248
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:15,615
Seo Joon Oh!

249
00:19:26,273 --> 00:19:29,423
<i>I...</i>

250
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:34,167
<i>I killed her...</i>

251
00:19:35,727 --> 00:19:38,929
<i>I killed Yoon So Hee.</i>

252
00:20:06,256 --> 00:20:08,016
Seo Joon Oh!

253
00:21:32,737 --> 00:21:36,075
<i>[Prosecutor Yoon Tae Young]</i>

254
00:22:08,357 --> 00:22:10,276
Yes, Prosecutor Yoon.

255
00:22:11,915 --> 00:22:16,949
I'm sorry. I had my reasons...

256
00:22:23,096 --> 00:22:25,865
Did you... kill her?

257
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,295
My younger sister...

258
00:22:37,761 --> 00:22:39,471
Yoon So Hee.

259
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:43,019
Did you kill her?

<i>If you did...</i>

261
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:53,997

If you really killed my sister...

263
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:02,205

00:24:06,309 --> 00:24:07,976
Over here!

Please... Please look over here...

We're over here!

00:24:46,804 --> 00:24:50,131
Please... Over here!

00:24:53,378 --> 00:24:57,060

279
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,951
Joon Oh's not there.

280
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,942
Joon Oh's not there. They're both female.

281
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:12,022
I don't think Joon Oh got out.

282
00:25:12,022 --> 00:25:14,730
Hey, what the heck are you saying?

283
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,522
Let's save So Hee and Bong Hee
and then look for Joon Oh. Ki Joon!

284
00:25:18,522 --> 00:25:22,692
How can we go in right now? We'll all
die if we go out in this weather!

285
00:25:26,086 --> 00:25:29,367
I'm sorry, CEO Hwang.
I must have lost my mind.

286
00:25:38,797 --> 00:25:41,849
Hey. Let's use this boat.

287
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:45,188
We have to save So Hee and Bong Hee.
Let's use this.

288
00:25:46,122 --> 00:25:49,932
Oh, and also... Let's break up.

289
00:25:49,932 --> 00:25:52,726
I can't date you anymore
because you're such an asshole.

290
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,746
Help me with this! Come on!

291
00:25:59,746 --> 00:26:01,542
Go and help her.

292
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:04,577
Ki Joon, what are you doing over there?

293
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:11,800
No! Don't go out there!

294
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,766
You can't go out there right now!

295
00:26:13,766 --> 00:26:16,773
It looks like they're coming to save us.
Over here!

296
00:26:16,773 --> 00:26:19,702
So Hee. So Hee, do you see
Joon Oh over there?

297
00:26:19,702 --> 00:26:21,891
- Do you see Joon Oh?
- Over here!

298
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:25,718
We're over here! Please! Over here!

299
00:26:25,718 --> 00:26:28,573
Seo Joon Oh! Seo Joon Oh!

300
00:26:28,573 --> 00:26:31,053
- Please... Please...
- Seo Joon Oh!

301
00:26:31,053 --> 00:26:35,180
- Over here...
- Answer me, Seo Joon Oh!

302
00:26:40,888 --> 00:26:41,888
Geez.

303
00:26:41,888 --> 00:26:44,705
I told you not to go!
Why aren't you listening?

304
00:26:46,432 --> 00:26:48,439
Let's abandon them.

305
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,192
This is more important.

306
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:54,009
So Hee, you saw, didn't you?
What happened to Seo Joon Oh?

307
00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:56,440
What happened to Seo Joon Oh?
Hurry up and answer me!

308
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,442
You already know...
what happened to Joon Oh.

309
00:27:04,445 --> 00:27:06,307
<i>Seo Joon Oh!</i>

310
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,622
Tae Ho, what are you saying?

311
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:38,320
If we lose this boat...
we're all going to die here.

312
00:27:41,465 --> 00:27:43,468
Let's abandon them.

313
00:27:43,468 --> 00:27:44,868
We're more important.

314
00:27:44,868 --> 00:27:48,410
How can you say such a thing?
Do you have the right to say that?

315
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,349
Let's talk about who has what right
after we survive!

316
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:53,859
Get out. You can't take this boat.

317
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:56,990
We can't do anything about
someone who's already dead.

318
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,006
Keep yourself alive.

319
00:28:01,982 --> 00:28:04,590
How can you talk like that?

320
00:28:05,967 --> 00:28:08,853
How did we get tangled up in this mess?

321
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,425
Whose fault is it
that Seo Joon Oh ended up like that?

322
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:14,439
- Are you crazy, you punk?
- I'm crazy? Am I the crazy one?

323
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:17,718
You're all crazier than I am.
It was hard to bring this boat back.

324
00:28:17,718 --> 00:28:19,663
How can you take it back out after that?

325
00:28:19,663 --> 00:28:22,044
Let's not do this. Let's save them first!

326
00:28:22,044 --> 00:28:25,476
Then should we just die? Should we stick
our thumbs up our butts and die here?

327
00:28:25,476 --> 00:28:28,596
Come to your senses, I'm begging you!

328
00:28:28,596 --> 00:28:31,092
I'm the one who caught it
and stopped it from floating away.

329
00:28:31,092 --> 00:28:35,089
If we take it out again and lose it,
we'll all die here.

330
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,224
Am I the only one
who wants to get off this island?

331
00:28:37,224 --> 00:28:39,359
Am I the only one who wants to live?

332
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,843
Is it so wrong to do everything it takes
to live? I think you guys are weird!

333
00:28:43,843 --> 00:28:46,473
Why are you so satisfied here?
We need to get out of here!

334
00:28:47,461 --> 00:28:49,439
Don't you want to live?

335
00:28:50,172 --> 00:28:52,522
Is it really living if I survive alone?

336
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,095
If I abandon everyone else...
If I leave them here...

337
00:28:58,886 --> 00:29:01,810
If I run away so I can live,
is that really living?

338
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:04,615
Anyway, no one can take this boat!

339
00:29:04,615 --> 00:29:08,467
If you want to save them,
swim or make a raft.

340
00:29:08,467 --> 00:29:10,987
- Let go!
- Hey.

341
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:18,715
You son of a bitch.
There's nothing you won't say.

342
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,490
Were you always such garbage?

343
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,141
How dare you speak like that
to someone who has seniority?

344
00:29:22,141 --> 00:29:24,827
- Seniority, my ass.
- Let go!

345
00:29:24,827 --> 00:29:28,574
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey, are you crazy?

346
00:29:32,323 --> 00:29:34,932
If you want to live, listen to me!

347
00:29:34,932 --> 00:29:37,833
Stop thinking about yourselves!

348
00:29:42,109 --> 00:29:44,367
I'll hold him down! Go!

349
00:29:51,846 --> 00:29:53,869
Damn it!

350
00:29:54,137 --> 00:29:56,738
- One! Two!
- One!

351
00:30:00,388 --> 00:30:03,234
If something happened to Seo Joon Oh...

352
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,593
You and Choi Tae Ho...

353
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,484
I won't forgive either one of you.

354
00:30:09,484 --> 00:30:11,888
What do you think
you're capable of doing?

355
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,060
Wait and see.

356
00:30:15,955 --> 00:30:18,272
Wait and see what I'll do.

357
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,532
You son of a bitch.

358
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:43,609
You son of a bitch!
We need to survive too!

359
00:30:45,807 --> 00:30:48,015
Wake up, you son of a bitch!

360
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:04,724
- One... Count like this!
- The waves are too strong!

361
00:31:04,724 --> 00:31:09,301
- Count like this. One! Two!
- One.

362
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:14,009
One... I think we're moving forward!
No, we're not... Wait...

363
00:31:14,009 --> 00:31:19,006
- Two! One!
- Hey, aren't we going backward?

364
00:31:19,006 --> 00:31:22,612
No, what are you saying?
We're moving forward...

365
00:31:22,612 --> 00:31:26,372
Tae Ho is pulling us back!
We're going backward!

366
00:31:26,372 --> 00:31:29,338
- Hey!
- Tae Ho!

367
00:31:31,445 --> 00:31:33,454
Hey!

368
00:31:33,454 --> 00:31:36,319
This bastard put a hole in it!

369
00:31:37,513 --> 00:31:42,053
When the waves calm down...
we'll fix the boat and get out of here.

370
00:31:42,672 --> 00:31:45,090
If you want to live...

371
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:47,026
Listen to me.

372
00:31:51,294 --> 00:31:54,637
- Damn it!
- That little...

373
00:31:54,637 --> 00:31:58,346
Who does he think he is...

374
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:15,401
Well, what brings a prosecutor
from the western district

375
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:17,138
to my office?

376
00:32:21,423 --> 00:32:24,358
I know we are both busy
with government affairs

377
00:32:24,358 --> 00:32:27,611
so I'll make this short
and easy to comprehend.

378
00:32:28,573 --> 00:32:30,692
I'm...

379
00:32:30,692 --> 00:32:33,464
Yoon So Hee's older brother.

380
00:32:34,224 --> 00:32:37,173
You know who Yoon So Hee is,
don't you, Chairwoman Jo?

381
00:32:37,173 --> 00:32:41,500
Of course I know.
I really enjoyed her drama.

382
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,773
Yesterday...

383
00:32:43,773 --> 00:32:47,646
I received a report saying
that a body was found in China.

384
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:51,721
Gosh, it's quite unfortunate.

385
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:55,044
That's comforting,
even if they're empty words.

386
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:59,500
We're people who make money
on empty words.

387
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:03,891
It's a relief that it was comforting.
Even while you know they're empty words.

388
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:08,076
Now that we've exchanged words
of blessing, let's talk about work.

389
00:33:08,076 --> 00:33:10,446
I heard...

390
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:14,138
Ra Bong Hee confessed
to killing Yoon So Hee.

391
00:33:14,138 --> 00:33:16,317
Is that true?

392
00:33:18,901 --> 00:33:21,715
I see that you're not here for no reason.

393
00:33:22,406 --> 00:33:25,536
How much do you know, Prosecutor Yoon?

394
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,811
<i>I... killed her.</i>

395
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:39,807
<i>I killed Yoon So Hee.</i>

396
00:33:39,807 --> 00:33:41,636
This is all I know.

397
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:48,817
It looks like there isn't much
discrepancy in how much we know.

398
00:33:49,891 --> 00:33:51,961
What source did you get that from?

399
00:33:51,961 --> 00:33:55,208
One person's hand is not big enough
to conceal the sky.

400
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:58,067
No matter how much you try
to conceal the sky with your hand...

401
00:33:58,067 --> 00:34:01,551
The sun will keep shining,
and the rain will fall.

402
00:34:01,551 --> 00:34:03,057
The truth will be revealed.

403
00:34:03,057 --> 00:34:05,336
How do you know if that's the truth?

404
00:34:05,336 --> 00:34:08,418
They're just a few words said by
a hypnotized girl who lost her memory.

405
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:12,547
This can't be used as evidence.
You know that.

406
00:34:13,255 --> 00:34:15,971
It looks like you're thinking
about that girl, quite a bit.

407
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:19,942
She's a survivor.
Isn't it our nation's obligation?

408
00:34:19,942 --> 00:34:22,632
Our nation's obligation...

409
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:27,907
I don't think that term
was meant to be used like that.

410
00:34:27,907 --> 00:34:33,088
In law, everything can be arbitrarily
interpreted, so interpret it as you wish.

411
00:34:37,315 --> 00:34:39,878
Then...

412
00:34:41,173 --> 00:34:43,896
What about...

413
00:34:44,835 --> 00:34:47,443
the fact that you bribed people
to get your son into school

414
00:34:47,443 --> 00:34:52,125
and illegally laundered money, using a
fake company under your husband's name?

415
00:34:53,023 --> 00:34:56,494
Should I interpret that
arbitrarily as well?

416
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:06,572
You prepared a lot before coming here.

417
00:35:08,835 --> 00:35:10,356
What is it that you want?

418
00:35:10,356 --> 00:35:14,869
All you have to do
is what you were supposed to do.

419
00:35:16,385 --> 00:35:20,655
Just as you saw it...
Just as you heard it...

420
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:23,846
Just as it is...

421
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:27,047
Announce all of it.

422
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:31,027
"A survivor returned,
but she lost her memory."

423
00:35:31,027 --> 00:35:34,494
"The only thing she remembers
is that she killed someone."

424
00:35:34,494 --> 00:35:37,465
"The victim of that murder
was the top star, Yoon So Hee?"

425
00:35:42,884 --> 00:35:46,452
Are you intending to kill Ra Bong Hee
by making her into a murderer?

426
00:35:48,798 --> 00:35:53,268
I'll say this. I think you are
continuing to misunderstand.

427
00:35:53,268 --> 00:35:55,565
Please listen carefully.

428
00:35:55,565 --> 00:35:59,860
As Chairwoman Jo of the special
investigation committee, you will inquire

429
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,697
and as Prosecutor Yoon of the western
district, I will investigate.

430
00:36:03,697 --> 00:36:07,065
And the judgment of what
should be done with Ra Bong Hee...

431
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:09,367
will be made by the nation.

432
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:12,423
All you have to do is announce
what you found out.

433
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:15,302
I'll be the one to investigate.

434
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:19,826
Are you...

435
00:36:19,826 --> 00:36:23,719
aware that I have seniority over you?

436
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:26,559
Of course. I know it very well.

437
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:30,927
I even listened to your lectures
at the training institute.

438
00:36:30,927 --> 00:36:33,523
I'm just living the way you taught us to.

439
00:36:33,523 --> 00:36:37,050
The way my brilliant instructor
told us to live.

440
00:36:42,402 --> 00:36:47,673
I hope you act the way you taught us
to act back then, Ma'am.

441
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:49,327
Take care of yourself.

442
00:37:04,844 --> 00:37:09,657
Wow... It must have been hard for you
to come all the way to China.

443
00:37:10,344 --> 00:37:14,367
Wow, seriously.
The plane crashed, of all things

444
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:16,791
and we ended up on a deserted island.

445
00:37:18,056 --> 00:37:20,760
I thought I was going to die. Seriously.

446
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,440
But it's such a relief that
you made it back alive, CEO Hwang.

447
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,719
But...

448
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:31,293
What happened on that island?

449
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,436
That girl, Ra Bong Hee, who was
Joon Oh's stylist made it out--

450
00:37:38,436 --> 00:37:40,922
Ra Bong Hee, that girl?

451
00:37:40,922 --> 00:37:42,961
- She's alive?
- Yes.

452
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:45,465
The special investigation team
is questioning her

453
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:47,969
but they don't know anything.

454
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:52,108
There are rumors
that she lost her memory.

455
00:37:52,108 --> 00:37:57,117
She lost her memory? She can't remember
what happened on that island?

456
00:37:57,117 --> 00:38:01,038
Yes, that's what they say.
But I'm not certain.

457
00:38:01,682 --> 00:38:06,193
Wow, we were out in that blood bath,
but she can't remember it?

458
00:38:06,193 --> 00:38:08,155
Wow, that can't be true. No way.

459
00:38:08,155 --> 00:38:12,445
I don't know about anyone else,
but she should remember! She should.

460
00:38:12,445 --> 00:38:16,173
CEO Hwang,
when the public safety guys arrive

461
00:38:16,173 --> 00:38:18,355
you'll officially return to Korea

462
00:38:18,355 --> 00:38:22,413
but we won't have time to talk
because you'll be questioned.

463
00:38:22,413 --> 00:38:24,097
You're probably right.

464
00:38:25,992 --> 00:38:28,358
- What about the company?
- It was crazy.

465
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:31,884
The crazed fans of our kids
are camping out at our company...

466
00:38:31,884 --> 00:38:34,876
CEO Hwang, when you come back
and see everything...

467
00:38:36,222 --> 00:38:39,864
But, anyway, CEO Hwang.

468
00:38:40,632 --> 00:38:44,989
What really... happened on that island?

469
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,224
Please tell me about it, at least.

470
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:50,802
It'll be hard to see each other
when we return to Korea.

471
00:38:53,286 --> 00:38:55,887
- Do Pal.
- Yes.

472
00:38:56,811 --> 00:38:59,128
Do you think you can handle it?

473
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:04,163
I need to handle it.
This is our company we're talking about.

474
00:39:21,913 --> 00:39:25,365
They won't come. Of course they won't.

475
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:29,048
If they were coming,
they would have come a long time ago.

476
00:39:29,048 --> 00:39:31,643
They should have come for me!

477
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:34,416
Choi Tae Ho...

478
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:36,751
It's because of that bastard.

479
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:39,733
He's stopping all of them from coming!

480
00:39:43,269 --> 00:39:45,686
Why aren't you saying anything?

481
00:39:45,686 --> 00:39:47,695
Are you thinking of dying here?

482
00:39:47,695 --> 00:39:50,628
What answer can I possibly
give you in this situation?

483
00:39:52,628 --> 00:39:54,385
Should I curse with you?

484
00:39:54,385 --> 00:39:57,387
It looks like we're going to die here.

485
00:39:57,387 --> 00:39:59,864
It looks like we're going
to starve to death here!

486
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,434
We'll freeze to death
before that happens.

487
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:04,139
Hey.

488
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:08,384
If you're so scared of dying

489
00:40:08,384 --> 00:40:11,253
why don't you care about
anyone else dying?

490
00:40:15,097 --> 00:40:18,541
I've never met anyone
as selfish as you in my entire life.

491
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,356
You've been getting on my nerves
since we got here.

492
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,202
It's not only your life that's precious

493
00:40:42,202 --> 00:40:44,166
and you're not the only one who's scared.

494
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:46,657
So stop whining.

495
00:40:48,858 --> 00:40:51,447
I ended up like this
because I was trying to save you

496
00:40:51,447 --> 00:40:53,206
and Seo Joon Oh...

497
00:40:58,402 --> 00:41:00,617
Seo Joon Oh...

498
00:41:20,974 --> 00:41:23,094
They'll be here soon.

499
00:41:24,248 --> 00:41:27,355
They'll come to save us soon...

500
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:30,268
So don't be too anxious.

501
00:41:30,268 --> 00:41:32,831
They're not coming to save us.

502
00:41:32,831 --> 00:41:36,635
They can't! How can they? How can they
come when that bastard is stopping them?

503
00:41:36,635 --> 00:41:39,244
They'll come. They will.
If we wait a little longer--

504
00:41:39,244 --> 00:41:41,204
He killed a man.

505
00:41:45,532 --> 00:41:47,943
Choi Tae Ho killed someone.

506
00:41:48,614 --> 00:41:51,251
And I saw all of it.

507
00:41:54,998 --> 00:41:58,675
I saw him kill someone else
just so he could live.

508
00:42:00,465 --> 00:42:02,373
Hold on a little longer!

509
00:42:03,538 --> 00:42:07,043
I... want to live...

510
00:42:07,043 --> 00:42:10,510
Do you have anything in your bag?
Do you have any food?

511
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:20,798
I want to live...

512
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:23,403
Please...

513
00:42:36,278 --> 00:42:40,695
You're going to die anyway.
You'll die no matter what.

514
00:42:47,561 --> 00:42:49,137
I'm sorry.

515
00:42:59,173 --> 00:43:02,221
Hey. Hey. Punk, be careful, seriously!

516
00:43:02,221 --> 00:43:04,492
- I was just...
- Are you okay?

517
00:43:04,492 --> 00:43:05,820
Yes.

518
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:10,668
Geez, you call yourself a man,
but you got beaten to a pulp.

519
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:13,038
You're badly hurt!

520
00:43:13,038 --> 00:43:15,945
There's a first aid kit
in one of the suitcases.

521
00:43:15,945 --> 00:43:18,856
I'll clean you up. You need it.

522
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:28,807
Give me the boat.

523
00:43:30,644 --> 00:43:33,362
Where will you use a lifeboat
with a hole in it?

524
00:43:33,362 --> 00:43:35,485
Even if you take it, it's of no use.
It's deflated.

525
00:43:35,485 --> 00:43:40,175
Don't worry about that. We'll fix it
and use it, so hand it over.

526
00:43:40,175 --> 00:43:42,759
- No.
- Hey, Choi Tae Ho!

527
00:43:44,365 --> 00:43:47,650
Never mind. I'll just take it then.

528
00:43:50,579 --> 00:43:52,730
Stop it already, seriously!

529
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,231
Hey!

530
00:43:58,076 --> 00:44:02,615
That's enough. Okay? Stop it.

531
00:44:02,615 --> 00:44:05,480
Ji Ah, are you okay? Huh?

532
00:44:06,581 --> 00:44:09,730
- Stop it already! Stop it!
- Hey! What are you doing?

533
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,996
Wait, stop it. Stop it!
What are you people doing?

534
00:44:12,996 --> 00:44:15,032
Stop it already!

535
00:44:15,032 --> 00:44:17,043
- Wow, stop it already!
- That's enough!

536
00:44:17,043 --> 00:44:19,190
Do you want to die? Do you?

537
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,860
- Do you--
- Hey!

538
00:44:22,469 --> 00:44:25,844
What's wrong with you?
What the hell is wrong with you?

539
00:44:25,844 --> 00:44:29,521
Why are you making me out to be
the weird one? Let's survive together!

540
00:44:29,521 --> 00:44:31,637
I don't want to die here!

541
00:44:31,637 --> 00:44:34,740
I don't want to die here either, Punk!
None of us want to!

542
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,898
They don't want to die here!

543
00:44:36,898 --> 00:44:39,469
- You're trying to survive on your own!
- Wow.

544
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:42,164
We should collect ourselves
at a time like this!

545
00:44:42,164 --> 00:44:46,097
Tae Ho's right. Yes. He's right.

546
00:44:46,759 --> 00:44:49,744
It's important that we survive!
Who cares about them?

547
00:44:49,744 --> 00:44:53,465
If you think about it carefully,
Tae Ho is right. Yes.

548
00:44:53,465 --> 00:44:56,434
Let's just forget about them,
and leave them to die!

549
00:44:56,434 --> 00:44:58,074
Ki Joon.

550
00:44:59,637 --> 00:45:03,788
I'm saying, let's leave them to die!

551
00:45:03,788 --> 00:45:06,829
- Why are you winking?
- Ouch! Seriously!

552
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,351
Sand got in my eye!

553
00:45:09,351 --> 00:45:13,844
Anyway, I completely agree with you!

554
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:17,873
Let's just go back to the hut.
Let's go back to the hut!

555
00:45:17,873 --> 00:45:19,735
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

556
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:24,976
Like Tae Ho said, let's go back,
and when the waves calm down

557
00:45:24,976 --> 00:45:29,090
we'll come back later,
much later, to save them. For now...

558
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:30,918
Let's go back to the hut, okay?

559
00:45:30,918 --> 00:45:35,240
- Hey, Manager Jung, you son of a--
- Yeah! I'm a dog! A dog! A dog!

560
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,224
I want them to die, so I'm a dog!

561
00:45:38,224 --> 00:45:44,000
I have my reasons but none of you
understand me! I'm so annoyed!

562
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,789
Right, Tae Ho? Are you all right?
Geez, you're badly hurt!

563
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:52,460
There's a first aid kit back at the hut,
so I'll put some medicine on that, okay?

564
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,161
I'm sorry for hitting you earlier.

565
00:45:56,246 --> 00:45:59,244
I think you're right.
We didn't think it through.

566
00:45:59,244 --> 00:46:03,574
We... didn't... think it through!

567
00:46:03,574 --> 00:46:05,858
It hurt a lot, didn't it?

568
00:46:05,858 --> 00:46:09,166
It's okay. It's okay.
Let's go back to the hut and talk.

569
00:46:12,195 --> 00:46:16,284
- You found something that pumps air?
- Yeah. An air pump.

570
00:46:16,284 --> 00:46:18,545
I found it at the beach.

571
00:46:18,545 --> 00:46:21,159
It seems like it came with the boat.

572
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:23,065
So what are you saying we should do?

573
00:46:23,916 --> 00:46:28,179
First, Tae Ho can't find out,
so very carefully and slowly...

574
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:30,117
One person will move at a time.

575
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:37,628
<i>While we live our daily lives,
we'll look for something to fix the hole.</i>

576
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,057
<i>As naturally as possible.</i>

577
00:46:40,682 --> 00:46:42,195
Where are you going?

578
00:46:42,996 --> 00:46:44,786
I'm going to search for food.

579
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:50,856
<i>That was good. Yeol, search in
the upper parts of the mountain.</i>

580
00:46:50,856 --> 00:46:54,447
<i>There's no time,
so let's split up to search.</i>

581
00:47:07,351 --> 00:47:09,896
<i>Ji Ah, you go first.</i>

582
00:47:13,442 --> 00:47:15,179
Go that way.

583
00:47:17,273 --> 00:47:20,096
- I'll go get some water.
- Yeah, okay!

584
00:47:20,096 --> 00:47:22,179
- Get lots!
- Okay.

585
00:47:23,585 --> 00:47:25,731
<i>Ji Ah, you were a little awkward.</i>

586
00:47:25,731 --> 00:47:30,262
<i>You have to be more natural
so he doesn't catch on, okay?</i>

587
00:47:30,262 --> 00:47:31,742
Where should I look?

588
00:47:33,929 --> 00:47:38,021
<i>- Tae Ho isn't suspicious of me, so--</i>
- Ki Joon, where are you going?

589
00:47:42,132 --> 00:47:45,025
I'm going with Ji Ah because it could be
dangerous. Do you want to go?

590
00:47:45,025 --> 00:47:47,701
I have stuff to do here.
Go with her, then. Go.

591
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,507
You can go.

592
00:47:50,507 --> 00:47:54,753
Okay. You need more medicine.
I'll put more on for you later.

593
00:48:02,226 --> 00:48:06,144
<i>Bong Hee sacrificed herself...</i>

594
00:48:06,144 --> 00:48:08,427
<i>to keep us alive.</i>

595
00:48:09,965 --> 00:48:12,514
<i>When she was in pain,
she didn't even show it.</i>

596
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:16,083
<i>This time, let's help Bong Hee.</i>

597
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:18,092
<i>That's the right thing to do.</i>

598
00:48:19,282 --> 00:48:22,447
<i>If we are human,
we should do that, don't you think?</i>

599
00:48:23,085 --> 00:48:27,701
That's why, even if it's hard, let's
push through it, and keep our strength.

600
00:48:27,701 --> 00:48:30,610
That's the only way
we'll save Bong Hee...

601
00:48:31,614 --> 00:48:33,766
and find Joon Oh.

602
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,523
Do you think Joon Oh is alive?

603
00:48:38,523 --> 00:48:42,679
I once asked Joon Oh if he thought
other people were still alive.

604
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:45,621
Do you know what he said?

605
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:49,862
He said, we should hope they're alive.

606
00:48:50,626 --> 00:48:52,451
He told me to hope.

607
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:56,820
Okay. Let's hope.

608
00:49:00,253 --> 00:49:03,664
<i>Yesterday, Yeol brought
the most materials back.</i>

609
00:49:03,664 --> 00:49:07,431
<i>There were a lot,
but none of them were useful.</i>

610
00:49:07,431 --> 00:49:12,672
<i>Ji Ah didn't bring anything back,
so it was also useless.</i>

611
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:17,048
<i>I hope we have a better day today
than we did yesterday.</i>

612
00:49:18,862 --> 00:49:22,512
- Airplane parts...
<i>- There isn't much time.</i>

613
00:49:22,512 --> 00:49:27,681
<i>Today will be another hard day,
but let's do our best today.</i>

614
00:49:30,411 --> 00:49:32,532
Why is this here?

615
00:49:34,923 --> 00:49:38,061
I should bring something
so they don't scold me again.

616
00:49:47,846 --> 00:49:49,567
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing.

617
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:52,416
- What about you?
- I found this.

618
00:49:53,413 --> 00:49:55,373
- Where did you find this?
- I picked it up.

619
00:49:55,373 --> 00:49:59,228
- Hey!
- Be quiet! Seriously...

620
00:49:59,228 --> 00:50:03,110
Hey! Good job. Good job.

621
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:05,923
This is more than enough
to cover up that hole!

622
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:08,561
- Huh?
- Because this is rubber.

623
00:50:08,561 --> 00:50:11,681
The boat is rubber too. We just
have to burn it, melt it, and attach it.

624
00:50:11,681 --> 00:50:14,514
- How will it stick?
- Geez, never mind.

625
00:50:14,514 --> 00:50:17,800
- Good job!
- Don't push me!

626
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:21,032
Hey, anyway,
two days have already passed.

627
00:50:21,032 --> 00:50:24,469
If we wait any longer, it could
get dangerous for Bong Hee and So Hee

628
00:50:24,469 --> 00:50:27,498
so let's hurry up.
Yeol, work on it tonight.

629
00:50:27,498 --> 00:50:28,648
Okay.

630
00:50:28,648 --> 00:50:32,101
When Yeol is finished, we'll depart
as soon as the sun rises.

631
00:50:32,101 --> 00:50:34,425
- Before Tae Ho wakes up.
- Okay.

632
00:50:34,425 --> 00:50:38,282
I'll go first, so get back
without being noticed, okay?

633
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:42,128
I'm leaving.

634
00:50:50,396 --> 00:50:55,192
<i>As Chairwoman Jo of the special
investigation committee, you will inquire</i>

635
00:50:55,192 --> 00:50:59,242
<i>and as Prosecutor Yoon of
the western district, I will investigate.</i>

636
00:50:59,242 --> 00:51:03,199
And the judgment regarding
what should be done with Ra Bong Hee...

637
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:05,273
should be made by the nation.

638
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:27,126
Yeah, it's me.

639
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:29,248
Call in the reporters.

640
00:51:30,824 --> 00:51:32,592
What for?

641
00:51:33,585 --> 00:51:40,230
Um... Regarding the Legend Entertainment
private plane crash...

642
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,664
It's a special announcement.

643
00:51:42,664 --> 00:51:45,248
That'll be enough, right?

644
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:47,291
Okay.

645
00:52:00,592 --> 00:52:05,447
When we arrive, you will be transferred
to the public safety team.

646
00:52:05,447 --> 00:52:08,567
Oh. Okay.

647
00:52:35,141 --> 00:52:37,293
I took care of it without a doubt.

648
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:41,936
Okay. Okay, good work.

649
00:52:43,586 --> 00:52:46,786
- This place is good.
- Thank you.

650
00:52:54,721 --> 00:52:56,188
You should eat too.

651
00:53:18,045 --> 00:53:19,581
Where are you going?

652
00:53:23,717 --> 00:53:26,661
- You weren't sleeping?
- Where are you going?

653
00:53:29,961 --> 00:53:33,692
- I'm getting some water.
- At night?

654
00:53:33,692 --> 00:53:35,034
Yeah.

655
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:39,313
Okay.

656
00:53:40,152 --> 00:53:41,916
Be careful.

657
00:53:56,278 --> 00:53:58,447
They won't come to save us, will they?

658
00:53:59,811 --> 00:54:01,811
They won't come.

659
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:05,625
If they were coming,
they would have come already.

660
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:21,530
<i>We're...</i>

661
00:54:22,418 --> 00:54:24,425
going to die here.

662
00:54:30,759 --> 00:54:33,056
This is so hard for me.

663
00:55:04,141 --> 00:55:06,480
It's so cold...

664
00:55:14,563 --> 00:55:16,583
Oh, that's right.

665
00:55:26,233 --> 00:55:28,030
Where did she go?

666
00:55:36,052 --> 00:55:37,759
So Hee!

667
00:56:01,032 --> 00:56:03,128
I knew it.

668
00:56:10,351 --> 00:56:12,873
You son of a bitch,
why didn't you listen?

669
00:56:13,817 --> 00:56:15,822
You son of a bitch.

670
00:56:15,822 --> 00:56:18,278
I said we need to survive.

671
00:56:18,278 --> 00:56:21,182
We won't get out of here, we're going
to die here without that boat!

672
00:56:21,182 --> 00:56:25,585
Do you want to die here?
Do you, you son of a bitch?

673
00:56:27,221 --> 00:56:33,500
Ji Ah, it'll be okay.
Ji Ah. Ji Ah? Wait...

674
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,221
Oh... Wait...

675
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:41,065
Ki Joon!

676
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:44,320
You son of a bitch! You dumb bastard!

677
00:56:59,365 --> 00:57:01,313
So Hee!

678
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,831
Yoon So Hee!

679
00:57:38,628 --> 00:57:40,182
Stop it!

680
00:57:40,182 --> 00:57:41,659
You son of a bitch.

681
00:57:42,557 --> 00:57:45,447
You crazy bastard.

682
00:57:45,447 --> 00:57:47,121
You son of a bitch!

683
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:52,278
Why do you keep making me
into the crazy one?

684
00:57:52,278 --> 00:57:55,418
Why do you make me into
the crazy one, you son of a bitch?

685
00:58:02,958 --> 00:58:04,878
Get up, you son of a bitch.

686
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:11,077
Get up, you bastard!

687
00:58:17,304 --> 00:58:18,768
Get up.

688
00:58:24,445 --> 00:58:25,784
Yeol.

689
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:35,615
No!

690
00:58:38,637 --> 00:58:41,923
You can't, So Hee. No! No, don't do it!

691
00:58:41,923 --> 00:58:45,701
Come back down with me.
They'll be here soon to save us.

692
00:58:45,701 --> 00:58:48,295
Soon! They'll be here soon to save us!
So let's--

693
00:58:48,295 --> 00:58:50,509
- They're no coming.
- No, they will! They will!

694
00:58:50,509 --> 00:58:52,528
They'll be here soon
if we wait a little longer!

695
00:58:52,528 --> 00:58:57,324
I'm sorry about not responding. I was
wrong. It was because I was scared too.

696
00:58:57,324 --> 00:58:59,085
I was afraid too!

697
00:58:59,085 --> 00:59:02,519
I did it because I was afraid Seo Joon Oh
is dead, and we'll both die too!

698
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:06,094
So... So come back down with me.

699
00:59:07,869 --> 00:59:11,632
Forget it. You don't have
to answer me anymore.

700
00:59:12,586 --> 00:59:15,740
- I'll go first--
- Wait! This!

701
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:17,405
This.

702
00:59:20,284 --> 00:59:23,438
Your necklace. I found it!

703
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:27,851
I found the necklace your brother
gave you. You wanted to find this!

704
00:59:41,884 --> 00:59:45,547
Wait, no. Yeol! Yeol!

705
00:59:46,224 --> 00:59:49,173
Wait, no. No...

706
00:59:49,173 --> 00:59:52,626
Yeol, wake up! Yeol!

707
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:57,250
No. No, wait a minute. Wait, Yeol.

708
00:59:59,126 --> 01:00:01,317
Yeol, wake up. Yeol!

709
01:00:03,233 --> 01:00:07,211
Yeol. Yeol, no! Yeol, wake up!

710
01:00:08,454 --> 01:00:11,028
Geez, what do I do?

711
01:00:11,028 --> 01:00:14,376
Yeol! Yeol!

712
01:00:16,164 --> 01:00:19,744
Yeol! Wait! Wake up, you son of a bitch!

713
01:00:19,744 --> 01:00:21,833
You son of a bitch...

714
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:24,027
Yeol!

715
01:01:47,802 --> 01:01:52,304
On the 17th of last month,
Actress Yoon So Hee's body...

716
01:01:52,304 --> 01:01:55,757
was found in Huizhou, China.

717
01:01:56,467 --> 01:01:59,989
She was murdered.

718
01:02:01,197 --> 01:02:05,346
Ra Bong Hee, who visited the island
to try to regain her memory...

719
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:07,228
said--

720
01:02:07,228 --> 01:02:11,440
Um... They found another survivor.

721
01:02:14,632 --> 01:02:16,550
Prosecutor Yoon.

722
01:02:18,664 --> 01:02:21,195
I regained...

723
01:02:22,057 --> 01:02:23,891
all of my memory.

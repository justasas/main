00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,490
<i>This is about Shin Jae Hyun's death
four years ago.</i>

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,560
<i>It was not a suicide.</i>

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,990
<i>It was murder
that was disguised as a suicide.</i>

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,740
<i>You're useful for once.</i>

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:24,730
<i>Let's send you off. In one shot.</i>

6
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:32,970
<i>Sa... Save me... Save me...</i>

7
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,240
<i>Let's send you off in one shot.</i>

8
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,190
No way.

9
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:48,790
<i>Shin Jae Hyun's case was disguised
as a suicide four years ago...</i>

10
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:50,640
Jang Do Pal.

<i>[Arrest Warrant]</i>

12
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,720
His accomplice was Choi Tae Ho.

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,480
These two planned their crimes...

14
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:09,100
<i>which is why I am here
to request the investigation be reopened.</i>

15
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,980
- It's dangerous!
- Geez, no it's not!

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,980
I'm telling you it was!

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,290
Yes, Tae Ho just left.

18
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,130
Gate Three. Yes, I understand.

19
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:42,150
<i>The owner of the cell phone
that recorded this murder</i>

20
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,590
<i>became a murder target
for Choi Tae Ho and Jang Do Pal.</i>

21
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,550
<i>That was Yoon So Hee.</i>

22
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:56,280
I want to request a rigorous
investigation into Yoon So Hee's murder.

23
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,980
How did Yoon So Hee record the incident?

24
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,580
So are you saying Seo Joon Oh
is unrelated to this incident?

25
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,890
Will Seo Joon Oh speak
at this press conference?

26
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,500
We caught Choi Tae Ho!
We caught him as he tried to escape.

27
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,740
Okay.

28
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:02,280
The police caught Choi Tae Ho.

29
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:20,240
<i>That's enough. You should leave
a little room for our investigation.</i>

30
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,570
Through a fair investigation
by the prosecution

31
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:29,680
I am urging them to work hard so that
they don't victimize an innocent person.

32
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,840
That is all for today's press conference.

33
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,080
<i>[Episode 15]</i>

34
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,490
Wow, Ji Ah. Thank you.
Thank you for not doing anything!

35
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,080
- Ji Ah did so much by doing nothing!
- She did.

36
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,430
But why do I feel so weird?

37
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,000
We were so worried that we couldn't
reach you and Manager Jung.

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,770
By the way, are you sure
Tae Ho was caught?

39
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:00,160
Why do you keep asking? Are you sad?

40
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,660
Why would I be sad?
I just can't believe it.

41
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,820
Jang Do Pal and Choi Tae Ho
were both caught

42
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,450
so starting tomorrow, you must take over
Legend Entertainment, Deputy CEO Tae.

43
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,460
- I'm leaving.
- Hey, I didn't want this position.

44
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,480
And why is it my responsibility?

45
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,630
Now that CEO Hwang has woken up,
he should take responsibility for it.

46
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,970
Isn't that right, CEO Hwang?

47
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,660
Joon Oh, a guy like this can't be a spy.
He should be the spy.

48
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,060
He was such a great actor, that I thought
he was on Jang Do Pal's side.

49
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,370
Hey, you really don't get me.
Do you know how difficult it was?

50
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,600
I'm not so sure.

51
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,150
I wish every day was like this.

52
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,480
I'm a little anxious because too many
good things are happening at once.

53
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,870
Hey, you don't have to be anxious.

54
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,450
We still have one important thing
left to do.

55
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,210
Clearing the false charges
against Joon Oh?

56
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,060
Joon Oh, don't worry.

57
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,010
This time, we will tell the truth,
and prepare a red carpet for you

58
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,790
so you can walk on it with light feet.

59
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,120
Should I dress up for this?
Prepare something for me.

60
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,970
Okay.

61
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,340
<i>Hello.</i>

62
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,680
I'm a lawyer from Choi In Park Law Firm.

63
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,830
Legend Entertainment's lawyer
is already working for Jang Do Pal

64
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,670
which is why Tae Ho found another
lawyer. He's looking for a way out.

65
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,070
We must tie him to the conspiracy.

66
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,330
And make sure Choi Tae Ho
doesn't get off.

67
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,890
Of course.

68
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,690
What are you going in here?

69
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,430
What? Am I not allowed to be here?

70
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,410
You're not affiliated with us anymore and
this case isn't under your jurisdiction.

71
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,940
You're overstepping your authority
by acting like this.

72
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,170
Think whatever you like.

73
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:18,340
But you'd better start investigating
the witnesses' statements tomorrow.

74
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,400
What about Seo Joon Oh?

75
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,450
- I need to see Seo Joon Oh first.
- Get the statements first.

76
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,060
Seo Joon Oh needs to come in
before I collect their statements.

77
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,790
When is Seo Joon Oh coming?

78
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,680
After you carry out the statement
investigation in a reasonable manner--

79
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,130
Reasonable? How can you talk so
carelessly as a man in the same field?

80
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,970
We only halted his indictment
because Seo Joon Oh wasn't here.

81
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,520
We'll start once he shows up!
That's why...

82
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,580
You'd better tell Seo Joon Oh to show up.

83
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,230
You don't think the stay of proceedings

84
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,270
on Seo Joon Oh's case
was without a reason, do you?

85
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,900
You will also be charged
with concealing a criminal.

86
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,700
You shouldn't demand it so confidently.

87
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,620
I dare you.

88
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,950
You have more to lose than I do,
so I have nothing to fear anymore.

89
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,870
You said you'll investigate properly

90
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,590
so lock up Jang Do Pal and Choi Tae Ho.

91
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:19,650
You'll have to act properly
now that so many people are watching.

92
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:21,660
- Lawyer Jo.
- Yes.

93
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:29,590
Here is the evidence for Hwang Jae Gook's
incident. It's someone under Jang Do Pal

94
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,510
but Choi Tae Ho was involved
in this incident as well.

95
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,400
Please keep that in mind.

96
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,070
Let's go.

97
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,630
<i>[Hwang Jae Gook
Murder Instigation Evidence]</i>

98
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,120
Geez, what was our relationship
in our past lives

99
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,530
that we got involved in two cases?
Two murder cases.

100
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,000
You talked with your lawyer for a while.
What did you conclude?

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,480
Jang Do Pal has been
consistently playing dumb.

102
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,670
He's the real criminal,
so of course he has nothing to say.

103
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,160
And what about you?

104
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:44,130
Prosecutor,
I know this is a lot to ask...

105
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,400
but can I see CEO Jang?

106
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,300
Why would I let you do that?

107
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,160
Are you going to see your accomplice
and plot something else?

108
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,980
I want to reduce your workload.

109
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,630
So please let me see him, just once.

110
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:17,580
Wow, Yoon Tae Young
has really done it this time.

111
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:22,000
I shouldn't have played along.
Isn't he a prosecutor too?

112
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,770
How could he do this to his own family?

113
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,060
Listen well. Nothing has changed.

114
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:32,890
Our investigation was fair,
and the criminal is Seo Joon Oh.

115
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,360
- Defend our side.
- Yes.

116
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,270
Yoon Tae Young, that bastard.

117
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,640
Yes, Prosecutor Yoon.
We're in front of Bong Hee's house.

118
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,540
But there are many police officers here.

119
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,170
<i>I know it'll be uncomfortable,
but hide out for a few days.</i>

120
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:56,000
<i>Lee Jae Joon is desperately
trying to find you.</i>

121
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,630
But you can't go in until
Choi Tae Ho is locked up for good.

122
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,870
Jang Do Pal and Choi Tae Ho
were really caught, right?

123
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,490
Yes, you can sleep comfortably tonight.

124
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,680
How can I sleep comfortably
when I'm in hiding? Okay, I'll try.

125
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,880
Thank you for your hard work.

126
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,750
Hey, we predicted this would happen.

127
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,680
We should hide so they can't see us.

128
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,680
Why? You don't have to suffer with me.
You can go inside and rest.

129
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,530
Again? You told me to stay by your side,
yet you want me to go home alone?

130
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,900
Hey, why do we both have to suffer?
It's better that you rest well.

131
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,740
What if you were me?
Would you go home alone?

132
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,410
Of course not.
I'm too responsible to do that.

133
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:47,630
See? I would feel uncomfortable
either way, so there's no difference.

134
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:53,950
We've come this far,
let's suffer for a little bit longer.

135
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:58,300
And, you'd be really bored without me.

136
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,690
I know, but I don't want
everyone to suffer because of me.

137
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,350
- Enough!
- Son of a bitch?

138
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:05,480
- Enough! Enough! Enough!
- Son of a bitch?

139
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,580
Enough. Enough. Stop saying weird things

140
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,290
and just cheer up.
Okay?

141
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,980
- Cheer up! Okay?
- Geez.

142
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,950
- Huh?
- Okay. Geez.

143
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,010
Let's do this!

144
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,070
Yeah. Yeah, Reporter Park.

145
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:42,020
Let's not do this
before the election, okay?

146
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,660
No, don't do that. Not again!

147
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,070
You should know better than to do that!

148
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,470
Wait, I have another call. Wait!

149
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,230
Hello? I told you
it wasn't Congresswoman Jo!

150
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:59,550
No, who told you that?
It's not true. I'm hanging up.

151
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,370
Hello? Let's talk about this
over dinner sometime. Yes.

152
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,610
Yes, talk to you later.

153
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,010
- Can't you put the phones on vibrate?
- I apologize.

154
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,320
What time is it?
Why hasn't Ji Ah come out yet?

155
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,370
Ki Joon, let's go.

156
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:26,850
Hey, where do you think you're going?
You're a wanted criminal.

157
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,210
What? Joon Oh is a wanted criminal?

158
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,520
- Hey, you really didn't know that?
- I didn't.

159
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,100
Jae Hyun's case is solved,
but is So Hee's case solved?

160
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,010
It's not solved yet? I'm not sure.

161
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:41,460
Hey, it's okay. It's okay.

162
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,040
Did you say Jang Do Pal
went to find you in China?

163
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,210
He didn't come to find us.
He came to attack us.

164
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,830
He bribed the hospital,
and at first, he tried to kill us.

165
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:16,180
That was when Ki Joon and I were
being treated at a Chinese hospital.

166
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,390
Choi Tae Ho came
with Chinese gangsters...

167
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,150
They cornered us and attacked us.

168
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,530
And I found out later on...

169
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,620
that he told Ki Joon that he'd let us go

170
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,400
if we said Seo Joon Oh killed So Hee.

171
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,820
- Ji Ah!
- Ji Ah.

172
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,490
How did it go? Was it okay?

173
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,770
Well, he took my statement...

174
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,190
- You don't have to be nervous.
- Really?

175
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:59,490
- Okay, I'll be back.
- Good luck!

176
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,780
I'll be back too! Don't worry about us!

177
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,940
Don't be nervous.

178
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,590
- See you!
- Yup!

179
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,590
Wow, that's a relief. It sounds like
Prosecutor Yoon pressed them hard enough.

180
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,110
I know.

181
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:15,950
Joon Oh, something was weird though.

182
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,440
What?

183
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,860
Near the end,
he asked me some weird questions.

184
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:32,180
It was because of CEO Hwang.
I wanted to save CEO Hwang.

185
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,390
If I didn't do as he told me,
he was going to kill me.

186
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,760
You saw it too!

187
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,680
You saw Seo Joon Oh kill her.

188
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,380
That's why I had no choice.

189
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,090
I tried to tell the truth a few times...

190
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:51,090
Like when I saw So Hee's dead body.

191
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:56,770
I was going to tell the truth,
but I was kidnapped by Tae Ho.

192
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,380
Prosecutor Yoon,
I know it's hard to believe

193
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,060
but I did it because I was scared.

194
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,830
Tae Ho is a really scary guy.
He's even scarier when he's angry.

195
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,290
He's already tall, but when he's angry,
his eyes pop out...

196
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,580
When we were on the boat,
he was covered in blood and he laughed.

197
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,460
He was so scary!

198
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,320
He's a total psychopath.

199
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,760
You have no idea what he'll do next!

200
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,750
That's why I'm begging you.
Please lock him up this time.

201
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,320
But Tae Ho Hang.

202
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,220
Didn't you become the deputy CEO
because of that psychopath?

203
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,690
Pardon?

204
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:40,590
It's true.

205
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:45,100
If I just focus on your statement,
you're a poor victim.

206
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,330
But it's not like that on paper.

207
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:52,960
Unless you're doing this because you're
not satisfied with your current salary.

208
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,900
Pardon?

209
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,420
I thought it was over

210
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,820
but that's when the look
in his eyes changed.

211
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,150
Ha Ji Ah, you're exactly how
the media portrayed you to be.

212
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,880
You're very refreshing. You don't
seem like the type to take threats.

213
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,570
Well, does anyone have a choice?

214
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:15,310
No, I just feel bad for you
because I'm such a big fan.

215
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:18,230
Geez, but your mother

216
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,820
took a lot of money
from your down payment at the company.

217
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,240
How much did she take?

218
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,320
Why are you asking me that?

219
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,440
I'm just asking to verify,
but you don't have to answer.

220
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:42,140
For someone who was threatened,
you received quite a large sum of money.

221
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,680
<i>What do you mean by that?</i>

222
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,000
Did you really lose your memory?

223
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,970
The doctor said you regained
all of your memory.

224
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,910
Did you pretend not to remember
to hide Seo Joon Oh?

225
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,970
- Prosecutor Lee--
- I heard you're dating. Is that true?

226
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,870
Did you start on the island,
or did you start during your escape?

227
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,550
Is it Stockholm syndrome?

228
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,370
Prosecutor Lee, what are you saying?

229
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,740
Where is Seo Joon Oh?

230
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,860
Where is he?

231
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:27,550
It sounds like he understood our
tendencies and made a surprise attack.

232
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,470
Why is it so hard to contact you?

233
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,610
- How is it going?
<i>- Which side are you curious about?</i>

234
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:50,350
Are you curious about the statements,
or about Choi Tae Ho and Jang Do Pal?

235
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,640
Both.

236
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,770
Jang Do Pal and Choi Tae Ho
are meeting right now.

237
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:00,690
What? What reason do they have to meet?

238
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,060
Choi Tae Ho asked to see him.

239
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,250
Choi Tae Ho?

240
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,440
CEO Jang.

241
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,900
When you said you'd save me...

242
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,760
is that offer still valid?

243
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,910
What do you mean?

244
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,270
Can you ask that now?

245
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,260
When you cast me for Dreamers,
this is what you told me.

246
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,580
You said if you had to choose one person
to help, you would choose me.

247
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,780
Isn't that why you helped me
with Jae Hyun's incident too?

248
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,680
Yeah. That's what I said.

249
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,080
Please save me one more time.

250
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:08,310
My lawyer told me I can get out.

251
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,020
If you give me a push, that is.

252
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,030
<i>Let's close our eyes,
and send you off in one shot.</i>

253
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,590
<i>Sa... Save me...</i>

254
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,650
<i>Let's send you off in one shot!
In one shot!</i>

255
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,710
Choi Tae Ho,
you don't talk very much.

256
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,840
Pardon?

257
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,850
Oh, yes.

258
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,080
It sounds like you were threatened too.

259
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,100
You understand.

260
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:55,000
If that's how it sounds to me,
other people will hear the same thing.

261
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:02,630
<i>I'll leave first,
so I can try to get you out.</i>

262
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,230
If we both want to live,
one of us needs to get out.

263
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,330
I'll leave first,
and make sure to get you out.

264
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,070
You know I'm the only person
who can help you.

265
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,090
That's how we survived this long.
Am I wrong?

266
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,420
They're trying to pressure
the people around you to catch you

267
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,790
but you can't let their
psychological warfare get to you.

268
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,980
Then they'll end up
getting what they want.

269
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,080
We're doomed.

270
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,010
Did you hear that?

271
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,800
Since the statement,
she hasn't said a word.

272
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,840
I wonder if something happened in there.

273
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:47,270
Nothing happened.
I gave my statement and got out.

274
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,490
But your expression says otherwise.

275
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:54,340
Ji Ah and Ho Hang didn't feel good
about it either, but it's nothing big.

276
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,810
You have to tough it out,
Bong Hee and Seo Joon Oh.

277
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,100
What about Tae Ho? He's in prison, right?

278
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,570
They'll probably put him in jail tonight,
since they can't hold him forever.

279
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:10,240
I'll call you back after I check
if anything has changed with those two.

280
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,330
Bong Hee, I wore a turtleneck today,
but it doesn't sting. Touch it.

281
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:27,230
It's dangerous. Sit properly.
Look straight ahead.

282
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,140
<i>Choi Tae Ho just got out.</i>

283
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,300
We will change our plans starting now.

284
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:23,520
<i>Fine. Then there's something
you need to do for me.</i>

285
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,090
What is it?

286
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:29,980
The lawyer said if I'm charged for
instigating Hwang Jae Gook's murder too

287
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,070
I'll have to do 20 laps in here.

288
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:35,440
You can take care of that, right?

289
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,840
Prosecutor Yoon has
Lee Jae Joon's evidence

290
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,250
for Hwang Jae Gook's incident.
We don't have time.

291
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,130
<i>Who are you?</i>

292
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,070
<i>Stop! Stop!</i>

293
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,800
You have to get rid of that punk

294
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,840
and put out the last embers.

295
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,290
You can do that, right?

296
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,110
I'll do that as soon as I get out.

297
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,300
And as for your sentence...

298
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,820
I'll do whatever I can to shorten it.

299
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,310
- Seo Joon Oh, it's okay.
- But I'm not okay.

300
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,660
No, I feel stuffy and uncomfortable.

301
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,090
I feel uncomfortable too!
I'm not doing it just for you. It's cold.

302
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:57,480
Hey, if you refuse, your contract
as my stylist will be terminated, got it?

303
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,170
We don't need a contract.

304
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,070
Because you keep acting like this,
I'm constantly careful with you

305
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,750
and because I'm always watching out,
I end up feeling insignificant.

306
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,290
Do you want your artist to feel that way?

307
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:17,110
Is that what you want?
Should I feel insignificant and small?

308
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:20,850
What did I do to make you feel that way?

309
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,610
That's why I want you to lighten up.

310
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,380
Hey, I think of you as someone who's like
my voice when I talk to myself.

311
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,550
But because you're not talking,
I feel alone even when I'm with you.

312
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,620
What does that mean?
I'm your voice when you talk to yourself?

313
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:51,790
I'm sure you're frustrated too.

314
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,220
I know you're having a hard time.

315
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,740
If it were anyone else,
they wouldn't have survived a single day.

316
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,290
Only you could have gotten through it

317
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,870
and I got through it because of you.

318
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,110
That's why I'm thankful to you.

319
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,490
I don't deserve any of this

320
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:20,160
but you trusted me,
and stayed by my side...

321
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,150
and looked out for me.

322
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,680
I feel burdened
now that you've told me that.

323
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,390
I'm okay. Really. Don't worry.

324
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:44,430
Okay. Then to celebrate that you're okay

325
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,790
here's a new lipstick color.

326
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,290
Pardon?

327
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:52,030
Oh, it's Prosecutor Yoon.

328
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:55,770
Yes, Prosecutor Yoon.
Why didn't you come here yourself?

329
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:59,580
Why do you sound like that?
Is something the matter?

330
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,110
Something went wrong.

331
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:10,060
Choi Tae Ho got out.

332
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:34,170
Hide out somewhere
until things settle down.

333
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,980
Yes, I understand.

334
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:47,970
Let's go.

335
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:59,440
Should I congratulate you?
You're finally free.

336
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,380
- It was all thanks to you.
- What will you do now?

337
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,070
Are you going to cause trouble again?

338
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,490
No.

339
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,020
I will live quietly.

340
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,490
Can I trust you?

341
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:18,600
This time, you managed to get out...

342
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,370
but this can always
come back to bite you in the future.

343
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:25,430
<i>But I'm sure you know better than I do.</i>

344
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:28,860
Keep yourself under control. Okay?

345

<i>Jang Do Pal confessed
that he committed the crime alone.</i>

346
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,570
And Choi Tae Ho...

347
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,670
said he did what he was told to do
because he was threatened.

348
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,580
Wait...

349
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,440
What does... What does that mean?

350
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,780
After what Tae Ho did...

351
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,770
Are Jang Do Pal and the prosecution
out of their minds?

352
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:03,880
<i>Lee Jae Joon helped,
and the prosecutor...</i>

353
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:07,670

by declaring a war.

354
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,140

355
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,150

Why do they keep targeting us?

368
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:02,560
But, I was thinking...

369
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,990
Don't you think making Ra Bong Hee
a culprit was too harsh?

370
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:11,340
- Even if we want to find Seo Joon Oh--
- We have no choice.

371

Regarding Yoon So Hee's murder

396
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:28,040
are you intending to carry out
a fake investigation?

397
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,490
What? This punk...

398
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,820
Prosecutor Yoon! I mean, Mr. Yoon.

399
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:37,480
- You are the one with plans.
- Me?

400
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,160
It just seems like you're trying to end
Choi Tae Ho, no matter what. Am I wrong?

401
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,860
You are the one who wants to target
Seo Joon Oh, so what are you saying?

402
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,710
And you let Choi Tae Ho go
for that reason.

403
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:52,110
Hey, Yoon Tae Young! You should
just leave quietly. What is all this?

404
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:56,460
Fake investigation? Is it fake
and targeted if it doesn't go your way?

405
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,150
Fine, I was ready to resign,
so I'm okay with leaving

406
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:03,740
but things won't go your way
just because I'm gone.

407
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:08,170
I will continue to use the skills
I learned here when I get out.

408
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:12,650

It's just as you'd think. She looks like
someone who'd possess men.

414

How could she shamelessly roam around

have done this in the first place.

I mean, how could she dare
to mess around with our Tae Ho?

00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:54,750
Shouldn't we report her?
Are they offering a reward?

A reward? I wonder.

00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:08,670
- Wasn't that girl on the news?
- You mean that murder case?

- Should we stop contacting Joon Oh?
- Maybe for the time being.

434
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,970
Yeah, Ki Joon. Yeah, Bong Hee went home.

435
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:57,480

441
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:24,820
That's right. I heard a small girl
was his accomplice.

Hey! You... How dare you?

Hey.

461
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,550

00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,890
How did this happen?

466
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,080
No, Mom.

467
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,810
This will pass like a storm.
It will pass.

468
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:57,800
When it's over,
everyone will find out the truth.

They'll find out
Seo Joon Oh and I... are innocent.

Where did your stubbornness come from?

471
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:10,380
I'm the daughter
of a strong woman with a kind heart.

472
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,520

473
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,160
Mom. I'm hungry.

474
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,530
I haven't eaten a single meal.

475
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,620
How about we mix your warm rice
with red pepper paste and vegetables?

476
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,930
- Can you eat at a time like this?
- Yeah.

477
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:36,880
Now that we're here,
let's give it our all until the end.

478
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,560
Tell that punk for me.

479
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,470
If he doesn't settle this properly,
I'll scold him terribly.

480
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:47,410
Seo Joon Oh is very grateful to you.

481
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,990
Whatever.

482
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,590
- Mom, where are you going?
- How many spoonfuls of red pepper paste?

483
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,530
Three spoonfuls!

484
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:11,790
I went to visit Jang Do Pal yesterday

485
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,850
but I couldn't see him.

486
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:17,810
When I asked, they said
he hasn't seen anyone yet.

487
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:20,790
Why? Is he afraid he'll be swayed?

488
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:23,160
<i>Maybe. It's probably because</i>

489
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,700
<i>he has a lot to think about
after letting Choi Tae Ho go free.</i>

490
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:34,190
It'll be hard to visit him
until Choi Tae Ho makes a move.

491
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:39,930
We have a lot of time now.
Let's try to get both of them.

492
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:44,750
Do you think you can find a way?

493
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:50,320
There's nothing we can't do.
The hard part is to endure it until then.

494
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,270

00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:12,090
You scared me.

497
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,610
How did you pick up before it even rang?

498
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:19,260
Hey, I called you so many times.
Don't you check your phone?

499
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,780
You did?

500
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,730
Is everything all right at home?

501
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,320
I guess you read the news.

502
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,790
I'm okay, Seo Joon Oh.

503
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,450
Yeah right.

504
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,770
Tell your mother...

505
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:51,780
that I'll apologize to her personally
after I settle things in Seoul.

506
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,430
You don't need to worry about that.

507
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,220
Instead of worrying about that...

508
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,870
make sure you stay well hidden.

509
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:03,450
Hey, I'm hiding. Don't worry about me.

510
00:42:03,450 --> 00:42:06,210
I'm just worried about you.

511
00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:10,760
<i>I'm doing fine too,
so don't worry about me either.</i>

512
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,760
I'll go back to Seoul tomorrow.

513
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,600
Hey, why so soon? Stay there for
a little longer. You'll only suffer here.

514
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:23,130
But you're so bored without me.

515
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:25,500
Yeah, that's true.

516
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,550
I'll go back tomorrow.

517
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,040
- Bong Hee.
- Yes?

518
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,850
Come back soon.

519
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,630
Yes.

520
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:05,410
<i>[You should have died on the island.]</i>

521
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:25,190
- Bong Hee?
- Yeah, Mom.

522
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:28,170
Wait, what about food?

523
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,610
It's okay, Mom. I'm not hungry.

524
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:38,510
You have to eat
if you want to get anything done.

525
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,950
Bong Hee.

526
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:55,730
Are you confident
you can trust him until the end?

527
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:57,190
Mom.

528
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:01,950
If you want to trust and cheer
for someone other than yourself

529
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:04,550
you have to be stronger yourself.

530
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:07,530
Can you do that?

531
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,740
Mom.

532
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,080
Why are you so faint of heart?

533
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,470
Thank you, Mom.

534
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:23,180
Thank you.

535
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,660
Come here.

536
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,070
Me... Me?

537
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,140
- You have your phone, right?
- Yes, I do.

538
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,730
Hand it over.

539
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,970
Yeah, Byung Joo.

540
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,630
It's me, Joon Oh.

541
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:17,340
Huh? I don't remember
having a friend like you.

542
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,820
Why did you call me?

543
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,570
We used to call each other often.

544
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:25,620
- Things sure have changed a lot.
- What bullshit.

545
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:30,720
Hey, I don't want to hear your voice. I'm
hanging up if you don't get to the point.

546
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,260
<i>Joon Oh.</i>

547
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:36,620
<i>I didn't want to push it this far either.</i>

548
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:42,200
I'm human too. It hurts me
seeing you become more pathetic.

549
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:46,750
That's why you should just give up.

550
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:50,170
You have to give up for the people
around you to live in peace.

551
00:45:51,810 --> 00:45:54,360
That's what I wanted to tell you.

552
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,600
Sir! Sir!

553
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,210
We're in trouble!

554
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:16,110
I found Ra Bong Hee.
She's on her way to Seoul.

555
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:19,690
Yes. Bring her here
as soon as she arrives.

556
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:23,510
They issued an arrest warrant
for Ra Bong Hee.

557
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:28,600
It seems like Lee Jae Joon
is finally lashing out.

558
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,230
<i>[Prosecutor Yoon]</i>

559
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:04,670
She's not answering.
I think she's on her way.

560
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:09,220
But Ra Bong Hee doesn't know anything.
Shouldn't we go and find her?

561
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:18,970
What are you planning to do?
They're doing this to draw you out.

562
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:21,030
I know. But how can I sit back
and do nothing?

563
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:22,690
Don't do this.

564
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:26,910
- Let's think about this--
- What is there to think about?

565
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:32,500
Bong Hee did nothing wrong,
but she's going to be arrested, so...

566
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:36,110
I need to prevent this from happening.

567
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:11,900
<i>[Prosecutor Yoon]</i>

568
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,990
Is Bong Hee still not answering?

569
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:11,050
Sir, I'll look for Seo Joon Oh.

570
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,490
Wait, excuse me! Wait a minute.

571
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,120
Here.

572
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,270
Oh.

573
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:55,830
Yes, thank you.

574
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,150
<i>[Prosecutor Yoon]</i>
Ra Bong Hee!

575
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:26,630
Why are you doing this?

576
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:30,490
Where are we going? Let go of me!

577
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:33,600
- I told you to let go!
- Let's talk when we get there.

578
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,170
Let go of me! Why are you doing this?

579
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:38,660
- Let's go.
- Who are you?

580
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:46,920
Let her go for now. Attract attention
and you'll be caught too.

581
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,760
Get out of our way!

582
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:59,310
Control yourself! If you
butt in now, you'll both be caught.

583
00:50:59,310 --> 00:51:01,400
You won't be able to help her!

584
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:06,200
If you want to save her,
you have to be patient.

585
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:15,740
Let's get out of here
before a bigger problem arises.

586
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,870
I'll ask Byung Joo to take your car.

587
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:30,050
We have to be very careful right now.
It'll be problematic if you get caught.

588
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,370
What happens now?

589
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,950
Now that Bong Hee has been taken...

590
00:51:40,290 --> 00:51:42,500
what happens now?

591
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:49,670
<i>When she see Lee Jae Joon,
he'll ask her for your location.</i>

592
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,690
<i>He'll try to make a deal with her.</i>

593
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:01,800
<i>He'll tell her that he'll let her go
if she tells him where you are.</i>

594
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,900
<i>And he'll ask her where you are.</i>

595
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,210
<i>Repeatedly, until she talks.</i>

596
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:12,930
<i>He has to harass Bong Hee
if he wants to catch you.</i>

597
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:17,800
<i>He'll drag it out...</i>

598
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:22,580
until the person looking in
turns himself in.

599
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:29,270
<i>Where is Seo Joon Oh?</i>

600
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,060
I don't know.

601
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:36,840
<i>This will only make it
worse for you.</i>

602
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,250
<i>You should talk, Ra Bong Hee.</i>

603
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:46,090
You can leave if you just tell me
where Seo Joon Oh is.

604
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,400
Are you really going to act like this?

605
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:02,420
Fine. Let's wait and see who wins.

606
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:34,600
Are you serious?

607
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:37,410
Yes.

608
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,740
No matter how much I think about it,
this isn't right.

609
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,240
I don't think I can do this any longer.

610
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:08,010
You may leave.

611
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,820
What's going on?

612
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:35,780
Why was I released, Prosecutor Yoon?

613
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,110
<i>It was a choice Seo Joon Oh made.</i>

614
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,620
I can't let this happen, Prosecutor Yoon.
I can't.

615
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:11,960
<i>Even if you think I'm crazy,
I have no choice.</i>

616
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:14,880
There's only one way.

617
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,650
I'll turn myself in.

618
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:29,220
Wow, Seo Joon Oh.
It's so hard to see your face.

619
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:38,360
Since you came here yourself,
let's make a masterpiece together.

620
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:45,340
<i>You should have stopped him.</i>

621
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,610
You were the one who didn't want
the prosecution to be involved.

622
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:51,770
Yet you just let him go?

623
00:55:51,770 --> 00:55:56,900
If he went there without a plan,
it'll be over for him. What do we do?

624
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,850
<i>Seo Joon Oh. Look here.</i>

625
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:10,930
How many hours has it been?
You have only told us your name.

626
00:56:10,930 --> 00:56:13,440
Why aren't you answering my questions?

627
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,250
Didn't you come here to cooperate?

628
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:21,210
Geez, seriously.

629
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,650
- Still?
- Yes.

630
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:25,480
It's been six hours.

631
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:28,240
What does he think he's doing?

632
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:58,020
What is that bastard doing? Look at this.

633
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:05,830
<i>[Water.]</i>

634
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,860
He's a total nutjob.

635
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:15,820
<i>First, don't say anything.</i>

636
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:19,300
Don't give them any reaction,
no matter what they do.

637
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,930
They will talk to you.

638
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:25,130
You had a fun time with your food.
Are you full?

639
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:27,900
Let's be quick about this.

640
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,610
What was your motive
for killing Yoon So Hee?

641
00:57:30,610 --> 00:57:35,530
I heard Yoon So Hee
called you a murderer. Is that true?

642
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:40,940
You're going to keep doing this?
When will you stop?

643
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:45,290
You walked in here
on your own two feet.

644
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:47,180
So why aren't you talking?

645
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:50,020
Dragging it out won't make it
better for you!

646
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:53,440
Do you think this will stop me
from putting you behind bars?

647
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:59,540
What is it that you want?
Why aren't you talking?

648
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:03,070
<i>At this point, you will say one thing.</i>

649
00:58:03,070 --> 00:58:06,830
The most tempting proposal
to Lee Jae Joon's ears.

650
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,910
I'll start talking.

651
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:14,480
If you do me a favor.

652
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:16,460
A favor?

653
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:20,130
Jang Do Pal. Let me see him.

654
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:22,300
Why do you want to see him?

655
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:26,610
If I let you see him,
what will I get out of it?

656
00:58:26,610 --> 00:58:30,280
There's only one thing you want,
isn't there? Who knows?

657
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,430
If you let me see him, I might...

658
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:37,570
do you a favor in return.

659
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:43,760
For Lee Jae Joon, nothing is
more important than your confession

660
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,250
so he'll let you see Jang Do Pal
at least once.

661
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,730
You ordered him to kill
Hwang Jae Gook, didn't you?

662
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:57,290
Where did you hide him?

663
00:58:57,290 --> 00:58:59,980
The guy who tried to kill him!

664
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:02,260
Talk!

665
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:06,300
Jang Do Pal will feel a lot of pressure.

666
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:11,060
The prosecution is doing everything
they can to find his associate.

667
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,750
Where are we going?

668
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,400
If that guy is caught, Hwang Jae Gook's
case will come into the light as well

669
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,880
which means he'll spend
the rest of his years in jail.

670
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:29,260
But Jang Do Pal shut his mouth
and is refusing to say anything.

671
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:31,180
What could that mean?

672
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:33,980
That means he put his trust in someone.

673
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:37,890
It can only be Choi Tae Ho,
who left under an agreement.

674
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,590
He agreed to take care of it instead.

675
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:43,890
Then...

676
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:48,230
that means I need to split those two up?

677
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:54,880
It's your job to win Jang Do Pal
over to our side.

678
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,570
<i>We're not certain of anything.</i>

679
01:00:09,570 --> 01:00:13,260
<i>That's why it won't be easy.</i>

680
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:17,990
Geez, what is that on your head?

681
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,600
- You look good.
- Why did you want to see me?

682
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:26,790
Do you think it'll be okay
to leave them alone like this?

683
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:29,060
Turn up the volume.

684
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,750
<i>Have you been doing well?</i>

685
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:34,110
I feel at ease because
I have nothing to worry about.

686
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:39,370
It's more like you're generous.
You've even in jail for Tae Ho.

687
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:41,050
If...

688
01:00:42,610 --> 01:00:45,370
If you're trying to
get something out of me--

689
01:00:45,370 --> 01:00:47,090
What about Tae Ho?

690
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,080
Does he come to visit you?

691
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,460
Do you know what Tae Ho
has been doing out there?

692
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:59,880
- Do I have to know that?
- Geez, of course you should.

693
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:07,230
You should be curious if you confessed
to a crime in return for a favor.

694
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,230
But do you think Tae Ho
will do you that favor?

695
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:26,180
Even if you're willing
to get your hands dirty for Tae Ho

696
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:29,990
Tae Ho would never do that for you.

697
01:01:29,990 --> 01:01:33,310
It seems like he already
forgot about your favor.

698
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:36,500
I'm not sure what you're saying.

699
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,950
I never asked for a favor--

700
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:40,800
But CEO Hwang...

701
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:44,920
can speak now.

702
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:54,180
So? What do you want me
to do about it?

703
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:56,920
I don't know why I'm listening to this.

704
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,180
What is he doing?

705
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,870
- Do you trust Choi Tae Ho that much?
- Let go!

706
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:05,680
- Get out there! Hurry!
- Yes!

707
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,300
- What is this bastard doing?
- Open the door!

708
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,160
Hurry up and open it!

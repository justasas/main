00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,760
<i>We found out when we were
reinvestigating Shin Jae Hyun's case.</i>

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,250
<i>Yoon So Hee, who testified at the time</i>

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,530
<i>there was record of her statement saying
that she had evidence that it was murder.</i>

5
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:27,270
Look at this. Look at it!

6
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,370
<i>It started then. I've known Yoon So Hee
since they were secretly dating.</i>

7
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,600
<i>We asked the police officer
who was responsible for this case</i>

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,370
<i>and he said So Hee
did give that statement</i>

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,690
<i>but she ultimately insisted
that Seo Joon Oh was the murderer</i>

10
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,960
so her statements were inconsistent.

11
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,820
You can't forget him.
You killed Jae Hyun.

12
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:53,890
We'll die anyway!

13
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,900
Whether we starve to death or someone
kills us, we're going to die here!

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,560
<i>So Hee was probably
threatened by Jang Do Pal.</i>

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,790
That's why she changed her story.

16
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,200
Because she knew
about Jae Hyun's murder...

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,280
In the end...

18
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,960
That's why, in order to find out
the truth about So Hee's death

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,010
we must catch the murderer
who killed Shin Jae Hyun.

20
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,370
That's how we can clear
your false charges as well.

21
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,830
<i>A package will land in Korea
very shortly.</i>

22
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,940
<i>The lost items that were found
on the deserted island.</i>

23
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,300
<i>In with that stuff,
I found something that looked familiar.</i>

24
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,730
These are the pictures I received.

25
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,710
Seo Joon Oh.

26
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,860
Isn't this the cell phone that Ji Ah
was waving in the cave?

27
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,840
This was So Hee's cell phone.

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,260
- It's no longer here.
- I'm here because you said it was here!

29
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,470
It's not here. Someone picked it up.

30
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,280
The lost items from the deserted island
have arrived. What should we do?

31
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,750
Do I still look like Chairwoman Jo
to you?

32
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,400
Don't ask me that.
Get rid of them! Burn them!

33
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,760
Let's find that cell phone.

34
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,290
<i>Let's bring it back here!</i>

35
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,220
Okay.

36
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,810
Let's find it.

37
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:48,000
<i>[Lost Articles]</i>

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,750
Beloved citizens of Seowon!
I'm your candidate, Jo Hee Kyung!

39
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,180
- We must change everything--
- Jo Hee Kyung! Jo Hee Kyung!

40
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,330
Everything must change!

41
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,420
Thank you! Yes! Yes! Thank you! Oh.

42
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,740
Oh my. Oh my! Grandmother!
Yes, thank you.

43
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,090
- Yes, please vote for me.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

44
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,560
- Oh! You're here!
- Yes. Yes.

45
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,960
Yes, thank you. Yes.

46
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,840
I love these vegetable side dishes,
especially bellflower root.

47
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,020
These aren't bellflower root.
These are chicken feet!

48
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,090
Do you eat these as side dishes as well?

49
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,100
Of course! They're delicious!
Here you go, please try some.

50
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,290
- No, that's okay.
- They're delicious!

51
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:53,140
- Oh, Congresswoman Jo, please use this.
- Oh, no. It's okay!

52
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,720
Let's take a picture together! Oh my!
Here. Here.

53
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,880
Oh! Oh my! Oh my! What do we do?

54
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:06,730
- Yes, please get some rest.
- Oh, yes. You worked hard today.

55
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,950
Gosh, I could die.

56
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,270
<i>Have you been well, ma'am?</i>

57
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,610
Oh my, who is this?
It's been a long time.

58
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,860
You must be busy
preparing for your election.

59
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,650
Oh, you know. An extra body
wouldn't be enough at this point.

60
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,690
But, I'm sure you're not calling me
to cheer me on.

61
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,020
Okay, what is this about?

62
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,990
Your team should have gotten
a package. Did you receive it?

63
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:00,840
A package? What package?

64
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,410
You know, the lost items that
the survivors used on the island.

65
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,630
<i>It should have arrived by now.</i>

66
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,990
Lost items?

67
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,180
I'm not sure about any lost items.

68
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,920
I haven't received anything like that.

69
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,840
<i>You'll receive it soon. I know
because I tracked the package.</i>

70
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,170
Wait, Prosecutor Yoon. It's been
so long since that case closed...

71
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:35,110
And, our team dispersed,
so it might not even come here.

72
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,740
Your team dispersed,
but the case isn't closed yet.

73
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,080
Wait, does that package contain
something that belonged to Yoon So Hee?

74
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,410
Don't you understand how rude it is
to act like I have something of yours?

75
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,830
If you look in the package,
you will find a white cell phone.

76
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,860
<i>That's all I want to see.</i>

77
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,180
It was So Hee's.

78
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,640
Hey, Prosecutor Yoon.

79
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,460
I have to get back out there
for my campaign

80
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,890
so I'll call you back after I check.

81
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,950
Gosh, what is this about?

82
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,470
<i>The number you have dialed
is unavailable--</i>

83
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,600
This case is still holding me back,
even after the team dispersed.

84
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,960
Geez, why isn't anything working out?

85
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,530
Yes, what happened last night?
The items that she told you to burn...

86
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,700
Did you burn them already?

87
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,670
Did you actually burn them already?

88
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,650
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

89
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,340
Open the trunk!

90
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,240
Why did you have to do
exactly as you were told?

91
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,030
They were actually going to burn
everything because I told them to?

92
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,230
Well, you told me not to talk
about it again, so...

93
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,010
He said this was Yoon So Hee's.

94
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,570
- I guess she liked antique things.
- What do you mean?

95
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:25,910
That is a really old model.

96
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:32,370
It's not turning on.
He's probably going to be here soon.

97
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,540
We need to know what's on it,
before he arrives.

98
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,720
Let me see.

99
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,620
Because this is such an old model,
unless the battery is dead

100
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,540
I don't know if it can be fixed.

101
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,520
Who should we bring this to?

102
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,230
Bong Hee, I'm on my way
to meet Jo Hee Kyung.

103
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,820
I think it'll be best if I meet
with her on my own first.

104
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,110
Where are you two?

105
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,100
Oh, there's somewhere we need to go.

106
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,460
Is Bong Hee busy with something?
Why are you answering her phone?

107
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,930
- Bong Hee is driving right now.
<i>- Turn right.</i>

108
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,940
My license is suspended,
as you probably know.

109
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,220
Prosecutor Yoon, we're on our way
to meet Byung Joo--

110
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,220
We can't meet you.

111
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,210
No, we'll be there soon!
Please find the cell phone! Good luck!

112
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,190
You too!

113
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,940
- Bong Hee, why aren't you turning right?
- Yes, right.

114
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,550
<i>- Please make a U-turn.</i>
- Make a U-turn up there.

115
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,860
- A U-turn?
- Who are they? Do you know them?

116
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,750
Yeah, prepare the cars.
Tell everyone to gather.

117
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,770
We're going to Seowon.

118
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,190
You there. Who are you?

119
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,110
Geez.

120
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,550
It's me. CEO Jang, can you see me?

121
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,770
- How long have you been there?
- It's not that. There's so much dust!

122
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:16,620
You see, I have germophobia. I was
going to clean while you are away.

123
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,690
People say, the right hand should work
so that the left hand doesn't notice.

124
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,280
That's what I'm doing. I'm actually
on the small side, but you saw me.

125
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,290
Geez, the left hand caught me.
I was caught.

126
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,690
Wait.

127
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,190
Yes?

128
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,090
Byung Joo.

129
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,740
It's okay.

130
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,660
After Tae Ho finishes his work today

131
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,350
make him loosen up and enjoy his night.

132
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:55,990
Whether you drink together, or play games

133
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,050
- do whatever.
- But why?

134
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,160
Why are you asking questions?
Just do as you're told.

135
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,040
But if I suggest this out of the blue

136
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,160
he'll scold me again.

137
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,130
He always curses at me, you see.

138
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,080
He's been working so hard

139
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:16,030
so you can just tell him
that I told him to take a break today.

140
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,350
There's that method, isn't there?

141
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,190
Thank you, CEO Jang.

142
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,500
Don't leave Tae Ho alone
until he goes home

143
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,550
- and then keep an eye on him.
- Yes.

144
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,940
And don't tell Tae Ho about
what we just talked about.

145
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,310
- Yes.
- If anything happens...

146
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,260
Call me right away.

147
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,390
Yes. Don't worry, CEO Jang.

148
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,340
While I was in America,
my name was "Mark."

149
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,330
Your source of income
is under my control.

150
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:51,760
- Yes.
- Remember that.

151
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,660
- Why Seowon?
- I'm not sure either.

152
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,280
But Jang Do Pal just rushed out
with his guys.

153
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:08,310
But Prosecutor Yoon said
Jo Hee Kyung's district is Seowon.

154
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,090
Is that why Jang Do Pal went there?

155
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,840
Yes, but it's strange that Jang Do Pal
told me not to tell Choi Tae Ho.

156
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,670
Is it because Choi Tae Ho could worry?

157
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:20,290
But that only happens between
married couples who worry--

158
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:24,110
Hey, who cares?
Anyway, Byung Joo, we're counting on you.

159
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:29,270
Tell me everything that Jang Do Pal
and Choi Tae Ho talk about. I told you.

160
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,950
You're small and compact,
so no one can see you.

161
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,550
That's the most important advantage
for a spy.

162
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,120
But, I don't think
I'm as small as we thought.

163
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,960
- What are you saying?
- I was seen earlier.

164
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,280
- Who saw you?
- Jang Do Pal. I was taken aback.

165
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,920
He was probably mistaken!

166
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,310
Make yourself smaller! Try it out.

167
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,680
Try it! Byung Joo, where are you?
Byung Joo, where are you?

168
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,890
- Byung Joo! Have you seen him?
- I can't see him!

169
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,190
- Byung Joo!
- Here I am!

170
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,310
You scared me! See?

171
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,560
Okay. If it means you will return

172
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,240
I will do my best to make myself smaller.

173
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,880
Wait.

174
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,410
What's that?

175
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,960
- It's time to pick up Choi Tae Ho.
- Get out.

176
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,320
Yes.

177
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,940
- Bong Hee, see you later.
- Eat this.

178
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,080
Try to make yourself really small!

179
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:25,100
Hey, you'd better not buy me a hamburger
with bacon in it next time!

180
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,930
Be careful!

181
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,840
Are you worried?

182
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:37,370
Byung Joo is half the size he was before.
He must have been on a diet.

183
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,960
I really can't see him. He'll be fine.

184
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,570
He'll be okay, right?

185
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,670
Yes, very good!

186
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,180
Yes, nice!

187
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,400
Yes.

188
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,220
Yes.

189
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,740
Okay, look this way!

190
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,510
Yes, very good!

191
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,400
I'll check something before we resume!

192
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,250
Ji Ah, water.

193
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,300
Give me that.

194
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,920
Ji Ah.

195
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,350
It looks like Ki Joon is misunderstanding

196
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,990
but he should know how to differentiate
personal life from work.

197
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,930
I'll talk to CEO Jang
and find you another manager.

198
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,010
I'm just thinking of you.

199
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,150
Give us a moment.

200
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,490
- You want me to change managers?
- Yeah.

201
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,200
You damned son of a bitch.

202
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,060
Do you know how much harm you
caused me already, you son of a bitch?

203
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:26,570
You have no right to talk after
killing people, you bastard. Shut up.

204
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,780
Lost items?

205
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,920
A cell phone?

206
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:08,620
<i>[I can't take your side]</i>

207
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:12,140
<i>[I'm letting you know just in case...]</i>

208
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,870
Why are you out here already?
Are you finished?

209
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,630
If you were going to act like this,
why did you let me work with him?

210
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,690
If you're having a hard time now,
how will you endure the movie?

211
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,550
What do you mean?

212
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,780
You left because you got mad
while watching our commercial shoot.

213
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,690
- Oh, that's not it...
- Then why did you leave?

214
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:38,310
What were you thinking about all day?

215
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:44,450
I can't express all of my feelings to you

216
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:48,250
because I want to protect you.
What am I saying? Let's go in.

217
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,650
Ki Joon.

218
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,060
You seem to have a lot of secrets
these days.

219
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,170
What kind of secrets could I have?
It's just that, these days...

220
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,310
It's because I'm so frustrated.
Geez, I'm so frustrated.

221
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,930
Excuse me!

222
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,490
Oh, what do we do? What do we do?

223
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,000
What's wrong?

224
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,950
- You can't go inside. Please wait here.
- Why? Why?

225
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,800
You can't go inside.

226
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,320
- Mrs. Hwang, what's the matter?
- I don't know! All of a sudden...

227
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,740
It looks like he has gotten through
the critical stage.

228
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,840
Thank you, Doctor.

229
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,170
- Let's talk outside.
- Yes.

230
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,680
CEO Hwang.

231
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,810
You were in critical condition.

232
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:19,560
But, you made it through.

233
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,290
Please, continue to hold on.

234
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,880
Don't give up, okay?

235
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,020
Don't leave me here by myself.

236
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,760
In order to save you...

237
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:40,140
I even betrayed Joon Oh.

238
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:47,750
He... He promised
not to hurt you anymore...

239
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,800
That's why I sold my soul to the devil.

240
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,940
I'm sorry.

241
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,910
CEO Hwang, if you leave like this,
I'll really be a bad guy.

242
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:04,620
CEO Hwang. Jae Gook. Don't give up.

243
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,470
You'll wake up, won't you?

244
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,540
You're going to wake up, right? Please.

245
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,250
Ho Hang. The doctor said he's all right.

246
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,240
Don't worry.

247
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:37,620
Mrs. Hwang. You must have been
shocked. Thank goodness...

248
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,270
If...

249
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,490
Mrs. Hwang, just a moment.

250
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,950
Hey, stop it already!

251
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,810
Be quiet! What if someone sees you?
Keep your hat on! Lift this up too.

252
00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:01,690
Geez, how far up? Lift it. Lift it.
Is that good? Is that good? How's that?

253
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:04,370
- Cover your eyes. Very nice.
- Hey, is this the right hospital?

254
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:07,570
It is. I've visited before.

255
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:17,000
- There's Secretary Tae. He came out.
- Where?

256
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,290
Hey, why aren't you stopping me?

257
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,380
Look at me. Okay, there.

258
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,210
That was strange.

259
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:30,150
I saw Joon Oh. It was definitely Joon Oh.

260
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,930
What the heck?

261
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,560
Joon Oh.

262
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,600
- Why aren't you stopping me?
- I didn't know you were going.

263
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,590
Wow, seriously.

264
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,260
Oh! Whoa! He's a ghost! He's a ghost!

265
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:47,940
Whoa! Whoa!
Ghost! No, there's no ghost!

266
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,300
Wow! That scared me.
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

267
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,210
Hello?

268
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,950
You've gotten weaker.

269
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,930
Our CEO Hwang.

270
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,610
Hold on for a little longer.

271
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,950
I'll catch them...

272
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,990
And expose the truth.

273
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:15,700
Seo Joon Oh! Seo Joon Oh!
Mrs. Hwang is coming. Hurry!

274
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,290
Tae Ho. Tae Ho?

275
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:51,470
Is there anything you want to do today?

276
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,820
Why?

277
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:59,370
I knew you would ask me why,
so I asked CEO Jang about it.

278
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:02,610
CEO Jang said you've been working
really hard recently

279
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:07,720
so he told me to take you out drinking,
or play games with you at your house.

280
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,560
Why would I drink with you?

281
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,340
And, play games with me?

282
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,050
Does it look like I have no one
to play games with besides you?

283
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,040
Just take me home.

284
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,140
Okay.

285
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,550
<i>[Choi Tae Ho is home.]</i>

286
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,790
What are you doing here
in broad daylight?

287
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:08,140
- Are you guarding my house for robbers?
- No...

288
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,890
Then... are you spying on me?

289
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,330
No.

290
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,060
- Did CEO Jang tell you to do this?
- No.

291
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,970
<i>[Choi Tae Ho is home.
Oh no, we're in trouble...]</i>

292
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,630
<i>[Choi Tae Ho is home.
Oh no, we're in trouble...]</i>

293
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,840
Put that phone down and drive.

294
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:08,560
Geez, seriously.

295
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,260
If I want to survive,
whose side do I need to take? Seriously.

296
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,540
I'm so conflicted.
Choi Tae Ho or Jang Do Pal?

297
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:22,000
Geez, I'm so conflicted.
Whose side should I take?

298
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,480
Oh! Take this.

299
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,680
Why don't you offer him some tea?

300
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:35,370
- Yes, what kind of tea would you like?
- That's okay. Thank you.

301
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,090
- Congresswoman Jo.
- I'm fine too!

302
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,250
Oh.

303
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,840
Did you look for the package?

304
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,940
Oh, that? I was informed about it.

305
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:57,130
I received it...

306
00:25:57,130 --> 00:26:01,180
But it was evidence
that should be sent to the prosecution.

307
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,940
It's not something I can just give you.
You know that.

308
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,810
You're saying...

309
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:11,210
You won't let me look at an item
that belonged to my deceased sister?

310
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,890
Ma'am.

311
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,580
Are you really going to act like this?

312
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:19,060
I want to show it to you too.

313
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,060
Look here, former chairwoman
of the special investigation committee!

314
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:25,520
You weren't even interested in those
items until I told you about them!

315
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,350
You didn't know it was So Hee's phone,
or where those items came from!

316
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:32,900
But now that I want to see it, it's
suddenly evidence for the prosecution?

317
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,590
Why are you trying so hard
when you already know how things work?

318
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:43,100
It's quite unfortunate,
but there's nothing I can do for you.

319
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,990
As you can see, this was a short break
from my election campaign.

320
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:51,940
You've never lost a loved one, have you?

321
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,670
To me, that cell phone...

322
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,140
is the only item that my sister
left behind.

323
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:06,360
Her will could be on that phone,
and the truth could be on it as well.

324
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:12,470
And the person who will expose the truth,
the person who must see the evidence

325
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:17,060
is not the prosecution,
it's Yoon So Hee's brother.

326
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,100
It's me, Yoon Tae Young.

327
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,590
What kind of place do you think this is?

328
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:30,820
This isn't the special investigation
base! This is my election headquarters!

329
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,510
Do I really need to listen
to everything you say while we're here?

330
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,900
Even if you don't show it to me,
there are other ways.

331
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:45,030
I'll make myself clear.
You made a mistake today.

332
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,960
Why did you do that?

333
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,690
I thought you intended
to show him Yoon So Hee's phone.

334
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,440
<i>Last night, the CEO
of Legend Entertainment came to customs</i>

335
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,160
<i>and demanded that we tell them
where the lost items went.</i>

336
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,000
<i>I thought you should know.</i>

337
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,110
Just leave it.
Let's wait and see for a little longer.

338
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:17,090
Geez, she's strange. She doesn't need
those items and they are important to us.

339
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,470
Does she think we won't see them
if she doesn't let us?

340
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,620
<i>There are many people
going in and out of her headquarters</i>

341
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,430
<i>so I'm pretty sure it isn't there.</i>

342
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:29,210
<i>Let's go to the hotel. There's a place
where she rests between appearances.</i>

343
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,840
Yes. Go to the hotel.
Okay. We'll head that way.

344
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,870
Is there another way, Seo Joon Oh?

345
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,500
Bong Hee, the only way is for you
to drive faster.

346
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,120
I'm driving fast already!

347
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,710
If you're going to be like this,
I'll take a taxi. Give me 10,000 won.

348
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,820
<i>CEO Jang. Yes, it's Byung Joo.</i>

349
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,920
Tae Ho is on his way over there
right now.

350
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,120
Yes, I thought you should know.
That's why I called.

351
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:05,530
Tae Ho, what brings you here?

352
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,980
Why?

353
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:13,060
Am I somewhere I shouldn't be?

354
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,130
Hey, no way.

355
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:19,700
It's just that I told you to rest,
for your own good, but here you are.

356
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,210
You wanted me to rest
but had someone watching me?

357
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,440
That doesn't make any sense.

358
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,240
So?

359
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,590
Is there something
I'm not supposed to find out?

360
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,610
Wait outside.

361
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,900
Tae Ho.

362
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:58,640
The lost items from
the deserted island arrived.

363
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,880
Inside one of those boxes...

364
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,200
is So Hee's cell phone.

365
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,130
It's in Jo Hee Kyung's hands right now.

366
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,450
But...

367
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,300
Why are you telling me this now?

368
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,360
I didn't tell you because I wasn't sure
if there was any evidence in those boxes.

369
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,580
And because it's Jo Hee Kyung,
I feel cautious about jumping in.

370
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,940
I was going to check first--

371
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,350
Now that I know about it,
let's check together.

372
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:29,780
Whether there's something in there
or not, I have to know.

373
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:37,490
Sure. For me, it's always reassuring
to have you around.

374
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,510
<i>Jae Hyun!</i>

375
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,690
Let's talk.

376
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:53,550
You already know.
What else is there to talk about?

377
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:57,760
This won't change my mind.

378
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,740
You were doing so well. What's wrong?

379
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,420
Dreamers has just started to do well.
If you help us a little more--

380
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:27,180
Then, should I work in the background
behind your success

381
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:31,500
and... live as a shadow?

382
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,990
Jae Hyun.

383
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,590
Is it because you need money?

384
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,720
If it is, I'll talk to CEO Hwang--

385
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,510
Hey, you!

386
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:46,700
Do you think I'm a money-hungry gangster?

387
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:52,240
If you're going to give me that
bullshit, go. I don't want to hear it.

388
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:03,250
Tell me what you want.
I'll give you anything, if you stay.

389
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,560
Who do you think you are?

390
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,380
You don't even know how to sing,
so how can you help me?

391
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,320
Instead of wasting your time
holding on to me

392
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,370
go and practice your singing.
That will be more helpful to you.

393
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:25,090
- You're speaking too carelessly.
- No.

394
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:28,160
If I compare this to how you treated me,
I'm not being careless at all.

395
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,190
What did I do that was so wrong?

396
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:33,240
Didn't I treat you well,
if all you did was lend me your voice?

397
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,040
All I did was lend you a voice?

398
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,640
Fine.

399
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:42,070
This voice will quietly disappear.

400
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,060
So I wish you all the best
in your future.

401
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,320
I'll be watching to see how well you do.

402
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,920
Do you feel like you can say anything
because I praised you?

403
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,570
Do you think I'll be doomed without you?

404
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,160
Let go! Let go! Let go!

405
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:24,180
I just want the best for us.

406
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:29,320
I'm sorry, okay? Jae Hyun.

407
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,940
- Geez, seriously!
- I stopped gently.

408
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,210
Let's go.

409
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,290
Whoa.

410
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,060
Hey! What are you doing?

411
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,730
Yes, I'm coming! I'm coming, Seo Joon Oh!

412
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,630
- Hey.
- Yes?

413
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,700
- What's with you? What are you doing?
- What do you mean?

414
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,290
Why are you putting on makeup?

415
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:28,040
We're entering a hotel,
but I look so tacky and untidy...

416
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,750
Hey, who cares?
We're just going to a hotel.

417
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:35,440
- Is this your first time?
- Yes.

418
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,420
Wow, that's so like you.

419
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:43,270
You did so many things
for the first time after meeting me.

420
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:45,710
You were lucky to meet a good artist.

421
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,340
I let you go on a plane
and took you to a hotel.

422
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:52,300
You should be thankful to me, okay?
Give that to me.

423
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,230
- What are you doing?
- Come here.

424
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,670
- No, that's okay--
- Come here so we can go!

425
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,650
Like this. Pucker up.

426
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,790
More!

427
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,390
You messed it up, didn't you?
You rubbed it all over, didn't you?

428
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,450
No, you look pretty.

429
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,780
- Pardon?
- You look pretty.

430
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,230
Wait for me, Seo Joon Oh!

431
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:45,290
- Bong Hee, where are you?
<i>- We're in front of the hotel.</i>

432
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,820
<i>We're going inside right now.</i>

433
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,940
Choi Tae Ho and Jang Do Pal's guys
are scattered around the hotel.

434
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,800
This goes for Seo Joon Oh too,
but if he sees you

435
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,150
he'll get suspicious,
so be careful not to get caught.

436
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:02,240
I'll go upstairs and reserve a room.

437
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,660
You should take off your shoes
when you enter a hotel.

438
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:18,250
- What are you doing? Take them off!
- Okay, I'm taking them off.

439
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,940
I'm not stupid, you know!

440
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:26,120
Happy? Huh?

441
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,520
Hey, you were really rude.
What do you mean, "Happy? Happy?"

442
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,800
Hurry up, Seo Joon Oh!

443
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,470
Wow, seriously!

444
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,520
15th floor. Go!

445
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,400
Hey, this is your first time
in a hotel elevator, isn't it?

446
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,890
There are people like that. Go! Go! Go!

447
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,710
15th floor!

448
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,700
Oh, does it detect sound?
It's not working.

449
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,170
- 15th!
- 15!

450
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,390
15th... 15th floor.

451
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,180
Wait!

452
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,310
Oh.

453
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:11,280
Oh! Aren't you Choi Tae Ho? I'm a huge
fan! Please give me your autograph.

454
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,060
Thank you. I'm sorry.

455
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,710
Since Jang Do Pal
and Choi Tae Ho are on the move

456
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:24,820
I am certain
they're after So Hee's phone.

457
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,950
I'm not sure exactly
what is on that phone

458
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,440
but it's clear there's something
that they're trying to hide.

459
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,620
Earlier, Byung Joo said Jang Do Pal was
coming here behind Choi Tae Ho's back.

460
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,970
- He thought it was strange.
- Is that so?

461
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,570
<i>I can't be on your side,
but I'm telling you this, just in case.</i>

462
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,990
<i>Jang Do Pal asked Ji Ah
whose phone it was.</i>

463
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:53,830
<i>He seems to be sensitive about So Hee's
things because of Choi Tae Ho.</i>

464
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:57,450
<i>I'm letting you know in case this can be
helpful in clearing your false charges.</i>

465
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,010
<i>No need to thank me.</i>

466
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,440
<i>There's no need to refuse my thanks.</i>

467
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:06,540
<i>I'm already here to find that cell phone.
Wow, you've gotten slow.</i>

468
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,770
<i>If you're that slow,
I don't think you can work with me.</i>

469
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:13,710
<i>I hope you live happily ever after
with Jang Do Pal and Choi Tae Ho.</i>

470
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:18,840
You told me not to talk to you,
but why are you roaming about like that?

471
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,270
<i>[Traitorous Jung Ki Joon]</i>

472
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,010
- What?
- Yeah, Joon Oh. Where are you?

473
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,710
Why do you want to know?

474
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,220
Where are you?

475
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,000
- I'm at the Seoul Plaza Hotel.
- Where?

476
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,030
You know, that one time
after we finished work

477
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,990
there was pizza here,
so we ate four pizzas.

478
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:43,450
Are you following Jo Hee Kyung?
Are you alone?

479
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:47,160
Since you betrayed me, I'm always alone.

480
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,870
Hey, what if Jang Do Pal and
Choi Tae Ho find you? Get out!

481
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:53,090
But I'm not that scared for some reason.

482
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,250
<i>Why aren't you scared?</i>

483
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,670
<i>Joon Oh. This situation
is a lot more serious than you think.</i>

484
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,320
<i>Those guys move in groups!</i>

485
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,360
<i>Anyway, I don't have a good feeling
about this, so get out. It's dangerous.</i>

486
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,860
<i>Get out of there--</i>

487
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,270
Joon Oh! Joon Oh!

488
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:14,980
- No!
- Joon Oh!

489
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,780
What's wrong? What is it?

490
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,980
Ji Ah, I'm sorry, you have to go
by yourself today. It's an emergency!

491
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,870
- I'll call you! I'm sorry!
- Ki Joon!

492
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:31,350
Taxi! I'm sorry!

493
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:34,390
Ki Joon! Ki Joon! Ki Joon! Damn it!

494
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:36,390
Follow them!

495
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,740
<i>Everything is A-OK.</i>

496
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,110
He's using the slang term.

497
00:39:58,110 --> 00:40:00,370
Oh, he said everything's okay.

498
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,910
- Tell him to keep watch anyway.
- Yes.

499
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,110
"Be on the lookout."

500
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:09,350
You're saying, Jo Hee Kyung's room,
and her election headquarters

501
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:11,260
those two rooms are suspicious, right?

502
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:14,490
Yes. Jang Do Pal and Choi Tae Ho
probably already know that.

503
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:17,040
All we have to do is get to them
before they do.

504
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,180
Prosecutor Yoon, stay at the headquarters

505
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:21,290
while Bong Hee and I search her room.

506
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:24,810
You must be careful.
Their side is on the move too.

507
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:28,120
Don't worry. The two of us
will search for it carefully.

508
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,050
From now on, it's all about timing.

509
00:40:31,050 --> 00:40:35,300
During the afternoon,
when she's campaigning, is your best bet.

510
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,520
In that time period,
please search her room.

511
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,750
Okay! Let's do that! Let's go!

512
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,620
But, Seo Joon Oh.
You must be very careful.

513
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:50,970
Don't worry. We'll do whatever it takes
to bring her phone back.

514
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,250
I'll throw these out.

515
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,100
Thank you very much.

516
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,740
Thank you!

517
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,070
Jo Hee Kyung! Jo Hee Kyung!

518
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,050
<i>[Jo Hee Kyung's Campaign Schedule]</i>

519
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:51,650
Jo Hee Kyung! Jo Hee Kyung!

520
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:01,840
Go.

521
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,700
Key! Key!

522
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:12,650
Hey, why did you throw it?
Like this, here... Come here.

523
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:17,620
- I can't focus.
- Bong Hee, you have to learn this.

524
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,640
I threw it like this,
but it was hit by the wind...

525
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,940
Put it back! Put it back! Put it back!

526
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:41,230
Seo Joon Oh. Our dominant hand.
From our dominant side, this way.

527
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,240
Can you see up there?

528
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,920
<i>Check Jo Hee Kyung's room first.</i>

529
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:05,130
Oh my!
Wow, why are you in such a dark place?

530
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:08,450
Hey, because you're here
this place seems a little brighter.

531
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:11,270
I brought you coffee
so you don't get tired!

532
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:14,380
How long have you been here?

533
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:19,740
I saw you at a hair salon. Wait,
no I didn't. Wait! Where are you going?

534
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,550
- We must go!
- You should take your coffee!

535
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:25,330
Oh no. Joon Oh's up there.

536
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,310
Why aren't you answering?

537
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:39,480
Hey, there's nothing here.

538
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,730
- That was close. There's nothing, right?
- I don't think it's in here.

539
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:49,020
- You're phone's ringing.
- Oh, it is. It's mine.

540
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:50,830
It's Byung Joo.

541
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,450
Hello?

542
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,470
What do we do, Seo Joon Oh?

543
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,170
You should have put it on vibrate.

544
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,990
Is it on vibrate?

545
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:33,860
No, I can't see,
so I can't put it on vibrate.

546
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:39,300
- Did you hear something?
- No.

547
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,920
Someone could show up at any time,
so let's start.

548
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,630
- Yes.
- Yes.

549
00:45:36,090 --> 00:45:38,390
That bastard bought new shoes.

550
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,840
Open it.

551
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,370
Hey, Tae Ho.
Here you go.

552
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,900
What brings you here, Ki Joon?

553
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:56,210
Ji Ah agreed to do the movie.

554
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:03,360
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

555
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,130
- What brings you here?
- What about you?

556
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:08,950
- I was passing by--
- How long have you been here?

557
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:10,830
Have you been here a while?

558
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:13,500
Well yes, I took a good look around--

559
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,780
- Did you see him then?
- Who?

560
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,090
If you saw anyone, tell me who they were.
Who exactly have you seen?

561
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:21,740
Have you seen my friend...
wait, who?

562
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:25,080
- Could it be Joon...
- Oh?

563
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,120
- Seo.
- Joon.

564
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,210
Oh.

565
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:29,490
- Joon Oh.
- You know Joon Oh?

566
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:32,010
Are you here to meet Joon Oh?

567
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:34,310
- Have you seen him?
- Something terrible has happened.

568
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:38,460
Tae Ho just went up to Joon Oh's room.

569
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,060
- I'm going to lose my mind.
- Hey.

570
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,760
Joon Oh's here?

571
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,720
What? You don't want me to?

572
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,310
No, I've got nothing to lose.

573
00:46:50,310 --> 00:46:52,270
Make a decision before I change my mind.

574
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,390
What are you doing here?

575
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:00,570
- Let's talk outside.
- Huh? Why?

576
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,640
This visit is quite sudden.

577
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:09,850
What's so urgent that you came here?

578
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,600
- It's urgent.
- Yeah, it is.

579
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,960
First you didn't want to do it
at all, and now it's urgent?

580
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,260
I said it was urgent.

581
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,920
It's urgent.

582
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,810
Tell me if you don't want me to do it
so I can tell CEO Jang.

583
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,200
Never mind. Do the movie.

584
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:36,020
<i>I forgive you of your sins.</i>

585
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,690
<i>Get me a pizza from the pizzeria
across from the hotel when you leave.</i>

586
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,980
<i>No bacon.</i>

587
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:50,680
We're good now, right?

588
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:55,310
Wow.

589
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,550
I thought I was going to die
in that cramped space.

590
00:48:00,610 --> 00:48:02,310
- Here.
- I thought I stopped breathing.

591
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,430
Open it for me.

592
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:10,890
<i>[Traitorous Jung Ki Joon]
I decline.</i>

593
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:27,210
I figured it out.

594
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:37,740
<i>I think it was Investigator Oh.</i>

595
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,150
I will place this where you asked.

596
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:42,700
<i>Go on ahead. I'll follow a bit later.</i>

597
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,180
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

598
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,870
Now we're going to track Tae Ho.
It's only us.

599
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:53,770
If one of you loses Tae Ho,
you'll die by my hands.

600
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:59,050
Jung Ki Joon was here.

601
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,890
<i>I think Jang Do Pal has also
caught on to what's going on.</i>

602
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:05,120
That means we need to be
one step ahead of them.

603
00:49:05,120 --> 00:49:08,910
I'll take care of Jang Do Pal.
You two keep an eye on Investigator Oh.

604
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:11,220
- Understood.
- All right.

605
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:14,500
Get a move on
so we don't lose him.

606
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,610
Yes, sir.

607
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:29,870
Yeah, it's me.

608
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:32,950
I have a favor to ask of you.

609
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:39,680
Goodness, bosses!

610
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,370
Goodness. Boss! Boss!
I bought drinks, though!

611
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:51,560
Investigator Oh.

612
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,900
- He's leaving.
- Leaving.

613
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,900
- He's leaving.
- He's leaving! Shouldn't we go?

614
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,670
- Not yet.
- I think we have to go.

615
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:01,440
- We wait for the light.
- Wait, no!

616
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,500
The light hasn't turned!

617
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,550
We have to follow him
so we don't lose him!

618
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:04,600
Not yet, Bong Hee!

619
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,080
- He's gone.
- Go, go, go, go!

620
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,740
- Go, go, go, go!
- Don't.

621
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,320
- We have to go now.
- Stay calm.

622
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,620
- D.
- D.

623
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,360
- We're already too late.
- P, R, N, D.

624
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:14,000
- Let's go.
- I'm going.

625
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,990
- Do I turn on the brakes?
- Just go.

626
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:17,780
- I'm going.
- Bong Hee, let's go.

627
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,210
- I'm going.
- Bong Hee.

628
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:20,460
I'm going. I'm going.

Tae Ho is with you, isn't he?

632

Yes.

633

Don't answer, just listen.

634
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:44,820
I understand.

<i>Don't leave the hotel.</i>

636

Do you understand?

638
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:54,040
Yes.

639
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:56,940
Who was that?

640
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,360
An acquaintance.

641
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,280
Do you want to grab a bite to eat?

642
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,530
We could talk about the movie.

643
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,590
Tae Ho...

00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,800
Get out.

646
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:40,200
- Why do you keep veering left?
- I'm not veering left!

647
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,470
Just follow the car
ahead of us, Bong Hee!

648

<i>Che bella cosa...
Cchiu' bello, oi ne'.</i>

649
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:52,030
- Why are you driving so slowly?
- I'm driving pretty fast.

650
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:53,530
He hasn't caught on, has he?

651
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,700
- Oh there... what do we do?
- Seriously!

652
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,330
He just took the right exit.

653
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:03,860
- What do we do?
- Do something.

654
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,990
- Make a U-turn.
- A U-turn?

655
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:06,870
Hurry! Stay left
so you can veer right.

656
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:08,020
All right.

657
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:10,540
Whoa!

658
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:13,500
- It's because we're so slow.
- But I'm driving so fast!

659
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,920
- He appeared out of nowhere.
- Okay, veer right now.

660
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:22,530
- Oh no!
- Why is this guy trying to get in here?

661
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:26,030
Why is this guy trying
to butt into this lane?

662
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:33,060
What? What's wrong?

663
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,180
Behind us.

664
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:52,830
Wait a second. Hold on.

665
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:55,640
Given the situation, I don't think
you should keep driving straight.

666
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:59,310
- You won't make a U-turn?
- I haven't done that before.

667
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:01,210
So you're just
going to keep driving straight?

668
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,630
I'll just... keep going, I guess.

669
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,510
What is with that car?
What's going on?

670
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:11,120
He keeps tailgating us.

00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:50,180
How fast were you going
that you got pulled over?

674
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,080
Looks like you were caught
speeding too, CEO Jang.

675
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:12,600
Oh, Seo Joon Oh. That car!

676
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,250
- Is that it?
- Yes, it is! Yes, we found it!

677
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:18,060
See, our paths crossed again
because I kept driving straight.

678
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:21,340
What in the world is he doing?
We're following him.

679
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:22,690
It's because I drove fast.

680
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,200
- Stay strong.
- I think that's the hardest thing to do.

681
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,650
Don't smile too much, Bong Hee.

682
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:30,320
- Why not?
- Because we're tailing him.

683
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,780
That's right.

684
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,570
What's wrong with me?

685
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:43,460
Oh, sol... oh.

686
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,450
Oh, this won't do.

687
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:50,930
Oh. Okay, stay quiet.
Keep it together.

688
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:53,150
All right now.

689
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:57,170
Oh, he's over there.
He's headed that way.

690
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,610
It's a rest stop.

691
00:54:58,610 --> 00:54:59,760
That's a gas station.

692
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,000
- I'm saying it's both.
- Oh, I see.

693
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,800
Don't turn on the headlights!

694
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,570
Why turn on the headlights
when we're tailing him?

695
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,320
How can you just
take the wheel like that?

696
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,890
- You startled me!
- Slowly veer right.

697
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:11,140
You startled me!

698
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,080
- Welcome.
- Yes.

699
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,980
- How much?
- 20 liters. 20 liters.

700
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,110
All right.

701
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,900
- Where is your restroom?
- It's over there.

702
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,040
Oh!

703
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,480
He's headed for the restroom.

704
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,690
<i>[Do not throw out trash in the
restroom. We sell trash bags.]</i>

705
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:43,240
Here we go.

706
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:46,230
Seo Joon Oh.

707
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:49,520
I'll buy us some time,
so you go and search his car.

708
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,180
How do you expect to buy us some time?

709
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:52,410
Best of luck!

710
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:53,800
Hey.

711
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,890
She can't be serious.

712
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:03,500
<i>Che bella cosa...
Cchiu' bello, oi ne'.</i>

713
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:05,790
How disgusting.

714
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:10,090
<i>O sole mio...</i>

715
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:22,180
What the? It's locked?

716
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,720
This can't be happening.

717
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,790
Oh, come on.

718
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:28,460
Excuse me!

719
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,800
Oh, come on.

720
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:35,390
<i>[Restroom Out of Order]
Excuse me!</i>

721
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:38,490
<i>Is something wrong with this door?</i>

722
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:39,630
Is anybody out there?

723
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,520
Save me!

724
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,200
<i>[Restroom Out of Order]</i>

725
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:47,980
Gosh.

726
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,970
<i>[Legend Entertainment: Private Items]</i>

727
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:14,040
Yes. Are you on your way?

728
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:18,000
Yes, I just arrived.
Yes, ma'am.

729
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:52,060
<i>You must get it fixed.</i>

730
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:58,100
I have to know what's on this phone.

731
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:02,020
I have to know what's on it to understand
why everyone wants me to hand it over.

732
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,840
I think I need to be
the first one to know.

733
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:10,990
I will place this where you've asked.

734
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,780
Go on ahead. I'll follow a bit later.

735
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,180
Yes, ma'am.

736
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,540
- Yes, Manager Jung?
<i>- Something awful has happened!</i>

737
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,750
<i>Tae Ho is headed in your direction!</i>

738
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:35,270
- What?
<i>- Get out of there! Hurry!</i>

739
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:21,930
Unbelievable.

740
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:30,570
You're alive?

741
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,580
You can't be alive.

742
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:01,940
I'm not alive, Tae Ho.

743
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:11,670
So I'm at peace.

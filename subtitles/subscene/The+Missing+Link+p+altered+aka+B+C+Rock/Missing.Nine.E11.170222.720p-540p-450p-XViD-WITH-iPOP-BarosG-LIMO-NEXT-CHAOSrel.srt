12
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:50,230
Do you know me?

13
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,200
Got you! I've always
wanted to try that on someone!

14
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,290
Seo Joon Oh, you scared me!

15
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,170

- Hello.
- Hello.

19
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,690
Du Du.

20
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,410

- Okay.

22
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,830
- Yes, hello?
<i>- Did you see Seo Joon Oh?</i>

23
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,550
Yes, Prosecutor Yoon.

24
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,380
Wow, you finally found him.

25
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,850
Congratulations. Thanks to you...

26
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:19,080
I opened Shin Jae Hyun's case again.
We'll talk about it when you return.

27
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,550
You two must have a lot to talk about,
so I'll let you go.

28

Who? Oh, So Hee's older brother?

40
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,170
Yes. He took care of me very well
while you were gone.

41
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,620
Really? You're hungry, aren't you?

Yes. What is all this?

43

roam about like this?

What about your injury?
Are you okay?

45
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,460
Of course I'm not!
I'm straining myself just for you.

46
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,290
Hearing you talk like that reassures me
that it's really you.

47
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,850
I wasn't so sure before.
You're really alive, Seo Joon Oh.

48
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,340
I bet you kept looking for me,
thinking I was dead.

49
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,240
Why would I have looked for you
if I thought you were dead?

50
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,920
I looked for you because
I thought you were alive.

51
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,900
I didn't think you were dead

52
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,360
but other people kept telling me
that you died

53
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,450
so it was hard to believe,
and I had a hard time with that.

54
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,110
That's how I felt.

55
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,230
But...

56
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,630
Who saved you?

57
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,740
The grandpa you met earlier.

58
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,710
<i>He was fishing by the ocean,
and he saw me on the beach.</i>

59
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,550
Hello? Are you all right? (In Chinese)

60
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,580
<i>It turned out
that he was the neighborhood doctor.</i>

61
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,960
<i>At first, I wasn't sure
if he was trying to save me or kill me.</i>

62
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,090
<i>But he wasn't a complete quack.</i>

63
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,410
It was for the best.
If I had gone to a big hospital...

64
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,250
I would have turned out like CEO Hwang.

65
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,410
That's why, no matter
how hard I searched for you

66
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,210
I couldn't find anything.

67
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,050
Hey, I heard news about you,
and I continued to search for you.

68
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,570
Look at this.

69
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,400
The internet is slow in this neighborhood

70
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,560
so it took forever to print out
even one page.

71
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,560
But, Seo Joon Oh,
how did you know my number?

72
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,090
That was my first day,
so I hadn't given you my number.

73
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:32,260
Artists are supposed to memorize
the phone numbers of the entire staff.

74
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,130
Do you think we're stars for no reason?

75
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,530
I guess that's how celebrities are.

76
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,700
<i>Yes, hello? Yes, who is this?
Why are you speaking informally to me?</i>

77
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,550
Yes, that's right. This is Byung Joo.

78
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:51,180
Oh, Joon Oh! Joon Oh! I'm sorry,
it's so great to hear your voice!

79
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:55,480
It's so nice to hear your voice!

80
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,000
Where are you calling from?
You were in China?

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,500
There's a lot of pork in China.
You didn't eat any pork?

82
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,380
You had sweet and sour pork?
When are you coming back?

83
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:09,420
Bong Hee's phone number?

84
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,230
By the way, Seo Joon Oh.

85
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,310
I was really lonely while you were gone.

86
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,370
People I thought I knew on the island...

87
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:29,790
After coming back to reality...

88
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,740
They weren't the people I thought I knew.

89
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,680
You told me not to do anything,
and just stay by your side.

90
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,890
But you left me alone.

91
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,390
I didn't even know
if you were alive or dead

92
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:50,310
so all I could do was wait.

93
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,790
I almost gave up too.

94
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,230
I'm sorry.

95
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,040
I'm sorry for leaving you alone.

98
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,900

the survivors who were missing

100
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,660
and took on a large role
in normalizing the company.

101
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,300
He has also given his best effort
to improve the company's reputation

102
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,680
after it was tarnished
due to many rumors.

103
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,680
<i>We cannot leave Hwang Jae Gook's
position empty any longer</i>

104
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,280

106
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,800

107
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,030
Now, let's take a vote.

108
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:34,740
He has been approved.

109
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,440
Thank you.

110
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,050
Control your expression.

111
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,870
Aren't you controlling your expression
too well?

112
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,270
It doesn't look like
you're controlling it. You look sincere.

113
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,480
Smile.

114
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,670
CEO Jang. Congratulations
on formally becoming the CEO.

115
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,870
We should have a company dinner
on a night like this.

116
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:13,020
Are Tae Ho and Ji Ah working?

117
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,220
- Tae Ho's shooting a movie.
- Ji Ah's at a meeting for her movie.

118
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,490
Those punks sure are unlucky.

119
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:21,880
It's not like they'll starve
if they don't come.

120
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,440
Tell Ji Ah to drop by my office tomorrow.

121
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,790
It could be difficult because
she'll be filming an outdoor commercial.

122
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,250
Tell her to come by when she's finished.
Is it going to take all day?

123
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,790
Yes.

124
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:47,320
CEO Jang, you said you were going to
visit the hospital today. Are you going?

125
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,160
Has CEO Hwang's condition improved?

126
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,480
- Well, not really.
- Then there's no use in visiting.

127
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,970
You can go and nurse him
so that problems don't arise.

128
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,510
- If he gets better, let me know.
- Yes, I understand.

129
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,540
- Let's go.
- Okay.

<i>[Journalist Kim Was Mentioned
In The Final Announcement. Who Is He?]</i>

131
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:10,860
When we were leaving that island

132
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,880
Journalist Kim told me something.

133
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:18,300
The person who gave me the information,
was Yoon So Hee.

134
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,030
<i>The reason So Hee didn't say anything</i>

135
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,030
when she knew
who caused Jae Hyun's death...

136
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:28,950
The reason why Yoon So Hee
changed her mind...

137
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,100
was because of CEO Jang.

138
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,680
Him.

139
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,720
It was because of Jang Do Pal.

140
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,260
- CEO Jang Do Pal?
- Yeah.

141
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,310
On the day of Jae Hyun's death...

142
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,480
<i>Tae Ho arrived late, and while
we were walking into Jae Hyun's house</i>

143
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,300
Jae Hyun fell.

144
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:58,120
If Tae Ho killed Jae Hyun
and came out to cover up his crime...

145
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,360
<i>that means someone else
pushed him off the roof.</i>

146
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,720
Then are you saying...

147
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,090
Jang Do Pal was the one
who helped Choi Tae Ho?

148
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,690
Yeah.

149
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:18,050
I don't know how Journalist Kim
found CCTV footage of Tae Ho

150
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:22,770
but during the investigation, they said
the footage was being inspected.

151
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,640
I'm certain Jang Do Pal
had something to do with it.

152
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,640
And I'm sure Tae Ho wasn't
thinking clearly enough at the time.

153
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,870
<i>And at the time...</i>

154
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,980
<i>I thought Jae Hyun committed suicide
because of me</i>

155
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:44,620
<i>which is why no one, including me,
thought it could have been a murder.</i>

156
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:49,070
<i>CEO Hwang and I stopped the autopsy
for that reason.</i>

157
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,140
We didn't want to kill him twice.

158
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,290
Jang Do Pal

159
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,570
even bribed the hospital
that Manager Jung and Ji Ah were in

160
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,290
and tried to kill all of us.

161
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,650
What? Why are you telling me this now?

162
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,440
We just found each other.

163
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,960
That's right. Were you hurt?

164
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,950
No. I'm a fighter.

165
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:14,990
- But Seo Joon Oh.
- Yeah?

166
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:20,480
When we return to Seoul, how will we
deal with Choi Tae Ho and Jang Do Pal?

167
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,070
No one's on our side.

168
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,990
What do you mean? You're on our side.

169
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,760
Everyone thinks I'm dead.

170
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,950
If I go back,
Ki Joon, Ho Hang, and Ji Ah...

171
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,120
can all be persuaded.

172
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,720
I'll take care of everything,
so don't worry.

173
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,400
You've suffered enough because of me.

174
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,180
Cheers.

175
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,400
But how will we return to Seoul?

176
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,870
The prosecution is investigating
your case right now

177
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:09,300
so they're probably going to
put you in handcuffs as soon as we land.

178
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,120
So...

179
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,770
Please draw us a picture. (In Chinese)

180
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,870
No. Yes! Yes! Yes!

181
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,670
A three-way intersection out front?
Yes! Yes! Yes!

182
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,280
There will be a red light?
Okay! Okay! Okay!

183
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,670
I get it now.

184
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,760
Wow, there are hundreds of those.

185
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,930
Oh, wait! Excuse me! (In Chinese)

186
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:36,710
This place, you can go this way.

187
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,590
Turn left, go straight
and then turn right.

188
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,480
And then go upstairs and then downstairs.

189
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,770
Thank you.

190
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,880
What did he say?

191
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,410
Oh, Seo Joon Oh, the red light!
If we see the light, turn right--

192
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,080
Turn right when we see the light.

193
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,190
No, we came this way,
so we have to that way!

194
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,870
If I look at it from here, it's this way.

195
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:03,400
South and north.
From here, it's this way--

196
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,360
If we look here,
the full moon is in the sky--

197
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,420
Wait, hey. Then you don't even need
a map! You're looking down on Grandpa!

198
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,950
Just like how the moon is fixed,
the cardinal points are fixed too.

199
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,140
Wow, seriously. Listen to this girl.

200
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,180
- West is our non-dominant hand.
- Our right hand is our dominant hand.

201
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,260
You're confusing me now. Did we use
a spoon to eat on the deserted island?

202
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,200
Excuse me, what do you use to eat?

203
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,570
- In India, they eat with their right--
- They do--

204
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,080
- You're in trouble if you use your left.
- Does that mean--

205
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:34,430
Grandpa told us that
when our backs face the red light...

206
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,310
Hey, don't do that! Seriously!

207
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,030
You said you eat with your right hand...

208
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,530
Excuse me!

209
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,050
Seo Joon Oh, this way. Our dominant hand.

210
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,420
This is where we can
take the boat to Korea, right?

211
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,160
Yes, that's right.

212
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,680
- It is, right?
- Yes, it is.

213
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,030
You're sure this is the place, right?

214
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,630
He said it is.

215
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,190
Seo Joon Oh, this place feels strange.

216
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,630
- No.
- What? There's nothing here.

217
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,640
We're walking into the dark again.

218
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,810
You passed the physical examination.

219
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:35,390
Oh, you're the perfect size!

220
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,580
You will arrive in Incheon
tomorrow afternoon.

221
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,980
- 500 yuan.
- I paid already.

222
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,300
- Did you receive it?
- Yes, I did.

223
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,750
We're going to get you there in the box.
We won't be held liable for anything.

224
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,200
- 500 yuan.
- I said I paid already.

225
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,640
- Did you receive it?
- Yes, I did.

226
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,760
- Please sign here.
- Oh! Wait.

227
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,590
You can't sign without thinking.
How can you trust him?

228
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,820
It's always like this for illegal acts.

229
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,090
- Is it always like this?
- Hey, it is. It's always like this.

230
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,990
- Should I stamp all of it?
- Use five fingers.

231
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,160
Wait, why are you stamping everything?
Why do you need this? Stop stamping!

232
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,170
It's always like this on this continent.

233
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,480
Are we finished?

234
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,560
- 500 yuan.
- I said I paid already!

235
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,170
- Did you receive it?
- Yes, I did.

236
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,090
He received my payment!

237
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:25,070
Here's a clipper. Give me a nail clipping
and two strands of hair.

238
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:28,470
Hey, wait! Why are you giving that to
them? What are they going to do with it?

239
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:31,040
In Chinese movies, they always do this.

240
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,000
Wait, why do you need
his nail clippings and hair?

241
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,540
- Why do you talk so much?
- Geez. Here.

242
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,290
- 500 yuan.
- I paid already!

243
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,460
- Did you receive it?
- He did! He received it!

244
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,400
You're finished.

245
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:55,260
I don't think this is right, Seo Joon Oh.

246
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,290
I'm anxious. Don't you watch the news?

247
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,800
I don't watch the news.

248
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,180
There's no guarantee that
those people will take you to Seoul.

249
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,010
It doesn't seem like they have a permit.

250
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,070
If they had a legal permit,
would they smuggle people over?

251
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,360
I'll give Prosecutor Yoon a call.
There must be another way.

252
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,990
There isn't! There's no time either.

253
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,600
Hey, aren't you leaning on
So Hee's brother too much?

254
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,300
People should do
what they can on their own

255
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,000
and only ask for help
if they really need it.

256
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,590
You can't even take out the bones in your
fish. How will you enter Korea illegally?

257
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,910
I'm worried, Seo Joon Oh.

258
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,650
- Bong Hee.
- Yes?

259
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:35,210
What's our goal?
We should get back to Korea, right?

260
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,010
- Yes.
- We should go and see people, right?

261
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,070
- Yes.
- We should fix everything, right?

262
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:44,240
- Yes.
- Then this is nothing! Don't worry!

263
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,570
Here. Get in!

264
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,610
Pardon? Why?

265
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:51,340
We can't go to the airport together
because I'm wanted. Let's split up here.

266
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,610
They said I'll arrive in a day,
so I'll see you tomorrow.

267
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:57,390
How can I go alone?
I can't. I'm too anxious.

268
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,170
- Hey! Come here. Get in.
- I'm worried--

269
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,370
Geez, seriously. Hey! Who am I?

270
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,260
I survived a plane crash, stepped
on a mine, and survived the high seas.

271
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,510
- Does this make sense?
- No.

272
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,160
There's someone else
who doesn't make sense.

273
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,600
We have to catch him.

274
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,140
Don't worry.

275
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:20,770
Call me when you're about to leave.
I'll wait for you there.

276
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,520
- Okay.
- Take care of yourself.

277
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,580
Okay! Don't worry! Go on. Get in!

278
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,800
- Go!
- Take care of yourself, Seo Joon Oh.

279
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,410
Go!

280
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:45,250
<i>We'll face plenty more hardships
going forward. That's why...</i>

281
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:49,820
<i>This is nothing in comparison.
I can endure all of it.</i>

282
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,830
<i>I'll be okay.</i>

283
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,900
<i>I wonder how much time has passed.</i>

284
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,330
<i>It's so dark in here</i>

285
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,180
<i>that the inside of this container
is frozen in dimness.</i>

286
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,790
<i>No one is willing to speak first.</i>

287
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:40,720
<i>At a time like this,
an introduction is much needed.</i>

288
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:48,950
Hello! I'm a Korean singer, Seo Joon Oh.
(In Chinese)

289
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,720
<i>I shouldn't have done that.</i>

290
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:00,280
<i>It's been a while
since I've been so embarrassed.</i>

291
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,470
<i>Okay, I'll break the ice
with the person next to me.</i>

292
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,220
Hello. My name
is Seo Joon Oh. (In Chinese)

293
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:16,340
Don't ask any questions,
if you want to live. Got it?

294
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,870
You're Korean!

295
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,880
Don't ask any questions.

296
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,800
Wh... What?

297
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,840
Don't ask any questions!

298
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:35,020
<i>Geez, there's always someone.</i>

299
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,990
<i>I'll just sleep.</i>

300
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,470
- Don't ask--
- I don't want to know anything.

301
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,670
I'm not curious at all. You have a knife.

302
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,080
<i>Geez, I'll just sleep.</i>

303
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:04,380
<i>I wonder how much time has passed now.
I'm thirsty.</i>

304
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,790
Oh, is he doing card tricks?

305
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,710
Don't ask any questions.

306
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,980
I wasn't asking you.

307
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,240
Um, is that magic?

308
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,770
Whoa! How did you do that?

309
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,510
Wow, amazing.

310
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,520
What are you doing?
You're putting it inside?

311
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,960
No way. You must be kidding.

312
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,330
Whoa!

313
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,750
How did that get in there?
How did you do that?

314
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:09,750
Fascinating. Fascinating.

315
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,670
- Don't ask any questions.
- Geez!

316
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,580
Excuse me.

317
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,330
You must pay me because you watched.

318
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,840
<i>It's about money.</i>

319
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,290
Wow, it's awesome! (In Chinese)

320
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,870
<i>In this small space,
where there's no fresh air</i>

321
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,260
<i>they're juggling fire.</i>

322
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,680
Hey, stop it! That's enough!

323
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,760
- Please pay up.
- Yes, you must pay us!

324
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,190
<i>Geez, it's for money again.</i>

325
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:51,290
Okay, pay up. Find the white ball.
Where could the ball be? Let's see.

326
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:54,610
Okay! Okay. Where could it be? Find it!

327
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,710
- Here!
- Here!

328
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,160
- I want to know!
- No!

329
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,690
You put it right there!

330
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:06,870
<i>They're swindling each other for money.
Geez, how pathetic.</i>

331
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,970
What is that?

332
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:24,520
Oh, this is a drawing
my daughter gave me.

333
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,680
I'm looking at it because
I miss my daughter so much.

334
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:34,120
Mister, is there anyone you miss?

335
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:37,210
<i>Someone I miss?</i>

336
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:42,790
Don't ask any questions.

337
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,610
<i>Should I kill him?</i>

338
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,970
He was the one who asked me a question.

339
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,960
<i>Someone I miss.</i>

340
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:03,220
- Oh my goodness!
- Geez.

341
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:19,460
Gosh, why hasn't he called?

342
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,440
I'm going crazy here.

343
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,800
<i>I wonder how much time has passed.</i>

344
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,390
<i>I woke up to the sound of someone crying.</i>

345
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,420
Mister, why are you crying?

346
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,540
Don't ask any questions.

347
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,190
Where did your knife go?

348
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,740
You were swindled, weren't you?

349
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,500
Hey, why would you...

350
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:11,320
Mister, what's wrong?
Where are you cards?

351
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,150
Mister, where's your daughter's drawing?
You were swindled, weren't you?

352
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,020
Your torches too?

353
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,640
<i>I couldn't hold it in any longer.</i>

354
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,270
This person, seriously. You...

355
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,010
Mister.

356
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,290
I challenge you.

357
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,980
<i>Plane crash, land mine, high seas...</i>

358
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,620
<i>No one is as lucky as I am.</i>

359
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,730
<i>Everything I have.
I have nothing to lose.</i>

360
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,760
<i>I'm Seo Joon Oh.</i>

361
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,290
Oh, excuse me. Um, wait...

362
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:36,640
Oh! These are Seo Joon Oh's clothes.
This is...

363
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:43,190
Wait, excuse me. Have you seen
a skinny Korean man with yellow hair?

364
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:45,700
His name is Seo Joon Oh.
Have you seen him?

365
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,380
- Don't ask any questions.
- Let's go!

366
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,670
Seo Joon Oh.

367
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,550
What happened?

368
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,580
- Hey, it's nothing.
- Pardon?

369
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,300
Wait, where are your clothes?
What happened to you, Seo Joon Oh?

370
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,190
I was swindled.

371
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,600
Oh, what's that smell?

372
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,410
- Bong Hee.
- Gosh! That smell!

373
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,340
It's coming from this bag.

374
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,370
- What's wrong?
- Wait a minute.

375
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,240
Hey, lend me your scarf.

376
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:43,860
- Why are you running away?
- I'll give it to you. Stay there.

377
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,140
- Hurry.
- Here.

378
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:49,060
Gosh, something's rotting.

379
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,940
- Is it cashmere?
- Yes, it's soft, isn't it?

380
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:56,950
Okay. Let's go and wash up.
I'll find you clothes in the meantime.

381
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,300
Let's go.

382
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,700
- What happened?
- Hey, stop it.

383
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,580
- Hey, I can see!
- Hey!

384
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,780
- Wait, I'll cover it for you!
- Hey, stop it! You're bothering me!

385
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:13,250
But I can see everything!
I can see your butt!

386
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,250
I can't do this. I won't.

387
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:22,800
This is a role
that Tae Ho recommended you for.

388
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,650
- Why don't you want to do it?
- This was So Hee's role.

389
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,370
So Hee recommended him too.

390
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:30,970
- So? What's wrong with that?
- I'm sure you don't care, but I do.

391
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:35,360
I don't want to be her replacement,
and why would I do a melodrama with you?

392
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,970
If you're so particular and picky,
how will you ever reach the top?

393
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:42,360
You didn't purposely push
So Hee out of her role.

394
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,370
You're just taking a lead role because
she's dead and gone. What's wrong--

395
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,200
Hey, Ji Ah! Do this movie!

396
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,450
Hey, So Hee really wanted to do movies,
and asked to meet directors

397
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:55,250
by begging CEO Jang
and even threatening him.

398
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,280
CEO Tae. Stop saying crazy things.

399
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,460
Yes, I apologize.

400
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,320
Don't do it if you don't want to.

401
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,580
Tell her not to do it.

402
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,590
But Ji Ah.

403
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:12,120
People can always change their minds,
so think about it.

404
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,180
Your mom should stop mooching
off the company.

405
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,860
That bastard.

406
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,380
Anyway, I can't do it. I won't do it.
I'm making myself very clear.

407
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,000
I won't do it. I'm leaving.

408
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,640
- I'll find a good project--
- Ji Ah.

409
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,310
You haven't seen the tabloids yet,
have you?

410
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,720
Tabloids?

411
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,920
Go and look at them
when you get a chance.

412
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,850
- Ji Ah--
- Manger Jung.

413
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:07,410
- Let's talk.
- Sure.

414
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:21,000
- You don't seem to get along these days.
- What do you mean by that?

415
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,180
I'm not as closed-minded as you think.

416
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:29,460
Whether you date, or move in together,
I don't care.

417
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,840
We're not dating.
When we were on the island...

418
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,950
Are the tabloids about...

419
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:44,430
<i>[Four Months Pregnant?]</i>
What is this article saying?

420
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,920
- Am I pregnant?
- That's ridiculous.

421
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,490
<i>You promised you wouldn't
do anything to Ji Ah.</i>

422
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,960
You promised.

423
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,820
You were acting so slowly, that..

424
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:09,610
I thought you forgot about that promise.

425
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:13,100
Maybe I didn't make it clear enough.

426
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,080
Maybe that was my bad.

427
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:18,490
Okay, now...

428
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:22,320
How about...
you control Ji Ah better?

429
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,860
Before a bigger problem arises.

430
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:39,570
Yeah. What?

431
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,040
Lost items?

432
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
I found it! (In Chinese)

433
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,530
I found it!

434
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:00,460
Hurry up and find them! We have to
find them before the sun goes down!

435
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:05,120
<i>They said these are items
they didn't find last time.</i>

436
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,680
<i>There were clothes and cellphones
left behind.</i>

437
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,150
Wait. A cellphone?

438
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,480
I mean...

439
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,450
I asked for a meeting with the directors.
Why haven't I been contacted yet?

440
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:27,180
Aren't you neglecting me too much?

441
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,120
This isn't what we agreed to!

442
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,290
- Did you search the computer?
- Yes, I didn't find anything.

443
00:33:55,130 --> 00:34:00,030
Yeah, Ji Ah. You said you were
with So Hee after the crash, right?

444
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,660
Yes, why do you ask?

445
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:05,880
Okay, then. You know the cellphone
that was waved in the air for help?

446
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,000
Whose phone was it?

447
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,750
- Why are you bringing that up all of a--
- Answer my question!

448
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,960
Why is he yelling?

449
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,090
There's light.

450
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,210
It was So Hee's. Why?

451
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,860
Okay.

452
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,590
- Yeah, where's the cellphone?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

453
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,710
They were already collected
and landed in Korea.

454
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,710
Then whose hands did it fall into?

455
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,110
Please look favorably upon me.
Let's turn things around.

456
00:34:56,910 --> 00:35:01,290
Oh, hello. I'm Jo Hee Kyung.
Please look favorably upon me.

Oh my. I know a lot
about traditional markets.

460
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:14,780
I've loved traditional markets
since I was very young.

461
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,700
When I was little,
I used to go to the market with my mother

462
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,150
and those were such great memories!
I still remember!

463
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,790
Please try this.

464
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:26,090
- Oh, it's delicious!
- Is it?

465
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:31,410
This too. Please try this too.
This is very delicious.

466
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,360
Try the fish cakes! Try this too!

467
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,530
It looks like you love market food!

468
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:43,010
Jo Hee Kyung! Jo Hee Kyung! Jo Hee Kyung!

469
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:46,230
- Jo Hee Kyung!
- Thank you!

Why did you plan out
our schedule this way?

472
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,660
Why are we going to all the markets? It's
not like we're a on a hunt for good food.

473
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,570
- Yes--
- I ate too much rice soup.

474
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:11,550
And, why are they still calling me
Chairwoman Jo?

475
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,660
The special investigation committee
ended ages ago.

476
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:17,440
I understand, Chairwoman...
No, Congresswoman Jo.

477
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,310

Why do you always give me turtlenecks?

00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,500
- You are so stubborn.
- They look good on you.

485
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,740
- You're really obsessed with these.
- Here, be quiet.

Keep your hat on.
You can't be seen by anyone.

There are so many other things
besides turtlenecks...

00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:12,090
- Seo Joon Oh, why are you empty-handed?
- What?

489
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:16,390
- Where's the scarf I lent you earlier?
- I threw it out. It smelled. I'm sorry.

490
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:20,810
We have a lot to talk about,
so shall we relocate?

491
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:24,450
I'm sorry,
but I have something to take care of.

492
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,300
It's more important than
clearing myself from the false charges.

- I'll tell you when I return.

505
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,440
Was it because of me?

506
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,380
Did CEO Jang use me to threaten you?

507
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:25,650
- It's not like that.
- Then what is it?

508
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:29,350
I'm not scared about the tabloids,
so let's just tell the truth!

509
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:32,360
Why aren't you scared of the tabloids?
You should be! You're an actress!

510
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,330
Your image is your life if you're
an actress! You should be scared!

511
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,470
After what we went through on that island

512
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:45,870
"Pregnancy On The Deserted Island"
is a top search. This is upsetting me.

513
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:47,460
That's because CEO Jang--

514
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,000
Do the movie if you want
the rumors to go away.

515
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,790
You have to take on a project
for them to quiet down.

516
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,030
Tae Ho's image is good right now

517
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:58,790
so if you display good chemistry
in this melodrama, it'll help you too.

518
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:02,340
So let's not think right now,
and just get through this.

519
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,480
Until the world calms down...

520
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,350
Let's just...

521
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:13,360
do our job quietly.

522
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,770
Does it look like I was shot in the head?

523
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,990
Don't you feel like we owe Joon Oh?

524
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,420
Oh, that's right.

525
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,760
We no longer have any right
to feel apologetic.

526
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,400
We really betrayed him.

527
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:31,190
You don't have to feel that way.

528
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,150
I'll be the son of a bitch
for both of us.

529
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:38,720
I don't think I can continue traveling
with you right now. What should we do?

530
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,160
Do you want to get out? Or should I?

531
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,690
What are you saying? We're in Gunsan!

532
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:49,440
If we get out right now,
we'll be roadkill!

533
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:10,950
<i>All I did was choose a path
for our survival.</i>

534
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,030
<i>Since Joon Oh is no longer here.</i>

535
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,470
<i>Ji Ah didn't know anything about this</i>

536
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:20,490
<i>so all she has to do
is firmly walk along that path.</i>

537
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:24,110
<i>That's all I wish for.</i>

538
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:47,060
- Yes, please go ahead.
- Yes.

539
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,530
I'll push you.

540
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,760
- I'll push you.
- Okay!

541
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,890
It's easier if I push you, isn't it?

542
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,790
Do you always drive so safely?

543
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:15,670
This isn't my car. It's not my car.

544
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,620
Ouch, my legs.

545
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,590
Go back safely!

546
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:29,930
Geez, what is all over the ground?

547
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:33,410
Trust, love, and friendship
are all on the ground.

548
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,650
Oh! What's that smell?

549
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:40,180
It smells very familiar!

550
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,370
It's the smell of a traitor.

551
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,780
Joon Oh.

552
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,880
Hi.

553
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,610
Come here.

554
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,750
Come here!

555
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,780
Come here! Come here! Come here!
Byung Joo, come here!

556
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,390
Come here, Byung Joo. It's me!

557
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,940
- Step on it! Go!
- But it's Joon Oh!

558
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,490
- It's Joon Oh, but let's go!
- I understand!

559
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:23,510
I talked to him already, so just drive!
Go this way!

560
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:26,450
- Reverse! Reverse!
- Come here!

561
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:29,420
Hurry! Drive to the right!

562
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,600
Hey! Come here! Come here!

563
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,640
Hey, what are you doing?

564
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,290
Don't push my arm! Open the window!

565
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:43,700
- Joon Oh could have gotten hurt!
- Hey, choose!

566
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,710
Is it Ki Joon or me?
Byung Joo! What are you doing?

567
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,400
Spin the wheel this way!

568
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,950
Where are you trying to go?
Reverse to the left!

569
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:56,270
- Joon Oh, tell us if we have room.
- More.

570
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:58,870
- Hey, Byung Joo! The other way!
- The other way?

571
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:02,590
No, go forward first. I don't think
you can drive. Open the door.

572
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:06,220
Joon Oh! Joon Oh! Joon Oh!

573
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,310
- Joon Oh!
- Come here. Ki Joon!

574
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:12,830
Hey! Hey, get out! Get out! Get out!

575
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:19,550
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Please go!

576
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,720
- Mister, who are you?
- I'm in a difficult situation--

577
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,220
That's your problem!
How dare you just jump into my cab?

578
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,440
Joon Oh! Joon Oh!

579
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,570
Joon Oh, are you all right?

580
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:32,490
- How are you?
- Hey, I'm fine.

581
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:34,220
- Joon Oh!
- Hey, wait.

582
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,020
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

583
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:40,030
We're here! But... Mister! Mister!

584
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:43,470
Why did you get into my cab?

585
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:46,500
Oh, but still...

586
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,610
This is my house. Get out!

587
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:52,790
My house is right here! Get out!

588
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,340
- Hurry up and get out!
- Thank you.

589
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:59,590
I told you to get out! Geez, seriously!
I thought I was going to die!

590
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,130
Thank you. Thank you.

591
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:03,180
- Close the door!
- Yes, I will.

592
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,230
- You have to close the door!
- Wait.

593
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,510
- What? Are you hiding?
- I'm sorry.

594
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,040
Why are you here?

595
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,860
He's a beginner,
so we might have to help him get out.

596
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,650
Seriously, these people.
Why can't anyone drive?

597
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:22,270
Reverse! Reverse all the way!

598
00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:24,680
Damn it!

599
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,550
Come here!

600
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,140
Joon Oh, are you all right?

601
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:37,580
Geez, why are you going
so fast on a bike?

602
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,740
You're okay. You're okay.

603
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:43,590
Are you okay? Be more careful!

604
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,060
Hey!

605
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:52,400
Wow! They still have these?
I want to play!

606
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,370
Ki Joon! Let's play this game!

607
00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:12,950
Wow, they still have these machines?

608
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:18,780
- This is for girls. Give me 1000 won.
- Wait. Wait.

609
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,090
Ma'am, can I get some change?

610
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:35,660
I'll kill you!

611
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,220
- How much is one portion?
- 2,000 won.

612
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,070
- Give me half for 1,000 won.
- No.

613
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:44,680
- Please give me half!
- No.

614
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,090
Since when are you so strict?

615
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:49,500
- Can I get one portion?
- Yes.

616
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:54,000
- This is amazing!
- These are the best rice cakes.

617
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,170
- Where did these rice cakes come from?
- They're chewy. They're wheat cakes.

618
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,940
- Chew it. They're rice cakes.
- Try this.

619
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:02,880
Rice cakes are more expensive!
Wheat cakes are bad for eczema!

620
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,870
- This is itchy, isn't it?
- Isn't that why you're wearing it?

621
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:07,650
I'm only eating rice cakes
because this is itchy.

622
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:10,010
So if I eat wheat cakes,
I can't wear any clothes?

623
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:13,740
- Why are you arguing?
- We're not arguing! We're adults!

624
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:17,800
- Why would we fight?
- We're so close.

625
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,720
I'm dying here.

626
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,740
Is it okay to leave
the two of them alone?

627
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:07,950
Seo Joon Oh shouldn't
expose his identity right now.

628
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:13,700
Of course. Seo Joon Oh told me.

629
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,880
He said, when he comes back,
he can persuade

630
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:22,060
Manager Jung, Ji Ah,
and Secretary Jung to come around.

631
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,400
He said he was going to do that.

632
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:28,940
I know it won't be easy.

633
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:34,210
But just like how he acted on the island
and when we were coming back to Korea...

634
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:40,010
I'm certain he will bring everything
back to normal in his own way.

635
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:44,550
I truly believe that he'll do it.

636
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:17,010
Geez, I'm going to wash up!
I'm going to wash up, so wait out here.

637
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:19,740
Pay for me, and wait out here, got it?

638
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,900
Ki Joon.

639
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,010
I've been thinking...

640
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:43,440
I think you were right
about the rice cakes.

641
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,800
You've always been right...

642
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,390
Why did you do it?

643
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:02,520
I'm sorry.

644
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:05,870
- Hey, what about your injury?
- It's just a scar now. It's fine.

645
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:07,630
Oh, it healed well.

646
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:11,870
But it still hurts when I raise my arm.

647
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,180
I asked you why you did it.

648
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,260
I told you I'm sorry.

649
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,800
- Hey, can you roam around like this?
- No.

650
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,850
You can't. The prosecution
is searching for you.

651
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:26,370
So what? Are you going to report me?

652
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:31,090
I can't. How could I report you,
even if I'm a son of a bitch?

653
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:33,580
Don't tell anyone that you saw me today.

654
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:36,570
Why? What is it this time?
What are you planning to do?

655
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:41,710
What else? Now that I'm back,
I'm going to flip everything around.

656
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:46,440
Wow, these people are really shameless.
Jang Do Pal and Choi Tae Ho.

657
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,670
Hey, Tae Ho, that bastard.
Did you see that bastard cry?

658
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:53,060
- Hey, he's a good actor!
- He's good.

659
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:56,250
- What do you mean he's good?
- He's good! He's better than you.

660
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:59,550
You saw. He can cry out of the blue.
He's really good.

661
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:03,180
Don't underestimate CEO Jang and Tae Ho.

662
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:06,010
They have a lot more power

663
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:09,800
and it's been too long, so there's
no evidence either. Will you be okay?

664
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:13,120
Of course I won't. It'll be exhausting.

665
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:17,260
But I can't just stay still
and do nothing.

666
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:21,740
They think they can do whatever they
want, when they're only in entertainment.

667
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:25,150
Geez, they think if time passes
and the evidence is destroyed

668
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:27,990
their crimes disappear too.

669
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:32,100
What can I do?
What about Jae Hyun's murder?

670
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,160
I need to do this, even if I won't
be okay. I need to do it.

671
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,610
I should at least hope to resolve it.
What else can I do?

672
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:42,760
- See?
- Joon Oh, I'm so sorry.

673
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:50,510
I'm so sorry. No matter what the case is,
I can't take your side right now.

674
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:52,490
It just ended up this way.

675
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:59,090
I'm really... sorry. Geez.

676
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:04,320
Hey, you said you would believe me...

677
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:09,660
and be on my side,
when no one else believes me.

678
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:17,450
Look at this.
You just say whatever you want

679
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:20,200
and hear whatever you want.

680
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,750
Geez.

681
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:26,190
Hey.

682
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:32,030
If you were going to be sorry,
you shouldn't have done what you did!

683
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:35,250
Why do you keep apologizing?

684
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,030
I'm really so sorry.

685
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:47,720
I'm really sorry.

686
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:57,810
Ki Joon, the door code to your house
is still the same. 0831. My birthday.

687
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,300
- How do you know that?
- I was there earlier.

688
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,140
- Why would you do that?
- Because I came back late. Sorry.

689
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,870
Do you think you can just go into
anyone's house because it's late?

690
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:14,210
Well, it was really late.

691
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:17,080
Why do you live like that?
Is that how you were raised?

692
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,220
- I learned it from you--
- Hey, I taught you better.

693
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,470
- But it was so late--
- That doesn't mean you can sleep there.

694
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:27,660
But... I bought you that house.

695
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,170
- Really?
- I bought it for you.

696
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:33,510
- You're sorry, aren't you?
- About what?

697
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:38,630
You're sorry, aren't you?
Don't do that. Don't do that!

698
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:57,080
You're the only person
with different colored socks.

699
00:53:02,170 --> 00:53:05,220
- Please have some fruit!
- Oh, yes.

700
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,040
Yes, here you go.

701
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,690
- Thank you.
- Yes, here you go.

702
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,060
Have a seat.

703
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:14,330
By the way...

704
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:17,960
- Who's Seo Joon Oh?
- Oh that?

705
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,010
Mom, over here. The one in red.

706
00:53:21,010 --> 00:53:23,580
Oh, it's him.

707
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:27,630
My mom doesn't watch TV.
That's okay, right?

708
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:29,680
This is Seo Joon Oh.

709
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:34,610
I heard a lot about
how you've been helping our Bong Hee.

710
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:38,140
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, no problem.

711
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:41,780
Please continue to look after her
in the future.

712
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:43,550
Thank you.

713
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:47,880
Please have some fruit, and let me know
if there's anything you need.

714
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,150
- Yes.
- Please eat.

715
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:51,400
Thank you, Mother.

716
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,770
Oh! "Mother? Mother..."

717
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:58,370
Mom.

718
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:02,900
- Yes, please sit.
- Yes, please sit down.

719
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:07,550
Wow, it's good.

720
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:15,150
Yes, please have some.

721
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,120
- Here.
- Thank you.

722
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,540
- Here.
- Oh.

723
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:24,600
How does it feel to be back in Korea?
It must be a whole new feeling.

724
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,680
It doesn't feel that special.

725
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:36,820
Regarding what you had to resolve today,
did it go well?

726
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:38,800
Yes, I guess so.

727
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,530
- Joon Oh.
- Yeah?

728
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:48,210
- Are you in a bad mood?
- No!

729
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,180
Please don't mind us.
Please eat. Please eat.

730
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,370
Why aren't you offering me any?

731
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:59,160
It must feel awkward
because we've never met before.

732
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,540
What should we do? We can't feel awkward
if we want to work well together.

733
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:05,720
I'm sure it'll get better.

734
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:11,240
Joon Oh, what's wrong? You're making
them uncomfortable. Smile.

735
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,330
I just have bad memories
about government authorities.

736
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:21,670
You are probably aware.
I guess this kind of interaction...

737
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:23,790
is a little awkward for me.

738
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,660
That's right. You're aware, aren't you?
That's understandable.

739
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:31,020
Is this funny to you?

740
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:33,600
What's wrong with you?

741
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,950
This is our first meeting,
so I'm sure it'll get better.

742
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:41,860
I'll try my best to speak
casually with you first.

743
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:46,480
Oh, is that how you sound
when you speak casually?

744
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:50,040
Seo Joon Oh, what do you mean?

745
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,060
He's speaking in his casual tone
right now.

746
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:56,560
If he speaks casually with you,
you can do the same.

747
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,990
That doesn't mean
you can be rude to him though.

748
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:05,380
Lawyer Jo,
should we give them a briefing?

749
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,080
Oh, sure.

750
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:20,560
- Get going.
- Yes.

751
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:29,950
<i>We found out about this while we were
reinvestigating Shin Jae Hyun's case.</i>

752
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:33,740
Yoon So Hee, who testified at the time

753
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:39,160
<i>there was record of her statement saying
that she had evidence that it was murder.</i>

754
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,340
<i>We asked the police officer
who was responsible for this case</i>

755
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:45,170
<i>and he said So Hee
did give that statement</i>

756
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:50,430
but she ultimately insisted
that Seo Joon Oh was the murderer

757
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:53,680
so her statements were inconsistent.

758
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,220
So Hee was probably threatened
by Jang Do Pal.

759
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,780
That's why she changed her story.

760
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:03,540
Because she knew
about Jae Hyun's murder...

761
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:06,330
In the end...

762
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:10,960
That's why, in order to find out
the truth about So Hee's death

763
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,250
we must catch the murderer
who killed Shin Jae Hyun.

764
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:17,870
And that's how
we can clear your charges as well.

765
00:57:17,870 --> 00:57:21,650
But we don't have any witness statements

766
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:25,930
or any decisive evidence,
so we're in a frustrating situation.

767
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,880
<i>The truth is,
I've been looking into something myself.</i>

768
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:37,380
<i>A package will land in Korea
very shortly.</i>

769
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,520
<i>The lost items that were found
on the deserted island.</i>

770
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:48,620
In with that stuff,
I found something that looked familiar.

771
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,270
Go faster.

772
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:24,530
These are the pictures I received.

773
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,650
Seo Joon Oh.

774
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:34,780
Isn't this the cellphone
that Ji Ah was waving in the cave?

775
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:38,630
It was really dark that night.
Wasn't it black?

776
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:41,610
This was So Hee's cellphone.

777
00:58:41,610 --> 00:58:42,930
Pardon?

778
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,470
How do you know that?

779
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:54,180
She stubbornly only used
this cellphone for many years.

780
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:57,910
It was very dirty,
and it broke many times

781
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:02,370
but she insisted on keeping this one,
without even changing the case.

782
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:07,950
It didn't suit her image as an actress,
so I offered to buy her a new one

783
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:11,750
but she said she liked that
it felt familiar in her hands.

784
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:15,980
- Deputy Kim. Can you check it out?
- Oh, sure.

785
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:19,930
Hm, send this to the other offices.

786
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:26,030
Yeah. Bring it here for now.

787
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:33,190
- It's not here.
- What do you mean?

788
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:35,730
I'm here because you said it was here!

789
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:39,810
It's not here. Someone picked it up.
Who are you?

790
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,840
- Congresswoman Jo.
- Yeah?

791
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:00,060
The lost items from the deserted island
have arrived. What should I do with them?

792
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:03,820
Our team dispersed,
so they weren't sure where to send them

793
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:06,420
which is why I told them
to bring the items here.

794
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:09,050
- Investigator Oh.
- Yes.

795
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:12,500
Do I still look like a chairwoman to you?

796
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:16,720
Don't ask me that,
just get rid of them! Burn them!

797
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,770
I have enough to worry about already.

798
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:21,330
I apologize.

799
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,810
You still call me
"Investigator Oh" too...

800
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:28,730
Let's find that cellphone!

801
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:34,340
Let's bring it back here!

802
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,180
Okay.

803
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,370
Let's find it.

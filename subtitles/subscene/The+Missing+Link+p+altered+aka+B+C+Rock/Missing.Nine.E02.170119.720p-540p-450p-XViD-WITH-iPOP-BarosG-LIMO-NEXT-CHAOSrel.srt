00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:18,590
We're going down!

3
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,660
I'm in here! Please save me!

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,700
- Declare an emergency!
- Roger!

5
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,300
Mayday! Mayday!

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,230
Joon Oh! Joon Oh! Joon Oh!

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,650
What the hell is this?

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,170
Ji Ah!

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,500
Wait here. I'll come back
after I check the situation.

10
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,580
<i>Control, this is 079er. We are in a dive!</i>

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,770
We're crashing, you bastards!

12
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,700
<i>Mom, can I stop doing this?</i>

13
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,240
There's no need for your daughter
to be a diver just because you are.

14
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,000
- You can stop, then.
- Really?

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,470
Wait, why did you give up so quickly?

16
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,860
I never expected you
to live a life like mine.

17
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,390
People should do
what they want to do in life.

18
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,380
Then why did you make me go into
the water and make me do this every day?

19
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,720
This is all I can do for you.

20
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,180
I'm unable to leave my child
an inheritance to live on

21
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:17,810
so teaching my child how to eat and live
is the least I can do as a mother.

22
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,680
Do what you want to do,
and come back if it's too hard.

23
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,120
I'll always be here.

24
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,570
Joon Oh! Seo Joon Oh, wake up!
Seo Joon Oh!

25
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,420
Seo Joon Oh! Wake up! Seo Joon Oh!

26
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,010
Seo Joon Oh.

27
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,330
No! Seo Joon Oh, please wake up!

28
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,830
Seo Joon Oh!
Are you awake, Seo Joon Oh?

29
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,520
The others... Huh?

30
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,190
Seo Joon Oh!

31
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:07,960
Seo Joon Oh! No! Seo Joon Oh, wake up!

32
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,210
Seo Joon Oh!

33
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,520
Wake up! Please!

34
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,290
There's water.

35
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,490
Oh! No, you can't! Don't touch that!

36
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,010
You can't drink this yet.

37
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,450
Why? What's going on?
Where did you come from?

38
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,590
Where are we? Huh?

39
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:47,500
Hey, why can't I drink that?

40
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,470
Hey, why?

41
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,720
Hey, where the heck are we? Huh?

42
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,450
Hey! I'm asking you where we are!

43
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,400
Your actions tell me you're okay.
Wait here for a little bit.

44
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,820
And just in case, don't touch that.

45
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:06,270
Hey, where are you going?
Hey! Hey! What...

46
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:08,170
Did our plane crash?

47
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,170
But... But I'm... I'm okay!

48
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,620
What is this? Is... Is this the engine?

49
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,110
Ouch, that's hot!

50
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,780
Ki Joon! Ye... Yeol! Hey, Ji Ah!

51
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,990
My phone... Hey, where...

52
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,830
Hey! Hey!

53
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,870
Shit!

54
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,120
What do we do...

55
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,700
What do I do, Mom?

56
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:02,000
<i>What do we do...</i>

57
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,440
<i>[Episode 2]</i>
According to the doctor

58
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,810
her memory has been compromised
temporarily, due to encephalomeningitis.

59
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:30,170
Anyway, we will try everything
to recover her memory--

60
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,790
Investigator Oh, about her...

61
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,040
Don't you think she's too calm?

62
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,010
She can clearly express
her emotions and opinions

63
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:45,710
and her clear speech tells me
she didn't go through that much hardship.

64
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,470
She's much too calm.

65
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,520
Anyway, whether it's medicine
or hypnosis, do everything you can.

66
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,830
Yes, I understand.

67
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,010
Let's go.

68
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,280
- Be careful!
- Yes! I'm coming!

69
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,220
Hurry up. Go.

70
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,690
Ra Bong Hee!

71
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,990
Geez, can you come with us for a moment?

72
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,960
There's someone who wants to meet you.

73
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,980
Who is...

74
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,690
- It'll just be a moment.
- Please come this way.

75
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,710
- Why are you doing this?
- Hey! You'll know when you get there.

76
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,440
- Who are you--
- Hey! Don't fighting back!

77
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,010
Geez, this girl!

78
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,920
Who the hell are you?

79
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,630
Damn it... Who are you?

80
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,360
Yes... We're... Um, who are we?

81
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,600
Who the hell are you?

82
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,070
Oh, we're... here to explore
the mud flat.

83
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,960
Oh... Yes, we heard that the octopuses
are good these days, so we're...

84
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,640
- Bong Hee!
- Hey, catch her!

85
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:56,000
- Stop right there!
- Bong Hee!

86
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:03,640
- Go!
- Hurry up!

87
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,640
- Follow her!
- Excuse me!

88
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,490
Wait!

89
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,030
My jacket!

90
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:25,050
- What the hell are you saying?
- That's why I'm here!

91
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,820
Hey, you son of a bitch! Hey, come here!

92
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,020
Hey, you bastards! Come here!

93
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,690
<i>Seo Joon Oh!</i>

94
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,660
Hey... Hey, let's go!

95
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,530
- Let's... Let's go!
- Hurry!

96
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,810
So?

97
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,740
Oh.

98
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,170
Okay.

99
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,260
Oh, yes.

100
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,120
Here you go, Sir.

101
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,570
Bong Hee. Are you all right?

102
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,100
Yes.

103
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,090
Why did our plane crash? Why?

104
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,990
Damn it! Shit!

105
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,780
The plane couldn't even handle that?

106
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,260
This plane was so expensive!

107
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,260
Why... Why can't I drink that?

108
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,020
Nice!

109
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,920
Why isn't anyone here?

110
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:52,710
Hey, what? Is this all yours?

111
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,950
Give it to me. Give it to me!

112
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,950
I'll buy some for you when we get back.

113
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,580
Give it to me!
I told you to give it to me!

114
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,540
Wait, why are you acting like this?

115
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,930
I told you not to eat that!
We're on a deserted island!

116
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,600
I was just...

117
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,000
What did you just say?

118
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,330
This is a deserted island. Everyone died,
and we're on the only ones alive.

119
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,300
That's all we have left to eat!

120
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,240
What did you say? Huh?
Hey, we're on a deserted island?

121
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,820
The plane crashed,
and now it's just the two of us?

122
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,360
Have you gone to that side?

123
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,480
What about the others?
Did you look for them?

124
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,930
What about Ki Joon, Ji Ah, Yeol, and
Tae Ho? Did you go all the way to end?

125
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,910
There's a hidden camera, isn't there?
I should have known earlier.

126
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,500
You're not a newbie stylist.
You're a rookie actress, right?

127
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,870
Where's the camera? Huh?

128
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:13,030
What about the others?

129
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:21,150
What happened to the others?

130
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,670
<i>Before all of this...</i>

131
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:40,730
<i>They were family.
We worked together for many years.</i>

132
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:45,400
<i>There are rumors going around
that this incident...</i>

133
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:50,170
<i>was fabricated by Legend Entertainment!
Does that make any sense?</i>

134
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:55,350
<i>After the only survivor of the crash,
Ra Bong Hee, returned</i>

135
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,370
<i>the families of Legend Entertainment
have been pressing for the truth</i>

136
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:03,060
<i>in order to find out
if the rest of the missing are alive.</i>

137
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,300
<i>The fan clubs for those who are
still missing gathered at 10 a.m.</i>

138
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:11,530
<i>and through the question and answer
period with Seo Joon Oh's stylist, Ms. Ra</i>

139
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,950
<i>they pressed for the truth
to be revealed.</i>

140
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:19,820
<i>For the purpose of the ones
who are still missing we ask Ra Bong Hee</i>

141
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,630
<i>for her testimony of what she remembers.</i>

142
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,950
<i>If we follow the fan clubs'
joint statements</i>

143
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,810
<i>there are no statements from
the authorities involved in this case</i>

144
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,540
<i>so many malicious rumors
are going around...</i>

145
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,220
A deserted island!

146
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:40,860
She regained some of her memory, and
she said she was on a deserted island!

147
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,360
- Is she certain?
- Yes. She is.

148
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,390
Bring Ra Bong Hee
to Yeomchang-dong right now.

149
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,880
Sure.

150
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,600
Why can't you do it?

151
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,120
Tae Young, this case

152
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,380
came down to us from the top!

153
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,080
If we take care of this well, you and I--

154
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,270
There's something else
I must do. I'm sorry.

155
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,670
Is it because of your sister?

156
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,940
If rumors start--

157
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,170
I will work hard to prevent any problems.
I have Lawyer Jo as well.

158
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:22,370
Do you think your sister is still alive?

159
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,430
- I can only hope.
- And if not?

160
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,780
After you throw away
your opportunities for success

161
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,180
and hang on to this case, if your
sister is dead, what will you do then?

162
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,200
Whether my sister is alive...

163
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,650
or dead, I will have to do my job.

164
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,990
And what do you think your job is?

165
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:50,430
The truth. I will reveal the truth.

166
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:55,750
It's my job to help the victims in
the name of law. That's your job as well.

167
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,810
It's not our job...

168
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:03,130
to manipulate the truth,
like we did for this case.

169
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:17,020
So the plane crashed,
and only the two of you survived?

170
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:22,370
So, Seo Joon and Ra Bong Hee,
just the two of you.

171
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,030
Yes.

172
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,720
<i>Don't believe everything
she says. Get confirmation.</i>

173
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,310
Get more out of her! Ask her for details.

174
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:40,000
<i>I don't know
how you'll feel about this...</i>

175
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,090
But how did it feel after
you knew you were on a deserted island?

176
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,960
You don't believe me, do you?

177
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,850
I'm a girl who can't remember
what happened

178
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,490
for the last four months.

179
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,410
It's strange that I suddenly
remembered a part of it.

180
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:02,990
<i>And it's also strange
that I survived the plane crash.</i>

181
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:06,800
So you're wondering
if I'm telling the truth or not...

182
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,970
And asking me trick questions.

183
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,040
No, I'm...

184
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,870
I don't remember everything...

185
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,930
about what happened to them.

186
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,880
But...

187
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,240
If I tell you everything
that I do remember...

188
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:36,930
If I tell you everything
I saw and felt in detail...

189
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,740
Will you believe me?

190
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,400
Will you believe me...

191
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,360
<i>And for those people
who might be dead or alive...</i>

192
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,820
For those people...

193
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,430
Can you go save them?

194
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:13,040
<i>If... If you can...</i>

195
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:18,210
I'll do everything you ask
to regain my memory.

196
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,540
So...

197
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,180
So, please...

198
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,830
Please don't abandon those people.

199
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,680
Here we go.

200
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,990
Let's accept it.

201
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,690
One day...

202
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,990
I wondered why it had to happen to me...

203
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,000
<i>Out of all the people...</i>

204
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
<i>Why did this happen to me?</i>

205
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,720
<i>I was full of resentment.</i>

206
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,380
This is for encephalomeningitis.
It might help with your memory.

207
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:26,730
And on another day... I felt pain...

208
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:31,810
<i>because people died.</i>

209
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,620
<i>And on a different day...</i>

210
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,890
<i>I was thankful that I was even alive.</i>

211
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:11,910
<i>And on a different day...</i>

212
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,310
<i>I felt desperation</i>

213
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,430
<i>because I wanted to live.</i>

214
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,450
Hey! It's... It's a boat!
Hey, it's a boat!

215
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,910
Over here! Over here! Over...

216
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:33,220
Hey. Hey. Hey! Hey! Hey!

217
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,820
Over here! Over here!

218
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,010
Good job! Good job!

219
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,140
- I think we'll survive!
- Over here! Save us!

220
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,660
Go! Go!

221
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,140
<i>We experienced hundreds</i>

222
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,870
<i>of different feelings
and moods every day.</i>

223
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,820
Our bodies got injured...

224
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,030
<i>And our hearts got sick...</i>

225
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,120
- Oh, are you hurt? Let's see!
- It hurts.

226
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,900
Hey, this won't open!

227
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,850
It was as if we were waiting to die...

228
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:21,460
as we endured it sluggishly, day by day.

229
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,770
But we saw something.

230
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:31,200
What was it?

231
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,100
Hope.

232
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,940
10... 15...

233
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,900
20... 25!

234
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,440
- You didn't see his body, right?
- I didn't.

235
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,380
He was saved. In 25 days.

236
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:00,510
- We can live too!
- We can! We can live!

237
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:05,530
We can survive! We can survive!

238
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:08,050
We can survive!

239
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,910
We're going home! We're going home!
Home! Home!

240
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:16,880
<i>No matter what it takes,
we're going home!</i>

241
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,040
- Home! Home!
- We're going home!

242
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,460
After seeing hope
right in front of our eyes

243
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,060
a thought crossed my mind.

244
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:36,120
<i>"Let's survive for now."</i>

245
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,680
<i>"If we stay alive for now..."</i>

246
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:43,270
"someone will surely come to save us."

247
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,400
<i>Did you think about
looking for other survivors?</i>

248
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,730
<i>We tried looking for them...</i>

249
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,490
- Seo Joon Oh, why did you come out?
- Hey, let's stop for today.

250
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,270
Is it because the grass is prickly?

251
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,680
No, I'm hungry. We should eat
if we're going to move around.

252
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,770
- You ate bread this morning.
- Hey, let's live.

253
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:16,850
No, we can't stop!
Let's look for a little longer!

254
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,460
Ask her how they lived
during those four months.

255
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:26,140
I'll ask you a detailed question.
How... did you survive?

256
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:32,500
<i>There were no people...</i>

257
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,860
<i>And because there were no people,
there were no houses.</i>

258
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:41,030
<i>And because there were no houses,
there was no light.</i>

259
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:44,260
<i>If you were in a place like that
for four months...</i>

260
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,820
How do you think you would have lived?

261
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,360
Is that a weapon?

262
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,120
Oh, be careful.

263
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,630
Gosh, take off your gloves!

264
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,670
No. No. Wrap it around the big tree.

265
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,300
- This one?
- With your fingers!

266
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,290
- It stings.
- I'll do it. Move.

267
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,090
Then you should have done it
from the start!

268
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:15,830
Three! Yes! That's right! Yes!

269
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,160
- One, two...
- Three!

270
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,410
- Use your strength!
- I'm holding it up! Three!

271
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:22,870
- Three!
- Four!

272
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,040
One...

273
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,940
- Pull it one more time!
- A little more! This way!

274
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,520
Left or right? I can't see!

275
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,710
Lift it higher.
When will you do this side?

276
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,410
If we go near the grass, the grass
is getting water from somewhere.

277
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,620
So if we plug this in,
drops over water will come out.

278
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:47,670
Oh, it's coming out! Look!
It's coming out! See?

279
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,390
It is.

280
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,420
We should drink it next year.

281
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,050
We don't have to ration for 25 days

282
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:58,230
if we've already been here
for a few days, right?

283
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,540
This won't work.

284
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:04,690
For our remaining days, I'll just
drink this. You can have the rest. Okay?

285
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,840
And for food, I don't eat much.

286
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,790
I'll just have this, and you have
a lot here, so I'll take this too, okay?

287
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,170
Put it down.

288
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,890
How many rations?

289
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,660
Her statements have been good
for the last few days

290
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,520
so what should we do now?

291
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,890
Make a call to China for me.

292
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,220
Yes, around Huizhou, China
where Ra Bong Hee was found

293
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,640
there are 143 islands.

294
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:48,100
Out of those, we are assuming
97 islands are uninhabited.

295
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:54,360
We requested that they contact us if any
trace of human life or a body is found.

296
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,010
How long did they say it'll take?

297
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:59,020
I'm... I'm not sure, so people who know--

298
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:03,120
How long will it take
to search those 97 islands?

299
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:07,450
We asked the specialists
to start the search as soon as--

300
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:11,870
I don't want to hear that they'll try
their best and that they'll work hard!

301
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,500
Tell me the facts. The facts, okay?

302
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,030
The... The truth is... So...

303
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,300
If we have to mark all 97 islands

304
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:25,560
and recruit people to search
the surrounding water

305
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,540
it'll take around three months.

306
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,760
It looks like I'll be fired
in the meantime.

307
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:41,550
- Where is Ra Bong Hee right now?
- She's at home in Namhae Island.

308
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,680
- Did you give her security guards?
- Yes.

309
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,620
Tell them to protect her
so that the reporters can't get to her!

310
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,970
If the media finds out about her
memory loss, they'll press us harder.

311
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,630
Yes, I'll tell them.

312
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,570
You can continue with
our investigation in Yeomchang-dong.

313
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,060
Continue to record it and send it to me.

314
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,970
Yeah, Lawyer Jo.

315
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,780
Yes, Prosecutor Yoon,
they found your sister.

316
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:15,150
They found your sister
in Huizhou, China.

317
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,870
But...

318
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,840
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

319
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,080
I'm sorry, Sir.

320
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,880
Where in China?

321
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,170
I'll bring back lots of fish!

322
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:13,220
- What are you doing?
- Isn't it obvious?

323
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,970
You don't have to do that.
People who look will see it.

324
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:18,790
Here's your lunch.

325
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,160
Hey, wait!

326
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,490
- Give me some more.
- No.

327
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:31,890
Hey, I'm working! Give me a little more.

328
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,190
No one asked you to do this.

329
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,840
I better not eat it.

330
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:18,470
Excuse me. Sir.

331
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:24,090
- Your barbecue is ready.
- Huh?

332
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,550
Would you like some wine, Sir?

333
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,850
What is this? Pineapple...

334
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,500
Pizza!

335
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,280
Excuse me, would you like
some barbecue, Sir?

336
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,190
- I don't really like pork.
- Okay. Okay.

337
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,630
Here's some spicy seafood noodle soup!

338
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,510
- Oh!
- Have some!

339
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,570
- Bonjour.
- Hey, Byung Joo!

340
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,290
Do you like shrimp?

341
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:12,300
This is why I have you, Byung Joo! Hey!

342
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,170
Thank you! Sausages.

343
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:18,900
Wake up. Excuse me.

344
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,150
Is it delicious?

345
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,130
Why are you eating this right now?

346
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,840
You're crazy! You're crazy!
You're crazy! Huh? You're crazy!

347
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,270
Why are you eating this?

348
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,370
- No, it wasn't me!
- Gosh, really.

349
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,850
Are you crazy? Are you?
Why did you eat this? Why? Why? Why?

350
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:50,290
It wasn't me! It wasn't!
I was dreaming about eating.

351
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,050
Gosh, that's gross!

352
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,620
- I... I'm burping because I'm hungry.
- You're got to be kidding me.

353
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,390
I was running all over this island and
saving this food so that we can live!

354
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,930
What do we do if you eat it all?

355
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:04,980
I told you I was dreaming!
Would I have eaten this in my right mind?

356
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,650
You're crazy! You're crazy!
You ate all this to save yourself!

357
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:10,080
Hey!

358
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:14,040
This girl... Hey!

359
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,090
Are you going to keep
talking to me like that? Huh? Crazy?

360
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,630
You're my stylist and I'm your artist!

361
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:24,100
What stylist calls her artist crazy?
Do you want to be fired?

362
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:29,610
Hey, if we're saved like that Alden guy

363
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:32,340
I'll send boxes of these to your house.

364
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:37,140
So be careful what you say.
If not, I'll really fire you, got it?

365
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,160
Yes.

366
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,810
Since I already...

367
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,880
I'm sorry. I didn't burp. I'm sorry.

368
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,410
What will you do now? Huh?
I ate everything.

369
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:56,080
I ate everything. There's some honey,
but the food is gone. What will you do?

370
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,230
What else can we do?

371
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,200
We have to hunt.

372
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,960
Who are you?

373
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,750
Make a fire.
I'll find food for us to eat.

374
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,990
How can I make a fire without a lighter?

375
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:16,070
I'm asking you because we don't have
one. Would I have asked if we had one?

376
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,950
Make one for us!

377
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:21,000
Hey, what are you going to catch?

378
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,500
How do I make a fire?

379
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,780
Geez, I should have gone
on "Law of the Jungle."

380
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:50,750
Damn it. I knew it wouldn't work.

381
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:59,390
- Where did you get that?
- I found it.

382
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,570
What are you doing?

383
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:03,340
I'm making a fire.
I'm making a fire with the lens.

384
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,340
That is just glass!
It won't start a fire.

385
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,750
You need a convex mirror
to make a fire. That won't work.

386
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:11,610
Hey, why are you telling me
that now? I've been here for hours!

387
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:15,850
Because I just saw you. Anyway,
make a fire. I'll catch some fish.

388
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:18,090
- This is a present.
- How...

389
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,450
It's a present!

390
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,950
Oh, I got one!

391
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,030
Wow! That scared me!

392
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:45,780
Geez, that scared me.

393
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,670
I almost caused a fire.

394
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,570
I was the one
who set this all up earlier today.

395
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:11,750
Hey, what did you do for a living?
There's nothing you can't do.

396
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:16,050
It's not that there's nothing I can't do,
but there are many things you can't do.

397
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,460
And can you stop calling me "Hey"?
I have a name. Ra Bong Hee.

398
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,260
- Fine, Ra Bong Hee.
- This looks good.

399
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,820
Hey, the way I see it,
I think a deserted island suits you.

400
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,960
You were born to live here.

401
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,070
I can't just starve to death
after what we did to survive.

402
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,220
I should make it work
until we're rescued.

403
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,490
- It looks delicious.
- Here.

404
00:40:40,490 --> 00:40:42,960
- What?
- Eat it. It's ready.

405
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,670
- Just like this?
- Yes!

406
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,660
- I can't take the bones out.
- Pardon?

407
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,470
I choked on a fish bone when
I was little, so I can't do it anymore.

408
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,700
Take out the bones for me.

409
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,690
Wait, then what is it
that you can actually do?

410
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,510
Geez, it looks like you forgot already.

411
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,750
Hey, do you really want to be fi--

412
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:09,330
Hey, do I really have to say
the same thing over and over again?

413
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:12,750
Do you really have to make me
into an indecent and petty person

414
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:18,270
by making my heart ache
as I keep threatening to fire you?

415
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:19,700
I'm exhausted!

416
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:24,450
Sure. Okay, fine.

417
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:31,930
Hey, eat some while you take out
the bones. When you're eating fish

418
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,410
it's more delicious
if you eat it like that.

419
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,430
Here, okay? Here, you have some.

420
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,670
And I'll have some too.

421
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:49,460
- Isn't it good?
- Wow, it's so good!

422
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,510
Hey, we should have eaten this
from the beginning.

423
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,390
We shouldn't have eaten snacks...

424
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:56,650
- Hey, eat this.
- Okay.

425
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,270
Bones.

426
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:03,360
Let's cook them all.

427
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:37,030
Wake up. Seo Joon Oh!

428
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:40,310
- What?
- Hurry up! Come out here.

429
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,430
Where are we going?

430
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,940
- What? Is something there?
- There are sounds...

431
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,240
- Where?
- Listen carefully.

432
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,000
- What is it?
- Over there. Over there.

433
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,750
- You can hear it, right?
- I think we heard it wrong.

434
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,340
No! No way!

435
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,650
Over there.

436
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:12,730
Damn it.

437
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,730
Seo Joon Oh, do you see that?
Seo Joon Oh, do you see it? Seo Joon...

438
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:22,020
- Seo Joon Oh, what are you doing?
- I'm farsighted. I can see better. Wait.

439
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,830
Stop it!

440
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:29,100
Let's move in on the count of three.

441
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:54,000
Yeol. Hey. Hey. Yeol!

442
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,360
Ye... Ye... Hey, Yeol!

443
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,780
Hey, Yeol!

444
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,070
One, two...

445
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,350
Here you go.

446
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,890
That's it. Like that.

447
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,730
Let's drink some more. Open wider.

448
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,460
Oh, you're awake?

449
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:20,060
How's your arm? Oh...

450
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,160
It's okay thanks to you.

451
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,420
That's a relief. Oh, sit down.
I was making porridge.

452
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,920
There's nothing but fish and clams here.

453
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,690
It's almost ready.

454
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:35,850
It looks good. You can eat it with...

455
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:39,890
Oh, drink it with that hand.

456
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:41,390
Thank you.

457
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,840
By the way, there's something
I'm curious about.

458
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,840
How did you not die?

459
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,640
- Are you okay? Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

460
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:57,590
Oh, it came out weird, didn't it?
What I meant was...

461
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:00,040
How did you survive
and get all the way over here?

462
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,760
And how did you know we were here?

463
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,250
That's what I wanted to ask.

464
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:09,790
Um, after the plane crashed...

465
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:12,330
and I woke up...

466
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,860
<i>I thought I was the only survivor.</i>

467
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:37,160
<i>I waited for days</i>

468
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,430
<i>hoping that a rescue team would come.</i>

469
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:48,240
<i>But then I saw a light last night.</i>

470
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:54,070
Oh, that light. We were cooking
and eating fish last night.

471
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:58,150
Do you think they'll come for us?

472
00:46:58,730 --> 00:46:59,820
To save us?

473
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,310
Over there,
it seemed like A-L-D-E-N was here.

474
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:05,910
I don't know exactly
what country he was from

475
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:08,370
but I think he was here a long time ago.

476
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:13,950
He lived on this island for 25 days.

477
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,970
I think he was rescued.

478
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:27,970
Haven't you thought that
we might end up dying on this island?

479
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:40,970
Right now, the chances
that they won't come are pretty high.

480
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,310
Why do you think that, Lee Yeol?

481
00:47:45,310 --> 00:47:47,010
I saw him.

482
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:52,200
Alden.

483
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:24,710
Is that...

484
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,440
really true?

485
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:33,010
If people found this island
and came here even once

486
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,120
the people that I saw...

487
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:38,380
They would have been collected.

488
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,640
Because they're human bodies.

489
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,320
Geez, it's cold. You're awake?

490
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,580
- Joon Oh!
- Yeah.

491
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:01,360
Geez, I couldn't sleep
because of the two of you talking.

492
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,670
What about food?
Did you eat something?

493
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:07,020
Hey, is that enough? Huh?

494
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:11,040
You should eat fish. Fish.
We have a lot of fish.

495
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,930
Hey, let's cook a few more
of the fish from yesterday.

496
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,500
Don't we have any left?
Oh, that's right, we ate all of them.

497
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,730
Hey, then go and catch some more fish.

498
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:29,790
Hey, you're going to make
my heart ache again...

499
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:34,630
Hey, if you keep acting like this,
I'll fire you when we get back to Seoul!

500
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,360
Okay, fire me.

501
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:42,790
Fire me, you son of a bitch.

502
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,200
Fire me. If you're lucky enough
to escape this island, fire me!

503
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:54,430
But you...
won't be able to get out of here.

504
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:57,450
Neither of us will be able
to escape this place!

505
00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:02,970
- Hey, what... Hey, are you crazy? Ouch!
- You horrible bastard...

506
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:06,450
- Let go. Hey, let go.
- You son of a bitch!

507
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:09,130
- You can catch your own fish!
- I won't eat them.

508
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:11,420
You son of a bitch!

509
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,920
Joon Oh! Joon Oh! Joon Oh!
Joon Oh. Joon Oh. Joon Oh, get up.

510
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:17,920
What?

511
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,280
Light.

512
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:48,150
A person.

513
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:50,110
It's a person!

514
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:52,930
Hey. Hey. Hey!
Where do you think.... Hey.

515
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:55,580
I bet they're not here
to rescue us, right?

516
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:59,460
Joon Oh, they could be
like us. Survivors.

517
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,790
Joon Oh, they could be people
we know! I'll be right back.

518
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:06,570
Yeol! Yeol! Hey, where do you
think you're going? Hey!

519
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:21,040
Hey, Yeol!

520
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,850
Where is it?

521
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:35,180
Let's go that way!

522
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,840
I think it was around here somewhere.

523
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:47,690
Let's split up. If you find someone
or if something happens, scream loudly.

524
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:48,910
Okay.

525
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,630
Excuse me! Is anyone out there?

526
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:24,040
Here!

527
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,130
Please help!

528
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:31,930
Bong Hee!

529
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:37,080
Please help me!

530
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,700
Please save me!

531
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,790
You should have been more careful!

532
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,880
Geez, come on.

533
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:14,530
<i>There's something I'm curious about.</i>

534
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:17,850
When you first saw that light...

535
00:53:17,850 --> 00:53:21,980
Why did you run towards it
without looking back?

536
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:29,200
Did you do it to help another survivor?
Is that way?

537
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:38,880
<i>I didn't go to help anyone...</i>

538
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,040
To be honest, I wanted to be helped.

539
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:50,740
No matter who it was
or where they were on that island...

540
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:55,530
I thought they would be
better off than we were.

541
00:53:56,730 --> 00:54:00,020
I completely understand how you felt.

542
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:03,770
Yes, I think I would have
felt the same way.

543
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:06,930
<i>Are you on a date?
Stop the useless chatter</i>

544
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:09,170
and ask her who that survivor was!

545
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:13,170
Yes... Yes, Oh... Yes. Um...

546
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:15,040
So, Ra Bong Hee.

547
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,490
<i>The light from that cellphone.</i>

548
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:21,500
The survivor that you found
by putting yourself in danger.

549
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,310
Who was it?

550
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:28,280
Do you remember? Do you?

551
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:33,290
It's so cold.

552
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,990
You scared me.

553
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:47,020
Thank you for saving me.

554
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:49,530
You would have done the same for me.

555
00:54:50,170 --> 00:54:52,780
But I'm still thankful.

556
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,700
I won't forget it.

557
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:59,440
Don't forget it, okay?
Cherish this memory.

558
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,700
- Joon Oh!
- Earlier...

559
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,470
- Yeol.
- Bong Hee!

560
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:05,740
Are you okay? What happened?

561
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:08,190
- I tripped.
- Are you hurt?

562
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:09,410
No, I'm fine.

563
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:13,910
- That's why you two shouldn't have...
- Let's go. It's cold.

564
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:19,160
<i>You must remember, Ra Bong Hee.</i>

565
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,090
Who was that person?

566
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:24,470
Who was that person

567
00:55:24,470 --> 00:55:27,010
and are they still alive
or did they die on that island?

568
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:28,480
The thing is...

569
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,680
Do you remember?

570
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,730
That person...

571
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,440
No!

572
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,100
No!

573
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:42,930
That person...

574
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,670
I definitely...

575
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:08,200
I definitely saw that person.

576
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,680
Who was it that you saw?

577
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:37,530
I saw her face...

578
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:45,430
I'm sorry.

579
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:53,600
Goodness.

580
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,610
Joon Oh...

581
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:12,770
- Ji Ah!
- Ji Ah!

582
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:18,480
Ji Ah! Ji Ah. Ji Ah.

583
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,350
Wh... Wh... What happened?

584
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:23,790
Where were you?
Why did you leave me alone?

585
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:27,010
Ji Ah, are you hurt?

586
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:31,900
- Don't cry. Don't cry.
- Hey, how did you survive all this time?

587
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:35,890
Hey, were you alone all this time?
Were you alone?

588
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:39,730
No, I was with someone.

589
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,980
They found the body under a cliff.
(In Chinese)

590
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:10,390
But the crash wasn't
the cause of death. It was murder.

591
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:17,090
He said she was found at the bottom of
a cliff. But it wasn't the plane crash...

592
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:22,840
But he thinks someone killed her.

593
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:29,880
<i>I stayed here after the plane crash</i>

594
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,590
and this is where we met.

595
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:35,530
- What's so weird about that?
- Just follow me.

596
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:39,630
- She's anxious and won't eat anything.
- After all that happened...

597
00:58:39,630 --> 00:58:41,910
She tried to kill herself a few days ago.

598
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:43,070
Why?

599
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:46,330
She said she wants do die.
She said she's miserable here.

600
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:59,750
What is his relationship to her?
(In Chinese)

601
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,010
He wants to know their relationship.

602
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,210
Tell him she was his younger sister.

603
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:44,520
Are you okay?

604
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:06,120
From a medical point of view

605
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,400
she should remember everything.

606
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:11,740
Are you saying...

607
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:16,450
Ra Bong Hee remembers everything,
but she's pretending she can't?

608
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:18,940
<i>Is that what you're saying?</i>

609
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:20,930
<i>This is all I have to say.</i>

610
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:24,690
<i>From a medical perspective,
this situation doesn't make any sense!</i>

616
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:09,540
<i>He kills others so he can live. He can
do it again. We're on a deserted island.</i>

617
01:02:09,540 --> 01:02:12,650
<i>If they find out, it'll stir up a mess.</i>

618
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:14,500
<i>- Are you sick?
- It's not a fatal illness.</i>

619
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:15,720
<i>What's not fatal?</i>

620
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:18,350
<i>We don't know who's alive or not...</i>

621
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:20,410
<i>Do you think everyone else died?</i>

622
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:23,230
<i>- Tae Ho?
- You were alive!</i>

623
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:26,190
<i>Whether we starve or we're killed,
we're going to die here anyway!</i>

- Hey, Yoon So Hee!</i>

625
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:31,480
<i>He's Seo Joon Oh,
a former Dreamers member.</i>

626
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:33,440
<i>He has a unique theory.</i>

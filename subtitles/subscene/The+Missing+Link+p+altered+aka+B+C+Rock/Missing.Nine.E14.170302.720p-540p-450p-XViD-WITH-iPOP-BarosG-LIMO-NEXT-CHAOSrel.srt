1
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,370
<i>I want to live.</i>

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,600
<i>You should.</i>

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,380
<i>I'll save you.</i>

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,900
<i>Get out of here. I'll take care of this.</i>

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,130
<i>And after I leave?</i>

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,720
<i>Take a taxi around the block.</i>

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,500
<i>You have to arrive when the others arrive
to avoid suspicion.</i>

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:34,970
- Save... Save me...
- Jae Hyun. Jae Hyun...

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,620
<i>Sa... Save...</i>

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,250
<i>Let's send you off. In one shot.</i>

11
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,310
<i>Die! Die!</i>

12
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,830
This is what really happened

13
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:51,410
when Choi Tae Ho and Jang Do Pal
killed Shin Jae Hyun four years ago.

14
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,050
And those two...
disguised it as a suicide.

15
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,820
- And Yoon So Hee recorded it?
- Yes.

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,410
And I think So Hee was killed
because of this.

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,260
I could have gone straight
to the prosecution

18
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,830
but there is one reason...
why I came here first.

19
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:25,830
As the chairwoman of the special
investigation committee of this case

20
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,780
please save me, Seo Joon Oh,
the last survivor.

21
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:36,750
Please tell everyone

22
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,460
that I am alive, and that I've returned.

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,930
And to prove my innocence...

24
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:54,180
It's not like I did anything wrong...

25
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:57,610
but I'll talk about it
at the press conference.

26
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,500
What an unlucky year we've had.

27
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,440
Can I get you some water?

28
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,500
Do you think water will fix this?

29
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,730
This might not be the best time

30
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,970
to tell you this...

31
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,830
What are you trying to say?

32
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,210
When we wrapped up
the special investigation committee

33
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:31,530
we got a call asking us to collect
a body. Do you remember?

34
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,080
They told us about the bodies we missed,
and Journalist Kim's location.

35
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,150
- And they asked us to collect them.
- So what?

36
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,080
Now that Seo Joon Oh has come back...

37
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,330
I think Seo Joon Oh made that call.

38
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,990
So what do you want me to do?

39
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,530
Should I thank him for a job well done?

40
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:58,100
If he had killed them,
he wouldn't have made that call.

41
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,170
It's important to make
a political judgment. It is...

42
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,120
But now that this has happened,
I want to request...

43
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,150
that you rethink this one more time,
in a cool-headed manner.

44
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:16,570
I'm sorry if I crossed the line.
I'll get you some water, Congresswoman Jo.

45
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:44,410
<i>[Episode 14]</i>
Please, no flash.

46
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,260
How is Choi Tae Ho doing?
Was he really stabbed?

47
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,700
- Please tell us your thoughts.
- How is he?

48
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,760
You should have listened to me.

49
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,910
If you had listened,
this wouldn't have happened.

50
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,950
Why did you do it?

51
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:14,590
Why... did you kill Jae Hyun?

52
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,280
Why do you think I did it?

53
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,940
It was all for you, of course.

54
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,850
Should I have let him live
after he heard what we said?

55
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:36,430
I... just did what I had to do.

56
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,510
What you had to do was to kill a person?

57
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,510
I'm tearing up.

58
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,180
You killed a person for me.

59
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,250
Let's get things straight, Tae Ho.

60
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,360
This happened

61
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,160
because I was dealing with the mess you
made when you thought you'd killed him.

62
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,840
Do you know that?

63
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,950
But still...
You shouldn't have killed him.

64
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,590
If you hadn't,
my life could have been different.

65
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,760
Do you really believe that?

66
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,650
You're so naive.

67
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,040
Please get rid of the reporters

68
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,680
and make sure the medical staff
stays quiet.

69
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,380
- I'm going to leave tomorrow.
- Okay.

70
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,280
I'll do that.

71
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,760
Oh, right.

72
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:44,300
About that cell phone...
What are you going to do about it?

73
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,440
<i>Hey, Choi Tae Ho.</i>

74
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,770
What the hell are you doing?

75
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,440
Get those police cars out of here!

76
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,390
How did you get my number?

77
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,520
I know everything you know.
I know you sent them to catch me.

78
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,600
But you idiot...

79
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,610
If they catch me, they'll find So Hee's
phone too. Think before you act.

80
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,640
<i>I'll find it.</i>

81
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,750
I'll find it myself.

82
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,080
Okay, then. Get some rest.

83
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,830
- Hello!
- Please look here!

84
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,230
Please pose for the photos!

85
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,280
Get out.

86
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,030
Deputy CEO Jang, I don't think
I can do this any longer.

87
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,200
I have to turn myself in,
Deputy CEO Jang.

88
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,360
I can't live like this anymore.

89
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,750
Get a hold of yourself, Choi Tae Ho!

90
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,080
It was an accident.

91
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,280
Do you want to ruin your life
because of a little accident?

92
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,240
It only takes a second to ruin your life.

93
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,640
Are you aware what state Joon Oh is in?

94
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:33,020
<i>Joon Oh and Jae Hyun ended up that way
because it was their fate.</i>

95
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,120
<i>If you close your eyes for a moment,
it'll all be over.</i>

96
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,450
Why are you making a fuss over this?

97
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,420
I want you to do as I say
for the time being. Do you understand?

98
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,990
Then...

99
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,680
Do I have to live with this guilt...

100
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,250
for the rest of my life?

101
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,090
I don't think I can do that,
Deputy CEO Jang.

102
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,360
If you weren't prepared for this

103
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,900
you shouldn't have asked for my help.

104
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,530
It's too late now.

105
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,570
We've already crossed the line.

106
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,970
Tae Ho.

107
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:22,020
In life, people do things
that are much worse than this.

108
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,200
You'll learn soon enough.

109
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,390
- How have you been?
- I've been well.

110
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:41,310
Your fans are waiting.
Do you have any good news?

111
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,520
I'm preparing for my next project,
and I'm also exercising.

112
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,060
Please say something to your fans.

113
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,110
Geez, what was that?

114
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,140
Yes, um...

115
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,000
Murderer.

116
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:20,350
Do you think you can erase
what you've done?

117
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,860
Ki Joon, why are you out here?

118
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,840
- Did the broadcast go well?
- Yeah.

119
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,920
- Let's talk.
- About what?

120
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,880
Let's go.

121
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,880
Geez, the weather is so nice.

122
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,760
Ji Ah.

123
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,760
I'm sorry for how I've acted.

124
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:33,100
I didn't tell you what was going on.
You must have been frustrated.

125
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,930
Today, I'll tell you everything
I've been keeping from you.

126
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,480
Don't tell me.

127
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:45,830
Let's not worry about it.

128
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,850
And I already know
what you're going to say.

129
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:52,020
How would you know that?

130
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,270
CEO Jang threatened you with the fact
that my mom mooched off of him, right?

131
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:03,450
And I'm sure you tried to protect me
behind my back.

132
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,920
Ji Ah.

133
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,880
How do you catch on so quickly?

134
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,840
Hey, let me ask you a question.

135
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,980
Do you feel like...

136
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,940
I interfere too much in your life?

137
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,850
Do you feel burdened because of it?

138
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,910
No.

139
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,840
Because I knew why
you were acting that way

140
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,950
I felt bad for you more than anything.
You didn't have to do that.

141
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,730
What do you mean you knew
why I was acting that way?

142
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,570
I'm not dumb.

143
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:42,870
I know what happened between you
and my brother.

144
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,270
How do you know that?

145
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,300
You came to my brother's funeral,
didn't you?

146
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,430
I heard you were an army doctor.

147
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:06,290
How could I have not known
when you cried more than we did?

148
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,180
So you knew...

149
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,640
You knew.

150
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:19,680
Hey, why didn't you say anything?
Didn't you hate me?

151
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,740
I didn't think it was your fault.

152
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,810
I just thought my brother died
while serving in the army.

153
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,890
It wasn't anyone's fault.

154
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,900
I just accepted that it was his fate.
That's what I thought.

155
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,120
How could a middle school student forgive
me when she lost her older brother?

156
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,480
How could you forgive me
when I killed your brother?

157
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,470
You didn't kill anyone.

158
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,280
It's not like you did it on purpose.

159
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,340
You just tried to save him.

160
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:58,440
And not everyone apologizes
the way you have.

161
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,920
You threw away your career, you cared
for me, and took my mom's insults.

162
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,750
And you did it for a long time.

163
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:12,370
Your apology was more than enough.

164
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,990
That's why I was able to forgive you.

165
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,950
So let's stop talking about this!
Why are we still talking about this?

166
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:31,260
Stop it, okay?

167
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,030
Stop.

168
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:42,340
Gosh, it's really cold out.
I might catch a cold.

169
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,240
My nose is running.

170
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,120
Ki Joon, it's cold, isn't it?

171
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,260
I'll get going.

172
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,980
Yeah, Ki Joon.

173
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,590
Did you talk to her?

174
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,890
Yeah, me too.

175
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,670
When are you coming?

176
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:25,520
Bong Hee wanted to eat together
at her house. I don't know.

177
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,240
Okay, come soon. Okay.

178
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,420
Hey, not bad.

179
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,810
Oh!

180
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,330
Damn it, no one saw!
It only took one try!

181
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,890
Wow, this is actually possible.

182
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:21,530
Please grab it. Please grab it.
Please wait. Geez.

183
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,240
- What is this?
- Isn't it cute?

184
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,680
It's so cute! Here.

185
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,950
- Do you want to try it?
- Of course.

186
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,270
- 500 won.
- Sure.

187
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,810
It's your money.

188
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,000
- One more.
- Geez, so greedy.

189
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,430
- Let's do this!
- This one looks easy.

190
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,420
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.
Okay. I got it! I got it! I got it!

191
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,590
- You got it.
- I got it! It's mine.

192
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,110
Geez.

193
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,620
- See? It's not that easy.
- I should have gotten it. 500 won.

194
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,610
- Try this one.
- Let's go.

195
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,580
You got it.

196
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,760
I can get this one. It's in the bag.
I'm stupid if I miss this.

197
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,690
Here we go!

198
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:17,020
You got it. Wow, this game is well-made!
What a great machine.

199
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,660
Geez.

200
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,660
Gosh, they're so cute.

201
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:24,090
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

202
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:27,580
But Seo Joon Oh, this is my first time
getting stuffed animals as a gift.

203
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,230
- This is your first time?
- Yes.

204
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:33,160
Wow, you've had so many new experiences
since we met. You were lucky to meet me.

205
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,340
I know. I've had so many new experiences
since I met you.

206
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,050
- You should be thankful.
- I am.

207
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,920
Today, I learned that you are capable
of doing things.

208
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,710
Hey, stars need to be good at everything.
It's not that easy.

209
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,640
Right, you were a star, weren't you?
I almost forgot.

210
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,160
- Why would you forget that?
- They're so cute.

211
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,740
Thank you, Joon Oh.

212
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,060
Joon Oh?

213
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,720
Wait, So Hee recorded it? When?

214
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,450
She knew,
yet she still called you a murderer?

215
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,660
- Hey, Ji Ah...
- What?

216
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,590
I think...

217
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:31,590
there were too many things I didn't know

218
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,230
about our So Hee.

219
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,230
It's possible that a part of me

220
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,720
could have been suspicious
of So Hee from the beginning

221
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,660
but I might have been in denial.

222
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:49,410
We felt the same way.
And she was sensitive to begin with

223
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,720
so I just thought she was shocked
after Jae Hyun died.

224
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,770
I'm sure she never intended to use
her recording. It just happened that way.

225
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,870
She even tried to report it
multiple times.

226
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:03,040
But the way she treated Joon Oh...
So Hee wasn't like that before.

227
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,430
She liked and respected Joon Oh.

228
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,430
She wasn't the type of person
who could have done that when she knew.

229
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,530
Now that you mention it, I think
So Hee wanted to say something once.

230
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,240
<i>When Joon Oh was a complete wreck...</i>

231
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,030
<i>I visited Joon Oh's place a few times
to help him clean up.</i>

232
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,770
Joon Oh.

233
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,840
I drank today too.

234
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:02,420
And then I somehow ended up here.

235
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,250
I'm sorry, Joon Oh.

236
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:27,750
I know you did nothing wrong.

237
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,650
I know it wasn't you.

238
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,940
But if I don't do this...

239
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:41,350
I don't think I can bear it.

240
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:47,310
I don't think I can keep living.

241
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,810
Don't forgive me, Joon Oh.

242
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,580
<i>Because she was accepting bribes
from Jang Do Pal and Choi Tae Ho</i>

243
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,670
<i>she was probably in denial.</i>

244
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:22,940
The more tortured and guilty she felt

245
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,750
the more she
would have wanted to deny it.

246
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,870
It's a common occurrence that I see
in my investigations.

247
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,880
It wasn't anyone else...

248
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,670
but it was our So Hee who did that.

249
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,370
I'm sorry, Seo Joon Oh.

250
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:42,390
I want to apologize on So Hee's behalf.

251
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,340
Hey, no need for that.

252
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,850
Prosecutor Yoon, it's all in the past.

253
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,660
Hey, let's catch Jang Do Pal and
Choi Tae Ho. How many victims are there?

254
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,730
There's me, So Hee, Journalist Kim, and
CEO Hwang. Who knows what else he'll do?

255
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,150
We shouldn't relax
until the press conference is over.

256
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:09,240
That's right. We'll go
and testify correctly this time.

257
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,940
- We will.
- Geez.

258
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,330
I feel so much better
now that all the secrets are out.

259
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:19,700
Joon Oh, you can trust us.
We're not afraid of anything anymore.

260
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,230
- You need to be afraid of me.
- Really?

261
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,920
After the press conference,
we'll wait with a police team

262
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,690
so that Jang Do Pal and Choi Tae Ho
can't escape.

263
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:33,370
If we just expose the contents
of that cell phone

264
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,640
it'll cause an uproar.

265
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,560
Okay! Cheers to that.

266
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,710
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

267
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,740
Oh, how about we move CEO Hwang
to a different room?

268
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,940
I feel like we'll be more at ease if we
move him so that he remains safe.

269
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,750
What will we say to Secretary Tae?
He still hasn't come around yet.

270
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:58,100
Even if we move him, once Secretary Tae
tells them, it's all over.

271
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,740
CEO Hwang! CEO...

272
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:11,230
Whoa, he opened his eyes!
Jae Gook! Jae Gook!

273
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,590
He opened his eyes!
He opened his eyes! He...

274
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:20,520
Honey, do you recognize me? Honey!

275
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,140
He moved! He opened his eyes!
Mrs. Hwang, he...

276
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,150
What do we do now?

277
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,070
- I'll call the doctor.
- Okay.

278
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,870
CEO Hwang, do you recognize me?
It's me, Ho Hang!

279
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:36,830
Jae Gook. Yes, Jae Gook.
If you recognize me...

280
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:40,230
blink your eyes, just once.

281
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,430
He opened his eyes!

282
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:47,650
Wow! He opened his eyes!
He opened his eyes!

283
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,960
What do I do? Oh, wait a minute.

284
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,540
Oh, it's Secretary Tae.

285
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,700
Yeah, what is it?

286
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,810
<i>Manager Jung!</i>

287
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,310
What? What's the matter?

288
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,040
You're scaring me. What is it?

289
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,110
- Who is it?
- Did something happen to CEO Hwang?

290
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,210
Yeah, Ji Ah. Manager Jung.

291
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,360
CEO Hwang.

292
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,890
The doctor said
he's remembering things, but slowly.

293
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:29,290
CEO Hwang, do you recognize us?

294
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,010
CEO Hwang, it's me, Ji Ah.

295
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,360
CEO Hwang.

296
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,290
Joon Oh.

297
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:43,860
Yeah.

298
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:48,340
What? Hwang Jae Gook woke up?

299
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,040
Hello.

300
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,690
- Hello.
- Hello.

301
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,010
Hello.

302
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,530
- Is CEO Jang inside?
- Yes.

303
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:04,200
<i>How conscious is he? Can he talk?</i>

304
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:09,620
<i>He woke up,
but he can't talk or move yet.</i>

305
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:12,600
- How long until he talks?
<i>- I haven't asked the doctor yet.</i>

306
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:18,330
Hey, you son of a bitch!
Did you go there to say hello?

307
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,630
We can't let him say a word.

308
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:24,280
I only kept him alive
because he couldn't talk.

309
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:29,130
<i>When it looks like he's about to talk,
we have to kill him. Got it?</i>

310
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,880
<i>Ask the doctor right away.</i>

311
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,830
Why aren't you going inside?

312
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,290
I... I came to say hello to CEO Jang

313
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:46,750
but it seems like he's still busy,
so I'm going to leave. Bye.

314
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,300
You're here?

315
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,080
Why didn't you pick me up
from the hospital?

316
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,120
Something came up.

317
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,080
Is it true CEO Hwang woke up?

318
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,370
Where did you hear that?
I just found out.

319
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,630
What are you going to do?

320
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,110
What else can we do?

321
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:29,270
He'll tell everyone I tried to kill him
as soon as he opens his mouth.

322
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,030
We need to kill him.

323
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,100
<i>[Yoon So Hee Murder Investigation]</i>

324
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,520
We're already in the middle
of investigating this case.

325
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,100
Geez, look how thick it is.
You've done a lot of research.

326
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,720
<i>[Shin Jae Hyun Murder Investigation]</i>

327
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,930
What is this?

328
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:54,670
These are documents for Shin Jae Hyun's
death. The one that was called a suicide.

329
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,850
Please look into this case first.

330
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:59,100
It will give you clues
about Yoon So Hee's case.

331
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,250
Why are you trying to mess around
with a case that's already closed?

332
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:07,770
The statements were consistent and
the culprit was identified, so it's over.

333
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:11,770
Are you trying to give me extra work
because it looks like I'm slacking?

334
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:16,010
Did you try to investigate
Yoon So Hee's case properly?

335
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:21,040
I did, but it wasn't different from the
special investigation committee's report.

336
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,210
That's why I'm asking you...

337
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,790
Why do I have to disregard
the consistent statements

338
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:28,480
and investigate this all over again?

339
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,170
You're aware that Seo Joon Oh
has returned?

340
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,930
I heard, but I haven't seen him myself.
I should see him for myself--

341
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:42,960
As someone who sent the police to
Ra Bong Hee's house to catch Seo Joon Oh

342
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,040
that's a lame excuse.

343
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:50,680
Fine, if you came here

344
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,830
without Seo Joon Oh or any evidence,
you won't change much.

345
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,750
Do you have another plan?

346
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:01,330
Please wait until the press conference
tomorrow.

347
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,620
Everything will be exposed tomorrow.

348
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:11,390
From what I've heard,
the culprit in Hwang Jae Gook's death

349
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,760
is the same man who is responsible
for Shin Jae Hyun's death.

350
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,390
I will send you the evidence soon

351
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:23,050
so you should consider where you stand,
if you don't want to humiliate yourself.

352
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,960
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

353
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,670
Please vote for Jo Hee Kyung!

354
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,500
Congresswoman Jo, can we take a picture?
Thank you.

355
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,680
Here. One, two, three!

356
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,890
- Thank you! I hope you win!
- Yes, thank you!

357
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,410
Good luck!

358
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:47,540
Yes, that's right. Yes.

359
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,950
Yes, not at all. Yes.

360
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,760
What on earth is the problem?

361
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:57,010
Jung Ki Joon changed his statement,
and Hwang Jae Gook's case could be murder

362
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,600
yet you don't think there's a problem?

363
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,860
<i>How the hell did your team investigate
and create such a mess?</i>

364
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,450
Hey, it's not like we even have
a license to investigate.

365
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:12,260
We did our share, so the rest is up to
you! Why are you taking it out on us?

366
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,660
<i>As a former chairwoman who is trying
to join the national assembly</i>

367
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:18,430
you shouldn't talk
so carelessly about this.

368
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:23,760
Will you be able to face your voters
after Seo Joon Oh speaks to the press?

369
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,670
Ma'am, you must help us wrap up this case

370
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:32,280
if you want me to do
what you asked me to do.

371
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,260
How dare this district attorney

372
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,230
order around someone so stubborn?
Doesn't he have anyone else?

373
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:46,640
By the way, earlier...

374
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,850
He called you,
and asked you to call him back.

375
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,050
Please give this to me.
I can do it for you.

376
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,020
I should take these off.

377
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,590
CEO Hwang! He's smiling.

378
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,610
- Put those there.
- Yeah?

379
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,890
Wait, at a time like this...

380
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:38,330
- One, two, three!
- Smile! Smile!

381
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,130
He smiled!

382
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:44,270
Ji Ah, can you empty this?

383
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,730
- Wash it too.
- Okay.

384
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,350
Aren't you cold?

385
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,580
Good luck. Good luck!

386
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,650
- Throw it out?
- Good luck! I don't know either.

387
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,350
- Let's eat.
- Yeah, wait.

388
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,270
- Ji Ah, would you like a drink?
- Yes.

389
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,460
- Orange, grape or tomato?
- Tomato!

390
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,250
Tomato and grape...
The grape is for Ji Ah.

391
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,480
Sir, during Hwang Jae Gook's accident

392
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,270
a witness saw someone
touching the equipment.

393
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,920
They said he spoke in language
that was not Chinese

394
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:26,080
and when we got a composite sketch

395
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,060
- he looked familiar.
- Do you know him?

396
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,560
You'll recognize him too.

397
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,580
Jang Do Pal's guy?

398
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,190
Who are you? (In Chinese)

399
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,480
I took care of it.

400
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,480
Jang Do Pal...

401
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,800
- has a sloppy side.
- I know.

402
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,870
Take this, and print out the photos
from the hospital he bribed

403
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:20,500
so that we can target both Jang Do Pal
and Choi Tae Ho at tomorrow's conference.

404
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,510
Yes, I will do that.

405
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,060
Seo Joon Oh wants to hold
a press conference.

406
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,180
Did you know?

407
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:34,550
At that press conference...

408
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:37,610
he wants to play the recording.

409
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:45,710
You'll want to stop that from happening,
won't you, Choi Tae Ho?

410
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,610
Of course.

411
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:53,600
If this incident from the past
is talked about, it'll ruin my image.

412
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,380
If that happens, the help you've given me
will all have been in vain.

413
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,250
I can't let that happen.

414
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,960
I knew we'd be on the same page.

415
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:09,690
Can you do it? Can you stop Seo Joon Oh
from holding the press conference?

416
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,520
I have no choice.

417
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:16,300
I want to live in peace, you see.

418
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:24,980
Great! Isn't it great that we moved?
How nice is this?

419
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,170
CEO Hwang will be more comfortable,
and recover quickly.

420
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,930
Right, CEO Hwang?

421
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:36,440
Thank you so much
for taking care of my husband.

422
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:42,020
People kept saying the plane crash
was his fault

423
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:45,900
so it has been hard
for me and our children.

424
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:52,340
Because you were by his side
on the island, and you're still here now

425
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,680
the misunderstanding has been resolved.

426
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,090
Thank you so much.

427
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,240
It's time to pick up the kids
from school. I'll be back.

428
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,370
- Please stay for as long as you like.
- Yes.

429
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:11,170
- Travel safely!
- Goodbye!

430
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,670
- Are you all right?
- I'm sorry.

431
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,880
My skirt. You shouldn't sit on it.

432
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,610
- I'm sorry.
- No problem.

433
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,310
I'm also...

434
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,700
very thankful to you.

435
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,850
I thought you would resist until the end.
Have you come to your senses?

436
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:40,130
- Hey, we were just as bad.
- Do you think so?

437
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,880
We understand your position.

438
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,290
You had no other choice,
for CEO Hwang's sake.

439
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,700
You must have struggled a lot
by yourself.

440
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,770
Let's look after CEO Hwang together
from now on.

441
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:59,230
I know you had your reasons, so it'll be
hard for you to open up right away.

442
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:02,050
We all understand that.

443
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,080
But I'm sure you understand
our side as well.

444
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,850
If something happens to CEO Hwang,
call me right away.

445
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:14,440
You can do that,
even without opening up to me, right?

446
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,370
You can.

447
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,710
Yeah.

448
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,440
Until CEO Hwang fully recovers

449
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,190
we have to take turns watching
Choi Tae Ho and Jang Do Pal.

450
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,880
Okay?

451
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,260
- Answer him.
- Okay?

452
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,450
Yeah. Yes, I understand.

453
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,420
Yes. Yes, Tae Ho.

454
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,960
Yes, I understand. Yes.

455
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,250
Who was that? Tae Ho?
Is he out of the hospital already?

456
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,670
Yes, he told me to pick him up.

457
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:52,080
Figures, he's probably looking for the
cell phone, so he has no time to spare.

458
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,810
- Go.
- Yes, sure.

459
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,740
And don't make it obvious
that you were with us.

460
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,350
Don't worry. You can trust me.

461
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,350
- I'll get going! Yes.
- Goodbye! Yes.

462
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,270
CEO Hwang, take care.

463
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,640
I feel anxious no matter what he does.

464
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,470
<i>Seo Joon Oh is speaking
at a press conference tomorrow.</i>

465
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:18,930
I'll go to the press conference first,
and look for the cell phone.

466
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:22,900
Of course. We need to stop him.

467
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:48,470
- I found out where Hwang Jae Gook is.
- Okay.

468
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:52,740
Then go there
during the press conference tomorrow

469
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,030
- and kill him.
- Yes.

470
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,650
<i>[Byung Joo]</i>

471
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:08,400
<i>Choi Tae Ho will go straight to the press
conference tomorrow to find the phone.</i>

472
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,940
Have you heard anything
from Jo Hee Kyung's team yet?

473
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,650
No, they just said they'll see us
at the press conference tomorrow.

474
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:19,060
She's not that easy to deal with.

475
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,150
You can't let your guard down, okay?

476
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:24,800
If she doesn't help us,
we can do it ourselves.

477
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,500
Okay.

478
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,480
Drive safely!

479
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,560
Geez, it'll be fine, right?

480
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,920
It's going to be fine.

481
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:50,400
Geez, I wish it weren't tomorrow,
but the day after tomorrow.

482
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,590
It has to go well.

483
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:06,230
It will go well. It will.

484
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,240
It has to.

485
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:15,220
Don't worry.

486
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,630
It will go well.

487
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:33,940
- Tilt it this way, and to the center--
- Lift it up!

488
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:38,950
Move it to the right! To the right.
To the right. To the right.

489
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:43,300
- Move that to the right too.
- Testing. Testing, one, two, one, two.

490
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,060
<i>Joon Oh! Have you left yet?
Take care of the phone.</i>

491
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:06,880
<i>Get there safely,
and prove your innocence. Good luck!</i>

492
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,330
Oh, you scared me! You scared me...

493
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:15,410
You're here? Let's go.

494
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:19,530
No, I'll drive myself today.
Go home.

495
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:23,850
Tae Ho, I'll drive you!
Tae Ho! I'll drive you!

496
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,450
Today will go as planned, right?

497
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:31,250
I hope so. Has Seo Joon Oh
left his house yet?

498
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,290
Yes, he probably has.

499
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:39,060
Yes, Seo Joon Oh. Where are you?

500
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,040
If I'd known I was going to leave
so early, I would have gone with you.

501
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,900
I thought I was supposed to go
as late as possible so no one sees me.

502
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,230
Ki Joon, why did you call me at 4 a.m.?

503
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:50,400
Hey, on an important day like this,
we should be prepared.

504
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,980
Bong Hee! He doesn't normally get up,
but he got up today after one call!

505
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,820
He must be pretty nervous too!

506
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:00,380
I'm not nervous. Hey, where are you?

507
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,730
We're on our way too.
See you soon.

508
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:02,360
Who are you? Stop! Who are you?

509
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:11,000

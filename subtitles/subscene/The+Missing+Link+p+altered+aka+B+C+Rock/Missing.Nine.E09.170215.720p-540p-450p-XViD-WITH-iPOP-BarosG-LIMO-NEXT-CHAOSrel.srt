00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,390
<i>[Episode 9]</i>
Let's start!

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,510
Hello! We're Dreamers!

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,190
<i>We were finally pushed to this point.</i>

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,400
I hope you're the last one.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,520
Oh, you startled me! Hello.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,470
- Hello.
- Hello.

7
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,890
Why Jae Hyun?

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:32,410
Our album is out,
and it's called "I Couldn't Forget You."

9
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:36,470
- He's our frontman.
- Yes, I'm the frontman, Seo Joon Oh.

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:40,290
Yes, and I'm the bass player,
Choi Tae Ho. It's nice to meet you.

11
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,760
Joon Oh!

12
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,100
<i>She was murdered.</i>

13
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,430
I saw it myself.

14
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,790
<i>So, who murdered Yoon So Hee?</i>

15
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,520
No!

16
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,520
<i>Seo Joon Oh.</i>

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,400
Choi Tae Ho was right.

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,090
He killed her.

19
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,110
No way. This is wrong. This isn't right--

20
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,930
Can't you see that this is important?

21
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,830
And, he had an accomplice.

22
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:49,010
<i>She knew what Seo Joon Oh was doing</i>

23
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,210
<i>but she covered it up, and helped him.</i>

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,910
Who was it?

25
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,260
<i>All you have to do is tell them
what you saw. We saw the same thing!</i>

26
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,590
You saw Seo Joon Oh kill her.

27
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,240
What?

28
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,620
Secretary Tae. What are you saying?

29
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,530
That accomplice...

30
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,030
is right here.

31
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,970
What are you saying, Secretary Tae?
Wait... Let go! Secretary Tae--

32
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:32,380
Ra Bong Hee, she was his accomplice.

33
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:35,680
Secretary Tae. Secretary Tae!

34
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,220
<i>We must expose the truth.</i>

35
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,660
I killed Tae Ho. That's the truth.

36
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,470
If we... happen to get back...

37
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,790
Everything we saw and heard here...

38
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,730
Let's remember it for what it is.

39
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:14,470
I'm not sure if this is
the right time to tell you this...

40
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,250
But since you found out already...

41
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,360
This might be a good time to hear it.

42
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,850
What is this about?

43
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,570
Do you remember your DUI incident?

44
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,030
- Thank you.
- Sure!

45
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,470
Hey! Joon Oh, sit down and drink.

46
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,670
Okay! Okay. Okay. Okay.
I'll be right here.

47
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,990
Okay. Okay. Sit.

48
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:46,520
- Choi Tae Ho! Ma'am, it's Tae Ho!
- Hello.

49
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,320
It's Tae Ho! You can't take pictures!
You can't take pictures of Tae Ho.

50
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,340
He's come to pick me up.

51
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,110
Here we go!

52
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,150
<i>That was probably after
Shin Jae Hyun died</i>

53
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,500
<i>and when you were a complete mess.</i>

54
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,190
<i>Even after you were acquitted...</i>

55
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,130
<i>This was a time when your incidents
were on the news</i>

56
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:20,970
<i>on a daily basis.</i>

57
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,570
<i>That's why I wrote that article about
your DUI without a second thought.</i>

58
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,770
<i>But a long time after that incident...</i>

59
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,120
<i>I received some information
about Shin Jae Hyun's incident.</i>

60
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,270
What information? What went wrong?

61
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:50,850
<i>That's why we went back and investigated
again, and during that process...</i>

62
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,110
<i>I found out something.</i>

63
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,280
<i>You got into an accident while driving</i>

64
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,000
<i>and the person who reported
your accident...</i>

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,730
<i>was Choi Tae Ho.</i>

66
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,390
Yes.

67
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:12,100
Seo Joon Oh, you said,
"I drank, but I didn't drink and drive."

68
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,790
Is it true you drove under the influence?

69
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:18,060
I drank, but I didn't drink and drive.

70
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,880
You were telling the truth.

71
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,950
But...

72
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,020
Why are you telling me this now?

73
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,150
When people offer to help you...

74
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,370
Accept it.

75
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:41,860
Returning to your original place
is your right.

76
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,540
The truth is...

77
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,270
I don't know what's right.

78
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:51,470
I'm not even sure if that's a fact
that's for my well-being.

79
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,520
I'm going in to rest.

80
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,800
- Rest well.
- Yes, you too.

81
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,820
<i>Let me speak to Secretary Tae alone.</i>

82
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,250
What do you want to say to someone
who claims you were an accomplice?

83
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:37,870
I wasn't an accomplice!
And Seo Joon Oh's not a murderer either.

84
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,400
Secretary Tae knows this better than
anyone else! He must have a reason--

85
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,310
Are you saying
he was threatened by someone?

86
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:51,280
Are you asking because
you really don't know?

87
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,240
You have no fear, Ra Bong Hee.

88
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,130
The statements that we collected so far

89
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:01,570
all point to Seo Joon Oh as the murderer.

90
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:05,530
In other words, your testimony was false.

91
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,680
When many lies come together...

92
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,850
I guess that becomes the truth.

93
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,930
How are you going to refute
all of the statements?

94
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,720
They outnumber you,
so how can you prove your claim?

95
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,300
Now that we have this much evidence...

96
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,090
You would have nothing to say
if you were sent to the prosecution.

97
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:27,940
You don't know how serious
perjury is, do you?

98
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:32,900
Don't run wild.
Behave yourself until I call you.

99
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,810
This is not right!

100
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,590
The reason Seo Joon Oh
has to be the murderer

101
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,570
and I have to be his accomplice...

102
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,620
It's because you think
Seo Joon Oh is dead!

103
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,830
There's no way he is still alive...

104
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:59,990
He's easy to blame, and everyone
will easily forget this way!

105
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,420
I don't have evidence
to refute your claim.

106
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,260
But I'll make sure to find Seo Joon Oh!
I'll find him...

107
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:17,240
And I'll make sure
to show you that you're wrong.

108
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,920
Did it not go well?

109
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:48,480
You can't be exhausted already.

110
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,160
If you are, we'll end up
falling into their trap.

111
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,470
I won't be exhausted
until we find Seo Joon Oh.

112
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:59,360
He must also be...

113
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,580
trying his best to come back.

114
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,100
How can I be exhausted?

115
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,680
I'm still just fine.

116
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,170
I'm okay.

117
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,270
Are you all right?
Do you feel sick again?

118
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,650
You can't throw up here.
I'd have to clean it up.

119
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,410
Good work today.

120
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,280
- You have a very good friend.
- Pardon?

121
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,610
You were a lot more relaxed
after seeing your friend.

122
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:43,800
But... Tae Ho Hang.

123
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,180
You know you can't change
anything you said now, right?

124
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:54,070
The testimony you gave today
will be used in court as well.

125
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:58,310
In other words, no matter
what you saw or heard

126
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,520
- the truth starts here.
- I know that!

127
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,560
I can go now, right?

128
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,170
Is something bothering you?

129
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,640
We didn't hear anything else
about Seo Joon Oh, right?

130
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,040
Yes, but why are you asking
about Seo Joon Oh? He's dead.

131
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,220
If he's dead,
aren't you going to find his body?

132
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,750
Should I look into it?

133
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,780
I can call. But, there's
a time difference. If they're sleeping...

134
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,070
Why are you getting mad at me? Seriously.

135
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,610
She always takes it out on me.

136
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,740
You scared me! What's wrong?

137
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,010
Why were you so startled?

138
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:13,070
No, it's nothing. Why are you up
so early? You should sleep more.

139
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,760
Why? What were you doing?

140
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,970
It's just, everything's on the ground.

141
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:21,210
I'm sure it was just the wind.

142
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,650
Hey!

143
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,890
- Where did he go?
- What's wrong?

144
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,040
I saw someone run by!

145
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,310
Everything's on the ground too.
It's strange.

146
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,830
Go. There was noise. Go and see.

147
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,210
No. You go.

148
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,070
I don't want to.

149
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,190
Damn it.

150
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,800
Hey! Hey! Hey! Wait...

151
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,160
Wait.

152
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:49,600
- What is it, Ki Joon?
- Ji Ah, I heard a message.

153
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,680
- What are you saying? It wasn't working!
- I just had a signal.

154
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,900
- Oh!
- See? You heard it! It's not just me!

155
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,210
- Hey!
- Hey!

156
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,350
- Wow!
- Hey, I hear it!

157
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,920
Wait! Wait a minute! Let me listen!

158
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,750
- What is it?
- CEO Hwang, we heard a message.

159
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,770
- Seriously?
- Yes!

160
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,150
- It's working?
- Yeah!

161
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:18,010
- It wasn't working yesterday.
- It's not working.

162
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,350
- Pardon?
- Let me see.

163
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,690
- It's not working.
- It's not working.

164
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,140
Oh! I hear it! I hear it!
Wow, I heard it!

165
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,930
Wow, I hear it too!

166
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,160
Hey, but why is it buzzing so much?

167
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,270
Hey, we can't get a very good signal
here, so let's go somewhere else.

168
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,450
CEO Hwang, you speak Chinese, right?

169
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:43,560
- Hey, take this and go that way!
- Hurry!

170
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,330
- Can we talk for a second?
- Pardon?

171
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:00,990
You said you heard something
last night, didn't you?

172
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,060
I've been getting
a strange feeling around here.

173
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,030
Oh, was that yesterday?

174
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,580
After I left?

175
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,280
Did you check
Choi Tae Ho's body, by any chance?

176
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,950
Did you confirm that he's dead?

177
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,190
Ch... Choi Tae Ho--

178
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,350
We could be mistaken,
so let's not tell anyone else.

179
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,470
Let's look for him, just the two of us.

180
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,160
Wh... What is it saying?

181
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,780
High seas warning is in effect,
and they're going home--

182
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:36,860
Hey, how can they go? Listen. Listen.
Hold it higher. Hold it really high.

183
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,330
Requesting help.

184
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,820
What... What did you say?

185
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,540
There is someone here
on this deserted island! (In Chinese)

186
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,000
We are from Korea's
Legend Entertainment company.

187
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,620
- Help!
- Hurry!

188
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,440
Hey, just listen to what they're saying!

189
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,270
We should listen to what they're saying!
Why do you keep talking?

190
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,670
- You should listen before you talk!
- But...

191
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:04,250
No! No! Translate! Translate right now!
Geez, what the hell are you doing?

192
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,860
- Hey, why are you screaming?
- Okay, it's connected.

193
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,380
- Be quiet!
- Talk!

194
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:13,850
- He just told me to stop--
- You have to talk! They're leaving!

195
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,980
- I can't do this!
- Requesting help! (In Chinese)

196
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,440
- Help!
- Help!

197
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,400
- There are people here on this island.
- There are people here on this island.

198
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,270
Captain, we're going back
with a full load of fish today!

199
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:30,800
I know. We have a full load.
We really hit the jackpot today.

200
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,260
That's right. We're so lucky.
But when are we going home?

201
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,290
Be quiet for a second.

202
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,010
Why? What is it?  What's that?

203
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:43,140
<i>There are people on this deserted island!</i>

204
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,420
What?

205
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:51,030
What? They're saying there are people
on a deserted island, aren't they?

206
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:56,240
<i>Save us! Can you hear us?</i>

207
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,650
Hey, I'm going to look for something
with Journalist Kim.

208
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:06,670
You two shouldn't split up.
Stay together, got it?

209
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:10,900
I'll be nearby, so if anything happens,
scream loudly. Okay?

210
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,040
Wait, what are you looking for?

211
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:18,560
- I'll tell you later, Ji Ah.
- Let's go.

212
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,190
Return safely.

213
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:23,320
What the heck is this?

214
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,680
We have to leave when we get a message,
so where is he going?

215
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:38,530
Let's not stay together like this.

216
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:44,270
We don't know where the boat will dock,
so let's split up and keep in touch.

217
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,870
They might not have heard us.
I don't know if there's any point.

218
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,010
I like that idea. It's better than
missing the opportunity.

219
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,450
Let's leave this bastard out.
Ki Joon, let's split up.

220
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:58,870
That side is where the sun rises,
and that side is where the sun sets.

221
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,010
I like that. It's easy to comprehend.

222
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:03,100
Which way do you want to go,
Manager Jung?

223
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,840
It's a boat.

224
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,220
It is. It must be nice.
They get to have fun on a boat.

225
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,480
While we're stuck over here.

226
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,770
Why is the boat coming this way?

227
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,470
- A boat?
- Why is it coming this way?

228
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,080
The boat's coming this way!

229
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,630
The boat is coming for us. They're coming
this way to save us, aren't they?

230
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,170
I think they're coming to save us.

231
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,500
Hey.

232
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,450
Right? They're coming for us!
It's our boat, isn't it?

233
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,140
Hey, go up there!

234
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,150
We're here! Send help quickly!
(In Chinese)

235
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:51,100
Help! Help!

236
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,660
Don't let them leave!
Don't let them leave!

237
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,560
There are people here
on this deserted island! (In Chinese)

238
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,620
There are people here
on this deserted island!

239
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,880
Gosh, I'm worried about those three.

240
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,470
They're big in size,
but they can't do anything right.

241
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,570
- What if they lose the radio?
- Hey, no way.

242
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,860
You should have gone instead.
You would have been better.

243
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,860
But why aren't you telling me
where Joon Oh and Journalist Kim went?

244
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,790
They'll be back soon.
Be patient.

245
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,910
You must be thirsty.
I'll bring some water.

246
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,930
Thank you.

247
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:38,920
Gosh, who knew I would eat
mushrooms here? I'm all grown up now.

248
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,880
I could get married.

249
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,510
Oh, are you back?

250
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,910
Where did she go?

251
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:10,860
Ji Ah!

252
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,680
Ji Ah!

253
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,490
Ji Ah!

254
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,320
Ji Ah!

255
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,130
Ha Ji Ah!

256
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,930
No way.

257
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:31,130
- Ji Ah! Ji Ah!
- Bong Hee!

258
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,860
- They're inside, right?
- Wait, I'm looking for...

259
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,660
There's a boat.
The boat is here to save us!

260
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,110
- A boat?
- Joon Oh!

261
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,320
- Manager Jung!
- Where are they? Where's Ji Ah?

262
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,080
The thing is, I was just looking for her.

263
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,620
Where are Joon Oh and Journalist Kim?

264
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,210
The thing is, I think someone
was here this morning

265
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,490
but I have a feeling it was Choi Tae Ho.

266
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,810
- Let's find Ji Ah.
- Yes, hurry!

267
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:04,040
- Ji Ah!
- Ji Ah!

268
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,850
- Ha Ji Ah!
- I'm going crazy! There's no time!

269
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,520
- What if the boat leaves?
- Pardon?

270
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,250
They could easily leave without us
because of this weather.

271
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,070
Oh, Seo Joon Oh!

272
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,330
Bong Hee! Take Joon Oh to the beach.
I'll look for Ji Ah for a little longer.

273
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,920
- Yes, sure!
- And...

274
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,960
Even if we're a little late, please
don't let the boat leave without us.

275
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,190
Yes. I got it, Manager Jung!

276
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,110
Hey! Hey! Wait!

277
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:35,570
Thank you! Thank you!

278
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,030
Who are you?

279
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:42,670
Did you hear my message?
We sent that message?

280
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:47,160
You were lucky today. We don't usually
come here because of the strong waves.

281
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,420
Hurry up! We have to leave because
we're on a high seas weather alert!

282
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,320
Thank you! Thank you!

283
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,950
Hurry up and tell the kids to come here!

284
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:58,230
- Why?
- They have to leave due to weather.

285
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,050
Please wait! Please wait! Please wait!

286
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:05,570
There are others. There are others.

287
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:10,900
- No, there's no time!
- Please wait. There are others.

288
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:16,180
We're going to live. We're going to live.
We're going to live! We're going to live!

289
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,440
- There's a boat?
- Yes.

290
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,690
- Really?
- Yes!

291
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,040
We have to stop the boat from leaving!

292
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,800
They could be late, so I told Manger Jung
I'd keep the boat from leaving! Let's go!

293
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,550
- Wh... What about Ji Ah?
- About Ji Ah...

294
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:32,380
Manager Jung is looking for her!
Let's go!

295
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,500
Then I'll find Ki Joon and Ji Ah.
You two can go and hold the boat, okay?

296
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,030
- No!
- No!

297
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,340
I'll find Manager Jung. You two
can go ahead, okay? Hurry! Hurry!

298
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,640
- I can find them faster. I'll go.
- No! No!

299
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,570
No. No. Hurry!

300
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,510
- Secretary Tae.
- A boat! A boat is here!

301
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,780
Yes, we know!

302
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:59,920
You do? Then what are you
doing here? The boat is trying to leave!

303
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,040
The side the sun rises on!
The boat is on that side!

304
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,820
Oh, the side where the sun rises. There's
a high seas weather alert, so go! Hurry!

305
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,050
- Still...
- Hurry!

306
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:12,140
What are you doing? We have to go!
We have to go if we want to live!

307
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,290
- We'll wait for you! Okay?
- Journalist Kim!

308
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,640
No, go without me! Go!
I'll catch up to you!

309
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,600
- I'll keep them from leaving!
- The side the sun rises on!

310
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,620
The side the sun rises on!

311
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,990
Choi Tae Ho!

312
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,040
Hey.

313
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,460
Are you crazy? Have you gone insane?

314
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,610
Ji Ah was your girlfriend, you punk!

315
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:40,260
Not anymore.

316
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,150
She's not my girlfriend.

317
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:47,040
Tae Ho, kill me instead.
Ji Ah didn't do anything wrong, did she?

318
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,010
Tae Ho.

319
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,680
She didn't do anything wrong.

320
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:01,420
But there's something I want.

321
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,490
I...

322
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,220
want to have a good life too.

323
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,650
So you all need to die.

324
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:20,220
Ji Ah!

325
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,400
Geez, where are they?

326
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,420
- Tell them to hurry!
- Please wait!

327
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,550
CEO Hwang! Over here! We're here!

328
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,940
They are our guys! They're with us!
Hurry! Hurry!

329
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,310
I'm sorry!

330
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,750
- Help them so they can get on.
- Thank you!

331
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:39,010
- Hurry up and get on!
- Get on!

332
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:06,710
- Ki Joon! Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Be careful!

333
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,920
- Ji Ah, are you all right?
- Yes...

334
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,990
Ki Joon! Ki Joon, are you okay? Ki Joon.

335
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,280
Ki Joon. Ki Joon. Are you all right?

336
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:38,040
Yeah, of course I am. Isn't it obvious?

337
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,910
Geez, I wish they could have
come earlier. I almost died.

338
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:44,060
The side the sun rises on.

339
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:48,620
Did they get to the boat?
They got to the boat! Let's get going!

340
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,800
Leave our belongings. Let's get going.

341
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,990
Go now. If we leave Tae Ho alone,
we don't know what else he'll do.

342
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:58,430
- Go now. I'll follow you!
- Be careful.

343
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:12,300
Ki Joon and Ji Ah aren't here yet!
Tell them to wait a little longer!

344
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,630
Look here. If we don't leave now,
it'll be dangerous!

345
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:20,280
- What did he say?
- We have to leave now!

346
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,930
Hurry up and pull up the anchor!

347
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:19,160
We were on this island for four months!
We were here for four months!

348
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,610
For four months,
no one came to this island!

349
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:28,030
We were cold and hungry,
and no one came to find us!

350
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,650
What are you doing?
Hurry up and pull up the anchor!

351
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:33,260
- No!
- Joon Oh!

352
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:38,090
- What are you doing to us?
- Seo Joon Oh, it's dangerous! Let go!

353
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,450
Joon Oh!

354
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:48,040
No! No...

355
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,010
No.

356
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,460
Joon Oh!

357
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:16,650
- CEO Hwang! CEO Hwang!
- They're here!

358
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:21,540
They're here! They're here!

359
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,850
- Over here!
- Come back!

360
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,740
- We're here!
- Come back!

361
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,130
Hurry!

362
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,190
- They're coming! They're coming!
- We're going to live!

363
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,620
- CEO Hwang!
- A little further!

364
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,950
Ji Ah, come here!

365
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,770
Hold on to the rope!

366
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,290
Thank you! Thank you!

367
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,530
Ki Joon, what happened to your face?

368
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:52,970
Tae Ho tried to kill both of us. Without
Journalist Kim, we would have died!

369
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,050
- Right there!
- Ki Joon!

370
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,360
Ki Joon, where's Journalist Kim?

371
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,950
He said he'll come after dealing
with Tae Ho. Get on! Bong Hee!

372
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,270
Yes. Seo Joon Oh, hurry!

373
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,360
Ki Joon, I'll find Journalist Kim.

374
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,020
- Joon Oh!
- Seo Joon Oh! No!

375
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,200
No, let go! No! Seo Joon Oh!

376
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,520
- Hey, Bong Hee!
- Seo Joon Oh!

377
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,270
Journalist Kim!

378
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,400
Journalist Kim!

379
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,440
Journalist Kim...

380
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,100
Instead of evidence...

381
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,690
I wanted to testify on your behalf...

382
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:15,530
- Hey, wait...
- We're in trouble.

383
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:18,400
Can you get up? Come on.

384
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:30,850
Are you all right? Journalist Kim.

385
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,860
- I'm... I'm sorry.
- Hey, why are you sorry?

386
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,080
The person who gave me the information...

387
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,310
was Yoon So Hee.

388
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:49,390
She agreed to reveal everything
in an interview...

389
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:54,420
Hey, don't talk to much.
Journalist Kim, don't talk, okay?

390
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,430
But she kept changing her mind...

391
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:02,480
I got on the plane
so I could convince her.

392
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,120
Okay. I understand. I got it.

393
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:09,880
Wait a minute.

394
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:15,600
The reason why Yoon So Hee
changed her mind...

395
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,160
I think it was because of CEO Jang.

396
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,730
What?

397
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,760
I'll talk to you when I get back.

398
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,500
What else could it be? There's only
one thing we would talk about.

399
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,600
Pl... Please...

400
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,360
expose... the truth.

401
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,070
I'm... I'm sorry...

402
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,290
Journalist Kim.

403
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,240
Journalist Kim.

404
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,510
Journalist Kim.

405
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,540
Damn it!

406
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:17,260
Journalist Kim.

407
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:26,730
We were here for four months.
Four whole months.

408
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:33,070
I beg you.
There's nothing on this island.

409
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:38,030
- Fine! But there's no time. Hurry up!
- Thank you! Thank you!

410
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:42,020
- He said he'll wait. I'm going.
- CEO Hwang, why are you going?

411
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:46,190
Hey, I'm the CEO. I have to go.
If I'm late... then leave without me.

412
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,640
- What?
- But you'd better come back for me!

413
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,680
- Hurry up!
- CEO Hwang! CEO Hwang!

414
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:04,440
- Joon Oh! Joon Oh! CEO Hwang, he's here!
- Joon Oh!

415
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,350
Hey, come on!

416
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:09,260
What were you thinking?

417
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,270
Seo Joon Oh! Get on!

418
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:30,060
Seo Joon Oh, hurry up! Hurry, please!

419
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,350
- We have to leave. Hurry!
- Joon Oh!

420
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,290
Joon Oh!

421
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,560
- Hurry.
- Joon Oh!

422
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,740
Please! Hurry!

423
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,120
Let's talk on the boat! Get on!

424
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,090
Joon Oh!

425
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,730
Do you feel better? Did you throw up?

426
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,930
Gosh, seriously.

427
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,970
I need you... to hit my back.

428
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:41,660
Oh, geez! Wow.

429
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,230
You said you did this in the military!

430
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,920
Hey, is that the same thing?

431
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,620
This is a foreign country, with different
water and fish! Everything's different!

432
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,970
You're hungry again? Yes, so am I.

433
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,350
That's why we're going
where we can find fish!

434
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,940
Stop whining like a three-year-old child!

435
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,950
<i>Let's date. You and I.</i>

436
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,410
<i>I didn't have any feelings,
but Ji Ah didn't either?</i>

437
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:17,700
Ji and I are dating now! It's day one!

438
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:22,480
<i>She wants you to tell her if CEO Hwang
bothers you. She'll protect you.</i>

439
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,650
I've never been on a boat.

440
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:30,160
Gosh! Turn that way!

441
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,640
- We ate the same thing.
- Talk facing that way.

442
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:39,140
Tripletail!
Rock Bream! Rock Bream! Rock Bream!

443
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,890
Salmon! Squid! Squid!

444
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,730
- What are you doing so early?
- Let's catch fish.

445
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,390
Tripletail? Squid? Salmon? Are there any?

446
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:53,260
I don't think I can eat any more
of the mackerel you catch.

447
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,390
- Hurry.
- You enjoyed it.

448
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:58,770
I keep burping.

449
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,940
Yes, that's right.
That's how it is in our line of work.

450
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,390
- Shall we get going then?
- Yes.

451
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,270
Please go on ahead.

452
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,030
- Thank you for today.
- Sure.

453
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,640
The mood of the special investigation
committee improved after one case.

454
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,370
All I did was treat my employees
to dinner for working so hard.

455
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,940
You must always see things
that I can't see.

456
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:57,480
You have to try to see it.

457
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,210
If you decide not to see it,
there's no way you'll see it.

458
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,550
I don't know. What is it
that I decided not to see?

459
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:10,240
I'm talking about
when I went to check So Hee's body.

460
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:15,660
I coincidentally saw Jang Do Pal
at the hospital in China.

461
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:20,110
Do you know who Jang Do Pal
was visiting at the time?

462
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:23,770
- Why is that important?
- Choi Tae Ho.

463
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,830
I thought you knew everything and thought
I was being nosy for nothing.

464
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,030
But I guess you didn't know.

465
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:39,450
Well, isn't that understandable?

466
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,810
They could have timed their return while
watching over Choi Tae Ho's condition.

467
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:47,680
Then why don't you ask
Jang Do Pal about it?

468
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,410
When I see his expression...

469
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:54,570
I'll be able to guess whether or not
you and Jang Do Pal...

470
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:57,050
are on the same team, don't you think?

471
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,410
<i>Okay, pay attention!</i>

472
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:05,540
From now on, Secretary Tae Ho Hang

473
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:10,510
will be the other CEO
of Legend Entertainment.

474
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,000
- Okay, applause!
- Applause!

475
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:21,860
<i>Wait, what? I see.</i>

476
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,610
Congratulations on your promotion.

477
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,520
- It's all thanks to you.
- Why is it thanks to me?

478
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,460
- Huh?
- It's because you did a good job.

479
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,970
Do you think so?

480
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,810
Okay.

481
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,220
Why did you tell them to come here?
You could have talked on the phone.

482
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,730
They found another survivor.
Should that be discussed over the phone?

483
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,430
- Do you know who it could be?
- Why are you asking me?

484
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:56,480
I'll ask one more time out of concern for
you. You're sure it isn't Joon Oh, right?

485
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,400
How many times do I have to tell you
that there's no way?

486
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,880
This time, they found two survivors.

487
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:08,510
If there are two, I can't leave it
to the guys. I'd better go there myself.

488
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:11,700
- I'll go with you.
- You'll only raise suspicion.

489
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,330
Prosecutor Yoon is already
out to get you.

490
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:18,000
CEO... I mean CEO Jang.

491
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,540
Do you remember Tae Ho's meeting
for his Chinese movie?

492
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,760
What if you said that appointment
was pushed to an earlier date?

493
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,840
That will work.

494
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,930
Wow. You're finally acting like a CEO.

495
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:36,340
It's possible they didn't return to Korea
right after being rescued.

496
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,390
They could be waiting for
the right time to return, just like me.

497
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,960
I'm just asking you to keep that in mind.

498
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,830
That's possible.

499
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:52,140
<i>That accomplice is right here.</i>

500
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,090
- Secretary Tae!
- Ra Bong Hee!

501
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,950
She was the accomplice.

502
00:38:56,950 --> 00:39:00,310
<i>When many lies come together,
I guess that becomes the truth.</i>

503
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,070
How will you prove that this is a lie?

504
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:05,920
They outnumber you,
so how can you prove it?

505
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,330
Goodness. I'm here for soy sauce!

506
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:26,380
Did you see her daughter?

507
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,710
I heard that she's not in her right mind.

508
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:33,720
Go figure. I thought she looked pale
and absent-minded.

509
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,110
By the way, how do they plan on
finding other survivors through her?

510
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,320
That's what I'm saying!
That's why they didn't find any.

511
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,550
Who could they find with a girl
who's not in her right mind?

512
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:49,220
Gosh, it's too bad an unmarried girl
is in that kind of state.

513
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:54,470
It's because of her mother's fortune.
Things don't change!

514
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,190
Like mother like daughter!

515
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,580
You ignorant women!

516
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:08,250
Here you are, gossiping about others
because you have nothing better to do!

517
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:11,770
If you really have nothing to do,
go home and take a nap!

518
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,480
Why did you crawl out here?

519
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,630
Why are you making my daughter
into a mental case?

520
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,520
Are you crazy?

521
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,500
Pay me back for cleaning costs right now!

522
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,040
Fine. Fine! I'll give you money,
so go to the laundromat

523
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:30,940
and ask them to wash
your dirty mouths too!

524
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,160
This is why anything
that comes out of your mouths is trash!

525
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,300
Trash? Trash?

526
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,460
You'd better stay out of my sight
from now on!

527
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,850
If you don't, forget soy sauce.

528
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:46,710
I'll pickle you in salt and make you
into salted seafood!

529
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:53,200
You damned wenches...

530
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,880
How dare you talk about my daughter?

531
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,520
Wow, what a nice place.

532
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,590
- Prosecutor Yoon.
- Did you rest well for a few days?

533
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:18,330
I'm sorry for not being helpful to you.

534
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:21,210
Then stop being sorry,
and let's get back to work.

535
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:25,520
- Pardon?
- They found more survivors.

536
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,770
Survivors?

537
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,190
Who are they?

538
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:34,050
They requested personal protection,
so we only know there are two of them.

539
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,210
That's why I wanted to ask...

540
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,180
How about we go and see them in person?

541
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,950
Yes. Yes, I'll go no matter what.

542
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,080
The special investigation
committee doesn't know yet

543
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,510
and Jang Do Pal has guys
working for him in China

544
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,410
so he probably already heard the news.

545
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:52,730
We have to act quickly if we don't want
more witnesses stolen away from us.

546
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:55,060
But Prosecutor Yoon...

547
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,060
Out of those two survivors--

548
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:02,320
Um, I don't know
if this will be helpful...

549
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,610
But one of the two survivors

550
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:10,320
said they wanted you to visit them.

551
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,790
I think it might be Seo Joon Oh.

552
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:25,380
This time, I feel like it's Seo Joon Oh.

553
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,160
Yes, let's hope it is.

554
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,940
If Seo Joon Oh shows up,
we can flip this case around.

555
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,710
- Geez.
- Manager Jung, here.

556
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,690
Wait.

557
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,930
We can treat this when we get to
a hospital, so just hold on until then.

558
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,780
Geez, this is bothersome!

559
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,250
Wow, seriously. Are we really going home?

560
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,610
I didn't know this day would ever come.

561
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:40,120
Oh, everyone, what do you want to do
when you get home?

562
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:45,400
- We have to go to a hospital first.
- That's a given! After that.

563
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,340
What about you?

564
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,310
First, I want to eat delicious food.

565
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:56,130
- Like what?
- Braised short ribs.

566
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:59,420
My mom made
really good braised short ribs.

567
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,150
- I was born as an only son.
- Glutinous rice cakes?

568
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:06,840
No, you idiot.
We had one son for seven generations.

569
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:11,830
I was a precious child. That's why my mom
raised me with such good care.

570
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:13,930
But...

571
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:18,320
She doesn't know if her precious son
is alive or dead...

572
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,570
I can't imagine how worried she must be.

573
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:32,260
16... 17...

574
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,990
18... 19.

575
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:42,910
Seo Joon Oh. Oh!
Wow, seriously! Seo Joon Oh!

576
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:47,420
Wake up, Seo Joon Oh!
Are you all right? Huh? Gosh!

577
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,840
Hey, how many minutes?
Did I pass the four minute mark?

578
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,560
- Four minutes?
- Yeah.

579
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,390
22 seconds! You lasted for seven seconds
longer than last time! New record!

580
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:58,950
Geez, 22 seconds?

581
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:03,090
Hey, this is dangerous!
You almost died! The water is cold!

582
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:05,740
It would be good if I died.
I miss my mom.

583
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:09,290
What are you saying?
How would you see your mom if you died?

584
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:14,120
- My parents are in heaven.
- Pardon?

585
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,390
I have many siblings though!

586
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:20,200
Our Yeol, Tae Ho, and Ki Joon.

587
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,530
I consider Ji Ah a younger sister too.

588
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,360
Hey, forget this! Let's get back to work!

589
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:33,550
Pardon? Don't overdo it, Seo Joon Oh.

590
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:35,940
Hey, I can't let you feed me forever!

591
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:39,080
The artist is supposed to
feed his stylist. Follow me.

592
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:50,200
Wow.

593
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,040
- This is fascinating.
- What is?

594
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:58,150
I thought I would think about home
if I closed my eyes.

595
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,990
But I keep seeing that deserted island.

596
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:05,550
The shelter that we lived in together.

597
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:08,640
The beach.

598
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,390
The yard where we ate our meals.

599
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:15,120
Our So Hee.

600
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,010
Our Yeol.

601
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,380
Geez. I couldn't even thank
Journalist Kim.

602
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,590
If we didn't have the radio
he found, we wouldn't have been saved.

603
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,840
He also...

604
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:36,520
resolved the wrongful accusations
that were made against Joon Oh.

605
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,400
Geez.

606
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:47,430
- What was that?
- Are you all right?

607
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:51,810
They warned us about the weather.
I guess it's beginning.

608
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:58,330
This punk, why isn't he coming back?

609
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,390
Are you all right?

610
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:08,670
You'd better fix this first thing
when you get back.

611
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,390
Hey, hold it in.
Use your hands. Use your hands.

612
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:20,670
<i>Helmsman. Please come back
to the captain's cabin. I repeat.</i>

613
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:25,020
- Wh... What is he saying? Are we here?
<i>- Helmsman, return to the cabin!</i>

614
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,340
It sounds like he's looking for his crew.

615
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:32,950
<i>Where are you? Come back here!
Helmsman, return to the cabin!</i>

616
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:40,160
Wait, Ho Hang. Geez. Where are you going?

617
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:56,060
What are they doing?
They're making me so anxious!

618
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,250
- CEO Hwang.
- Where are you going?

619
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,220
I'm the only one who can speak to them.
I should see if I can help.

620
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:06,290
Find Secretary Tae. I don't know if he
fell into the water while throwing up.

621
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:11,890
Ki Joon, I'll look for Ho Hang.
Stay here, okay?

622
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,410
Don't come out. Stay here, got it?

623
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:17,320
- Be careful!
- He'll probably come back soon.

624
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,470
Ho Hang!

625
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,140
Are you all right?

626
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:51,400
Why did you come in here?
The currents are too strong!

627
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,210
I came to help you!

628
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:57,350
Then hold on to this for a moment.

629
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,960
- All you have to do is hold it steady!
- Okay!

630
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,810
Wow. What is going on here?

631
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:15,230
Ho Hang!

632
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:20,270
Where did that punk go?

633
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:23,460
- What did he say?
- He's asking where he went.

634
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,550
- Wait here.
- Bong Hee, where are you going?

635
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:28,530
Bong Hee!

636
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:32,200
- Geez, she doesn't listen.
- That scared me.

637
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:35,730
Seo Joon Oh!

638
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,850
Secretary Tae!

639
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,960
Ho Hang! Ho Hang!

640
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,630
What's wrong? Ho Hang!
Ho Hang! What are you doing?

641
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:59,230
Get up. Get up!

642
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:02,180
What's wrong? Are you okay? Wake up!

643
00:50:02,180 --> 00:50:05,070
- Joon Oh.
- Are you okay? What is it?

644
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,480
I'm seasick.

645
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:39,120
Excuse me!

646
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:46,330
- It's Tae Ho!
- No!

647
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:49,960
No. Ho Hang, it's okay.

648
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:54,630
No! Don't look! It's okay. It's okay.

649
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:06,020
Ji Ah, wake up. Ji Ah, one minute.

650
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:14,170
Joon Oh, you're blocking the light.
Can you move?

651
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:21,090
Joon Oh, you're blocking the light!

652
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,140
Ki Joon! Ki Joon!

653
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:43,480
Ki Joon.

654
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:57,390
One person is still being treated,
and the other person has recovered

655
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:59,290
but they're postponing their return.

656
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:02,210
They get scared
when they hear anything about Korea.

657
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:06,470
But what's strange is that
they wanted to see Ra Bong Hee.

658
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:09,140
But you don't know
their identities yet, correct?

659
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:11,080
That's correct. Not yet.

660
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,280
Bong Hee!

661
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,570
Oh, Ji Ah. It's you.

662
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,770
What a relief that you're okay.

663
00:52:32,770 --> 00:52:35,750
What about your injury?
Are you all right?

664
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:39,860
I was treated when I got here.
What a relief.

665
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:43,720
It's going to be okay,
now that we're all together.

666
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,320
But was it you...

667
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,660
who asked to see me, by any chance?

668
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:56,290
I did want to see you,
but the person who said that was...

669
00:52:56,290 --> 00:53:01,040
Bong Hee! Bong Hee! Bong Hee! Bong Hee!

670
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,950
- It was hard for you, wasn't it?
- Yes.

671
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:10,900
I'm relieved to see that
you're both okay.

672
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:16,830
Oh, but I was wondering...

673
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:18,790
What about Seo Joon Oh?

674
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:22,160
You two were here for a long time.

675
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:26,090
Did you hear anything about him?

676
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:31,210
Bong Hee, don't you remember?

677
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,680
When we left that island...

678
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:41,110
Manager Jung! Seo--

679
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,320
Ki Joon... No...

680
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:59,000
Ki Joon! Ki Joon...

681
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,830
Put that knife down.

682
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,890
Ra Bong Hee!

683
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,570
Put that down.

684
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,750
I'm the one you want, isn't that right?

685
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,260
No, Joon Oh.

686
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:35,590
I'm going to kill everyone on this boat.

687
00:54:35,590 --> 00:54:38,000
You and her...

688
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:41,680
I'm going to kill everyone here.

689
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:48,940
Mayday! Mayday! (In Chinese)

690
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,230
Oh, there's so much wind!

691
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:53,820
Requesting help!

692
00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:59,760
Joon Oh!

693
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:37,110
Ji Ah. Ji Ah.

694
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:42,230
- No!
- Damn it!

695
00:55:54,610 --> 00:55:57,860
Don't come... Don't come....

696
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:59,680
Don't come near me!

697
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,430
Don't come near me.

698
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:28,520
Don't. Don't.

699
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:57,150
<i>When we were leaving that island,
Joon Oh...</i>

700
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:59,730
<i>Tae Ho stabbed him with the knife.</i>

701
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,720
<i>Right in front of you.</i>

702
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:13,960
<i>Seo Joon Oh, are you... are you okay?</i>

703
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,890
Bong Hee.

704
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:20,290
You're okay, right?

705
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:24,080
I'm okay. What do we do?

706
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,150
That's all that matters.

707
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,050
If you're okay, that's all that matters.

708
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:51,780
No... No.

709
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,240
Look out! (In Chinese)

710
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,350
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Yoon.

711
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:02,870
I have to get going now. I'm sorry.

712
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:05,270
<i>I know you'll think I'm crazy...</i>

713
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:10,310
<i>But for one last time,
I want to believe he's alive.</i>

714
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,920
<i>I got a call.</i>

715
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,820
But his voice...

716
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,840
His voice...

717
01:00:24,170 --> 01:00:26,510
It sounded like Seo Joon Oh.

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,100
<i>So Hee said she was having a hard time,
and that she wanted to die.</i>

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,920
And then she just walked away...

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,890
<i>If you thought it was suicide</i>

5
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,930
<i>how did you find out
that Choi Tae Ho killed Yoon So Hee?</i>

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,090
The truth is...

7
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:30,840
Secretary Tae was a witness.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,960
Oh! So Hee!

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,970
<i>He said Choi Tae Ho threatened him.</i>

10
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,550
If he told anyone what he saw...

11
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,630
I'll kill you too.

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,060
So Secretary Tae lied to everyone
and said Yoon So Hee committed suicide.

13
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,490
To conceal Choi Tae Ho's murder.

14
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:56,240
It looks like it'll be quite noisy
for the next few days.

15
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,710
Yes, this is--

16
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,590
<i>Let's continue.</i>

17
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:10,280
- After Yoon So Hee died, what happened--
- <i>Stop! Stop right now!</i>

18
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,330
They found another survivor.
He's landing in Korea right now!

19
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:30,190
That's why I'm asking, who's the survivor
that you're not telling me about?

20
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,580
What? Hey!

21
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,870
Are you looking down on us?

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,670
This is the chairwoman
of the special investigation committee.

23
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,690
You still cannot enter. Please go back.

24
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,450
- What are you saying--
- Investigator Oh.

25
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:54,280
Let's wait and see
what they're up to behind our backs.

26
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,850
Bong Hee. You're hoping
it's Seo Joon Oh, aren't you?

27
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,990
I... I think it's Seo Joon Oh.

28
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,580
That's Seo Joon Oh's manager.

29
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,030
<i>[Episode 7]</i>

30
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,230
Hey, you must have gone through a lot.

31
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,530
Oh, they're here too.

32
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,610
The survivor who came back...
is the murderer.

33
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,160
Let's go.

34
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,280
Move!

35
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,020
Choi Tae Ho.

36
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,670
I'm Jo Hee Kyung
of the special investigation committee.

37
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,510
Where have you been?

38
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,860
Did you know you came back
at the most unbelievable time?

39
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,440
- I'm not sure what you mean.
- It's true.

40
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,800
Shall we hug as a congratulatory gesture
for your safe return?

41
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,370
I heard you killed Yoon So Hee.

42
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,640
We'll see each other again soon.

43
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,070
I think everyone is still very shocked.

44
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,510
After what happened to So Hee and Yeol...

45
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,950
They must be scared. People who were
by their side started disappearing.

46
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,080
"We might never get rescued.
We might end up living here forever."

47
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,670
That's probably what they're thinking.

48
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,230
It's normal to be scared right now.

49
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,190
That's true. It's normal.

50
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,040
So we should work even harder
to get out of here safe and sound.

51
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,720
Seo Joon Oh, you should be careful too--

52
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,840
Seo Joon Oh! Seo Joon Oh!

53
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,270
What are you doing in there?

54
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,340
Hey, do you think I'm here
because I want to be?

55
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,450
Your words sadden me at times. Last time,
you asked me why I stepped on a mine.

56
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,990
You might as well ask me why I was born!

57
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,850
Here, grab my hand. Come on!

58
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,740
Huh?

59
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:44,540
Thorns! They're thorns!
Why are there thorns?

60
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,810
Hey, why are these here?
Thorns! Thorns! Thorns!

61
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,680
Those aren't thorns. Those are bones.
Give them to me.

62
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,730
There should be more down there.
Look for more.

63
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,700
It's a cow.

64
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,690
- Thorns!
- They're bones. Hand them over.

65
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:04,210
What kind of bones are they?

66
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,820
- It's a rabbit.
- Pardon?

67
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,310
Wow, Ki Joon said the rabbits here
are huge, but they were this big?

68
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,690
Wow, what did the rabbits eat
to grow so big?

69
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,880
Hey, this isn't a rabbit.
These bones should go here.

70
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,700
No, it's a rabbit. It's a scary rabbit--

71
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,010
It's not.
The way I see it, I think it's a pig.

72
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,700
- What?
- I know because I love pig feet.

73
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,630
I'm certain this was a pig.

74
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,160
This is a pig's foot. Its front leg.

75
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,060
The front legs are the most tasty. You
know that right? They're so good.

76
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:53,720
- The back legs are better.
- The front legs! You don't know!

77
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,770
Anyway, why are there pig bones here?

78
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:03,810
Well, I'm sure it fell into the hole,
they way you did.

79
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,830
- Really?
- Yes.

80
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:10,100
- It fell when it was passing by.
- Probably.

81
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,140
- Let's stand guard.
- Here?

82
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,810
Let's stand guard
until another pig falls in!

83
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,300
If we catch a pig, can we eat meat!

84
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,400
That's right! We can!

85
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,380
Let's stop eating seafood!
Everyone is out of energy!

86
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,270
- They'll gain so much energy from this!
- They will! They will!

87
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,870
Do you know why corporate employees
always go out to eat meat?

88
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,330
I've... never worked for a corporation.

89
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,900
Seo Joon Oh, give me my first paycheck
when we get back to Seoul.

90
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:39,490
Okay? I want my first paycheck.

91
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,720
Okay. I'll think about your rate
when we get back.

92
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,740
- Today, I'll catch you a pig!
- Really? Sounds good!

93
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,800
Life is so hard. Gosh...

94
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,880
- Hey, Ha Ji Ah!
- Yeah?

95
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,850
- What's that smell?
- That's not important. Stop that.

96
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,570
Stop what?

97
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,420
<i>You know what I'm talking about!</i>

98
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,390
Stop acting on impulse
in front of CEO Hwang.

99
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,970
When was I acting? Why?

100
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,260
Why else? Even if it was a joke,
do you know how precious your lips are?

101
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,000
And the other person's feelings...

102
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,170
She told you not to feel burdened.
She feels sorry. She didn't mean it.

103
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:30,870
I didn't mean it,
but Ji Ah said she didn't either?

104
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,520
Anyway, don't do it.

105
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,600
- Ki Joon, I--
- Don't. You shouldn't joke like that.

106
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,020
If you joke like that one more time...

107
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,160
I'll really date you.

108
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,600
Bullshit.

109
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,680
I'll really date you.
Do you know how scary I am?

110
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,280
You can't handle me. I'm a real man!

111
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,330
I don't give up either.

112
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,020
It's scary just thinking about it,
isn't it? That's why you should stop.

113
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,060
Ouch, that hurts. That hurt a lot.

114
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,200
Anyway, don't joke around
about things like that!

115
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,990
I guess we'll just date then.

116
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,360
Seo Joon Oh.

117
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,080
Did we do a good job with our camouflage?

118
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,600
Hey. When I served my military service

119
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,360
there was a time when I was undercover
in an area with many trees.

120
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,090
My squad commander peed on me
thinking I was a tree.

121
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,000
That makes no sense. How could
someone mistake a person for a tree?

122
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,820
That's how well I was hidden!

123
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,760
A neighboring platoon hammered a nail
into me to set up their barracks.

124
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,500
Men don't... Ouch! It stings! It stings!

125
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,590
- What's wrong? Seo Joon Oh!
- My neck! Something's on my neck!

126
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,500
Take a look. Ouch, that stings.
Leaves got in, didn't they?

127
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,630
Gosh, you startled me! Gosh.

128
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:00,470
I almost died.

129
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,640
By the way, are all men like that?

130
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,870
Do they all lie
when they talk about the military?

131
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:10,510
Yeah. They all lie.

132
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,510
It's cold now that the sun's setting.
Go back. I'll stay here.

133
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,610
Where would I go? I'm not leaving.
I'm going to stay here.

134
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,950
Why? You look uneasy.

135
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,710
Well... It's because of
what you said before.

136
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:29,250
You told me not to do anything alone,
and stick by your side.

137
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,380
I'm just doing what you told me to do.

138
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,900
Well, it's not like
I'm from the Joseon Dynasty.

139
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,590
I can't just stick to you and scream,
"Help! Save me! Feed me!"

140
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,160
Hey, that's not my thing.
I can't do that.

141
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,770
So let's do everything together.
Let's look out for each other like this.

142
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,590
You can look after me,
while I look after you.

143
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,120
Now that it's night, it's getting cold.

144
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,560
You can ask me for help, to save you,
and to feed you.

145
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,100
I'll do everything by myself,
so don't disappear.

146
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,930
Don't leave my sight.

147
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,040
After the plane crashed, you were
the first person I saw when I woke up.

148
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,740
If you disappear...

149
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,540
or if something happens to you...

150
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,710
It'll be really hard for me.

151
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,200
That's why...

152
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,950
I don't want you to look out for me.

153
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,060
I'll look out for you.

154
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,970
Until we get out of here.

155
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,640
- Oh!
- Oh my gosh!

156
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,280
Oh! It's a pig! We have to catch it!

157
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,180
Where is it? Catch it!

158
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,290
No! Do... Don't throw that!
Please don't throw that! No...

159
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,910
- How's CEO Hwang?
- He's surviving one day at a time.

160
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,240
Who knew he'd live
after the car was crushed like that?

161
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,900
But they said it's almost impossible
that he'll wake up

162
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,470
so don't be too anxious.

163
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,880
But I am.

164
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,000
I am anxious.

165
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,950
CEO Jang, you haven't done
anything right so far.

166
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,980
Hey.

167
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,550
Am I wrong? You couldn't take care of
Ra Bong Hee, so she's back in Korea.

168
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,500
- I didn't know. I didn't know!
- Is that all you can say?

169
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,880
What would you have done
if she hadn't lost her memory?

170
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,010
The chairwoman of the special
investigation committee told me...

171
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,140
She said...

172
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,020
she knows I killed Yoon So Hee.

173
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,030
How does she know that?

174
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:28,170
Did Ra Bong Hee get her memory back?

175
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:33,350
I'll take care of it.
People in politics are all the same.

176
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,150
Let's shake up the playing board.
Shake it up.

177
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,700
The people who were on that island...

178
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,570
They all have to die.

179
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,020
That includes...

180
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,860
Ra Bong Hee.

181
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,220
Let's hold a press conference.

182
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,720
Let's hold a press conference tomorrow

183
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,010
and expose the fact that
Choi Tae Ho killed Yoon So Hee.

184
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,260
- Can you do it?
- Pardon?

185
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,260
Can you do the press conference?

186
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,710
You said you're certain.

187
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,870
Oh. Yes, I'm certain.

188
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,540
I'll do the press conference.

189
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,330
Okay, secure the location,
and find a good hair salon for her.

190
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,860
- Um, Chairwoman Jo.
- Yeah?

191
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,470
- Isn't it too soon?
- What do you mean?

192
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,890
Choi Tae Ho just came back, but if we
make him into a murderer right away--

193
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:38,400
Investigator Oh. How long ago
did Yoon So Hee die?

194
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,770
- It has been three months, hasn't it?
- Yes.

195
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:45,470
Criminal cases, should be
centered around the victim.

196
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,990
That's why, it's not important to us
that Choi Tae Ho returned today.

197
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,380
It's more important that
Yoon So Hee died three months ago.

198
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:55,210
Let's be respectful to the deceased,
Investigator Oh.

199
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,730
I understand.

200
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,980
Let's go. I'll take you home.

201
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,910
<i>[Choi Tae Ho's Top Secret Return]</i>

202
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,700
Yes.

203
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,620
It's me, ma'am. You're quite busy
these days, aren't you?

204
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,530
Yes, what else is new?
You're busy too, aren't you?

205
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:11,760
Since we're both busy,
I'll just get straight to business.

206
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,880
<i>That would be nice.</i>

207
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,760
It's about the person Ra Bong Hee
said was the murderer.

208
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,620
Who was it?

209
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,000
Prosecutor Yoon, you must be curious
about a lot of things.

210
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,450
Wait a day longer.
You'll find out soon enough.

211
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,350
Who do you think you're trying to trick?
You arrogant punk...

212
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,240
- Prosecutor Yoon.
- Yes?

213
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,120
It's about what you asked me last time.

214
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,120
<i>About the patient
in the Chinese hospital.</i>

215
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:06,140
Yes. Did you find out
who was in that room?

216
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:10,250
<i>According to our source
from that hospital...</i>

217
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,360
Prosecutor Yoon, the thing is...

218
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,550
Who is it that you can't tell me?
Is it the president of Korea?

219
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,240
It was Choi Tae Ho.

220
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,510
Who?

221
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,520
<i>Choi Tae Ho.</i>

222
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,170
Then are you saying Choi Tae Ho
intentionally delayed his return?

223
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,980
Is that what you're saying,
Detective Lee?

224
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,640
- Why?
- I'm not sure why yet.

225
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:12,010
Nice to meet you. Are you Chairwoman Jo
of the special investigation committee?

226
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,460
Yes, but...

227
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,590
Oh, you must be that CEO
of Legend Entertainment. Jang...

228
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,190
Yes. I'm Jang Do Pal.

229
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,490
Oh, yes. Yes. Jang Do Pal.
I remember you.

230
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:27,980
But, what brings you here?

231
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:33,370
Our Tae Ho wanted to meet
with you in person.

232
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,810
Why does he want to meet me?

233
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:42,550
Let's get going. I'll escort you
to a comfortable location.

234
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,720
I told you we'd see each other again soon

235
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,540
but I didn't know
I'd see you again quite so soon.

236
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,460
Are you here to turn yourself in?

237
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:19,610
It wasn't me, Chairwoman Jo.

238
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,620
You have the wrong information.
I didn't kill her.

239
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:33,950
Then who was it? Who killed
Yoon So Hee on that island?

240
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:50,590
I didn't know there were
other people so close by.

241
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,160
I should have looked around sooner. Geez.

242
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,680
- Were you here alone all this time?
- Yes.

243
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,630
Wow. You're very skilled!

244
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,320
He did a good job making this.

245
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,150
When I opened my eyes,
the remains of the plane were right there

246
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:10,340
so I packed up everything from
the plane and found a place to live.

247
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,620
- Can I eat this?
- Yes, go ahead.

248
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,210
Thank you.

249
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,690
Geez, after living day to day...

250
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,540
- It's been a few months now, hasn't it?
- I think so.

251
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,790
The weather has been unpredictable,
and it's getting colder.

252
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,530
It must have been hard by yourself.

253
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:31,840
Just when I thought I was going to die,
I ran into you two!

254
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,530
That's a relief.

255
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,830
- A pig would have been better.
- Pardon?

256
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,090
Did you hear? Anyway, we normally
wouldn't have come out this far.

257
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:44,030
We were all lucky.

258
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,460
Anyway, nice to meet you, Seo Joon Oh.

259
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,350
I'm Kim Ki Hwan, an entertainment
journalist at Myungsung Report.

260
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,680
Oh. You're a journalist.

261
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,490
I knew you looked familiar.
Have you interviewed me?

262
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,610
Oh, I remember interviewing
Yeol and Choi Tae Ho.

263
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,780
Seo Joon Oh! Look at this! Look!
It's a radio, isn't it?

264
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,430
- Hey, no, it's not...
- No, it's a radio.

265
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:13,060
- Did you not serve?
- I served my time!

266
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,070
It is a radio!

267
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,050
Does it work?

268
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,750
Wow. Where did you find this?

269
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,450
- Give it to me.
- It's heavy, be careful.

270
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,150
Someone from the military
must have been here.

271
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:28,860
I was walking by and found it.

272
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,990
Does it get a signal?

273
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,990
Well, it looks like soldiers were here
too. Didn't you find anything like this?

274
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,220
- We didn't find anything special here.
- Does it work?

275
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,470
Hey! If someone can fix this,
it could work. Who knows?

276
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,960
Secretary Tae! He went
to a technical high school!

277
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,100
- Really?
- Seriously?

278
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,070
- He might be able to look at it!
- He's in there. Call him out.

279
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,780
Oh, but didn't he skip our last meal?
I'll get him something--

280
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,400
Hey, leave him alone!
How many days has it been?

281
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,590
Okay.

282
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,580
Do you even know what you're doing?

283
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,840
What's wrong with Secretary Tae?

284
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,640
Did something happen?

285
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:22,040
Oh, he's just not feeling well.

286
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,080
He's not?

287
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,870
Choi Tae Ho is alive too?

288
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,430
- It's broken.
- This doesn't work.

289
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,510
Let's ask Secretary Tae.

290
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,750
Choi Tae Ho?

291
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:56,420
Who are you?

292
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,990
I'll be living with you from now on.
Please look after me.

293
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,560
You didn't tell me who you are yet.

294
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,510
Oh... I was a journalist.

295
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,300
But does that really matter here? Call me
whatever you like. "Older Bro" is fine.

296
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,820
"Excuse me" is fine too.

297
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,640
He's a journalist?

298
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,610
- Really?
- Yes, I'm telling you!

299
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,010
Hey, no way!

300
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:36,450
He's not dating her!
That actor is dating a singer!

301
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,560
Hey, I know who he is. He's my friend.

302
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,160
- Really?
- Didn't you know?

303
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,310
- Wow, really?
- No way. No way.

304
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:47,480
No, really! During a live broadcast...

305
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,960
Joon Oh. Let's talk for a second.

306
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
You were totally fooled.

307
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,420
Were you fooled all your life?

308
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,260
You're too much.

309
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,760
Who's that person?

310
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,200
He said he's Journalist Kim.
He was on the same plane. Why?

311
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,600
Are you letting just anyone join us here?
Who do you think he is?

312
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,690
Hey, he would have died if we'd left him
alone. How could I leave him there?

313
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,800
In what way does that person look like
he's about to die?

314
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,580
Is this your first time meeting
a feisty journalist? What's up with you?

315
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,980
Do you actually believe
he's a journalist?

316
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,350
What if he's not? Why would that matter?

317
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:30,720
Gosh, this man. Get up! Get up! Get up!

318
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,550
I bet this doesn't hurt
because you're fat.

319
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:36,470
Ho Hang, something bad could happen.
You'll collapse!

320
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,800
- Ho Hang!
- I'm okay.

321
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,740
Mister, this is your last chance.
If you don't eat, that's it.

322
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,620
Let's get up. Okay. Please open wide.

323
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,160
- Eat.
- Open wide.

324
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,940
I'll eat it myself.

325
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,000
I'll eat this by myself, so go out there
and do what you need to do.

326
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,330
- Okay. Eat.
- We'll get out of here no matter what...

327
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,190
But please forget about it already.

328
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,830
You weren't the one who killed So Hee.

329
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,660
- Ji Ah.
- You did nothing wrong.

330
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,040
- Geez, seriously. Ho Hang!
- I'll eat.

331
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:26,550
Eat, okay? Forget it, let's go.

332
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,700
Make sure you eat, Secretary Tae.

333
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:32,800
Don't eat it then!

334
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,490
You should have let it slide.
Did you have to say that?

335
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,750
I don't know. I'm pissed off. Is he the
only one suffering after So Hee's death?

336
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,240
We're having a harder time.

337
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,270
Even if you're pissed off...
He needs to eat.

338
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,380
You always say everything that's
on your mind without thinking.

339
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,290
Are you talking about Yoon So Hee?

340
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,660
Was Yoon So Hee with you too?

341
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,920
She died a few days ago.

342
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,950
Wait, why? I mean... How?

343
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,900
She committed suicide.

344
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,100
Suicide?

345
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,610
CEO Hwang scolded Secretary Tae for not
saying anything to So Hee as she left.

346
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:24,070
CEO Hwang said Secretary Tae
killed So Hee.

347
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,680
<i>That's why he's acting like that.
He won't eat and has no energy.</i>

348
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,870
<i>Because he feels guilty.</i>

349
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,630
Ho Hang.

350
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,670
Did you stay in here all day again?

351
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:02,880
Yeah.

352
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:07,670
Go outside and see some
sunlight tomorrow.

353
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,870
Don't stay inside too much.

354
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:17,340
Don't forget your meals either.
Everyone is worried about you.

355
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,200
Yeah... I will.

356
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,370
Good night, Ho Hang.

357
00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:36,820
Choi Tae Ho, you know, don't you?

358
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:41,130
I feel like you know...

359
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,760
why Yoon So Hee died.

360
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,790
She must have been scared.

361
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:59,980
Scared? Of you?

362
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,910
No.

363
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,590
Of this island.

364
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,720
Where should I put this?

365
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,540
You can put it over there.

366
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,420
Oh, these are cooking so well.

367
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,060
I'll help you cook these.

368
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,930
- No, that's okay.
- No, I can do it.

369
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,590
About what you said yesterday...

370
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,450
About Yoon So Hee.

371
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,740
Oh, yes.

372
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,030
Why do you think it was suicide?

373
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,850
Because we saw her dead body.

374
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:07,040
But when someone commits suicide,
there should be signs, don't you think?

375
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:12,150
Someone should have suspected
that she would. Something like that.

376
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:17,050
Can someone decide to commit suicide
overnight?

377
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:21,550
Think about it carefully. Think about
how she acted before she died.

378
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,700
Is it ready?

379
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,330
- I'll finish it.
- Give it to me. Yes.

380
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,340
Give it to me. I'll do it.

381
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,360
Is something wrong?

382
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,280
No, it's nothing.

383
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,500
- It's burning. I'll do it--
- Let go! I'll do it.

384
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,380
Don't block the wind. Go.

385
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,340
That day...

386
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,290
Is there anyone else who thought
So Hee acted strangely?

387
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:11,180
Mister, you said you talked to
So Hee that night.

388
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:15,210
Was anything else strange
about So Hee that night?

389
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:26,680
- What are you saying all of a sudden?
- It's not all of a sudden.

390
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,390
It's been bothering me
for quite some time.

391
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:33,730
She told me she wanted to return to Seoul
together. But she died the next day.

392
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,880
And she committed suicide.

393
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,520
Does that make sense?

394
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,600
Does anyone else know anything?

395
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,120
Did I bring up something unnecessary?
We're all thinking the same thing!

396
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,830
I too...

397
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,590
have been frustrated all day long.

398
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,630
I'm upset, but what can we do?
What can we do? There's no solution.

399
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,870
I feel sorry for So Hee too.

400
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:13,770
That's why we need to find out.

401
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:16,660
If it wasn't suicide...

402
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,030
Don't you think someone
could have killed Yoon So Hee?

403
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,090
Who would have killed So Hee?

404
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,130
Don't say things like that.

405
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,180
Damn it!

406
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:38,550
What are you doing here?
Go inside if you're finished.

407
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,980
- Why did you bring that up?
- Geez, you scared me!

408
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:06,830
Why did bring that up all of a sudden
just to make everyone anxious?

409
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,960
I didn't bring up anything pointless.

410
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,400
I probably know a lot more
about Yoon So Hee than you do.

411
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:23,650
You have to believe me.

412
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,480
Don't trust... Choi Tae Ho.

413
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,670
He's a dangerous man.

414
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:33,840
He probably killed Yoon So Hee too.

415
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:29,980
Who the hell are you?

416
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,880
Come out.

417
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,030
Come out, you son of a bitch!

418
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,130
Who the hell are you? What the hell
is this, you son of a bitch?

419
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:43,700
Hey, what's wrong with you?

420
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,680
Let go. Let go! Look at this. Look at it!

421
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:51,810
I told you, didn't I? This bastard is up
to something. We have to kick him out!

422
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:55,680
Why would he have boarded our plane
with this? Why did he follow us here?

423
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,720
Let me see!

424
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,530
Who is this?

425
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,040
Jae Hyun and So Hee!

426
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,250
Are these yours?

427
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:25,220
Wait, why do you have these...

428
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:28,210
That was the first article I wrote.

429
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,390
Shin Jae Hyun's suicide incident.

430
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:38,060
I told you, didn't I? I know more
about Yoon So Hee than you do.

431
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:41,880
I got to know Yoon So Hee after that.

432
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,510
These two were secretly dating.

433
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:53,280
<i>This is what Choi Tae Ho said.</i>

434
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,510
He said he didn't kill Yoon So Hee.
He asked me to believe him instead.

435
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:02,750
- But Ra Bong Hee said Choi Tae Ho--
- What job are we here to do?

436
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,090
Pardon?

437
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:09,850
What is our job as the special
investigation committee for that crash?

438
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:13,630
No, forget that.
What job should we be doing?

439
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,470
We should investigate
and reveal the truth--

440
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,070
The truth?

441
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:20,000
How are we supposed to know the truth?

442
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,020
What are you trying to say?

443
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,580
It's his word against hers.

444
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:34,440
Whose side should we take,
so that we'll get fewer insults?

445
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:51,590
<i>He probably killed Yoon So Hee too.</i>

446
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,770
<i>It was an accident...</i>

447
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:59,710
<i>I really... didn't mean
to kill him, Joon Oh.</i>

448
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,330
We need to survive!

449
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:06,410
You, Yeol, and CEO Hwang...
Why are you doing this to me?

450
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,990
We can't just die here, Joon Oh.

451
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:32,090
Geez, you scared me.

452
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,280
You should indicate
your presence next time.

453
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,770
Who the hell are you?

454
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,120
- Huh? I told you I'm a journalist.
- Stop joking around.

455
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,100
Why did you come here
and bring up Jae Hyun and So Hee?

456
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,070
Why are you confusing everyone?

457
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,220
Geez, what confusion?

458
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,820
If you don't want everyone to be
confused, why don't you just tell them?

459
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,650
This man is seriously...

460
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:02,600
Tell them what?

461
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,140
What should I tell everyone?

462
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,120
That you killed her.

463
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,010
Isn't it wrong to play innocent
after killing someone like that?

464
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,580
You're a real actor now, huh?
Your acting skills have improved.

465
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,520
You crazy bastard.

466
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,080
Whom did I kill?

467
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,470
We'll find out who the crazy one is...

468
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:35,370
later on, right?

469
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:38,530
Move.

470
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,540
Why are you all doing this to me?

471
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,060
<i>I don't know why you're looking out
for that bastard, Choi Tae Ho...</i>

472
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:23,230
But you said he killed Yeol.
You said you heard him admit to it.

473
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:27,570
That's right, Joon Oh. If we think about
Yeol, it's not right to keep Tae Ho here.

474
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,370
Then should we kill him?

475
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,880
What if Tae Ho volunteers to leave on
his own? Then we can let him go, right?

476
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,940
That wouldn't be our fault.

477
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,320
Seo Joon Oh.

478
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,960
About this afternoon...

479
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:18,770
Your mind is pretty chaotic
because of Choi Tae Ho, isn't it?

480
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,150
Yeah, well, you know...

481
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,730
Talk to me if you're struggling
with anything.

482
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,920
<i>Tae Ho, that punk...</i>

483
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,280
<i>If I made up my mind to trust him...</i>

484
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,970
<i>I should continue to trust him
until the end.</i>

485
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,060
<i>But I've been overwhelmed
with many thoughts these days.</i>

486
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:04,540
After I brought him here...

487
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,860
I shouldn't be like this.

488
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,250
I have a lot to think about.

489
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,790
When you have too much to think about,
being active is the best solution.

490
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:22,960
I saw a whole field of mushrooms
in the woods a few days ago.

491
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,730
Let's all go tomorrow and pick mushrooms.

492
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:27,520
Make Choi Tae Ho do all the work
so that he doesn't cause trouble.

493
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,880
As if he would do all the work.

494
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,080
Hey, he's just like me.
He doesn't use his body.

495
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,830
Well, then... we'll just leave him here.

496
00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:40,190
- Then why would we tell him?
- It's basic manners to ask him.

497
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,200
- Let's go.
- It snowed a lot in the woods.

498
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,970
We'll look at the snow,
and pick mushrooms. It'll be fun.

499
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,930
- There are mushrooms?
- Yes!

500
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:53,250
There are so many! You'll be surprised!

501
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,800
- Should we all go together?
- Yes.

502
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,130
Okay. Let's go.

503
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:07,590
Hey, Secretary Tae.
Are you really not going to get up?

504
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,480
Let's go! It'll feel like we're hiking,
and it'll refresh our moods!

505
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,730
CEO Hwang. I'll rest, just today.

506
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,290
- Journalist Kim, get up! Let's go!
- Please let me stay.

507
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:22,460
I feel so happy
after a good night's sleep.

508
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,960
They're not coming!

509
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:33,470
You should come with us.
It'll be just the two of you here.

510
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:37,580
Don't worry about Secretary Tae.
I'll make sure he eats.

511
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,020
Please take care of him.

512
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,660
Ho Hang, I brought you water.

513
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,340
- Let's go, CEO Hwang.
- Sure.

514
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:53,500
Geez, these shameless punks.
I'm only letting it go this time!

515
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,740
- I think we should take all of this.
- Will this be enough?

516
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,080
- Let's go!
- Oh.

517
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,150
What about Journalist Kim
and Secretary Tae?

518
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,770
Secretary Tae isn't well, so Journalist
Kim will look after him. Let's go.

519
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:10,010
It's a good idea to go on a field trip
for some fresh air. Bong Hee is smart.

520
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:13,080
- Ji Ah, let's go!
- Follow us with this.

521
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,350
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

522
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,400
- Let's go.
- Sure.

523
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,580
- We'll be back!
- Rest well!

524
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:53,350
How could there be mushrooms
in a field covered in snow?

525
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:57,250
No, CEO Hwang! When I came last time,
there were so many!

526
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:02,130
- I'm sure they're dead by now!
- They were nearby. Wait a minute.

527
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:04,980
- There's so much snow.
- Let's go! Hey, let's go.

528
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,850
- Hey, you said there were lots!
- Oh, here they are!

529
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:13,210
Mushrooms! Look! I found them!
See? They're under the trees!

530
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,590
- Wow, that's amazing!
- They're good to eat.

531
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,790
- Oh, here they are!
- It tastes like beef.

532
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:21,460
- Wow!
- CEO Hwang!

533
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:23,700
- Wow!
- They're here!

534
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,290
- Whoa!
- Where did you find them?

535
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:29,270
If you dig under the snow
next to the trees, you'll find them.

536
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:31,500
Oh, they're here.
They're here! They're here!

537
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,160
- Let's look for more!
- Wow, I can't believe this.

538
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,580
Are they delicious?

539
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,820
Give me the bag. Hey, there are
mushrooms here. Look for them.

540
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:42,750
Hey, let's grill these like meat!

541
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,890
Oh, it's so cold! Seo Joon Oh!

542
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:50,270
Okay. You did well.

543
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:55,180
Gosh, it got in my ear! CEO Hwang!
I mean Manager Jung!

544
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:04,320
- Geez!
- That was embarrassing!

545
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:09,140
- Why don't you listen to me?
- Pick some mushrooms!

546
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,150
Come here! Hey.

547
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:16,750
Hey, look for mushrooms.
Look for mushrooms already.

548
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:21,450
Stop it! Stop it... What are you doing?

549
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:29,260
Let's try here.

550
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,890
Seo Joon Oh!

551
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,810
Oh, it's so cold!

552
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:41,120
Let's hurry up so we can go back!
There are many over there too...

553
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,840
- Ra Bong Hee.
- Yes?

554
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,760
Where's Choi Tae Ho?

555
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,390
Huh? Oh!

556
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:52,680
Wait, he was nearby just a minute ago.

557
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,870
- I'll go look for him.
- Wait. Let's go together.

558
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:58,100
No, I'm sure he just
went to go to the bathroom

559
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,680
Take care of the others, okay?

560
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,430
Where did he go?

561
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,070
Secretary Tae!

562
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:16,670
The fish is ready!

563
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:18,610
Where did he go?

564
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:31,890
What? Why are you back already?

565
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:44,930
Where are you going?

566
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:57,890
The problem is... your big mouth.

567
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,290
Joon Oh!

568
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:27,910
- Joon Oh!
- What?

569
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:30,180
Why are you out here? Huh?

570
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,820
- Choi Tae Ho... That bastard...
- Wh... What?

571
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:37,400
Choi Tae Ho! He's killing Journalist Kim!

572
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:47,180
Geez, Journalist Kim.
You should have died in the crash.

573
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,570
But you survived...

574
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:53,110
You should have just lived quietly!

575
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:56,160
Why do you have to open
your mouth all the time?

576
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,650
How much do you know?

577
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,650
How much do you really know?

578
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:04,950
Wait...

579
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:08,370
Where are you going?

580
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:17,360
Where are you going in the middle
of our conversation? Huh?

581
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,570
Journalist Kim.

582
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:39,320
You talked so well in front of
the others. Why can't you talk now?

583
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:45,050
Talk to me. Talk.

584
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,420
Bong Hee! Bong Hee, look at this.

585
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,050
Bong Hee. Ta-da!

586
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:15,980
Hey, I paid a lot of money
for this back in the day.

587
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,440
Hey, this is a designer brand!

588
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,910
- It's pretty.
- Try it on.

589
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:27,830
Gosh, your arms are stuck. Take a look.

590
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:37,910
Bong Hee.

591
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:42,810
I'm on your team,
and so is everyone else.

592
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:44,890
That's why, Bong Hee...

593
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:49,170
Don't be scared or afraid...

594
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:54,260
Tell them exactly what you saw
and experienced on that island.

595
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:58,140
Think about those people
who are precious to you.

596
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:05,360
The people who could
still be alive... or dead.

597
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:10,900
That would be the courteous thing
to do for those people. Okay, Bong Hee?

598
00:49:25,050 --> 00:49:30,310
<i>The citizens are still demanding
that the truth be revealed...</i>

599
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:32,050
Yes, Investigator Oh.

600
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,890
Hello, did you leave yet, by any chance?

601
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:39,080
Yes. I think I'm almost there.

602
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:43,740
Oh, well... The situation
has changed quite a bit.

603
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:48,940
Hey, shouldn't this say "accident?"
Check it again!

604
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:52,490
<i>I think you should go back home for now.</i>

605
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:56,150
Pardon?
What are you saying all of a sudden?

606
00:49:56,150 --> 00:50:00,350
I was told to tell you
not to come here right now.

607
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:04,790
- Investigator--
<i>- They formally requested that we wait.</i>

608
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:11,510
<i>We will talk to Reporter Choi Jeong Ah
at the scene.</i>

609
00:50:11,510 --> 00:50:14,240
<i>The press conference is about to start.</i>

610
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,260
<i>Through the survivors' testimony,
the special investigation committee</i>

611
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:22,160
<i>has promised to reveal the truth
about Yoon So Hee's death.</i>

612
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,300
<i>It is predicted that Yoon So Hee's case</i>

613
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:28,330
<i>as well as information about
the other survivors will be revealed</i>

614
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:31,230
<i>so it is capturing a lot of attention.</i>

615
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,290
What are you doing?

616
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:23,640
Huh?

617
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:26,350
What the hell are you doing?

618
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:36,660
Journalist Kim, look at me.
Look at me. Get up.

619
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:42,260
Look at me. Wake up. Look at me!
Journalist Kim!

620
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,450
Hey! Hey, what's wrong with him?

621
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:48,380
- Journalist Kim!
- What happened to him?

622
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:50,910
- Take a look at him.
- Please wake up!

623
00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:54,120
There's a pulse, but he needs to wake up
so we can check his condition.

624
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:58,580
- Can you bring me a towel and water?
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

625
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:01,200
Mister! What do we do?

626
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:05,070
That bastard did this, didn't he?

627
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,510
This wasn't an accident! He was trying
to kill him! Does he kill out of habit?

628
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:14,700
Ki Joon, he has to wake up.
I have to ask him something, okay?

629
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,500
Okay. Okay.

630
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:19,800
<i>You have to believe me.</i>

631
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,630
<i>Don't trust... Choi Tae Ho.</i>

632
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:25,910
<i>He's a dangerous man.</i>

633
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:29,440
<i>He probably killed Yoon So Hee too.</i>

634
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,250
Why did you do it?

635
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,590
That son of a bitch started it.

636
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:01,420
He was meddling in everything,
and annoyed the hell out of me--

637
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:05,280
Do you kill people who annoy you,
you son of a bitch?

638
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:10,510
He didn't die. If he didn't die,
there's no problem, right?

639
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:13,760
No. You tried to kill him.

640
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,210
- I was just trying to scare him.
- No! You tried to kill him.

641
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,570
But you failed because of me.

642
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:23,260
No.

643
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:26,530
I said you're wrong.
Why do you keep doubting me?

644
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:29,210
You did it to So Hee too!

645
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:34,290
What? What did he do to So Hee?

646
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:37,210
Tae Ho...

647
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:39,350
did it to So Hee too.

648
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,430
I saw it all.

649
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,390
That's bullshit!

650
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:56,670
What? What... did you see?

651
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,380
This bastard...

652
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:02,010
This bastard killed So Hee!

653
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:04,810
And disguised it as suicide!

654
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:07,630
I saw it all!

655
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:11,930
He said... he'd kill me if I told anyone.

656
00:54:24,150 --> 00:54:26,770
Did you...

657
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,840
really kill So Hee?

658
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,870
Is that guy crazy?

659
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,710
Hey, what's with you guys?

660
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:42,880
Do you believe him? Do you believe
what that crazy bastard is saying?

661
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:59,140
He's not just crazy,
he's completely insane!

662
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:02,270
Hurry up and tell the truth!
Stop this bullshit and tell the truth!

663
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:04,450
No! I'm not lying!

664
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:08,480
I saw it! I saw... I saw him kill So Hee!

665
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,940
I don't lie! I really saw it!

666
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:14,540
He killed So Hee.

667
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,350
Tae Ho.

668
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:32,670
CEO Hwang.

669
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,970
CEO Hwang,
why are you being like this too?

670
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:42,890
Why did you do it, you bastard?
Are you crazy?

671
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:47,720
Yeol... You killed Yeol.

672
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,820
And you killed So Hee too.

673
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:53,420
Why did you kill those innocent kids,
you bastard?

674
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,650
I told you it wasn't me!

675
00:56:02,210 --> 00:56:04,560
Your friends!

676
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,110
Those poor and innocent...

677
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:10,340
younger friends of yours...

678
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:15,110
How could you kill them,
you son of a bitch? Huh?

679
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:18,760
You son of a bitch! Damn it!

680
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,580
You damned son of a bitch!

681
00:56:22,270 --> 00:56:24,590
Shit!

682
00:57:10,250 --> 00:57:15,680
<i>Now, we will listen
to the testimony of Choi Tae Ho</i>

683
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,500
<i>who is a survivor of
the Legend Entertainment plane crash.</i>

684
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,860
<i>This is regarding Yoon So Hee's murder,
which was a mystery during his absence.</i>

685
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:29,160
<i>Please listen to the testimony of
Choi Tae Ho, who was a decisive witness.</i>

686
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:47,030
- If she shows up, don't let her in.
- Sure.

687
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,520
Everything I'm about to tell you...

688
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:56,470
is all true...

689
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:01,610
and I witnessed all of it myself.

690
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,510
That person...

691
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:15,630
was always a threatening person to us.

692
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:21,690
<i>That's why Yoon So Hee...
always called him a murderer.</i>

693
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,800
And he...

694
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,720
tried to kill all of us.

695
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:42,510
Chairwoman Jo.

696
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:46,280
We're... doing the right thing, right?

697
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,960
Wait, Miss! No, stop.

698
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,550
- Mister, what?
- Hey, go home!

699
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:56,960
- Hey, block her! Block her!
- Why are you doing this?

700
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,360
- Hey, where are you trying to go--
- Hey!

701
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:03,940
This is illegal. Don't you know that?

702
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,190
Hey, who are you?

703
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:07,640
We're from the western
district prosecutor's office.

704
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,020
- You go.
- Don't push.

705
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:16,800
- Who are you?
- Um, we're...

706
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,100
We're here for an internship
with a security company.

707
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:22,680
- Yes!
- Yes!

708
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,980
Are you interested
in a prosecution investigation too?

709
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:26,390
Maybe not that.

710
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:29,350
- We had many experiences already.
- I'm going to the washroom!

711
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:33,730
He wanted survive by himself...

712
00:59:33,730 --> 00:59:38,620
So he tried to kill us,
when we were in the lifeboat with him.

713
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:48,900
<i>It was because... we knew the truth.</i>

714
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,690
To that person, we were...

715
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:54,350
people who needed to die.

716
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:02,370
Who was that person? Please tell us.

717
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,550
That murderer was...

718
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:13,400
Seo Joon Oh.

719
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:20,060
<i>It was Seo Joon Oh.</i>

Think about your own future.</i>

730
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:38,130
<i>If I told you someone went to his house
before he died, would you believe me?</i>

731
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:42,160
<i>Tell me! Why do I have to keep
you alive? Tell me!</i>

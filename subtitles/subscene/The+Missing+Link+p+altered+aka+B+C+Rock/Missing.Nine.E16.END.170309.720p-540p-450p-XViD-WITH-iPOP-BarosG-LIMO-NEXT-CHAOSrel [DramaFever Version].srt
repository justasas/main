00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,149
<i>Even if you think I'm crazy,
I have no choice.</i>

3
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:27,268
There's only one way.

4
00:00:31,292 --> 00:00:33,312
I'll turn myself in.

5
00:00:34,042 --> 00:00:39,820
Wow, Seo Joon Oh.
It's so hard to see your face.

6
00:00:41,935 --> 00:00:47,892
Since you came here yourself,
let's create a masterpiece together.

7
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:52,912
<i>You still should have stopped him!</i>

8
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:55,890
You were the one who didn't want
the prosecution to be involved.

9
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,164
But you just let him go?

10
00:00:59,164 --> 00:01:04,344
If he went there without a plan,
it'll be over for him. What do we do?

11
00:01:06,088 --> 00:01:10,021
<i>It can only be Choi Tae Ho,
who left under an agreement.</i>

12
00:01:11,094 --> 00:01:13,871
He agreed to take care of it instead.

13
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:28,923
So that means
I need to split those two up?

14
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:33,081
It's your job to win Jang Do Pal
over to our side, Seo Joon Oh.

15
00:01:40,093 --> 00:01:43,128
Geez, what is that on your head?

16
00:01:43,822 --> 00:01:47,760
- You look good.
- Why did you want to see me?

17
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,984
Do you think it'll be okay
if we leave them alone like this?

18
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:54,180
Turn up the volume!

19
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,114
<i>Have you been well?</i>

20
00:01:56,114 --> 00:01:59,394
I feel at ease because
I have nothing to worry about.

21
00:01:59,394 --> 00:02:03,683
It's more like you're generous.
You're even in jail for Tae Ho.

22
00:02:03,683 --> 00:02:08,686
If... you're trying to
get something out of me--

23
00:02:08,686 --> 00:02:10,239
What about Tae Ho?

24
00:02:11,477 --> 00:02:13,245
Does he come to visit you?

25
00:02:14,575 --> 00:02:17,605
Do you even know
what Tae Ho is doing out there?

26
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,155
- Do I have to know that?
- Of course you should.

27
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:30,490
You should be curious if you confessed
to a crime in return for a favor.

28
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:46,110
But do you think Tae Ho
will do you that favor?

29
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,120
Even if you're willing
to get your hands dirty for Tae Ho

30
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,145
Tae Ho would never do that for you.

31
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,764
It seems like he already
forgot about your favor.

32
00:02:55,764 --> 00:02:57,323
I'm not sure what you're saying.

33
00:02:57,323 --> 00:02:59,800
I never asked for a favor--

34
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,864
CEO Hwang...

35
00:03:03,677 --> 00:03:05,782
can speak now.

36
00:03:12,143 --> 00:03:15,097
So? What do you want me to do about it?

37
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:18,323
I don't know why I'm listening to this.

38
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,098
Hey, what is he doing?

39
00:03:21,098 --> 00:03:23,786
- Do you trust Choi Tae Ho that much?
- Let go!

40
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,433
- Go! Go! Hurry!
- Yes!

41
00:03:26,433 --> 00:03:29,152
- What is this bastard doing?
- Hey, open the door!

42
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,167
Open up!

43
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:33,169
<i>Open the door!</i>

44
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:36,973
Don't move!

45
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:39,462
Don't move!

46
00:03:40,468 --> 00:03:42,140
Take him away.

47
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:50,883
Seo Joon Oh, are you crazy?
What the hell were you doing?

48
00:03:50,883 --> 00:03:53,883
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

49
00:03:54,497 --> 00:03:58,485
You son of a bitch!
Are you playing with me?

50
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:00,570
No, I'm not.

51
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,771
<i>- Do you trust Choi Tae Ho that much?</i>
- Let go!

52
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:18,905
The underling you ordered to kill
CEO Hwang. You told Tae Ho to kill him.

53
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:21,300
But what do we do?

54
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,158
I saw Choi Tae Ho
and that underling being friendly.

55
00:04:25,158 --> 00:04:27,199
You were tricked.

56
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,767
<i>It's him.</i>

57
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:34,137
This is the guy who tried to
inject poison into CEO Hwang.

58
00:04:36,463 --> 00:04:38,822
<i>That's right, Joon Oh. I saw that guy.</i>

59
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:42,821
You once showed me a composite
of a guy and asked me if I knew him.

60
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:47,694
You said he caused CEO Hwang's accident
and that we needed to find him.

61
00:04:47,694 --> 00:04:52,430
<i>That guy got out of Tae Ho's van
and even bowed to him.</i>

62
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,490
<i>He acted as if he was Tae Ho's underling.</i>

63
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:02,699
<i>- What is this bastard doing?
- Hey, open up!</i>

64
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,103
<i>Open the door! Open up!</i>

65
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:09,848
Don't move!

66
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:22,427
Turn myself in?

67
00:05:23,733 --> 00:05:24,851
When did I say that?

68
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:28,605
You said you'd confess
if I let you see Jang Do Pal.

69
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:31,583
When did I say that?
I told you I'd confess?

70
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,634
Geez, seriously.

71
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,975
You're seriously crossing the line.

72
00:05:36,975 --> 00:05:39,846
If you're going to act like this,
I want a trial!

73
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:43,891
You said you can lock me up
even if I don't confess! I'm leaving.

74
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:48,437
Hey, seriously! Damn it!

75
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:53,153
Hey! Get this bastard out of here!
Get him out of here!

76
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:56,718
I... I won't forgive you for this.

77
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,899
- Bong Hee!
- Hello.

78
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:09,593
You're here?

79
00:06:09,593 --> 00:06:11,838
I heard Joon Oh turned himself in.

80
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,062
He didn't turn himself in...

81
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,925
He went in... instead of me.

82
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:22,855
The good news is...

83
00:06:22,855 --> 00:06:27,271
we will get a trial,
regardless of Seo Joon Oh's confession.

84
00:06:27,271 --> 00:06:31,752
Your statements all been neutralized,
so we needed a new angle.

85
00:06:31,752 --> 00:06:33,658
This might be for the best.

86
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:37,300
Why are we hopeful about this trial?

87
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,985
Do you have something planned?

88
00:06:38,985 --> 00:06:43,098
First, we have a reliable lawyer
on our side.

89
00:06:43,098 --> 00:06:45,307
- You're a lawyer?
- Yes.

90
00:06:45,307 --> 00:06:50,343
When did you become a lawyer?
Did you do it for Joon Oh?

91
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,841
No, it's not like that.
I've been preparing for a long time.

92
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:58,605
But I slowed down because of Seo Joon Oh
and then sped up thanks to him.

93
00:06:58,605 --> 00:07:00,380
- Pardon?
- I'll tell you later.

94
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,394
- What does that mean?
- Anyway, congratulations.

95
00:07:03,394 --> 00:07:04,677
Thank you.

96
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:07,975
Then, shall we plan for our trial?

97
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:13,223
I want to ask Hwang Jae Gook to be
our first witness, what do you think?

98
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:15,170
May I say something?

99
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,033
CEO Hwang hasn't fully recovered yet,
so will he be okay?

100
00:07:19,033 --> 00:07:22,485
He's right.
He can't even speak properly yet.

101
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:25,038
But we should still give it a shot.

102
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,286
I'll ask CEO Hwang about it.

103
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:38,451
Yes. Yes. I understand.

104
00:07:38,451 --> 00:07:40,192
He's on the line.

105
00:07:42,435 --> 00:07:47,247
Sir, why is it so hard to contact you?
It seems like you're avoiding me.

106
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:49,074
Can't you tell from hearing my voice?

107
00:07:49,074 --> 00:07:53,781
I'm in this state because I've been
using my voice to raise my ratings!

108
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:58,072
But I noticed that you often go to
Congressman Ahn's campaign rally.

109
00:07:58,072 --> 00:08:01,055
Sir. Sir!

110
00:08:01,055 --> 00:08:03,286
You can't treat me like this!

111
00:08:03,286 --> 00:08:07,250
You were the one who asked me
to save the Equitable Party!

112
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,744
Excuse me?

113
00:08:11,213 --> 00:08:15,165
Yes! No, that's okay!

114
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:18,653
Should I reschedule?

115
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:23,935
No. Let's go without him.
It's not my election anyway.

116
00:08:26,452 --> 00:08:29,663
- Jo Hee Kyung!
- Jo Hee Kyung!

117
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:31,685
Jo Hee Kyung of the Equitable Party!

118
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:37,333
Yes, hello! I'm on your side!
I'm Jo Hee Kyung!

119
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:43,129
What is this? Why are you being
so noisy in my restaurant? Get out!

120
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:46,110
Oh, you're working so hard.

121
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,837
It's nice to see that you're getting
a lot of business during a recession.

122
00:08:50,837 --> 00:08:55,618
You sure know how
to smooth talk your way out of things.

123
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,293
Yes, I understand.

124
00:08:57,293 --> 00:09:01,854
This is a hard time for all of us!
I will listen to your thoughts!

125
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:05,086
- If you give me a chance--
- Why would I give you a chance?

126
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:08,369
People in politics are all the same.

127
00:09:08,369 --> 00:09:13,640
Even the special investigation committee.
You falsely claimed that a someone died!

128
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,279
You don't take anyone's life seriously
because you have power.

129
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:23,432
Imagine what will happen
if you win the election!

130
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:26,063
- About that--
- I don't care!

131
00:09:26,063 --> 00:09:29,378
You're being noisy. Get out! Get out!

132
00:09:29,378 --> 00:09:33,798
Gosh, after listening to the boss,
I think she should go into politics.

133
00:09:33,798 --> 00:09:38,857
Hey, no thanks! I have better things
to do than to go into politics!

134
00:09:38,857 --> 00:09:40,753
No thank you!

135
00:09:40,753 --> 00:09:44,475
- She's such a good speaker.
- Politics aren't for everyone.

136
00:09:53,138 --> 00:09:56,259
CEO Hwang, for Joon Oh's trial

137
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:59,687
they want you to be a witness.

138
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:03,461
Can you do that, CEO Hwang?

139
00:10:13,057 --> 00:10:15,591
The weather is beautiful today.

140
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:22,368
Be careful!

141
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:27,226
What is it? Are you cold?

142
00:10:29,538 --> 00:10:34,246
What's wrong? CEO Hwang! What's wrong?

143
00:10:34,246 --> 00:10:38,115
CEO Hwang! CEO Hwang!

144
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:51,850
Yes. She resigned today.

145
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,572
Yes.

146
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,913
Turn off your phones.

147
00:10:59,913 --> 00:11:04,197
The article will tell them everything.
There's no need to answer every call.

148
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,567
Yes.

149
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:29,246
Yeah, Prosecutor Lee.
News travels fast. You heard already...

150
00:11:31,169 --> 00:11:33,576
Seo Joon Oh's trial?

151
00:11:34,307 --> 00:11:36,822
He turned himself in?

152
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:38,506
He did.

153
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:42,168
You will be our witness
for the first trial, right?

154
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:50,291
<i>Your words somehow
led us to a decisive trial.</i>

155
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,691
This was your plan

156
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:55,916
so we couldn't possibly
find a better witness.

157
00:11:55,916 --> 00:12:00,277
Wait, Prosecutor Yoon. Right now, I'm--

158
00:12:00,277 --> 00:12:05,274
I'm telling you to clean up your
own mess! Act like an educated woman!

159
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:09,836
I expect you to be there.
I'll get everything prepared.

160
00:12:09,836 --> 00:12:11,311
Wait.

161
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:17,524
That bastard...

162
00:12:18,423 --> 00:12:22,350
He's suddenly making me feel competitive.

163
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,886
Um, Seo Joon Oh turned himself in?

164
00:12:26,886 --> 00:12:28,178
That's what he says.

165
00:12:28,178 --> 00:12:32,684
If he went to the prosecution himself
at a time like this...

166
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:35,496
doesn't that mean he surrendered?

167
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:54,726
<i>You can take care of that for me, right?</i>

168
00:12:54,726 --> 00:12:59,868
<i>Prosecutor Yoon gave Lee Jae Joon
evidence from Hwan Jae Gook's incident.</i>

169
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:05,804
Get rid of him, and get rid
of anything that connects us.

170
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:07,143
You can do that, right?

171
00:13:07,143 --> 00:13:10,025
I'll take care of it
as soon as I get out.

172
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,211
And as for your sentence...

173
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,298
I'll do whatever I can to shorten it.

174
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:20,543
<i>The underling you ordered to kill CEO
Hwang. You told Choi Tae Ho to kill him.</i>

175
00:13:20,543 --> 00:13:23,118
But what do we do?

176
00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:26,668
I saw Choi Tae Ho and that underling
being friendly with each other!

177
00:13:41,537 --> 00:13:45,674
<i>We're doing everything we can
to find Jang Do Pal's underling.</i>

178
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:48,280
If we catch him before the second trial

179
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,793
Jang Do Pal will agree
to change his statement.

180
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:55,394
And by the way, Ra Bong Hee
is very worried about you.

181
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,647
"Seo Joon Oh, cheer up!"

182
00:13:58,647 --> 00:14:02,261
That's what she wanted me to tell you,
but do I really have to do this?

183
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:06,302
I'm thankful. What did she say?

184
00:14:06,302 --> 00:14:08,235
"Seo Joon Oh, cheer up!"

185
00:14:23,116 --> 00:14:27,359
I swear that I will speak the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth

186
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:28,572
according to my own conscience

187
00:14:28,572 --> 00:14:30,222
and if there is any falsehood
in my statement

188
00:14:30,222 --> 00:14:31,673
I shall be punished for perjury.

189
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,797
Prosecutor, please question the witness.

190
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:45,034
During the Legend Entertainment
plane crash

191
00:14:45,034 --> 00:14:51,495
did you spend four months on an island
near Huizhou China with the defendant?

192
00:14:51,495 --> 00:14:52,505
Yes, that's correct.

193
00:14:52,505 --> 00:14:55,914
You said you saw Yoon So Hee
being murdered

194
00:14:55,914 --> 00:14:59,325
by the defendant, is that correct?

195
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:00,984
Yes.

196
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:05,258
Please tell us what you remember
from that incident.

197
00:15:08,535 --> 00:15:10,320
That night...

198
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:14,806
I was worried about So Hee.
She had wandered off by herself

199
00:15:14,806 --> 00:15:17,287
<i>so I was looking for her.</i>

200
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:23,578
<i>But Seo Joon Oh suddenly approached her
from behind and strangled her.</i>

201
00:15:25,202 --> 00:15:29,961
<i>He continued to strangle So Hee,
who was struggling for air</i>

202
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:33,287
<i>without any hesitation,
until the very end.</i>

203
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:48,750
During your rescue...

204
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:54,772
You said he also attempted to kill
other survivors. Is that true?

205
00:15:54,772 --> 00:15:56,955
Yes, that's true.

206
00:15:56,955 --> 00:15:59,158
What was his reason?

207
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,942
It was...

208
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:05,956
We all knew that Seo Joon Oh
killed Yoon So Hee.

209
00:16:05,956 --> 00:16:07,116
Objection!

210
00:16:07,116 --> 00:16:11,616
His claim is subjective
and has no objective validity.

211
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:13,308
Sustained.

212
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:35,486
<i>Lawyer, please question the witness.</i>

213
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:37,038
Yes.

214
00:16:40,263 --> 00:16:45,559
You said you witnessed the defendant
killing Yoon So Hee. Is that true?

215
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:48,193
- Yes, that's correct.
- Are you sure you saw it clearly?

216
00:16:48,193 --> 00:16:50,260
It could have been dark or far away.

217
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,370
- Objection!
- Sustained.

218
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:57,076
I will change my question.

219
00:16:57,076 --> 00:17:00,769
During the incident,
were you able to see very clearly?

220
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:03,447
Did you see, with your own two eyes

221
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:07,583
the defendant kill Yoon So Hee?

222
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,764
Yes.

223
00:17:08,764 --> 00:17:12,219
Then during the incident,
what did the defendant do?

224
00:17:13,077 --> 00:17:14,740
Was it like this?

225
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:19,627
Or like this? Against a wall?

226
00:17:19,627 --> 00:17:22,477
No. I...

227
00:17:22,477 --> 00:17:26,480
I didn't see exactly how he killed her.

228
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,585
You just told us

229
00:17:29,585 --> 00:17:33,967
that you saw it clearly because
it wasn't dark or too far away.

230
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:35,976
But you suddenly don't remember?

231
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:41,714
<i>[Autopsy Report]</i>

232
00:17:42,877 --> 00:17:46,118
Was there a glove on the deserted island?

233
00:17:46,118 --> 00:17:49,789
- Why?
- She suffocated due to strangulation

234
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:52,349
but they found no evidence on the body.

235
00:17:54,936 --> 00:17:57,800
I'm not sure.

236
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:00,623
- I don't remember.
- Figures.

237
00:18:00,623 --> 00:18:03,224
It's not a pleasant memory.

238
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,863
<i>Witness?</i>

239
00:18:07,863 --> 00:18:11,646
Please answer my question.
What did the defendant do?

240
00:18:13,086 --> 00:18:16,672
At the time, I was in a state of shock

241
00:18:16,672 --> 00:18:20,481
so I don't remember
exactly what happened.

242
00:18:20,481 --> 00:18:24,218
It sounds like the defendant killed
Yoon So Hee in a very brutal way.

243
00:18:24,218 --> 00:18:27,767
So you're saying,
you saw him kill Yoon So Hee

244
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:31,838
but you don't remember
how he killed her. Am I correct?

245
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:35,983
I apologize.

246
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:40,509
It was a very distressing time,
so I don't want to remember it.

247
00:18:40,509 --> 00:18:42,398
How unfortunate.

248
00:18:42,398 --> 00:18:46,724
Then while the defendant
was killing Yoon So Hee

249
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:48,182
what were you doing?

250
00:18:48,182 --> 00:18:52,983
I already told you, I was in so much
shock that I couldn't move.

251
00:18:52,983 --> 00:18:55,365
So let me get this straight.

252
00:18:55,365 --> 00:19:00,203
You saw the defendant kill Yoon So Hee
but you didn't see how he killed her.

253
00:19:00,203 --> 00:19:05,571
You don't remember because it was painful
but you couldn't do anything, right?

254
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,153
I will ask you one last question.

255
00:19:10,153 --> 00:19:12,250
Are you sure the attacker was Seo Joon Oh

256
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,345
and Yoon So Hee was the victim?

257
00:19:16,304 --> 00:19:18,625
- Objection!
- Sustained.

258
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:22,942
I'm not the only one, Tae Ho Hang
will confirm what I said.

259
00:19:22,942 --> 00:19:26,086
When we were on that island,
Seo Joon Oh was a crazy murderer.

260
00:19:26,086 --> 00:19:30,088
He told us he'd kill us if we didn't
listen! And we believed it.

261
00:19:30,088 --> 00:19:33,252
You're saying you were scared to die

262
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:36,990
which was why you only watched as
Yoon So Hee died in front of you, right?

263
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,368
- Objection!
- Your Honor, that is all.

264
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:52,842
It'd be great if we can utilize his
presence as a witness to our advantage.

265
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:57,260
- How?
- If he accused you of being the murderer

266
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,734
but said something irrational,
or something like that.

267
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:03,346
If he's insisting he saw something
that he didn't see

268
00:20:03,346 --> 00:20:06,605
it's only a matter of time until
things don't make sense.

269
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:10,142
- "Lies..."
- "Give birth to more lies."

270
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,467
That's what you want
to take advantage of, right?

271
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:45,669
<i>Hwang Jae Gook needs complete rest
due to acute pneumonia.</i>

272
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:10,051
Lawyer, please bring
your witness to the stand.

273
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:12,691
Your Honor, I would like to request
a new witness.

274
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:14,569
This witness wasn't
approved beforehand!

275
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:18,614
He is a very important witness. He was
the first to see Yoon So Hee's body!

276
00:21:18,614 --> 00:21:20,936
We weren't sure if he could make it
due to his condition--

277
00:21:20,936 --> 00:21:26,549
That's also why we cannot have confidence
in his statements!

278
00:21:58,228 --> 00:22:00,371
This is the opinion of his family doctor.

279
00:22:00,371 --> 00:22:04,279
Please confirm that he is capable
of being a witness in a court of law.

280
00:23:11,192 --> 00:23:15,555
Lawyer, are you sure your witness
is well enough to testify?

281
00:23:15,555 --> 00:23:18,873
Your Honor, I apologize.

282
00:23:18,873 --> 00:23:21,712
The doctor confirmed that it was okay.

283
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:28,224
I...

284
00:23:33,983 --> 00:23:38,192
He did nothing wrong.

285
00:23:40,657 --> 00:23:42,527
Seo Joon Oh...

286
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:49,087
is innocent.

287
00:23:50,465 --> 00:23:54,852
Seo Joon Oh tried his best...

288
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:58,484
to save everyone he could
until the very end.

289
00:24:35,313 --> 00:24:37,593
Seo Joon Oh...

290
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:42,007
is innocent.

291
00:25:12,817 --> 00:25:16,327
Prosecutor, is your second witness,
Jo Hee Kyung, absent?

292
00:25:16,327 --> 00:25:17,558
Yes.

293
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:24,166
Since there are no more witnesses,
Case 2017-2916

294
00:25:24,166 --> 00:25:28,494
the first trial of Yoon So Hee's
murder case is dismissed.

295
00:25:44,073 --> 00:25:46,826
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

296
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:05,104
I saw Congresswoman Jo today.
Why did she just leave?

297
00:26:05,104 --> 00:26:06,878
She was here?

298
00:26:06,878 --> 00:26:09,481
Yes, I saw her in the hallway.

299
00:26:09,481 --> 00:26:13,196
Why is everyone surprising me today?

300
00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:17,429
Is it that hard
to put Seo Joon Oh in jail?

301
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:19,531
Is it that detrimental
if we're missing one witness?

302
00:26:19,531 --> 00:26:22,319
You should go and see Jang Do Pal!

303
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,401
- Why would I see him?
- You haven't visited him lately, right?

304
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:31,121
It's possible he could decide
to testify for Seo Joon Oh.

305
00:26:31,121 --> 00:26:33,304
Take my words seriously.

306
00:26:35,453 --> 00:26:40,108
Prosecutor Yoon and Lawyer Jo
are looking for the culprit

307
00:26:40,108 --> 00:26:41,607
so please be patient a little longer.

308
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:44,871
How is CEO Hwang doing?
He overworked himself today.

309
00:26:44,871 --> 00:26:48,015
Secretary Tae called to say
he's all right now.

310
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:51,195
He said CEO Hwang
really wanted to come today.

311
00:26:52,505 --> 00:26:54,747
Don't worry too much.

312
00:26:55,788 --> 00:26:57,298
What about Jang Do Pal?

313
00:26:57,298 --> 00:27:01,669
Prosecutor Yoon and Lawyer Jo
will see Jang Do Pal today too.

314
00:27:02,742 --> 00:27:06,842
We're almost there,
so just hang on, Seo Joon Oh.

315
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:10,518
Okay.

316
00:27:20,782 --> 00:27:22,366
CEO Jang.

317
00:27:25,867 --> 00:27:28,119
It's been a long time, Tae Ho.

318
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:33,143
What do you mean? I was late because I
was waiting to bring you some good news.

319
00:27:33,143 --> 00:27:35,045
Good news?

320
00:27:37,903 --> 00:27:42,576
I... caught him.

321
00:27:42,576 --> 00:27:46,316
- Really?
- He was in hiding.

322
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:49,799
I'll take care of him really soon...

323
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:52,393
so you can relax now.

324
00:27:53,321 --> 00:27:58,646
He has no one to help him.
Where was he hiding?

325
00:28:01,978 --> 00:28:04,096
<i>Take my words seriously.</i>

326
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:08,001
A few days ago, Jang Do Pal
and Seo Joon Oh met.

327
00:28:08,001 --> 00:28:10,603
I think Jang Do Pal heard
something from Seo Joon Oh.

328
00:28:10,603 --> 00:28:13,681
But I don't know what he said.

329
00:28:19,575 --> 00:28:21,315
Well...

330
00:28:21,953 --> 00:28:25,306
I'm sure he understands that it's over
as soon as someone finds him.

331
00:28:25,306 --> 00:28:30,155
Anyway, I found him,
so you don't have to worry.

332
00:28:30,155 --> 00:28:33,305
For your case,
I'll find an expensive lawyer

333
00:28:33,305 --> 00:28:36,013
and prove that you're innocent.

334
00:28:37,478 --> 00:28:40,006
Okay. Thanks.

335
00:28:40,006 --> 00:28:42,301
I have one more good news to tell you.

336
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:46,875
You didn't know that CEO Hwang's
health deteriorated, did you?

337
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:51,542
I feel like it is divine intervention.
He's hanging on by a thread

338
00:28:51,542 --> 00:28:54,976
so there's no way he'll wake up
and expose the truth about you.

339
00:28:55,811 --> 00:28:59,326
So you don't have to worry.

340
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:05,064
Okay.

341
00:29:06,932 --> 00:29:10,154
That's... good news.

342
00:29:28,395 --> 00:29:31,023
<i>Jang Do Pal.</i>

343
00:29:31,023 --> 00:29:36,825
Do you really want to miss
your last chance to live?

344
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:40,770
If you keep your mouth shut
and trust Tae Ho...

345
00:29:41,928 --> 00:29:47,369
In the end, you will both be ruined.

346
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:51,330
I thought you had finally come to
a realization when you agreed to meet me

347
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,450
but I guess you still don't believe me.

348
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,973
That punk who tried to murder
Hwang Jae Gook was following your orders.

349
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,090
Even if we don't find him,
we can lock you up for good.

350
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:06,941
Do you know why?

351
00:30:42,811 --> 00:30:44,711
It seems like...

352
00:30:45,776 --> 00:30:49,946
CEO Jang found out
I kept you alive and hidden.

353
00:30:49,946 --> 00:30:53,060
Because of that, he might testify
for Seo Joon Oh.

354
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,734
What should we do?

355
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:59,000
Should I have killed you
when I had the chance?

356
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,220
What if... I take care of Jang Do Pal?

357
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,012
Let's think of something.

358
00:31:19,772 --> 00:31:23,003
- Is that true?
- Jang Do Pal is going to testify?

359
00:31:23,003 --> 00:31:26,563
How? What got into him?

360
00:31:26,563 --> 00:31:28,792
I guess he's ready to die.

361
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:33,386
Yesterday, CEO Hwang and Jang Do Pal met.

362
00:31:48,885 --> 00:31:51,218
Do Pal.

363
00:31:52,907 --> 00:31:54,473
Do Pal.

364
00:31:56,616 --> 00:31:59,509
I want to rip you into shreds.

365
00:32:02,196 --> 00:32:04,259
But if you testify...

366
00:32:05,685 --> 00:32:07,942
I'll request
favorable arrangements for you.

367
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:15,246
Testify for Joon Oh.

368
00:32:20,587 --> 00:32:23,318
But what is Jang Do Pal going to say?

369
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:25,010
You told us before

370
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:28,843
that it will be hard to free Seo Joon Oh
from Choi Tae Ho's conspiracy charges.

371
00:32:28,843 --> 00:32:31,683
Right after he was rescued,
Choi Tae Ho told Jang Do Pal

372
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,401
that he killed Yoon So Hee.

373
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:38,226
He agreed to testify to that tomorrow.

374
00:32:39,053 --> 00:32:41,771
Wow, Joon Oh is going to be so happy!

375
00:32:41,771 --> 00:32:44,288
Now, all we have to worry about

376
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,805
is getting Jang Do Pal
to the court room safely.

377
00:32:46,805 --> 00:32:52,109
Choi Tae Ho probably knows by now
that Jang Do Pal is going to testify.

378
00:33:01,717 --> 00:33:02,992
Yes, Prosecutor Lee.

379
00:33:02,992 --> 00:33:07,882
Jang Do Pal will testify for Seo Joon Oh
tomorrow. Did you know?

380
00:33:07,882 --> 00:33:10,561
<i>If he testifies tomorrow,
you will lose this battle.</i>

381
00:33:10,561 --> 00:33:13,123
That will inconvenience me as well.

382
00:33:13,123 --> 00:33:16,781
<i>What are you going to do now?
Can you stop this from happening?</i>

383
00:33:19,684 --> 00:33:21,938
I guess he decided to testify in the end.

384
00:33:45,837 --> 00:33:47,707
Seo Joon Oh.

385
00:33:56,601 --> 00:34:01,195
I came because I was worried,
and I missed you.

386
00:34:04,351 --> 00:34:06,294
It's been hard on you, hasn't it?

387
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:09,993
You've done a great job.

388
00:34:11,111 --> 00:34:16,215
We just have to get through...
one more day.

389
00:34:18,012 --> 00:34:20,554
It'll all be over tomorrow.

390
00:34:22,322 --> 00:34:27,806
By tomorrow, we'll clear your charges,
and get you out of here.

391
00:34:31,146 --> 00:34:32,987
Trust me.

392
00:35:24,494 --> 00:35:27,802
- He still hasn't called, has he?
- No.

393
00:35:30,385 --> 00:35:31,936
Bong Hee!

394
00:35:32,994 --> 00:35:36,822
- Lawyer Jo.
- They just left.

395
00:36:03,293 --> 00:36:04,996
What's wrong with them?

396
00:36:58,159 --> 00:36:59,588
So?

397
00:36:59,588 --> 00:37:02,603
There was an accident,
but I don't know the details--

398
00:37:02,603 --> 00:37:05,400
I just need you to find out
Seo Joon Oh's location.

399
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:16,766
Lawyer Jo. Something's not right.

400
00:37:16,766 --> 00:37:20,297
- I think something happened.
- I can't reach Prosecutor Yoon.

401
00:37:20,297 --> 00:37:21,934
Pardon?

402
00:37:21,934 --> 00:37:24,061
I'll look into it.

403
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:15,684
- They'll be here.
- Why aren't they here?

404
00:38:17,476 --> 00:38:20,764
- They're not picking up, right?
- I can't contact the vehicles

405
00:38:20,764 --> 00:38:22,050
and I don't know where they are.

406
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,639
What on earth is going on?

407
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:26,679
What can we do?

408
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:29,679
If Joon Oh and Jang Do Pal aren't here,
we can't have a trial.

409
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:33,293
- This won't do. Let's find them.
- No, you can't.

410
00:38:33,293 --> 00:38:36,483
If we want to find them,
we need to be escorted by the police

411
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:38,789
but I think Lee Jae Joon
is stopping that from happening.

412
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:41,556
It's not easy.

413
00:38:44,561 --> 00:38:47,994
<i>- Yes, Prosecutor Yoon!</i>
- I'm sorry.

414
00:38:48,724 --> 00:38:51,891
What happened? We were worried
because we couldn't contact you.

415
00:38:51,891 --> 00:38:56,452
I should have told you what was going on,
but Choi Tae Ho's guys got to me.

416
00:38:56,452 --> 00:38:58,610
What about Seo Joon Oh?

417
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,255
We haven't found him yet.

418
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:02,896
They couldn't have gone very far.

419
00:39:02,896 --> 00:39:07,215
I'll look for them. I'll call you later!

420
00:39:07,215 --> 00:39:08,639
Yes.

421
00:39:09,782 --> 00:39:13,702
Gosh, how long do we have to wait?
I'm going crazy.

422
00:39:13,702 --> 00:39:17,684
Prosecutor Lee is stopping us from
doing anything, so we have no choice.

423
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:22,882
If we ask someone to find out their
location, I won't feel so frustrated.

424
00:39:22,882 --> 00:39:28,065
I can't stand this. Wow, this is
the power of the prosecution, huh?

425
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:29,717
Oh.

426
00:39:29,717 --> 00:39:33,487
There is one person who can help us.

427
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:12,601
I heard you decided to stand
as Seo Joon Oh's witness.

428
00:40:12,601 --> 00:40:17,695
You didn't think I knew you were doing
other things behind my back, did you?

429
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:21,177
Even if I were doing other things,
or acting like an asshole...

430
00:40:22,492 --> 00:40:25,119
You shouldn't treat me like this.

431
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:30,588
When Jae Hyun died...

432
00:40:32,824 --> 00:40:35,889
I told you I couldn't stand it,
and that I would turn myself in...

433
00:40:37,052 --> 00:40:40,391
but what did you say
after I said that so many times?

434
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:44,302
You told me you'd help me.

435
00:40:45,204 --> 00:40:47,831
You said you'd take responsibility.

436
00:40:55,572 --> 00:40:59,324
But, because of Jae Hyun,
whom I didn't even kill...

437
00:41:02,012 --> 00:41:04,677
Since I was on that deserted island...

438
00:41:04,677 --> 00:41:07,896
I wanted to live like other people...

439
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:12,510
so I lived while killing people.

440
00:41:14,108 --> 00:41:16,887
But now...

441
00:41:16,887 --> 00:41:19,257
you want to stab me in the back?

442
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,239
You can't do that.

443
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,722
If I'm going to die,
you're going to die with me.

444
00:41:40,588 --> 00:41:42,103
Congresswoman Jo.

445
00:41:42,873 --> 00:41:44,751
Bong Hee.

446
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:48,603
Congresswoman Jo lost her voice,
so she can't talk for very long.

447
00:41:48,603 --> 00:41:51,034
I'm not here to hear what she has to say.

448
00:41:51,034 --> 00:41:56,132
I'm here because I need your help.
Please help us.

449
00:41:57,726 --> 00:42:00,610
You know exactly what happened
on that island.

450
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:04,956
- Bong Hee, she is no longer responsible.
- No.

451
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:07,016
She is responsible.

452
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:13,003
She is responsible, as the chairwoman
of the special investigation committee.

453
00:42:13,003 --> 00:42:18,434
But not once did you act the part
in the special investigation committee.

454
00:42:21,023 --> 00:42:23,887
<i>If you had really
listened to us even once...</i>

455
00:42:24,494 --> 00:42:29,018
<i>And supported us,
and stood on our side...</i>

456
00:42:30,753 --> 00:42:33,532
<i>If you had done your job, even once!</i>

457
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,304
<i>Then we wouldn't be where we are today.</i>

458
00:42:40,943 --> 00:42:44,121
So how can you say
you're not responsible for this?

459
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:46,688
- You--
- That's why...

460
00:42:47,858 --> 00:42:50,150
I'm giving you a chance.

461
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,650
I'm giving you once last chance...

462
00:42:57,907 --> 00:43:00,844
to act like the chairwoman
of the special investigation committee.

463
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,597
What do you want to do?

464
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:11,001
Are you going to run away again?

465
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:13,108
Just like you've always done?

466
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:30,612
She knows how to talk.

467
00:43:48,146 --> 00:43:51,722
Yes, how have you been, Director?

468
00:43:53,242 --> 00:43:58,090
Oh, my voice? It's from my election
campaign. I'm embarrassed.

469
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:01,219
Well, I'm calling you because...

470
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:06,132
I have an urgent favor to ask you.

471
00:44:06,132 --> 00:44:07,420
Yes.

472
00:44:24,215 --> 00:44:26,157
I...

473
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:31,170
Because of you...

474
00:44:42,773 --> 00:44:45,179
If it weren't for you...

475
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:47,523
I...

476
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,322
Tae Ho!

477
00:45:04,112 --> 00:45:08,306
No! You can't do this anymore!

478
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:25,382
Just to hide your mistake...

479
00:45:25,382 --> 00:45:28,103
Just to hide that...

480
00:45:30,463 --> 00:45:35,382
Are you planning to run for the rest
of your life while killing people?

481
00:45:36,876 --> 00:45:38,958
You son of a bitch!

482
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:58,255
Does that make you happy,
you son of a bitch?

483
00:46:06,494 --> 00:46:10,409
When I didn't have to worry
about anyone else...

484
00:46:10,409 --> 00:46:14,001
I was comfortable when we landed
on that deserted island!

485
00:46:15,235 --> 00:46:17,969
That was when I was happy!

486
00:46:32,065 --> 00:46:34,074
Let's end this.

487
00:46:40,436 --> 00:46:42,139
Tae Ho.

488
00:46:46,159 --> 00:46:48,168
Let's end this.

489
00:47:03,891 --> 00:47:05,686
You know...

490
00:47:06,954 --> 00:47:10,244
I really want you to be happy.

491
00:47:12,878 --> 00:47:16,431
We can't go back to how we were before.

492
00:47:24,197 --> 00:47:26,603
But because I'm kind...

493
00:47:32,148 --> 00:47:34,969
I will stay by your side.

494
00:47:39,255 --> 00:47:40,885
Tae Ho.

495
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,795
Let's end this.

496
00:47:58,965 --> 00:48:01,402
How did I become this person?

497
00:49:27,304 --> 00:49:30,335
You worked hard, taking
my insults all this time.

498
00:49:30,335 --> 00:49:34,815
Not at all. Please have
a relaxing vacation.

499
00:49:49,724 --> 00:49:52,688
<i>The people who made the wrong choice...</i>

500
00:49:52,688 --> 00:49:56,498
<i>The people who regretted it afterward...</i>

501
00:49:56,498 --> 00:50:01,652
<i>The people who tried to conceal
the truth with a lie, were punished</i>

502
00:50:01,652 --> 00:50:05,623
<i>and everything finally
returned to normal.</i>

503
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:11,090
Please come with me.

504
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:16,876
Let's go.

505
00:50:18,411 --> 00:50:22,081
Let go. Let go!

506
00:51:16,637 --> 00:51:18,782
Let's make it beautiful!

507
00:51:23,036 --> 00:51:25,358
Don't frown like that!

508
00:51:27,806 --> 00:51:32,815
Bong Hee, I have something to tell you,
but I don't know how to say it.

509
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:38,650
- Did I surprise you, Bong Hee?
- These are seagulls!

510
00:51:43,686 --> 00:51:46,514
Smile. Smile.

511
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:49,733
- You look cute!
- Hey!

512
00:51:49,733 --> 00:51:50,994
You can't do that!

513
00:51:50,994 --> 00:51:53,954
Prosecutor, why are you so serious?

514
00:51:53,954 --> 00:51:55,914
Hey, don't touch me!

515
00:51:55,914 --> 00:51:58,108
Tae Ho!

516
00:51:58,885 --> 00:52:03,244
Hey, Secretary Tae! Run after you finish
your work, you crazy child!

517
00:52:03,244 --> 00:52:05,255
- What's your occupation?
- Manager.

518
00:52:05,255 --> 00:52:07,003
Manager, right? Managers--

519
00:52:07,003 --> 00:52:08,876
- Worry about yourself!
- Okay, Ji Ah.

520
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,934
That's why, I want to talk
about Bong Hee--

521
00:52:11,934 --> 00:52:14,494
Is it Bong Hee or me?

522
00:52:14,494 --> 00:52:17,927
You! I choose you! Yes!

523
00:52:17,927 --> 00:52:21,646
Ji Ah, you can't do that! Ji Ah!

524
00:52:21,646 --> 00:52:25,579
Even if we look happy,
we all have some pain inside us.

525
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:30,389
Why do you keep looking at people
like that? Even on the island!

526
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:34,335
How many people did he kill?
It's a secret?

527
00:52:34,335 --> 00:52:38,043
I'm in a good mood,
and you're pretty too.

528
00:52:38,043 --> 00:52:41,974
- Isn't she cute? Isn't she?
- She is!

529
00:52:41,974 --> 00:52:45,045
CEO Hwang!

530
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:50,668
Hey, you punks! Don't touch
my hair! Hey, stop it!

531
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:52,414
- Why do you only get mad at me?
- Hey!

532
00:52:52,414 --> 00:52:55,916
Hey, you punk.

533
00:52:55,916 --> 00:53:01,202
Hey, Secretary Tae! That punk.
Why can't you get your act together?

534
00:53:01,202 --> 00:53:02,612
Huh?

535
00:53:05,771 --> 00:53:07,603
- Byung Joo!
- I'm sorry!

536
00:53:07,603 --> 00:53:09,920
- What's wrong with you?
- I tripped on the tree.

537
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,648
- Put it back up!
- Stop that!

538
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,956
- Please go over there.
- Be careful!

539
00:53:14,956 --> 00:53:16,735
What is it?

540
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,380
What is this?

541
00:53:19,282 --> 00:53:22,864
- Ki Joon, I stepped in something!
- He stepped in poop!

542
00:53:22,864 --> 00:53:24,516
Why is there poop up here?

543
00:53:24,516 --> 00:53:27,835
It's manure, but it fell...

544
00:53:27,835 --> 00:53:29,864
- It's dog crap.
- What? What's wrong?

545
00:53:29,864 --> 00:53:30,965
- Did you fart?
- No!

546
00:53:30,965 --> 00:53:33,364
- Bong Hee, who pooped?
- Oh!

547
00:53:33,364 --> 00:53:36,059
- Joon Oh, it's poop.
- It is?

548
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:38,992
- He stepped in it!
- Hey!

549
00:53:38,992 --> 00:53:41,422
Why would you poop there
when you could go to the bathroom?

550
00:53:41,422 --> 00:53:43,641
- Joon Oh, when did you do that?
- I didn't poop!

551
00:53:43,641 --> 00:53:46,494
How could you step in it? Did you step
on the land mine intentionally?

552
00:53:46,494 --> 00:53:50,090
- Wait, the smell is spreading!
- Geez, I think I stepped in it.

553
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:52,320
Wait, no. It's not poop. It's not poop.

554
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,967
You'd better take care of that!

555
00:53:54,967 --> 00:53:59,565
- Secretary Tae, he's so cute!
- That's all that matters!

556
00:53:59,565 --> 00:54:01,688
We'll get going! Take care of that!

557
00:54:01,688 --> 00:54:05,068
Why do you keep staring like that?

558
00:54:05,068 --> 00:54:06,735
Get out of the way.

559
00:54:06,735 --> 00:54:08,902
- Gosh, this smell.
- Why is there poop?

560
00:54:08,902 --> 00:54:11,684
- I told you not to move your foot!
- Why?

561
00:54:11,684 --> 00:54:14,614
- It smells.
- How could they leave because of this?

562
00:54:14,614 --> 00:54:18,195
Wait! Your foot.
Stand still, Seo Joon Oh.

563
00:54:18,195 --> 00:54:19,619
Stop!

564
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:22,164
- Geez.
- How did you step in poop?

565
00:54:22,164 --> 00:54:23,793
They left? Why aren't you leaving?

566
00:54:23,793 --> 00:54:26,474
How could I leave someone
who stepped in poop?

567
00:54:26,474 --> 00:54:29,710
Geez. Why aren't you wearing
the necklace I got you?

568
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:31,989
I'm keeping it safe at home.

569
00:54:31,989 --> 00:54:34,878
Don't just keep it safe. If you don't
use it, it's worth less than crap.

570
00:54:34,878 --> 00:54:38,708
- Hey. Don't move.
- Hey, but...

571
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:42,043
Isn't it nice to be together again?
It reminds me of the deserted island.

572
00:54:42,043 --> 00:54:45,409
I know. That was nice.

573
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,739
Bong Hee, there's something on your face.

574
00:54:48,739 --> 00:54:49,739
Here?

575
00:54:49,739 --> 00:54:51,574
No, lower.

576
00:54:52,782 --> 00:54:56,311
- Where?
- Next to your lips.

577
00:54:56,311 --> 00:54:57,773
Here.

578
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:01,911
- Wait, no--
- It's not coming off.

579
00:55:01,911 --> 00:55:05,568
- What do we do? What else can we...
- There's another way.

580
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:08,686
And what's that? How do we erase it?

581
00:55:08,686 --> 00:55:10,853
Well...

582
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:13,297
Let's see.

583
00:55:14,052 --> 00:55:17,440
- Why are you closing your eyes?
- I did it for no reason.

584
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,728
- I guess it's bright out.
- It is. I'd better close them again.

585
00:55:25,092 --> 00:55:26,436
What?

586
00:55:28,447 --> 00:55:33,347
Geez! How could you tell me
about that now?

587
00:55:35,728 --> 00:55:37,170
- Gosh, that smell.
- Hey.

588
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:39,967
Joon Oh, what do we do?
I was just told about this interview.

589
00:55:39,967 --> 00:55:41,657
What interview?

590
00:55:41,657 --> 00:55:44,780
Ji Ah had an interview scheduled
for today, but forgot.

591
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:48,108
- Hey, what about my face?
- You should have told me earlier!

592
00:55:48,108 --> 00:55:51,251
We're having an interview
after I stepped in poop while painting?

593
00:55:51,251 --> 00:55:53,967
The smell of poop won't be recorded
for broadcast.

594
00:55:53,967 --> 00:55:55,882
Hello, I'm Seo Joon Oh.

595
00:55:55,882 --> 00:55:57,735
Joon Oh stepped in poop!

596
00:55:57,735 --> 00:55:59,965
I won't be able to star in a movie
for the time being--

597
00:55:59,965 --> 00:56:02,306
Joon Oh stepped on a mine a while ago!

598
00:56:02,306 --> 00:56:05,440
- Byung Joo, take this away!
- Wait. Yes.

599
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,684
You should remove this!

600
00:56:06,684 --> 00:56:11,237
I am happy to greet you
on this broadcast. I will...

601
00:56:11,806 --> 00:56:15,289
- When you commit a crime--
- Hey!

602
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:18,581
It ends up this way.
Please don't commit...

603
00:56:18,581 --> 00:56:19,994
any crimes.

604
00:56:19,994 --> 00:56:21,824
I know. It's okay.

605
00:56:21,824 --> 00:56:25,398
What was it again? Ki Joon,
"Don't hate the crime, hate the person?"

606
00:56:25,398 --> 00:56:26,427
Yeah, that's right.

607
00:56:26,427 --> 00:56:30,121
They say, "Don't hate the crime,
hate the person."

608
00:56:30,121 --> 00:56:31,931
Which camera should I look at?

609
00:56:31,931 --> 00:56:34,347
- Bong Hee, are we on TV?
- Mom, we're on TV!

610
00:56:34,347 --> 00:56:36,737
Hello! One, two, three!

611
00:56:36,737 --> 00:56:37,891
- Hello!
- Hello!

612
00:56:37,891 --> 00:56:40,047
What relationship?

613
00:56:40,047 --> 00:56:43,027
PD, does everyone date after
being stranded on an island?

614
00:56:43,027 --> 00:56:45,547
Well, we just take care of each other.

615
00:56:45,547 --> 00:56:47,505
It's cold. Let's stop.

616
00:56:47,505 --> 00:56:49,688
We dated, but we don't love each other.

617
00:56:49,688 --> 00:56:53,652
Please don't ask about her dating life.
Please ask about her work.

618
00:56:53,652 --> 00:56:58,119
- But I'm not working on anything.
- There are six movies on hold!

619
00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:02,101
I feel bad. I should do better.
I will work a lot harder.

620
00:57:02,101 --> 00:57:05,255
And we still haven't given up on Yeol.

621
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,579
We're still looking everywhere for him.

622
00:57:07,579 --> 00:57:12,840
I learned from CEO Hwang,
to always work for our actors...

623
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,561
I'm a man who's not scared of anything--

624
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:20,152
That scared me! I'm sorry.
That scared me.

625
00:57:20,152 --> 00:57:23,063
After I was dismissed...

626
00:57:23,063 --> 00:57:28,356
I converted to a job
where I mentor high school students.

627
00:57:28,356 --> 00:57:29,811
Please talk faster.

628
00:57:29,811 --> 00:57:35,398
It's not fun. It's a business
relationship. Yes, I'm just learning.

629
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:40,822
You see, this man has great character,
and works really hard.

630
00:57:40,822 --> 00:57:46,418
I'm a pretty good worker myself.
That's because I learned it from him.

631
00:57:46,418 --> 00:57:50,188
At first, I graduated and worked
somewhere else

632
00:57:50,188 --> 00:57:54,059
- and then my aunt called me...
- Your aunt?

633
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:58,463
Oh, Congresswoman Jo is my aunt,
but she...

634
00:57:58,463 --> 00:58:00,387
left for a vacation.

635
00:58:00,387 --> 00:58:03,166
- Byung Joo! Byung Joo!
- Yes?

636
00:58:03,166 --> 00:58:06,181
- Jo Hee Kyung...
- Do you know me?

637
00:58:06,181 --> 00:58:09,362
- The truth is, I like Bong Hee--
- Me?

638
00:58:09,362 --> 00:58:12,003
- Oh.
- Me?

639
00:58:12,726 --> 00:58:14,306
You do?

640
00:58:15,514 --> 00:58:18,994
- Please paint more actively.
- Yes.

641
00:58:18,994 --> 00:58:22,507
Not with your mouth,
but with your actions.

642
00:58:22,507 --> 00:58:24,282
Please show me.

643
00:58:26,842 --> 00:58:28,380
- Stop it!
- Don't tell me to stop!

644
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,847
Ji Ah, what are you trying to express?

645
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:35,239
So this is the style that Ji Ah likes...

646
00:58:37,373 --> 00:58:40,021
Oh! Oh!

647
00:58:41,483 --> 00:58:43,949
That side is a little empty.

648
00:58:43,949 --> 00:58:45,463
What do we do?

649
00:58:45,463 --> 00:58:49,369
- Wow.
- This is amazing.

650
00:58:49,369 --> 00:58:52,047
- Bong Hee.
- Yes?

651
00:58:52,047 --> 00:58:56,811
- We're doomed.
- We are. I'm speechless.

652
00:58:56,811 --> 00:58:58,893
I knew this was going to happen.

653
00:58:58,893 --> 00:59:01,235
I didn't.

654
00:59:01,235 --> 00:59:04,766
- What do we do?
- Should we start over?

655
00:59:04,766 --> 00:59:07,309
- We can do it again!
- Look what you did!

656
00:59:07,309 --> 00:59:12,074
Look, both sides are equal!
Both sides look good together.

657
00:59:12,074 --> 00:59:15,005
- Let's paint over it!
- How?

658
00:59:15,005 --> 00:59:16,695
You can do it.

659
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:21,090
We can do this!

660
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,797
Oh! Someone has to press the button.

661
00:59:24,797 --> 00:59:26,603
- Timer! Three...
- Don't come here.

662
00:59:26,603 --> 00:59:29,775
- Two! One!
- Get ready!

663
00:59:29,775 --> 00:59:31,722
One, two, three!

664
00:59:31,722 --> 00:59:33,443

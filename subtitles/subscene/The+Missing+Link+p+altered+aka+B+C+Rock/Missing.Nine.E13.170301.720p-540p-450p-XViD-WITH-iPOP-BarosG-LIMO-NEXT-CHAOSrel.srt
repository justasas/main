2
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,960
Yes, Manager Jung.

3
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,530
<i>We're in trouble, Bong Hee!
Tae Ho is headed your way!</i>

4
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,410
- Pardon?
<i>- Get Joon Oh out of there!</i>

5
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,020
<i>We must fix it no matter what.</i>

6
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,320
I need to know what information
is on this phone.

7
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,440
I want to know what's on this phone,
that everyone wants so badly.

8
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,360
I need to be the first to know.

9
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,030
I'll put it where you told me to.

10
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:15,110
Then get going.
I'll be right behind you.

11
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,370
Yes.

12
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,830
No way.

13
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,130
You're alive?

14
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:34,520
You can't be alive.

15
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:52,280
I'm not alive, Tae Ho.

16
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,520
That's why I'm at peace.

17
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,760
<i>[Episode 13]</i>

18
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,810
You did a good job, Seo Joon Oh.
You restrained yourself well.

19
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,950
Look where you're going.

20
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,440
Okay.

21
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,550
How did it go?
Did you find the cell phone?

22
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,640
No, it wasn't there.

23
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,520
And since Tae Ho left with nothing,
Congresswoman Jo must have it.

24
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,290
And by the way...

25
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,900
I ran into Tae Ho.

26
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:37,350
That happened
a lot sooner than we expected.

27
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:40,280
It looks like we'll be busier
starting tomorrow.

28
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,680
Joon Oh is alive?

29
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,610
What do you mean?

30
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,080
- He's alive.
- Tell me the details!

31
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,600
Seo Joon Oh is alive.

32
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,810
Is it that easy for you to say

33
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,420
that Seo Joon Oh is alive?

34
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,120
Don't raise your voice at me.

35
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,800
It won't hide the fact that
you've been trying to push me aside.

36
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,240
What do you mean?

37
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,490
That was because...

38
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,700
I heard Ki Joon and Ji Ah were there

39
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:33,110
so I was afraid your presence
would raise suspicions.

40
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,950
Why would I ever push you aside?

41
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:37,670
How can I expect to make movies
by myself?

42
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:43,000
If I wanted to push you aside,
why did I help you?

43
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,340
Ever since I crawled into
that fire pit to save you

44
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,190
- we became a team.
- That's why...

45
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,020
That's why I don't understand.

46
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,060
Tae Ho.

47
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:06,110
You still don't trust me?

48
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,050
Did you find out...
where the cell phone is?

49
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,160
It's unclear.
I'll have to keep looking for it.

50
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:22,610
When you find out where it is,
make sure you let me know.

51
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:27,330
I'll decide if I should trust you or not
by watching your future actions.

52
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,830
Okay?

53
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,900
In the meantime,
I'm going to search for Seo Joon Oh...

54
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,580
so round up the guys.

55
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,050
Okay. Let's do that.

56
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,710
While we're at it, we'll send him to
the prosecution and prove your innocence

57
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:49,550
and we'll get rid of that cell phone

58
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:52,650
so that we won't be dragged around
ever again.

59
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:56,850
We'll be spotlessly clean.

60
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,770
Okay?

61
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,660
The sky is so dark in Seoul.

62
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,120
The night sky on the deserted island
was so bright.

63
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,080
- The stars could have poured down on us.
- Yeah.

64
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,590
Do you remember that?

65
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,020
When things were difficult
on the deserted island

66
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,010
I looked at the stars in the sky...

67
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,170
and was comforted.

68
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,970
I know, right?

69
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:47,530
When we were on that island

70
00:09:47,530 --> 00:09:52,120
I was only thinking about
how to eat and survive.

71
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:59,230
When I think about that... Bong Hee.

72
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,850
I felt more at ease
when we were on that island.

73
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,640
Oh, that's right. I should
give this to you before I forget.

74
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,190
When I was in trouble,
this reminded me of you.

75
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,420
That's why... I bought it.
You can have it.

76
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,150
What is this?

77
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,910
It's pretty valuable,
but you can have it.

78
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:39,350
What is it though? You should tell me so
I can decide if I should take it or not.

79
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:43,760
Hey, I bought it because
it reminded me of you, so just take it.

80
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,140
But, before I--

81
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,400
Hey, seriously!

82
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,560
Forget it then!

83
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,650
- Hey, Seo Joon Oh, why--
- Geez.

84
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,320
Hey, why are you using your strength
again? You agreed not to do that.

85
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,580
I only grabbed you lightly, but...

86
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,190
Here. Take it.

87
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,250
Geez, you're so strong.

88
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,100
Yeah, Mom. Did you sleep well?

89
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,000
Of course I did. How about you?

90
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,010
Yeah, I slept well too. Isn't it hard
traveling up to Seoul so often?

91
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,650
Hey, not at all! It's not hard for me.
The bus takes me everywhere.

92
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:24,070
No, it's hard on you.
I'll go down there from now on.

93
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:31,410
Oh, sure. It's been sunny these days
so I'm busy with work anyway.

94
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:35,740
- Don't forget to eat, okay?
- Go back to sleep. Okay.

95
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,800
What's wrong, Seo Joon Oh? What is it?

96
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,340
Hey! Come here! Hey!

97
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,220
Hey! Hurry... Geez!

98
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,850
- What if they break it?
- We can fix it later. Let's go.

99
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,270
Those guys are looking at us,
aren't they?

100
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,670
Yes, they're making it pretty obvious.

101
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,550
It looks like they're curious
about where Seo Joon Oh is.

102
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:36,530
They're monitoring a prosecutor?
Those punks...

103
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:39,490
They have some nerve.

104
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,140
- Hello!
- Hello!

105
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,500
- Hello!
- Yes!

106
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,370
Jung Ki Joon!

107
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,610
Hello.

108
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,400
Why did it have to be our Ji Ah?

109
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,170
Manager Jung, haven't you looked after
Ji Ah since she was in middle school?

110
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,770
Do you really want to do this with Ji Ah?

111
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:07,000
Why does our Ji Ah have to get mixed up
with you and suffer like this--

112
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,350
Mother, that's not it...

113
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,320
Stay away from our Ji Ah.

114
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,290
Ji Ah is all I have left.

115
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,870
Listen carefully, Manager Jung.

116
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,160
Ji Ah has been the head of our family,
ever since her brother died.

117
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,920
She's a kind daughter who only cares
about her mother and her work.

118
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,240
I thought she was finally about to bloom

119
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,080
so I can't watch her crumble because
of the rumors about your relationship.

120
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,300
If Ji Ah is that precious to you,
stop selling her out.

121
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,720
Don't you feel sorry that she's still
working so hard after barely surviving?

122
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,810
She's a kind daughter?
Who does that benefit?

123
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,040
What's the use of working so hard?

124
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,730
She doesn't even get 10 won of her salary
because she's a kind daughter?

125
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,740
Mother.

126
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,800
If you're sincerely worried about Ji Ah

127
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,320
please stop using her, and let her go.

128
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,800
Because of the money
you mooched off her company

129
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,290
Ji Ah has to work until she's 60.
Do you understand that?

130
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,290
Who are you to tell us what to do?

131
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,310
I spent so much money on her
to make her into who she is

132
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,730
so why can't I take some of it back?

133
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,490
Ji Ah.

134
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,240
- Mom, come here.
- Yeah, okay.

135
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,730
Ji Ah, did you hear
what Manager Jung said to me?

136
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,610
- I did, so stop.
- Okay.

137
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:42,820
Yes, CEO Jang.

138
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,730
Yes.

139
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,030
Joon Oh is back.

140
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,240
Joon Oh?

141
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:01,360
Do you mean our Joon Oh, who died?

142
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,120
Stop the act. I saw Joon Oh last night.

143
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,020
I didn't call you here
to hear your answer.

144
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,370
You'd hate for others to get hurt,
just to save Joon Oh, wouldn't you?

145
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,680
You saw Ji Ah's mother today.

146
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,640
It hasn't been long,
but she came back to take more money.

147
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,540
That woman won't stop
until her daughter dies.

148
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:28,210
That's why you and Ji Ah
had better figure out where you stand.

149
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,780
Do you really think
CEO Hwang was in an accident?

150
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,650
Don't be scared. I won't kill you.

151
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,660
I'm going to kill Ji Ah.

152
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:04,020
Does Ji Ah know why you gave up
being a doctor?

153
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,130
Oh, that's right.
She doesn't have to know.

154
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,860
Since Ji Ah is going to die soon.

155
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,950
I'm only going to kill Ji Ah.

156
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,810
Don't forget your promise

157
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:29,580
to take responsibility for Ji Ah,
if I kept her alive.

158
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,700
I told you multiple times
that I remember.

159
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:40,350
And Joon Oh has feelings too, so if
I went back, would he even accept me?

160
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,250
After what I did to him...

161
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,500
Even if he would accept you,
do you have any interest in going back?

162
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,800
Why are you twisting things like this?

163
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,550
Then can you show it to me?

164
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,070
Show me how you really feel.

165
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,510
Ji Ah!

166
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:23,000
Ki Joon. Later. Let's talk later.

167
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,400
I have an interview to go to.

168
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,310
Oh, you have an interview?

169
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,070
- Get going then.
- Okay.

170
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,370
<i>[Seo Joon Oh]</i>

171
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:07,190
I'm here.

172
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,880
Prosecutor Yoon! Over here! Over here!

173
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,760
Hello!

174
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:30,360
Get up, Seo Joon Oh. We should give them
our chairs. They're our guests. Get up.

175
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,240
Here, please sit here! Please sit.

176
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,250
Yes. Yes. Okay.

177
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,220
How did you find this place?

178
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,530
This was the best place we could find
that was free and had no people around.

179
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,380
Seo Joon Oh can't be seen by anyone,
as you already know.

180
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,370
Thanks to you, I feel like we're camping
during work hours. How nice.

181
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:53,640
I see that Jung Ki Joon isn't here.

182
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,870
We don't have to worry about him
for the time being.

183
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,120
Instead, this is my manager.

184
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,120
He's my small and compact spy.
Please say hello.

185
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,390
I've already met Prosecutor Yoon.
I'm Byung Joo.

186
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,800
- You're working hard.
- Let's begin, Lawyer Jo.

187
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,030
Oh, sure.

188
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:16,430
We compared what you told us,
with the findings from our investigation

189
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,960
and tried to determine
what's on Yoon So Hee's phone.

190
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:26,210
<i>So Hee said she had proof
that Shin Jae Hyun didn't commit suicide</i>

191
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,110
<i>but she kept changing her story.</i>

192
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,680
<i>That's why Journalist Kim
looked into it himself.</i>

193
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,860
<i>I'm sorry. I can't make it.</i>

194
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,640
Hello! Long time no see.

195
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,720
- I'm here to ask about Shin Jae Hyun.
- That case is closed.

196
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,620
<i>But no matter how hard he searched,
other than So Hee's word</i>

197
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,210
<i>there was no other proof
that it wasn't a simple suicide.</i>

198
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,150
- Hello.
- Hello.

199
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:20,560
<i>[Myungsung Report - Kim Ki Hwan]</i>

200
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:31,280
<i>But then an anonymous source
shared decisive photographic evidence.</i>

201
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:42,210
<i>When he had to start at square one,
he probably thought the way we did.</i>

202
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,020
<i>If the culprits disguised
Shin Jae Hyun's death as a suicide</i>

203
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,440
<i>by making it look like he jumped...</i>

204
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,180
<i>Jae Hyun!</i>

205
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,220
Let's talk.

206
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,560
<i>Choi Tae Ho went to see Shin Jae Hyun...</i>

207
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,220
I'm almost there.

208
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:00,140
<i>There was someone else who helped him
with his crime and alibi.</i>

209
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,640
Now that we're all here,
let's hear what he has to say.

210
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,730
<i>At the time, the police said there were
CCTVs at the front and back doors.</i>

211
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:24,600
<i>They reported that both cameras
were broken</i>

212
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,550
<i>but Journalist Kim obtained
CCTV images from the front door camera.</i>

213
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:32,780
<i>I looked into it, and the back door
CCTV was broken</i>

214
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,190
<i>and was left alone for quite some time</i>

215
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,780
<i>but the front door CCTV was only missing</i>

216
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:40,360
<i>the footage from
the time of the accident.</i>

217
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,920
<i>It wasn't broken.</i>

218
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,210
<i>If Jang Do Pal
was Choi Tae Ho's accomplice</i>

219
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,040
<i>he would have used the back door</i>

220
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,960
<i>instead of the crowded front door,
when he was leaving.</i>

221
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,700
<i>And then he bribed the security guard
to erase the front door CCTV footage.</i>

222
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:04,260
The security guard who was bribed,
quit his job right after the incident

223
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,030
and we still haven't been able
to contact him.

224
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,440
- This weekend--
- No. No. No.

225
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:23,350
We're now wondering if Jang Do Pal
pushed Shin Jae Hyun's body.

226
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:26,660
And we're also wondering
what is on that cell phone.

227
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,690
Tae Ho...

228
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,880
was cast by Jang Do Pal.

229
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,230
He couldn't sing, but CEO Jang liked him
because he had star qualities.

230
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:40,850
If it was for Tae Ho, Jang Do Pal
would have run over to help him.

231
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:44,610
Journalist Kim also said Jang Do Pal
threatened So Hee

232
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,640
so we can be certain about that.

233
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,330
And...

234
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,590
I'll talk to you when I get back.

235
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:55,330
What else could it be?
There's only one thing we'd talk about.

236
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,480
- And?
- Pardon?

237
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,720
Never mind. Please eat.

238
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,710
Huh? Joon Oh,
she said she can meet us now.

239
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,600
- Right now?
- Yes.

240
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:19,160
Who are you talking about?

241
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,430
She said she could see us right away,
but what time is it now?

242
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,250
We've only waited for 10 minutes.

243
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:30,170
Let's wait.
She said she'd come so she will.

244
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,330
But Seo Joon Oh,
you've never met Lee Se Mi before?

245
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,910
After Jae Hyun's incident,
I didn't get along with So Hee

246
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,720
so I don't know anyone on her staff.

247
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,180
Anyway, I'll ask the questions,
so just stay like this.

248
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,740
Cover your eyes, cover your mouth,
and just listen, okay?

249
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,330
Fine.

250
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,360
Oh, she's here. I'll be back.

251
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,900
Hello! Hello! I've heard a lot
about you. Isn't it cold? Drink this.

252
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,760
I warmed up this coffee because
it's cold out. It's warm. Have some.

253
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,420
It's okay. Have some. It's delicious.

254
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:10,620
Se Mi, you worked for Ji Ah,
but transferred to So Hee's team, right?

255
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,580
- Was it for a year?
- Yeah, about a year.

256
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,110
Wait.

257
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,800
Did you call me here to talk about
Yoon So Hee, and not Ji Ah?

258
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,340
Wait, where are you going? Have
some coffee. Please talk to us. Don't go.

259
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:32,250
Right. It's okay! It's okay!
Just for a little bit. I'm right here!

260
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,590
I can't hear anything.

261
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:37,680
Se Mi worked as So Hee's stylist
for the longest time.

262
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,900
Other stylists changed their numbers
and can't be contacted.

263
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,610
- It was difficult to find her.
- Gosh, thank you.

264
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:50,200
Why don't you tell her about So Hee?
It's okay. Let it out. Let it all out.

265
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,600
What's the use now?

266
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,840
Well, it's hard working as a stylist.
I know because I tried it briefly.

267
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,870
Some actors can be picky or sensitive.

268
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,870
Was So Hee a sensitive person as well?

269
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:08,260
You know,
she was pretty weird to be honest.

270
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,690
- Hey, where did you put my phone?
- Your phone?

271
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,420
- Yeah, my cell phone.
- Don't you have it?

272
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,530
I gave it to you before my shoot!

273
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:37,220
I told you to take care of it
better than you take care of yourself!

274
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,960
Move.

275
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,160
So Hee! Oh my!

276
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:02,120
<i>At first, I just assumed
she was addicted to her cell phone.</i>

277
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,580
<i>But she was moody and indecisive
all the time.</i>

278
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,810
<i>I was about to go insane
from being around her.</i>

279
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,110
<i>I was tight on money from my student debt</i>

280
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:14,660
<i>so if CEO Jang hadn't given me a bonus,
I would have quit right away.</i>

281
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,830
Don't think doing
what you did to Jae Hyun.

282
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:20,120
I already have my insurance.

283
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,690
If something happens to me,
we're all going to die.

284
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:26,850
<i>And on top of that,
she treated CEO Jang so badly.</i>

285
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:31,770
<i>I was amazed that
CEO Jang took it.</i>

286
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,810
<i>- Hey, no way!</i>
- No, it makes sense.

287
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:40,340
It's more likely that she was threatened.
How could she have threatened CEO Jang?

288
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,120
No.

289
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,650
I thought CEO Jang did everything
because he adored So Hee...

290
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,360
but now that I think about it,
So Hee was controlling CEO Jang.

291
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,840
- What are you doing?
- Wait.

292
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,150
<i>[Standard Contract for Movie Actors
Yoon So Hee]</i>

293
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,700
Now, you're even stabbing
your own family member in the back.

294
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:15,220
Hey, how could you do this? Huh?

295
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,020
Ji Ah, please give it to her
just this once.

296
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,890
The director wants So Hee.
What can we do?

297
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,440
You said he created that character
for me.

298
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,800
First, you sent my stylist to her team
and now she's taking my roles?

299
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,000
So Hee.

300
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,550
What weakness did you find in
CEO Jang that you became such a star?

301
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,150
Are you happy?

302
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:55,830
On the day we got on the plane,
I heard So Hee talking to Jang Do Pal.

303
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,850
- What did she say?
- "Let's talk about it when I get back."

304
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:01,390
But could it have been
about Shin Jae Hyun?

305
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:06,410
But it didn't sound like
she was being pushed around.

306
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,550
If So Hee wanted to threaten Jang Do Pal

307
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:14,420
she needed evidence about Jae Hyun's
death. Did she really have it?

308
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,620
Jang Do Pal and Choi Tae Ho are
going crazy looking for So Hee's phone

309
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,850
so wouldn't that mean her phone
contains evidence?

310
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:22,770
How did So Hee get that evidence?

311
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:26,710
Gosh, when did you become so naive?

312
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,200
- Wait, is your stab wound okay?
- It was up here.

313
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,940
- Joon Oh!
- Yeah?

314
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,440
I don't have to meet Tae Ho today.

315
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,920
He said Ki Joon is with him,
so he doesn't need me.

316
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,480
- What does that mean?
- I'm not sure

317
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,160
but Tae Ho and Ki Joon were together
all day. It's not like they're married...

318
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,990
Why are they together?

319
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,930
I'm sure they have their reasons.

320
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:53,310
- Eat this.
- Yes, I need to eat.

321
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:54,560
Take all of it.

322
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,110
Let me know as soon as you find out
where it is.

323
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:04,120
Remember, I have to see it
before CEO Jang does.

324
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,800
Tae Ho, where are we going?

325
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,700
You'll know when we get there.

326
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,630
Ki Joon.

327
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:26,340
If you keep agonizing over it,
Joon Oh and Ji Ah will both die.

328
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,790
Don't try anything weird.

329
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,480
Okay.

330
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,240
<i>I heard the news yesterday.</i>

331
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,800
I heard Choi Tae Ho went through
Investigator Oh's car.

332
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:49,150
He must have acted without thinking
because he was in a rush. I apologize.

333
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:51,290
Why is everyone acting this way?

334
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:56,100
Are you looking for that cell phone
as well, by any chance?

335
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,870
Congresswoman Jo,
I guess you haven't seen it yet.

336
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:03,310
Why are you smiling like that?

337
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:08,030
It's nothing. It might be better
that you don't find out.

338
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,280
You made the right choice not to check.

339
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:15,510
What's on that cell phone
that made you so anxious?

340
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:19,990
All you have to do is give us
the cell phone.

341
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,710
If you give it to me

342
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:25,740
I'll take care of it myself.

343
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:30,240
Then you won't have to worry,
and you won't be harmed.

344
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,830
However, if this leaks out...

345
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,190
What if it does?

346
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:43,150
I can respectfully tell you that
we will all be in danger.

347
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,730
After how far you've come

348
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:50,520
there's no need to inconvenience
yourself before the election.

349
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:57,030
What could possibly be on that phone,
that would harm me as well?

350
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:01,410
Wouldn't it better
if we end this case completely?

351
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:04,050
If you agree, please give it to me

352
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:06,060
without asking any questions.

353
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:12,240
I promise you
we won't put you in harm's way.

354
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,980
I will think about it.

355
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,650
Remember that it's out for repair.

356
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,230
Yes.

357
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:27,480
Then I'll wait for your call.

358
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,560
Goodbye.

359
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,980
What was that about?

360
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,880
Tell them to fix it quickly.
Now, I'm so curious I might go insane.

361
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,620
I understand.

362
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,820
She said the cell phone is out
for repair. Find out where it is.

363
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,110
Yes.

364
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,570
- This...
- Eat this.

365
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,800
This...

366
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:01,770
This is much better than
any average video call.

367
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,470
And the sound...
What does this look like?

368
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,100
- A speaker.
- Oh, you know!

369
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,020
The sound quality is really great.
Let's try it out.

370
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,090
Isn't it nice?
Doesn't it look like a microphone?

371
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,150
Oh, it does.

372
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,860
- It's unexpected.
- Oh.

373
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,900
It's Investigator Oh.

374
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,090
- Hello?
- Bong Hee.

375
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,870
- Did you call me?
- I have a question for you.

376
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:31,600
You received lost items from the deserted
island not too long ago, didn't you?

377
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,480
There was a cell phone.

378
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,230
It was So Hee's cell phone.

379
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,000
Bong Hee, how do you know that?

380
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,160
Um, where is it?

381
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,030
That's a secret. It's out for repair.

382
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,150
But, is that why you called me?

383
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,640
Why are you interested in it?

384
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,180
Because it was So Hee's cell phone.
I wanted to check something.

385
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,680
Thank you, Investigator Oh.

386
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,730
- Hey, where do they fix cell phones?
- Cell phones?

387
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,500
She hung up without asking how I'm doing.

388
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,270
Fine, I see how it is.

389
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,820
<i>[The cell phone is repaired.
Please pick it up.]</i>

390
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,920
Fine. Fine...

391
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,170
<i>I asked around, and near
Jo Hee Kyung's election headquarters</i>

392
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:34,010
<i>there are three repair shops that are
known to fix broken cell phones.</i>

393
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:38,940
<i>It's probably at one of those shops,
so how about you go there first?</i>

394
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,410
Yes, they just arrived. Please come here.

395
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,690
Let's go inside.

396
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,650
What is this?

397
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,870
Who are those people?
I should know why we're here.

398
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:14,030
We need to catch Seo Joon Oh
and find the cell phone.

399
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:16,820
Why would Joon Oh come here?

400
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:27,010
Tae Ho.
So... So, what can I do?

401
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:30,410
You just have to stay by my side.

402
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:32,270
Okay.

403
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,010
- This is...
- It's number 103 on the third floor.

404
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,100
- Search everywhere, got it?
- Yes.

405
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,260
What are you doing?

406
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:10,630
I was texting Byung Joo.

407
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,410
<i>[If you find out where it is...]</i>

408
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,850
I was asking him to let us know
if he finds out where the cell phone is.

409
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,540
Let's go.

410
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,510
- Sir, where are you going?
- We're here to find the cell phone.

411
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,950
Cell phone? Where?

412
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:56,220
- It's not here either.
- What is this?

413
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,750
- Yes, Prosecutor Yoon.
<i>- Bong Hee.</i>

414
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:04,720
Lawyer Jo found out the location
from the special investigation team.

415
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:10,380
I'll send you the location via text.
Hurry over there. I'm on my way.

416
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,350
Really?

417
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,790
- Look carefully.
- Yes.

418
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,800
- Tae Ho! Tae Ho! Tae Ho!
- Hey, there they are!

419
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,410
They found out where the cell phone is.
It looks like CEO Jang is on his way.

420
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,000
<i>[Ki Joon, CEO Jang is
on his way to get the phone.]</i>

421
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:49,700
Geez, the person who dropped it off
should pick it up.

422
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,290
Oh, this is so bothersome.

423
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,470
Hello, you said the cell phone was ready.

424
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:14,950
I just finished the repair.

425
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,340
- But how did you know?
- You texted me.

426
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,070
I did?

427
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,860
Who are you? Who are you guys?

428
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,290
- Hand it over.
- What?

429
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:37,470
What are you doing?

430
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,950
Get him.

431
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:43,340
These people! Let go! Who are you people?

432
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,490
Hey, who are you?

433
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,080
Let go!

434
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,770
Good work.

435
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:47,390
Ouch, Congresswoman Jo.
We're in trouble. The cell phone...

436
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:51,170
- Look.
- Yes, I see him.

437
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,200
- Let's follow him.
- Yes.

438
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,620
Yes, Prosecutor Yoon.

439
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,240
Bong Hee.

440
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,630
I'm near the center and following
Jang Do Pal's car. Follow me.

441
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:18,460
I have a feeling
he's going to Legend Entertainment.

442
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:37,980
A man by the name of Journalist Kim
was on the island.

443
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,510
But that man...

444
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,580
had CCTV footage of me in Jae Hyun's
apartment on the night he died.

445
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:52,110
The footage that you told me you erased.

446
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:55,420
- What?
- You...

447
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,640
released those photos, didn't you?

448
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,420
What are you saying?
Why would I have done that?

449
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:03,490
I didn't think you had any reason
to do that at the time...

450
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:09,620
but because these things keep happening,
I'm starting to think you did it.

451
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,270
I'm sure that cell phone...

452
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:16,310
will tell me why you did that.

453
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,950
Hey, what are you doing?

454
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:52,750
- This son of a bitch!
- Hey, Choi Tae Ho. Hey, Choi Tae Ho!

455
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,180
What are you doing? Catch him!

456
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:14,110
You dumb bastards.
What are you doing? Follow him!

457
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:17,220
Find that cell phone! Hurry!

458
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,590
- He couldn't have gone far!
- Geez!

459

<i>Yes.</i>

Get out of here.
I'll take care of this.

468
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:16,220
- After I go outside...
- Take a lap around the block in a taxi.

469
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:20,310
You need to arrive when
the others arrive to avoid suspicion.

470
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:27,000
What? Do you want to die with him?

471
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:11,430
All you did was open your mouth
and stress me out.

472
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:14,910
Who knew you would be
so much help to me?

473

- You have to pretend you didn't see me!

496
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:16,150
- I'm sure they know already--
- You still have to pretend.

That's how we can both stay safe.

Listen to Tae Ho for now.

499
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:24,950
You have to refrain from doing anything,

00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,210
Wait a minute!

508
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:18,740
Really?

509
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:21,350
Seo Joon Oh found Choi Tae Ho.

510
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:26,770
- Yeah, I'll go there right away.
- Right away?

511
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:30,710
I should hurry.

512
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:34,440
Geez, it's so late. Okay.

513
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:11,660
- I'm sorry.
- Is that a trending phrase?

514
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:15,230
Why are you always sorry?
What are you going to do?

515
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:19,210
They ganged up on me...

516
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:23,660
- How are you going to find it?
- Are you looking for this?

517
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:45,560
<i>The murderer wasn't Seo Joon Oh,
it was Choi Tae Ho.</i>

518
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:49,920
Jung Ki Joon, do you know
what you're doing right now?

519
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,030
I do.

520
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:54,800
I'm prepared to receive my punishment.

521
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:00,010
I lied, but I think it's time for me
to tell the truth.

522
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:06,110
Yoon So Hee's murderer was Choi Tae Ho,
not Seo Joon Oh.

523
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:09,190
And Ha Ji Ah wanted to tell the truth,
but because of me

524
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:13,310
because I wanted to take Choi Tae Ho's
side, she had no choice but to lie

525
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:16,950
so please take that into consideration.

526
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:31,760
What are you staring at?

527
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,140
How did you get here, Seo Joon Oh?

528
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:40,490
You're asking me what I was thinking
to come back, aren't you?

529
00:56:41,350 --> 00:56:44,370
Is that... how it sounds?

530
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:48,690
Prosecutor Yoon told me to see you first.

531
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:55,100
You haven't heard yet, have you?

532
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:02,530
Please listen.

533
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:10,270
<i>Tae Ho, do you... want to live?</i>

534
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,970
This won't change much.

535
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:20,770
- I got it, you can go home.
- Okay.

536
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:26,510
By the way, why are you doing this now?

537
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:30,300
It's up to you whether or not
you want to be honest

538
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,320
but do you think this will
change anything?

539
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:36,420
It's hard to believe that you're doing
this for your own conscience.

540
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:39,530
It's not like Seo Joon Oh
suddenly showed up.

541
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:52,840
I'm just saying
what I should have said earlier.

542
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:56,170
It's not because Seo Joon Oh's alive.

543
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:04,060
<i>[My So Hee]</i>

544
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:18,810
<i>[My So Hee]</i>

545
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:21,230
<i>He's dead.</i>

546
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:24,110
Choi Tae Ho.

547
00:58:26,130 --> 00:58:28,750
<i>Sa... Save me...</i>

548
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:32,140
<i>- Jae Hyun. Jae Hyun...
- Save me...</i>

549
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:36,370
<i>Let's send you off.
In one shot...</i>

550
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:39,870
Die! Die!

551
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:45,210
<i>[My So Hee]</i>

552
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:10,370
<i>[Incoming Calls
My So Hee]</i>

553
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:11,960
<i>[My So Hee
Today, 10:48 p.m.]</i>

554
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,440
Yoon So Hee.

555
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,500
This is what really happened

556
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:26,000
when Choi Tae Ho and Jang Do Pal
killed Shin Jae Hyun four years ago.

557
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,470
And those two...
disguised it as a suicide.

558
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:36,300
- And Yoon So Hee recorded this?
- Yes.

559
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,940
And I think So Hee was killed
because of this.

560
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:50,220
I could have gone straight
to the prosecution...

561
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:55,850
but there is one reason...
why I came here first.

562
00:59:55,850 --> 01:00:00,820
As the chairwoman of the special
investigation committee of this case

563
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:06,730
please save me, Seo Joon Oh,
the last survivor.

564
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:11,580
Please tell everyone

565
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:16,390
that I am alive, and that I've returned.

566
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,520
And to prove my innocence...

567
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,830
It's not like I did anything wrong

568
01:00:31,830 --> 01:00:34,280
but I'll talk about it
at the press conference.

569
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:29,130
<i>I know it's not the right time
to bring this up...</i>

570
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:31,670
But when the special investigation
committee wrapped things up

571
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:36,720
we received a call from China asking us
to collect a body. Do you remember?

572
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:41,760
They told us about the bodies we missed,
and Journalist Kim's location.

573
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:46,480
Now that Seo Joon Oh has come back

574
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,560
I think...
Seo Joon Oh made that call.

<i>I kept him alive because he couldn't
talk. I have to kill him before he talks.</i>

<i>I don't think I can do this anymore.
I have to turn myself in.</i>

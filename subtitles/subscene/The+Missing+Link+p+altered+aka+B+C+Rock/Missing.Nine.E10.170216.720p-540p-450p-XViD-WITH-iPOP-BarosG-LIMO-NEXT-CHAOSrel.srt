1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,820
Bong Hee! Bong Hee! Bong Hee!

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,050
- It was hard for you, wasn't it?
- Yes.

3
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,930
I'm relieved to see that
you're both okay.

4
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,700
But, I was wondering...

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,950
What about Seo Joon Oh?

6
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,070
I heard you were here for a long time

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,080
did you hear anything about him?

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,750
Bong Hee, don't you remember?

9
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:43,160
When we were leaving the island...

10
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,880
<i>Tae Ho stabbed Joon Oh with a knife.</i>

11
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,830
<i>Right in front of you.</i>

12
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,800
<i>[Episode 10]</i>

13
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,560
It's because you asked to see her.

14
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,680
I guess she was expecting to see Joon Oh.

15
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,200
I know. I wouldn't have said that
if I had known she didn't remember.

16
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,570
You said you are Prosecutor Yoon, right?
So Hee's older brother.

17
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,700
Yes.

18
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,970
Our Bong Hee is a really pure person.

19
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,730
It was her first day on the job,
and her first trip abroad.

20
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:47,700
But I stopped Joon Oh from firing her
that day, and we ended up on that island.

21
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,550
Bong Hee did all the dirty work
while we were on the island.

22
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,570
Oh, do you know how many times
she saved So Hee's life?

23
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,590
It's true. If So Hee were still alive...

24
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,240
She would have been
the most thankful to Bong Hee.

25
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:03,880
I guess she couldn't say that herself.
I didn't know.

26
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,460
I don't know about anyone else,
but I thought you should know.

27
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,160
That way, you can help Bong Hee.

28
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,500
It'll be hard for her to go back
in this state, won't it?

29
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,060
Oh, just a moment.

30
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,670
Yes, ma'am.

31
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,500
Prosecutor Yoon.

32
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,460
Are you in China
with Ra Bong Hee, by any chance?

33
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,830
Yes.

34
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,260
Then, it's true that you're meeting
with the survivors.

35
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,170
I didn't tell you because
this was a personal matter

36
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,350
but I guess you heard.

37
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,190
You're meeting survivors I haven't met.
Didn't you think I would hear about it?

38
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,030
Who are you? Are you
the special investigation committee?

39
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,650
If I were, I wouldn't have met them.

40
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,810
What do you mean?

41
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,090
<i>How severely did you neglect
the safety of the survivors</i>

42
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,270
that they can't trust you, even when you
promise them personal protection?

43
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,510
They're so scared

44
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,750
that they only trust Ra Bong Hee.

45
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,490
That's why I came here with her.

46
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:14,210
Ra Bong Hee, that girl...

47
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,330
She's still under investigation.

48
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,850
The prosecution will ask for her
due to conspiracy suspicions

49
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,010
but you've taken her abroad without
our permission. How dare you?

50
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:27,150
Whether those charges will end
with an acquittal or a sentence...

51
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,660
We'll only know once we look into it.

52
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,970
Weren't you only interested in
finding Yoon So Hee's murderer?

53
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,480
Why are you protecting her?

54
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,690
You were out to get her not too long ago.

55
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:42,750
Back then, I thought Bong Hee was the
bad one, but I realized that's not true.

56
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,590
The bad side can be found somewhere else.

57
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:52,150
The truth is, we came here because
we wanted to hear Seo Joon Oh's story.

58
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,450
Why are you laughing like that?

59
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,530
What? Are you underestimating us?

60
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,470
So, did you see him?

61
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,790
It ended the way you wanted it to.

62
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:07,340
<i>I don't know what you're saying.</i>

63
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,820
What I want is for Ra Bong Hee
to return as soon as possible.

64
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,760
I want her to stay quietly under
my jurisdiction until we are finished.

65
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,210
So don't delude her with lies, just bring
her back while I'm asking nicely, got it?

66
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,160
So, who are the two survivors?

67
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,190
Are you asking me that question?

68
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:31,700
Finding out who they are is your job!

69
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,630
You didn't even know Ra Bong Hee
got away! What the hell are you doing?

70
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,300
- I'm sorry.
- Let's do our work properly.

71
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,100
Let's do the work we're supposed to do!

72
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,210
Don't let anyone get their hands
on our work!

73
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,300
- Yes.
- Regarding the two remaining survivors

74
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,860
do whatever you can to get them here.

75
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,760
Tell them we'll do much more than
personal protection, and get them here!

76
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,620
Yes, I understand.

77
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,340
After we deal with those two survivors,
let's wrap this up.

78
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:06,610
Gosh, I'm getting so sick of this.
I don't think I can do it anymore.

79
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,790
- Hello?
<i>- Is this Prosecutor Yoon Tae Young?</i>

80
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,050
Yes, who is this?

81
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,720
<i>I have evidence regarding
Yoon So Hee's murder.</i>

82
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,770
Geez, how did Ki Joon do this
in 10 seconds?

83
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:48,800
How did he step on all these lines?

84
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,400
- Seo Joon Oh.
- Yeah?

85
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,070
- Let me join.
- Hey, this isn't a place for you.

86
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,190
I have to do this in 10 seconds.

87
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,630
No, I'm not talking about that.

88
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:00,340
- Then what?
- I thought about it carefully.

89
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:03,260
Your family is up in heaven

90
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,550
and you have so many siblings...

91
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,500
So I'll...

92
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,450
I'll be the rock you can lean on.

93
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,000
What?

94
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:21,650
<i>You know, I'll cook a warm meal for you
if you're ever starving.</i>

95
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,210
<i>If you are struggling with
no place to sleep, I'll help you out.</i>

96
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,500
<i>If no one else takes your side,
I'll take your side.</i>

97
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,360
<i>And, if no one else believes you...</i>

98
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,260
<i>I'll believe you no matter what.</i>

99
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,860
Hey, why do you trust me so much?

100
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,190
They say real trust
is when you trust what you can't see.

101
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,840
I want to try it too!

102
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,750
What do you mean? How can you
trust something you can't see?

103
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,630
Anyway, you promised me! Don't change
your mind when we get back to Seoul.

104
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,310
- You want to try it?
- Yes.

105
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,630
You died. You have to step on the lines.

106
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,200
The lines? No, in our neighborhood,
you have to avoid the lines.

107
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,450
No, not here.

108
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:08,110
Do I have to step on the lines like this?

109
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,450
You died. You only have 10 seconds.

110
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,660
- How can I finish in 10 seconds? No way!
- Ki Joon did it.

111
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,790
Seriously?

112
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,750
- You didn't touch the lines!
- I don't have to touch them here.

113
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,840
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

114
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,030
- Didn't I do it?
- That was my rock.

115
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:29,520
- You should use your rock.
- My rock?

116
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,320
- Bong Hee.
- Bong Hee.

117
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,040
No, just lie down.

118
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,220
Why am I lying here like this?

119
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,860
Just lie down, Bong Hee.

120
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,160
Prosecutor Yoon postponed your flight,
so you don't need to rush.

121
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,190
You can't erase your memories
all at once, so take it slow, Bong Hee.

122
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,550
We heard what's going on in Korea.

123
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,780
Tae Ho, that bastard. Making Joon Oh
into a murderer wasn't enough

124
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,460
so he's going around
acting like a national hero.

125
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,540
It must have been very hard for you.
You didn't have any help.

126
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,100
Oh, have you heard anything
about Ho Hang?

127
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,260
Secretary Tae came back to Korea.

128
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,670
Then why aren't there
any articles about it?

129
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,190
He requested personal protection

130
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:25,800
so the special investigation committee
didn't officially announce it.

131
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,180
But he already gave his statement.

132
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,420
Right now...

133
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:36,450
He's probably with Choi Tae Ho.

134
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,760
Wow, I'm going crazy here.
I can't understand it.

135
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,330
He must have been scared
after hearing about CEO Hwang.

136
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,880
Now that Joon Oh's not here,
this is Tae Ho's world.

137
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,260
Wow, Choi Tae Ho,
that tenacious son of a bitch.

138
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,440
That bastard was involved in
CEO Hwang's accident too.

139
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,840
- Calm down. Stop talking about him.
- How can I calm down?

140
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,030
He made you like this, coaxed Ho Hang,
did this to Bong Hee...

141
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,160
And Joon Oh...
This is all because of Choi Tae Ho.

142
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,860
How much longer
do we have to worry about him?

143
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,300
Ji Ah wanted to go back,
but I stopped her.

144
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,570
CEO Hwang's accident
didn't seem like a coincidence.

145
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:19,420
So, what do you plan on doing now?

146
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,530
If it weren't for Ki Joon's injury,
I would have flipped out already.

147
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,270
We should go.

148
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:28,650
Even though Joon Oh's not here, there are
things we need to do, so we should go.

149
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:32,450
We need to help to you, since
you've been dealing with this alone.

150
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,510
So you don't need to worry too much.

151
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:39,440
When we go back,
you won't be alone anymore.

152
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,690
Secretary Tae is also acting like that
because he has no one to lean on.

153
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,240
He'll come around if we go
and persuade him.

154
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,440
We need to go back and clear
the false charges against Joon Oh.

155
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,500
And we need to make Tae Ho
pay for his crimes.

156
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,020
You'll really do that?

157
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,370
Seo Joon Oh...

158
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,350
I don't want him
to wrongfully suffer anymore

159
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,590
because of crimes he didn't commit.

160
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,080
I'm begging you.

161
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,850
Don't worry, Bong Hee.

162
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:17,170
I have somewhere I need to go.
Bong Hee, can you wait here?

163
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,180
What's going on?

164
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,470
Someone called me to say he has
evidence regarding So Hee's murder.

165
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,400
So I need to meet him to see what it is.

166
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,070
- Then I'm coming with you.
- Hey, where are you going?

167
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:34,480
I came all the way here to expose
the truth. I can't just lie here all day.

168
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,270
- Wait...
- Oh, Bong Hee.

169
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:42,660
I'm sorry I can't disclose
the patient's room number

170
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:46,060
or any personal information. (In Chinese)

171
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,840
- What did he say?
- This is a private hospital.

172
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,050
He can't reveal any personal information
about the patients here.

173
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,030
Let's act like nothing happened.
(In Chinese)

174
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:15,090
The guys will take care of everything.
Do you need to stay? You could be seen.

175
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:17,060
I should see it in person.

176
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,650
I'll take care of it.
Please go ahead and go back.

177
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,920
Okay. If that's what you want.

178
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,870
Oh. Tae Ho.

179
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,160
It's almost over. Let's end it well.

180
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,800
I think it would be best
for you to stay here.

181
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,150
We don't even know what the evidence is,
so there's no need for you to go.

182
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,700
- I'll check with Lawyer Jo.
- But Prosecutor Yoon...

183
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,070
I'll be back soon. Go inside.

184
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,120
Move! Move! (In Chinese)

185
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,570
Oh no!

186
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:41,750
You dumbass! We're not here
to kill people today!

187
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,540
Dumbass! Dumbass!

188
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:49,340
Dumbass! Dumbass! Dumbass!

189
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:52,580
Get out of the way. Hurry! Hurry!

190
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:01,460
The mission is to catch
these people alive.

191
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,590
Our main purpose today
is to capture these two guys.

192
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,420
If they don't cooperate,
you can kill them.

193
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,170
Dead or alive.

194
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,790
You idiot! You're a doctor!

195
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,520
What are you doing?
You can't the hospital doors.

196
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,620
You can't lock the doors!

197
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,410
Hey!

198
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,320
Let's move.

199
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,530
Don't move!

200
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,270
What are you doing?
You can't do this here!

201
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,160
Get lost!

202
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,900
Who are you? What's going on?

203
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:42,090
I'll take care of it.
It's nothing. Go on.

204
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,720
Hey! Move aside.

205
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,780
Wait!

206
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,170
Ji Ah! Ki Joon! You're in danger!
You have to get out of here!

207
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,040
- What is it?
- They're looking for you with pictures.

208
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,100
Get out of the hospital
while I buy some time.

209
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,290
- Pictures? Why?
- Wait, what about you?

210
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:18,800
They don't recognize me.
Be careful! Hurry up! Be careful, Ji Ah!

211
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,610
I'm pretty sure this is the location
you were looking for.

212
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,980
Move! Get out of the way! (In Chinese)

213
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,030
Who are these people?

214
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,050
- Who are you?
- Hello.

215
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,100
Thank you!

216
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,320
Stop!

217
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,940
- Stop!
- Crap!

218
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,110
Stop right there!

219
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,880
She's here too?

220
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,290
What is this? Move! (In Chinese)

221
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,890
- Stop right there!
- Over there!

222
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:57,630
Catch them! Catch them! Move!

223
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,050
I found them!

224
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,780
That's me, you son of a bitch!

225
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,590
It's because you're prettier in person.

226
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,130
Get her! (In Chinese)

227
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,780
Bring it on!

228
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,680
Ouch, that hurts. Ouch! That hurts!

229
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,560
That hurt!

230
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,560
Are you all right?

231
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:36,770
Lawyer Jo, hurry and call the hospital.
We'd better get back there.

232
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,740
We lost them.

233
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,070
Ki Joon, what do we do?
Ki Joon, what do we do?

234
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:59,920
Ji Ah, I think this hospital was bribed.

235
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,280
I think it'll be better
if you go and look for help.

236
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,730
What are you saying? What about you?

237
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,310
We'll stand out if we're together,
and I'll slow you down.

238
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,670
I'll hide here, so go--

239
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:11,420
What are you saying?

240
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,390
Didn't you see them?
Do you think they'll let you live?

241
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,210
Stop the bullshit.

242
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,010
Ji Ah. Ji Ah.

243
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,600
Pay attention and listen to me.

244
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,950
That's why
I'm asking you to find help.

245
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,210
You have to find people who can help us
if we want to live.

246
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:30,830
I'm sending you because I want to live.

247
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:35,430
Bong Hee is being chased out there.
If we waste time, we'll all die.

248
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,530
Why are you so scared? We escaped
that desolate, deserted island!

249
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,180
No.

250
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,710
You saved me multiple times

251
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,850
so it's my turn to save you.

252
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,380
Wait.

253
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,760
Come on.

254
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,400
What's going on? (In Chinese)

255
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,590
Stop! Stop!

256
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,870
Okay!

257
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,480
Move!

258
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,620
Ki Joon, let's go!

259
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:06,020
<i>The number you have dialed is--</i>

260
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:10,330
- Prosecutor Yoon, they're not answering.
- Are we almost at the hospital?

261
00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:12,390
We're almost there.

262
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,800
Does it make sense
that we can't contact the hospital?

263
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,140
Do your job! This is your job!

264
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,090
Stop making stupid excuses,
and get over there right now!

265
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:31,860
- Geez, he's so out of it.
- What is it? Is there a problem?

266
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,930
He said the hospital hasn't been
answering for an hour! That's nonsense!

267
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:42,410
I already told him to go there because
he can't check anything over the phone.

268
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,110
<i>How severely did you neglect
the safety of the survivors</i>

269
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:52,030
that they can't trust you,
even when you offer personal protection?

270
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,120
They're so scared

271
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,810
that they only trust Ra Bong Hee.

272
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:03,720
Jang Do Pal and Choi Tae Ho.

273
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,150
Check if those guys
are in China right now.

274
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,890
Yes, I'm on it.

275
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,990
Let's stop, Ra Bong Hee.

276
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:30,410
Do we have a reason to fight,
now that Joon Oh's not around?

277
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:33,620
You son of a bitch.

278
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,920
But Seo Joon Oh...

279
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:40,020
trusted you until the end.

280
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,060
You're not listening to me again.

281
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,130
You know how to punch.

282
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,150
Is it fun to play like this?

283
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,630
Let's stop now, okay?

284
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,060
This is fun.

285
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,900
Prosecutor Yoon!

286
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,660
Prosecutor Yoon, Ji Ah and Manager Jung
are in danger. We have to save them!

287
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,160
Hurry.

288
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:38,640
Wait. What happened here?

289
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,020
Where... Where did they go?

290
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,630
Where did they go?

291
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:49,680
Strange men were looking for
Ji Ah and Manager Jung with photos.

292
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,350
Choi Tae Ho was here too!
Where did they go?

293
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,260
Prosecutor, let's get out of here.

294
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,200
Excuse me.

295
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,920
Lawyer Jo. What's going on?
What are they saying?

296
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,000
They said nothing happened.

297
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,820
They said there was no intrusion,
and no injured patients.

298
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,750
They're playing innocent,
saying they have no idea.

299
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,140
But Manager Jung and Ji Ah
are nowhere to be seen

300
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,800
and people stormed in here,
and I was the one who made this mess.

301
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,990
What happened?

302
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,360
There are no CCTV's
in this hospital either.

303
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,400
The way I see it, the doctor is lying.

304
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,350
I think the hospital was bribed.

305
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,630
Hey! Hey! That's her! (In Chinese)

306
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,870
She's the one who caused such
a scene in our hospital.

307
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,850
Officers, arrest her!

308
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:40,700
They said you caused all of this mess,
and that we should arrest you!

309
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,180
- Arrest her! (In Chinese)
- Arrest her! Arrest her!

310
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,850
Prosecutor Yoon.

311
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:49,200
They wouldn't have paid off the hospital
without planning to kill.

312
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,470
Jang Do Pal and Choi Tae Ho have them
for sure. We have to find them!

313
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,920
<i>Oh, Chairwoman Jo!
To what do I owe this honor?</i>

314
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:05,550
The connection isn't very good.
Are you somewhere far away?

315
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,210
Oh, yes. It's just for business.

316
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,610
Your business...

317
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:15,770
isn't related to our survivors, isn't it?

318
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:19,500
- I don't know what you mean.
<i>- I mean...</i>

319
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:25,090
If you touch a single hair
on their heads, you'll die!

320
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,810
Chairwoman Jo, you're being quite harsh.

321
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:32,150
I think you're deluding yourself.
Just because I listened to you once

322
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,610
do you think we're on the same side?

323
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,140
<i>No way! They're my guests,
and I'm the host!</i>

324
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,430
Do you think I went through all that for
five months just to receive their bodies?

325
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,860
How dare you butt into my work
without any fear?

326
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:48,980
We're taking different paths,
but I thought we had the same goal.

327
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,360
You're talking strangely.
I'm a little hurt.

328
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,280
We don't have the same destination,
just because we crossed paths.

329
00:29:57,050 --> 00:30:00,370
Let's not drag this on,
let's settle this.

330
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:06,930
You'd better escort those kids
back to Korea in good condition.

331
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:11,270
Bring them back safe and sound.

332
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:21,660
CEO Jang, they're here.

333
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,400
Ji Ah!

334
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,270
Manager Jung! It's been a long time.

335
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,840
Wow, Ji Ah lost so much weight.

336
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,090
Hey, what is Manager Jung wearing?
You should have let him change.

337
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,280
Geez, you went through a lot.

338
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,690
First, why don't you sit down?
Sit down. Sit down.

339
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,570
Geez, it must have been hard.

340
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,270
I bet you didn't eat properly. Eat this.

341
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:50,480
Ji Ah, eat. You lost too much weight.
Your complexion isn't good either.

342
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,760
It's okay! Eat. Go on and eat.

- Wait.

346
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:09,200
It's okay. Eat.

Bring her everything she wants.

It was really hard for me too.

350
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,370
While you were away,
everything became a mess at the company.

351
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:48,490
And on top of that, do you know
how much money Ji Ah's mom took

352
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,940
as compensation from our company?

353
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:54,990
If we want to earn that back,
we have to put Ji Ah in a movie

354
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:58,330
or move her around.
We have to do something.

355
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,980

Oh, you ate so much.

00:46:06,650 --> 00:46:10,490
Excluding Ra Bong Hee, whose statement
lacks credibility due to her condition

507
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:14,680
the statements we've gathered so far
are all consistent.

508
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,420
Besides the witnesses' statements,
do you have any other evidence?

509
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:22,950
Can you tell us what your stance is

510
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,860
since you were very involved
in the first half?

511
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:29,400
Under such close quarters
after the plane crash

512
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,200
<i>Seo Joon Oh killed Yoon So Hee,
he had frequent conflicts with her</i>

513
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,000
<i>and on the way back, on the rescue boat</i>

514
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,610
<i>Seo Joon Oh, who threatened other
survivors in order to conceal his crimes</i>

515
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:44,280
suffered an injury...

516
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,470
And we believe that he died.

517
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:52,030
So did you find Seo Joon Oh's body?

518
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:54,820
Through a transparent investigation

519
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:59,490
<i>we hope to uncover the truth about
Yoon So Hee's murder as soon as possible.</i>

520
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:04,060
<i>We concluded that there are no more
substantive truths to be uncovered</i>

521
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:08,810
<i>so we will wrap up our investigation
related to the plane crash</i>

522
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:10,920
<i>and disperse.</i>

523
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:18,080
<i>Regarding the tragic disaster that caused
many heartaches in the last few months</i>

524
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,560
<i>we would like to express our condolences</i>

525
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:26,500
<i>to the victims and their families.</i>

526
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,120
Choi Tae Ho, how do you feel?
Please tell us!

527
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:18,640
Bong Hee, I'm sorry.

528
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:26,800
I think this is our reality.

529
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,710
Geez, I'm in pain...

530
00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:00,970
Geez...

531
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:14,000
- It's morning.
- Ki Joon, I'm glad we didn't drink this.

532
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,380
Hey, don't talk to me. I can't hear you.

533
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:22,700
Hey, I'm telling you.
It's good that we didn't drink these.

534
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,460
That's because you drank and drove.

535
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,990
No. My image would have suffered
if I had drunk these last night.

536
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:33,280
- Hey, seriously. You don't need these.
- Hey, get rid of those.

537
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,980
Let that guy know that Ki Joon
is seriously pissed off! Tell him!

538
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:41,500
Hey, I'm so angry! I wouldn't drink that
if they gave me 100 boxes.

539
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,740
- I bought these at the store.
- Good job.

540
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:46,760
Ki Joon, I bought these at the store.

541
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,630
If we drink these, we can drink alcohol.

542
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:53,770
If you drink these,
you will never get drunk.

543
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:57,540
Hey, what's that smell?
It smells like it rotted.

544
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:04,300
The design and color is the same as the
one you drank last night. You have these.

545
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:07,650
I bought them because
I wanted to sober up.

546
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:11,250
You want to sober up? Geez, seriously.

547
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,680
Stop drinking that.

548
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,830
- You're finished.
- Hey, let go.

549
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:19,050
- Hey, why are you being like that?
- Let me finish this.

550
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:21,660
Hey, why are you drinking?
You drank too much!

551
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:26,670
Geez, let go! I'm going to drink it!
Hey, let go!

552
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,770
When are you going to stop this?

553
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:46,750
Do you think Jae Hyun will
come back to life if you act like this?

554
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:53,000
- I killed him, didn't I?
- Who? Who told you that?

555
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,420
Ki Joon.

556
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,340
I killed him, didn't I?

557
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:04,210
Hey, I know you.
I know you, and you didn't do it.

558
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:07,680
No matter what they say,
it wasn't you, okay?

559
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:12,130
If anyone talks shit about you,
I'll deal with it for you!

560
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:15,750
Hey.

561
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:21,780
You're Seo Joon Oh,
the frontman of Dreamers.

562
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,850
This won't bring you down, right?

563
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:28,650
It doesn't matter what other people say.

564
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:30,890
I believe in you.

565
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,830
Let's drink again sometime.

566
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:19,180
Who is it?

567
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:22,110
Hello!

568
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:27,060
Bong Hee! You have a visitor!
It's someone famous!

569
00:52:56,420 --> 00:53:01,230
This place...
reminds me of that deserted island.

570
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:06,070
Your life here isn't so different
from our life on that island.

571
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:08,450
How did you find me here?

572
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:12,640
- Get lost.
- Back then...

573
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,080
It was really hard for us.

574
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:21,230
But I realized that it wasn't all bad.

575
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:24,280
I realized many things
from that experience.

576
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:29,720
When I think about those times,
there's nothing I can't endure.

577
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:35,990
- Nothing is difficult here.
- Stop the bullshit and get lost.

578
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:40,050
Ra Bong Hee. The same goes for you.

579
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:43,150
Killing you will take no effort.

580
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:46,520
I'm going to escape again anyway.

581
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,600
I'll do the same thing
I did to Seo Joon Oh.

582
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:53,830
So, just live the way you live now.

583
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,580
In that state where
you don't know anything

584
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:59,270
and you don't know
how to do anything...

585
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,300
Live just like that.

586
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,080
Mom.

587
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,910
Let's forget everything, Bong Hee.

588
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:06,390
You did everything you could.

589
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:09,630
Let's forget everything...

590
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:14,550
and live like nothing happened,
just like before.

591
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:17,250
Let's pretend nothing happened.

592
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,760
<i>Yes, Prosecutor Yoon.</i>

593
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:46,550
There's something I have to give you.

594
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:50,470
I think I should return it to you now.

595
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:53,500
<i>Sure. Travel safely.</i>

596
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:37,750
Hello?

597
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:52,450
<i>Hello? Please speak.</i>

598
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,930
Who is this?

599
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,010
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Yoon.

600
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:30,920
What do you mean?

601
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:37,360
I have to leave.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

602
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:43,230
<i>I know you'll think I'm crazy,
but I need to go.</i>

603
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:49,850
<i>For the very last time,
I want to believe that he's alive.</i>

604
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,900
I got a call.

605
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:07,800
<i>Bong Hee. It's me, Joon Oh.</i>

606
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,620
<i>Seo Joon Oh.</i>

607
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:16,080
<i>His voice...</i>

608
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:20,900
<i>His voice...</i>

609
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:26,420
It sounded like Seo Joon Oh.

610
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,850
Seo Joon Oh.

611
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,430
Who are you? (In Chinese)

612
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:03,130
Seo Joon Oh.

613
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,870
Who... are you?

614
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:19,190
Do you know me?

615
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:33,590
Got you! I've always
wanted to try that on someone!

616
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:37,130
Seo Joon Oh, you scared me!

617
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:54,160
Bong Hee. Let's go back to Seoul.

618
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:09,240

In this context, it's being used to mean its original meaning -- which isn't swearing -- but younger kids might not be aware of this.  I don't see a conflict with this card's name and our "no swearing" policy, but if it seems like a possible point of concern to the people in charge of the names at Bushiroad, it might be worth mentioning.}

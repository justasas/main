00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,390
<i>Even if you think I'm crazy,
I have no choice.</i>

3
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,510
There's only one way.

4
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,560
I'll turn myself in.

5
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:39,070
Wow, Seo Joon Oh.
It's so hard to see your face.

6
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:47,140
Since you came here yourself,
let's create a masterpiece together.

7
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,160
<i>You still should have stopped him!</i>

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,140
You were the one who didn't want
the prosecution to be involved.

9
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,410
But you just let him go?

10
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,590
If he went there without a plan,
it'll be over for him. What do we do?

11
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,270
<i>It can only be Choi Tae Ho,
who left under an agreement.</i>

12
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,120
He agreed to take care of it instead.

13
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:28,170
So that means
I need to split those two up?

14
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,330
It's your job to win Jang Do Pal
over to our side, Seo Joon Oh.

15
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,370
Geez, what is that on your head?

16
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:47,010
- You look good.
- Why did you want to see me?

17
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,230
Do you think it'll be okay
if we leave them alone like this?

18
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,430
Turn up the volume!

19
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,360
<i>Have you been well?</i>

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,640
I feel at ease because
I have nothing to worry about.

21
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,930
It's more like you're generous.
You're even in jail for Tae Ho.

22
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,930
If... you're trying to
get something out of me--

23
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,480
What about Tae Ho?

24
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,490
Does he come to visit you?

25
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,850
Do you even know
what Tae Ho is doing out there?

26
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,400
- Do I have to know that?
- Of course you should.

27
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,740
You should be curious if you confessed
to a crime in return for a favor.

28
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,360
But do you think Tae Ho
will do you that favor?

29
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,370
Even if you're willing
to get your hands dirty for Tae Ho

30
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:51,390
Tae Ho would never do that for you.

31
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,010
It seems like he already
forgot about your favor.

32
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,570
I'm not sure what you're saying.

33
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,050
I never asked for a favor--

34
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,110
CEO Hwang...

35
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,030
can speak now.

36
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,340
So? What do you want me to do about it?

37
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,570
I don't know why I'm listening to this.

38
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,340
Hey, what is he doing?

39
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,030
- Do you trust Choi Tae Ho that much?
- Let go!

40
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,680
- Go! Go! Hurry!
- Yes!

41
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,400
- What is this bastard doing?
- Hey, open the door!

42
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,410
Open up!

43
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,410
<i>Open the door!</i>

44
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,220
Don't move!

45
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,710
Don't move!

46
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,390
Take him away.

47
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,130
Seo Joon Oh, are you crazy?
What the hell were you doing?

48
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,130
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

49
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:57,730
You son of a bitch!
Are you playing with me?

50
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,820
No, I'm not.

51
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,020
<i>- Do you trust Choi Tae Ho that much?</i>
- Let go!

52
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,150
The underling you ordered to kill
CEO Hwang. You told Tae Ho to kill him.

53
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,550
But what do we do?

54
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:24,400
I saw Choi Tae Ho
and that underling being friendly.

55
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,440
You were tricked.

56
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,010
<i>It's him.</i>

57
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,380
This is the guy who tried to
inject poison into CEO Hwang.

58
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:38,070
<i>That's right, Joon Oh. I saw that guy.</i>

59
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,070
You once showed me a composite
of a guy and asked me if I knew him.

60
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,940
You said he caused CEO Hwang's accident
and that we needed to find him.

61
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:51,680
<i>That guy got out of Tae Ho's van
and even bowed to him.</i>

62
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,740
<i>He acted as if he was Tae Ho's underling.</i>

63
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,940
<i>- What is this bastard doing?
- Hey, open up!</i>

64
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,350
<i>Open the door! Open up!</i>

65
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:09,090
Don't move!

66
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,670
Turn myself in?

67
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,100
When did I say that?

68
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,850
You said you'd confess
if I let you see Jang Do Pal.

69
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,830
When did I say that?
I told you I'd confess?

70
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,880
Geez, seriously.

71
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,220
You're seriously crossing the line.

72
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,090
If you're going to act like this,
I want a trial!

73
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,140
You said you can lock me up
even if I don't confess! I'm leaving.

74
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,680
Hey, seriously! Damn it!

75
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,400
Hey! Get this bastard out of here!
Get him out of here!

76
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,960
I... I won't forgive you for this.

77
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,140
- Bong Hee!
- Hello.

78
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,840
You're here?

79
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,080
I heard Joon Oh turned himself in.

80
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,310
He didn't turn himself in...

81
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,170
He went in... instead of me.

82
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,100
The good news is...

83
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,520
we will get a trial,
regardless of Seo Joon Oh's confession.

84
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,000
Your statements all been neutralized,
so we needed a new angle.

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,900
This might be for the best.

86
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,550
Why are we hopeful about this trial?

87
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:38,230
Do you have something planned?

88
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,340
First, we have a reliable lawyer
on our side.

89
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,550
- You're a lawyer?
- Yes.

90
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:49,590
When did you become a lawyer?
Did you do it for Joon Oh?

91
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,090
No, it's not like that.
I've been preparing for a long time.

92
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,850
But I slowed down because of Seo Joon Oh
and then sped up thanks to him.

93
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,630
- Pardon?
- I'll tell you later.

94
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,640
- What does that mean?
- Anyway, congratulations.

95
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,920
Thank you.

96
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,220
Then, shall we plan for our trial?

97
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,470
I want to ask Hwang Jae Gook to be
our first witness, what do you think?

98
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,420
May I say something?

99
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,280
CEO Hwang hasn't fully recovered yet,
so will he be okay?

100
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,730
He's right.
He can't even speak properly yet.

101
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,280
But we should still give it a shot.

102
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,530
I'll ask CEO Hwang about it.

103
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,700
Yes. Yes. I understand.

104
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,440
He's on the line.

105
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,490
Sir, why is it so hard to contact you?
It seems like you're avoiding me.

106
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,320
Can't you tell from hearing my voice?

107
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:53,030
I'm in this state because I've been
using my voice to raise my ratings!

108
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:57,320
But I noticed that you often go to
Congressman Ahn's campaign rally.

109
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,300
Sir. Sir!

110
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,530
You can't treat me like this!

111
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:06,500
You were the one who asked me
to save the Equitable Party!

112
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,990
Excuse me?

113
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,410
Yes! No, that's okay!

114
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,900
Should I reschedule?

115
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,180
No. Let's go without him.
It's not my election anyway.

116
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,910
- Jo Hee Kyung!
- Jo Hee Kyung!

117
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:30,930
Jo Hee Kyung of the Equitable Party!

118
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:36,580
Yes, hello! I'm on your side!
I'm Jo Hee Kyung!

119
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:42,370
What is this? Why are you being
so noisy in my restaurant? Get out!

120
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:45,360
Oh, you're working so hard.

121
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,080
It's nice to see that you're getting
a lot of business during a recession.

122
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,860
You sure know how
to smooth talk your way out of things.

123
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,540
Yes, I understand.

124
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,100
This is a hard time for all of us!
I will listen to your thoughts!

125
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,330
- If you give me a chance--
- Why would I give you a chance?

126
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,610
People in politics are all the same.

127
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,890
Even the special investigation committee.
You falsely claimed that a someone died!

128
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:15,520
You don't take anyone's life seriously
because you have power.

129
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:22,680
Imagine what will happen
if you win the election!

130
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,310
- About that--
- I don't care!

131
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,620
You're being noisy. Get out! Get out!

132
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,040
Gosh, after listening to the boss,
I think she should go into politics.

133
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,100
Hey, no thanks! I have better things
to do than to go into politics!

134
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,000
No thank you!

135
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,720
- She's such a good speaker.
- Politics aren't for everyone.

136
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,500
CEO Hwang, for Joon Oh's trial

137
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,930
they want you to be a witness.

138
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,710
Can you do that, CEO Hwang?

139
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,840
The weather is beautiful today.

140
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,610
Be careful!

141
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,470
What is it? Are you cold?

142
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,490
What's wrong? CEO Hwang! What's wrong?

143
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:37,360
CEO Hwang! CEO Hwang!

144
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,100
Yes. She resigned today.

145
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,820
Yes.

146
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,160
Turn off your phones.

147
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,440
The article will tell them everything.
There's no need to answer every call.

148
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,810
Yes.

149
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,490
Yeah, Prosecutor Lee.
News travels fast. You heard already...

150
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,820
Seo Joon Oh's trial?

151
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,070
He turned himself in?

152
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,750
He did.

153
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,410
You will be our witness
for the first trial, right?

154
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:49,540
<i>Your words somehow
led us to a decisive trial.</i>

155
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,940
This was your plan

156
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,160
so we couldn't possibly
find a better witness.

157
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,520
Wait, Prosecutor Yoon. Right now, I'm--

158
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:04,520
I'm telling you to clean up your
own mess! Act like an educated woman!

159
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,080
I expect you to be there.
I'll get everything prepared.

160
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,560
Wait.

161
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,770
That bastard...

162
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:21,600
He's suddenly making me feel competitive.

163
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,130
Um, Seo Joon Oh turned himself in?

164
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,420
That's what he says.

165
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,930
If he went to the prosecution himself
at a time like this...

166
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,740
doesn't that mean he surrendered?

167
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,970
<i>You can take care of that for me, right?</i>

168
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:59,110
<i>Prosecutor Yoon gave Lee Jae Joon
evidence from Hwan Jae Gook's incident.</i>

169
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:05,050
Get rid of him, and get rid
of anything that connects us.

170
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,390
You can do that, right?

171
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,270
I'll take care of it
as soon as I get out.

172
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,460
And as for your sentence...

173
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,540
I'll do whatever I can to shorten it.

174
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,790
<i>The underling you ordered to kill CEO
Hwang. You told Choi Tae Ho to kill him.</i>

175
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:22,360
But what do we do?

176
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,910
I saw Choi Tae Ho and that underling
being friendly with each other!

177
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,920
<i>We're doing everything we can
to find Jang Do Pal's underling.</i>

178
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,530
If we catch him before the second trial

179
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:51,040
Jang Do Pal will agree
to change his statement.

180
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,640
And by the way, Ra Bong Hee
is very worried about you.

181
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:57,890
"Seo Joon Oh, cheer up!"

182
00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:01,510
That's what she wanted me to tell you,
but do I really have to do this?

183
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,550
I'm thankful. What did she say?

184
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,480
"Seo Joon Oh, cheer up!"

185
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,600
I swear that I will speak the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth

186
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,820
according to my own conscience

187
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,470
and if there is any falsehood
in my statement

188
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,920
I shall be punished for perjury.

189
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,040
Prosecutor, please question the witness.

190
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:44,280
During the Legend Entertainment
plane crash

191
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:50,740
did you spend four months on an island
near Huizhou China with the defendant?

192
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,750
Yes, that's correct.

193
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,160
You said you saw Yoon So Hee
being murdered

194
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,570
by the defendant, is that correct?

195
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,230
Yes.

196
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,500
Please tell us what you remember
from that incident.

197
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,570
That night...

198
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,050
I was worried about So Hee.
She had wandered off by herself

199
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,530
<i>so I was looking for her.</i>

200
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,820
<i>But Seo Joon Oh suddenly approached her
from behind and strangled her.</i>

201
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:29,210
<i>He continued to strangle So Hee,
who was struggling for air</i>

202
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:32,530
<i>without any hesitation,
until the very end.</i>

203
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,000
During your rescue...

204
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,020
You said he also attempted to kill
other survivors. Is that true?

205
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,200
Yes, that's true.

206
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,400
What was his reason?

207
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,190
It was...

208
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,200
We all knew that Seo Joon Oh
killed Yoon So Hee.

209
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,360
Objection!

210
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:10,860
His claim is subjective
and has no objective validity.

211
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,550
Sustained.

212
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,730
<i>Lawyer, please question the witness.</i>

213
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,280
Yes.

214
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:44,800
You said you witnessed the defendant
killing Yoon So Hee. Is that true?

215
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,440
- Yes, that's correct.
- Are you sure you saw it clearly?

216
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,510
It could have been dark or far away.

217
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,620
- Objection!
- Sustained.

218
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:56,320
I will change my question.

219
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,010
During the incident,
were you able to see very clearly?

220
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:02,690
Did you see, with your own two eyes

221
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:06,830
the defendant kill Yoon So Hee?

222
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:08,010
Yes.

223
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:11,460
Then during the incident,
what did the defendant do?

224
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,990
Was it like this?

225
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,870
Or like this? Against a wall?

226
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:21,720
No. I...

227
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,730
I didn't see exactly how he killed her.

228
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,830
You just told us

229
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,210
that you saw it clearly because
it wasn't dark or too far away.

230
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,220
But you suddenly don't remember?

231
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,960
<i>[Autopsy Report]</i>

232
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,360
Was there a glove on the deserted island?

233
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,030
- Why?
- She suffocated due to strangulation

234
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,590
but they found no evidence on the body.

235
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:57,050
I'm not sure.

236
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,870
- I don't remember.
- Figures.

237
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,470
It's not a pleasant memory.

238
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,110
<i>Witness?</i>

239
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:10,890
Please answer my question.
What did the defendant do?

240
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:15,920
At the time, I was in a state of shock

241
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,730
so I don't remember
exactly what happened.

242
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,460
It sounds like the defendant killed
Yoon So Hee in a very brutal way.

243
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,010
So you're saying,
you saw him kill Yoon So Hee

244
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,080
but you don't remember
how he killed her. Am I correct?

245
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,230
I apologize.

246
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,750
It was a very distressing time,
so I don't want to remember it.

247
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,640
How unfortunate.

248
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,970
Then while the defendant
was killing Yoon So Hee

249
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,430
what were you doing?

250
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:52,230
I already told you, I was in so much
shock that I couldn't move.

251
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,610
So let me get this straight.

252
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:59,450
You saw the defendant kill Yoon So Hee
but you didn't see how he killed her.

253
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:04,820
You don't remember because it was painful
but you couldn't do anything, right?

254
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,400
I will ask you one last question.

255
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,500
Are you sure the attacker was Seo Joon Oh

256
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,590
and Yoon So Hee was the victim?

257
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,870
- Objection!
- Sustained.

258
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:22,190
I'm not the only one, Tae Ho Hang
will confirm what I said.

259
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:25,330
When we were on that island,
Seo Joon Oh was a crazy murderer.

260
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,330
He told us he'd kill us if we didn't
listen! And we believed it.

261
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,500
You're saying you were scared to die

262
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,240
which was why you only watched as
Yoon So Hee died in front of you, right?

263
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,610
- Objection!
- Your Honor, that is all.

264
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,090
It'd be great if we can utilize his
presence as a witness to our advantage.

265
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:56,510
- How?
- If he accused you of being the murderer

266
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,980
but said something irrational,
or something like that.

267
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,590
If he's insisting he saw something
that he didn't see

268
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,850
it's only a matter of time until
things don't make sense.

269
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,390
- "Lies..."
- "Give birth to more lies."

270
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,710
That's what you want
to take advantage of, right?

271
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,910
<i>Hwang Jae Gook needs complete rest
due to acute pneumonia.</i>

272
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,300
Lawyer, please bring
your witness to the stand.

273
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,940
Your Honor, I would like to request
a new witness.

274
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,810
This witness wasn't
approved beforehand!

275
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,860
He is a very important witness. He was
the first to see Yoon So Hee's body!

276
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,180
We weren't sure if he could make it
due to his condition--

277
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:25,790
That's also why we cannot have confidence
in his statements!

278
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,620
This is the opinion of his family doctor.

279
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,520
Please confirm that he is capable
of being a witness in a court of law.

280
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,800
Lawyer, are you sure your witness
is well enough to testify?

281
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,120
Your Honor, I apologize.

282
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,960
The doctor confirmed that it was okay.

283
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,470
I...

284
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,440
He did nothing wrong.

285
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,770
Seo Joon Oh...

286
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,330
is innocent.

287
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:54,100
Seo Joon Oh tried his best...

288
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,730
to save everyone he could
until the very end.

289
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,840
Seo Joon Oh...

290
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,250
is innocent.

291
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,570
Prosecutor, is your second witness,
Jo Hee Kyung, absent?

292
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:16,800
Yes.

293
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:23,410
Since there are no more witnesses,
Case 2017-2916

294
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:27,740
the first trial of Yoon So Hee's
murder case is dismissed.

295
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:46,070
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

296
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:04,350
I saw Congresswoman Jo today.
Why did she just leave?

297
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,120
She was here?

298
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,730
Yes, I saw her in the hallway.

299
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,440
Why is everyone surprising me today?

300
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:16,670
Is it that hard
to put Seo Joon Oh in jail?

301
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,780
Is it that detrimental
if we're missing one witness?

302
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,560
You should go and see Jang Do Pal!

303
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,650
- Why would I see him?
- You haven't visited him lately, right?

304
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:30,370
It's possible he could decide
to testify for Seo Joon Oh.

305
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,550
Take my words seriously.

306
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:39,350
Prosecutor Yoon and Lawyer Jo
are looking for the culprit

307
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,850
so please be patient a little longer.

308
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:44,120
How is CEO Hwang doing?
He overworked himself today.

309
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,260
Secretary Tae called to say
he's all right now.

310
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,440
He said CEO Hwang
really wanted to come today.

311
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,990
Don't worry too much.

312
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,540
What about Jang Do Pal?

313
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,910
Prosecutor Yoon and Lawyer Jo
will see Jang Do Pal today too.

314
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,090
We're almost there,
so just hang on, Seo Joon Oh.

315
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,760
Okay.

316
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,610
CEO Jang.

317
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,360
It's been a long time, Tae Ho.

318
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,390
What do you mean? I was late because I
was waiting to bring you some good news.

319
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,290
Good news?

320
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:41,820
I... caught him.

321
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,560
- Really?
- He was in hiding.

322
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,040
I'll take care of him really soon...

323
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,640
so you can relax now.

324
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:57,890
He has no one to help him.
Where was he hiding?

325
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,340
<i>Take my words seriously.</i>

326
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,250
A few days ago, Jang Do Pal
and Seo Joon Oh met.

327
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,850
I think Jang Do Pal heard
something from Seo Joon Oh.

328
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,930
But I don't know what he said.

329
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,560
Well...

330
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,550
I'm sure he understands that it's over
as soon as someone finds him.

331
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:29,400
Anyway, I found him,
so you don't have to worry.

332
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,550
For your case,
I'll find an expensive lawyer

333
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:35,260
and prove that you're innocent.

334
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,250
Okay. Thanks.

335
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,550
I have one more good news to tell you.

336
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:46,120
You didn't know that CEO Hwang's
health deteriorated, did you?

337
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,790
I feel like it is divine intervention.
He's hanging on by a thread

338
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:54,220
so there's no way he'll wake up
and expose the truth about you.

339
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,570
So you don't have to worry.

340
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,310
Okay.

341
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,400
That's... good news.

342
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,270
<i>Jang Do Pal.</i>

343
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:36,070
Do you really want to miss
your last chance to live?

344
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:40,020
If you keep your mouth shut
and trust Tae Ho...

345
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:46,610
In the end, you will both be ruined.

346
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:50,580
I thought you had finally come to
a realization when you agreed to meet me

347
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,700
but I guess you still don't believe me.

348
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,220
That punk who tried to murder
Hwang Jae Gook was following your orders.

349
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:04,340
Even if we don't find him,
we can lock you up for good.

350
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,190
Do you know why?

351
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,960
It seems like...

352
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,190
CEO Jang found out
I kept you alive and hidden.

353
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,310
Because of that, he might testify
for Seo Joon Oh.

354
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,980
What should we do?

355
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,250
Should I have killed you
when I had the chance?

356
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:03,470
What if... I take care of Jang Do Pal?

357
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,260
Let's think of something.

358
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,250
- Is that true?
- Jang Do Pal is going to testify?

359
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:25,810
How? What got into him?

360
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:28,040
I guess he's ready to die.

361
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,630
Yesterday, CEO Hwang and Jang Do Pal met.

362
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:50,460
Do Pal.

363
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,720
Do Pal.

364
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,750
I want to rip you into shreds.

365
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,500
But if you testify...

366
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,190
I'll request
favorable arrangements for you.

367
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,490
Testify for Joon Oh.

368
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,560
But what is Jang Do Pal going to say?

369
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,260
You told us before

370
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:28,090
that it will be hard to free Seo Joon Oh
from Choi Tae Ho's conspiracy charges.

371
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,930
Right after he was rescued,
Choi Tae Ho told Jang Do Pal

372
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:33,650
that he killed Yoon So Hee.

373
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:37,470
He agreed to testify to that tomorrow.

374
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,020
Wow, Joon Oh is going to be so happy!

375
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,530
Now, all we have to worry about

376
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:46,050
is getting Jang Do Pal
to the court room safely.

377
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:51,350
Choi Tae Ho probably knows by now
that Jang Do Pal is going to testify.

378
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,240
Yes, Prosecutor Lee.

379
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,130
Jang Do Pal will testify for Seo Joon Oh
tomorrow. Did you know?

380
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,810
<i>If he testifies tomorrow,
you will lose this battle.</i>

381
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,370
That will inconvenience me as well.

382
00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:16,030
<i>What are you going to do now?
Can you stop this from happening?</i>

383
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,180
I guess he decided to testify in the end.

384
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,950
Seo Joon Oh.

385
00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:00,440
I came because I was worried,
and I missed you.

386
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,540
It's been hard on you, hasn't it?

387
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:09,240
You've done a great job.

388
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:15,460
We just have to get through...
one more day.

389
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,800
It'll all be over tomorrow.

390
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:27,050
By tomorrow, we'll clear your charges,
and get you out of here.

391
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:32,230
Trust me.

392
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,050
- He still hasn't called, has he?
- No.

393
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,180
Bong Hee!

394
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,070
- Lawyer Jo.
- They just left.

395
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,240
What's wrong with them?

396
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,830
So?

397
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:01,850
There was an accident,
but I don't know the details--

398
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:04,650
I just need you to find out
Seo Joon Oh's location.

399
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,010
Lawyer Jo. Something's not right.

400
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:19,540
- I think something happened.
- I can't reach Prosecutor Yoon.

401
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,180
Pardon?

402
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:23,310
I'll look into it.

403
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,930
- They'll be here.
- Why aren't they here?

404
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,010
- They're not picking up, right?
- I can't contact the vehicles

405
00:38:20,010 --> 00:38:21,300
and I don't know where they are.

406
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,880
What on earth is going on?

407
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,920
What can we do?

408
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,920
If Joon Oh and Jang Do Pal aren't here,
we can't have a trial.

409
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,540
- This won't do. Let's find them.
- No, you can't.

410
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,730
If we want to find them,
we need to be escorted by the police

411
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,030
but I think Lee Jae Joon
is stopping that from happening.

412
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,800
It's not easy.

413
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:47,240
<i>- Yes, Prosecutor Yoon!</i>
- I'm sorry.

414
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:51,140
What happened? We were worried
because we couldn't contact you.

415
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:55,700
I should have told you what was going on,
but Choi Tae Ho's guys got to me.

416
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,860
What about Seo Joon Oh?

417
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,500
We haven't found him yet.

418
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,140
They couldn't have gone very far.

419
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,460
I'll look for them. I'll call you later!

420
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,880
Yes.

421
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:12,950
Gosh, how long do we have to wait?
I'm going crazy.

422
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:16,930
Prosecutor Lee is stopping us from
doing anything, so we have no choice.

423
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:22,130
If we ask someone to find out their
location, I won't feel so frustrated.

424
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:27,310
I can't stand this. Wow, this is
the power of the prosecution, huh?

425
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,960
Oh.

426
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,730
There is one person who can help us.

427
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,850
I heard you decided to stand
as Seo Joon Oh's witness.

428
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:16,940
You didn't think I knew you were doing
other things behind my back, did you?

429
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:20,420
Even if I were doing other things,
or acting like an asshole...

430
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,360
You shouldn't treat me like this.

431
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,830
When Jae Hyun died...

432
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:35,130
I told you I couldn't stand it,
and that I would turn myself in...

433
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:39,640
but what did you say
after I said that so many times?

434
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,550
You told me you'd help me.

435
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:47,080
You said you'd take responsibility.

436
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,570
But, because of Jae Hyun,
whom I didn't even kill...

437
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,920
Since I was on that deserted island...

438
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,140
I wanted to live like other people...

439
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,760
so I lived while killing people.

440
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:16,130
But now...

441
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:18,500
you want to stab me in the back?

442
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,480
You can't do that.

443
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,970
If I'm going to die,
you're going to die with me.

444
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,350
Congresswoman Jo.

445
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,000
Bong Hee.

446
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,850
Congresswoman Jo lost her voice,
so she can't talk for very long.

447
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:50,280
I'm not here to hear what she has to say.

448
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:55,380
I'm here because I need your help.
Please help us.

449
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:59,860
You know exactly what happened
on that island.

450
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:04,200
- Bong Hee, she is no longer responsible.
- No.

451
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,260
She is responsible.

452
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:12,250
She is responsible, as the chairwoman
of the special investigation committee.

453
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:17,680
But not once did you act the part
in the special investigation committee.

454
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,130
<i>If you had really
listened to us even once...</i>

455
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:28,260
<i>And supported us,
and stood on our side...</i>

456
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,780
<i>If you had done your job, even once!</i>

457
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,550
<i>Then we wouldn't be where we are today.</i>

458
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:43,370
So how can you say
you're not responsible for this?

459
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:45,930
- You--
- That's why...

460
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,400
I'm giving you a chance.

461
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,900
I'm giving you once last chance...

462
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:00,090
to act like the chairwoman
of the special investigation committee.

463
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,840
What do you want to do?

464
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,250
Are you going to run away again?

465
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:12,350
Just like you've always done?

466
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:29,860
She knows how to talk.

467
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:50,970
Yes, how have you been, Director?

468
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:57,340
Oh, my voice? It's from my election
campaign. I'm embarrassed.

469
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,460
Well, I'm calling you because...

470
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:05,380
I have an urgent favor to ask you.

471
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:06,670
Yes.

472
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:25,400
I...

473
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:30,420
Because of you...

474
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,420
If it weren't for you...

475
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,770
I...

476
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,570
Tae Ho!

477
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:07,550
No! You can't do this anymore!

478
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,630
Just to hide your mistake...

479
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:27,350
Just to hide that...

480
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:34,630
Are you planning to run for the rest
of your life while killing people?

481
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,200
You son of a bitch!

482
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,500
Does that make you happy,
you son of a bitch?

483
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:09,650
When I didn't have to worry
about anyone else...

484
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:13,250
I was comfortable when we landed
on that deserted island!

485
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,210
That was when I was happy!

486
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:33,320
Let's end this.

487
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,380
Tae Ho.

488
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,410
Let's end this.

489
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:04,930
You know...

490
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,490
I really want you to be happy.

491
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:15,680
We can't go back to how we were before.

492
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,850
But because I'm kind...

493
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,210
I will stay by your side.

494
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,130
Tae Ho.

495
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:46,040
Let's end this.

496
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,650
How did I become this person?

497
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:29,580
You worked hard, taking
my insults all this time.

498
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:34,060
Not at all. Please have
a relaxing vacation.

499
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:51,930
<i>The people who made the wrong choice...</i>

500
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:55,740
<i>The people who regretted it afterward...</i>

501
00:49:55,740 --> 00:50:00,900
<i>The people who tried to conceal
the truth with a lie, were punished</i>

502
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,870
<i>and everything finally
returned to normal.</i>

503
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,340
Please come with me.

504
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,120
Let's go.

505
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:21,330
Let go. Let go!

506
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,030
Let's make it beautiful!

507
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,600
Don't frown like that!

508
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:32,060
Bong Hee, I have something to tell you,
but I don't know how to say it.

509
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,900
- Did I surprise you, Bong Hee?
- These are seagulls!

510
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:45,760
Smile. Smile.

511
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,980
- You look cute!
- Hey!

512
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,240
You can't do that!

513
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,200
Prosecutor, why are you so serious?

514
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,160
Hey, don't touch me!

515
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,350
Tae Ho!

516
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:02,490
Hey, Secretary Tae! Run after you finish
your work, you crazy child!

517
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:04,500
- What's your occupation?
- Manager.

518
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,250
Manager, right? Managers--

519
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:08,120
- Worry about yourself!
- Okay, Ji Ah.

520
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,180
That's why, I want to talk
about Bong Hee--

521
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,740
Is it Bong Hee or me?

522
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:17,170
You! I choose you! Yes!

523
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:20,890
Ji Ah, you can't do that! Ji Ah!

524
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:24,820
Even if we look happy,
we all have some pain inside us.

525
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:29,630
Why do you keep looking at people
like that? Even on the island!

526
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:33,580
How many people did he kill?
It's a secret?

527
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:37,290
I'm in a good mood,
and you're pretty too.

528
00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:41,220
- Isn't she cute? Isn't she?
- She is!

529
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:44,290
CEO Hwang!

530
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:49,910
Hey, you punks! Don't touch
my hair! Hey, stop it!

531
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:51,660
- Why do you only get mad at me?
- Hey!

532
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:55,160
Hey, you punk.

533
00:52:55,160 --> 00:53:00,450
Hey, Secretary Tae! That punk.
Why can't you get your act together?

534
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:01,860
Huh?

535
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,850
- Byung Joo!
- I'm sorry!

536
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,170
- What's wrong with you?
- I tripped on the tree.

537
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:11,890
- Put it back up!
- Stop that!

538
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:14,200
- Please go over there.
- Be careful!

539
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,980
What is it?

540
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,630
What is this?

541
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:22,110
- Ki Joon, I stepped in something!
- He stepped in poop!

542
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:23,760
Why is there poop up here?

543
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,080
It's manure, but it fell...

544
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,110
- It's dog crap.
- What? What's wrong?

545
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,210
- Did you fart?
- No!

546
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:32,610
- Bong Hee, who pooped?
- Oh!

547
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:35,300
- Joon Oh, it's poop.
- It is?

548
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:38,240
- He stepped in it!
- Hey!

549
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,670
Why would you poop there
when you could go to the bathroom?

550
00:53:40,670 --> 00:53:42,890
- Joon Oh, when did you do that?
- I didn't poop!

551
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,740
How could you step in it? Did you step
on the land mine intentionally?

552
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:49,340
- Wait, the smell is spreading!
- Geez, I think I stepped in it.

553
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:51,570
Wait, no. It's not poop. It's not poop.

554
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:54,210
You'd better take care of that!

555
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:58,810
- Secretary Tae, he's so cute!
- That's all that matters!

556
00:53:58,810 --> 00:54:00,930
We'll get going! Take care of that!

557
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:04,310
Why do you keep staring like that?

558
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:05,980
Get out of the way.

559
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,150
- Gosh, this smell.
- Why is there poop?

560
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:10,930
- I told you not to move your foot!
- Why?

561
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:13,860
- It smells.
- How could they leave because of this?

562
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:17,440
Wait! Your foot.
Stand still, Seo Joon Oh.

563
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,860
Stop!

564
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,410
- Geez.
- How did you step in poop?

565
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:23,040
They left? Why aren't you leaving?

566
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:25,720
How could I leave someone
who stepped in poop?

567
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,960
Geez. Why aren't you wearing
the necklace I got you?

568
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,230
I'm keeping it safe at home.

569
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:34,120
Don't just keep it safe. If you don't
use it, it's worth less than crap.

570
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,950
- Hey. Don't move.
- Hey, but...

571
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:41,290
Isn't it nice to be together again?
It reminds me of the deserted island.

572
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:44,650
I know. That was nice.

573
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:47,980
Bong Hee, there's something on your face.

574
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:48,980
Here?

575
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,820
No, lower.

576
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:55,560
- Where?
- Next to your lips.

577
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,020
Here.

578
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:01,160
- Wait, no--
- It's not coming off.

579
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,810
- What do we do? What else can we...
- There's another way.

580
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:07,930
And what's that? How do we erase it?

581
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:10,100
Well...

582
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,540
Let's see.

583
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:16,690
- Why are you closing your eyes?
- I did it for no reason.

584
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:19,970
- I guess it's bright out.
- It is. I'd better close them again.

585
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,680
What?

586
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:32,590
Geez! How could you tell me
about that now?

587
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:36,420
- Gosh, that smell.
- Hey.

588
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,210
Joon Oh, what do we do?
I was just told about this interview.

589
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,900
What interview?

590
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:44,030
Ji Ah had an interview scheduled
for today, but forgot.

591
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:47,350
- Hey, what about my face?
- You should have told me earlier!

592
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:50,500
We're having an interview
after I stepped in poop while painting?

593
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:53,210
The smell of poop won't be recorded
for broadcast.

594
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:55,130
Hello, I'm Seo Joon Oh.

595
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:56,980
Joon Oh stepped in poop!

596
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:59,210
I won't be able to star in a movie
for the time being--

597
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:01,550
Joon Oh stepped on a mine a while ago!

598
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:04,690
- Byung Joo, take this away!
- Wait. Yes.

599
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:05,930
You should remove this!

600
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:10,480
I am happy to greet you
on this broadcast. I will...

601
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:14,530
- When you commit a crime--
- Hey!

602
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:17,830
It ends up this way.
Please don't commit...

603
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:19,240
any crimes.

604
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,070
I know. It's okay.

605
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:24,640
What was it again? Ki Joon,
"Don't hate the crime, hate the person?"

606
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,670
Yeah, that's right.

607
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:29,370
They say, "Don't hate the crime,
hate the person."

608
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:31,180
Which camera should I look at?

609
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,590
- Bong Hee, are we on TV?
- Mom, we're on TV!

610
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:35,980
Hello! One, two, three!

611
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:37,140
- Hello!
- Hello!

612
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,290
What relationship?

613
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:42,270
PD, does everyone date after
being stranded on an island?

614
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:44,790
Well, we just take care of each other.

615
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:46,750
It's cold. Let's stop.

616
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:48,930
We dated, but we don't love each other.

617
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:52,900
Please don't ask about her dating life.
Please ask about her work.

618
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:57,360
- But I'm not working on anything.
- There are six movies on hold!

619
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:01,350
I feel bad. I should do better.
I will work a lot harder.

620
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:04,500
And we still haven't given up on Yeol.

621
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,820
We're still looking everywhere for him.

622
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:12,090
I learned from CEO Hwang,
to always work for our actors...

623
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:15,810
I'm a man who's not scared of anything--

624
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:19,400
That scared me! I'm sorry.
That scared me.

625
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,310
After I was dismissed...

626
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:27,600
I converted to a job
where I mentor high school students.

627
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,060
Please talk faster.

628
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:34,640
It's not fun. It's a business
relationship. Yes, I'm just learning.

629
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:40,070
You see, this man has great character,
and works really hard.

630
00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:45,660
I'm a pretty good worker myself.
That's because I learned it from him.

631
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:49,430
At first, I graduated and worked
somewhere else

632
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:53,300
- and then my aunt called me...
- Your aunt?

633
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:57,710
Oh, Congresswoman Jo is my aunt,
but she...

634
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,630
left for a vacation.

635
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:02,410
- Byung Joo! Byung Joo!
- Yes?

636
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:05,430
- Jo Hee Kyung...
- Do you know me?

637
00:58:05,430 --> 00:58:08,610
- The truth is, I like Bong Hee--
- Me?

638
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,250
- Oh.
- Me?

639
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:13,550
You do?

640
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,240
- Please paint more actively.
- Yes.

641
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,750
Not with your mouth,
but with your actions.

642
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:23,530
Please show me.

643
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:27,630
- Stop it!
- Don't tell me to stop!

644
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:30,090
Ji Ah, what are you trying to express?

645
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,480
So this is the style that Ji Ah likes...

646
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:39,270
Oh! Oh!

647
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:43,190
That side is a little empty.

648
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:44,710
What do we do?

649
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:48,610
- Wow.
- This is amazing.

650
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:51,290
- Bong Hee.
- Yes?

651
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:56,060
- We're doomed.
- We are. I'm speechless.

652
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,140
I knew this was going to happen.

653
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,480
I didn't.

654
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,010
- What do we do?
- Should we start over?

655
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,550
- We can do it again!
- Look what you did!

656
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:11,320
Look, both sides are equal!
Both sides look good together.

657
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:14,250
- Let's paint over it!
- How?

658
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,940
You can do it.

659
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:20,340
We can do this!

660
00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:24,040
Oh! Someone has to press the button.

661
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,850
- Timer! Three...
- Don't come here.

662
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:29,020
- Two! One!
- Get ready!

663
00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:30,970
One, two, three!

664
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:32,690

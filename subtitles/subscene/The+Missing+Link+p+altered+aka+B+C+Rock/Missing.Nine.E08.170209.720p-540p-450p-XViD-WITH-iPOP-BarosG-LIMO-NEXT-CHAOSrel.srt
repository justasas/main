00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:10,169
<i>That person...</i>

3
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:14,554
was always...

4
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:17,077
a threatening person to us.

5
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:22,847
<i>That's why Yoon So Hee...
always called him a murderer.</i>

6
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:27,121
And he...

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,986
tried to kill all of us.

8
00:00:40,622 --> 00:00:43,973
He wanted to survive by himself...

9
00:00:43,973 --> 00:00:48,935
So he tried to kill us,
when we were in the lifeboat with him.

10
00:00:54,618 --> 00:00:59,002
<i>It was because... we knew the truth.</i>

11
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:01,790
To that person, we were...

12
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,469
people who needed to die.

13
00:01:07,204 --> 00:01:10,469
Who was that person? Please tell us.

14
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:18,242
That murderer was...

15
00:01:18,242 --> 00:01:19,902
Seo Joon Oh.

16
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:26,712
<i>It was Seo Joon Oh.</i>

17
00:01:39,805 --> 00:01:44,709
<i>Is Seo Joon Oh still alive?
Why did he kill Yoon So Hee?</i>

18
00:01:52,364 --> 00:01:55,584
- Were you at the scene?
- Hey!

19
00:01:56,588 --> 00:01:59,689
It's not true, Prosecutor Yoon.
It's not true!

20
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:04,096
I'm so sorry.

21
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,736
For not being able save
the colleagues I loved...

22
00:02:11,736 --> 00:02:15,423
And for coming back by myself...

23
00:02:17,132 --> 00:02:19,050
I'm truly sorry.

24
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:21,735
No! It wasn't Seo Joon Oh,
Prosecutor Yoon!

25
00:02:21,735 --> 00:02:24,181
Bong Hee. Let's talk outside.

26
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:26,627
If you do this,
it'll only make things difficult for you.

27
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:45,412
Regarding your questions,
we will return to answer them

28
00:02:45,412 --> 00:02:48,093
once we complete
the additional investigation.

29
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:52,979
Choi Tae Ho! Choi Tae Ho!

30
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:55,977
- Choi Tae Ho!
- Please answer us!

31
00:02:57,685 --> 00:03:01,941
She got through.
I apologize.

32
00:03:07,615 --> 00:03:10,955
<i>[Episode 8]</i>
Let go! Let go of me!

33
00:03:10,955 --> 00:03:13,475
Was that why you tried
to stop me from coming here?

34
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:16,338
If so, I won't wait around foolishly
any longer.

35
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:20,711
Where's Choi Tae Ho?
Where's Chairwoman Jo?

36
00:03:22,793 --> 00:03:24,241
Bong Hee.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,308
Do you think anything will change
if you see them?

38
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:31,881
You said you understood.
So you should get your act together!

39
00:03:31,881 --> 00:03:36,330
The survivor who is here is Choi Tae Ho.
Not Seo Joon Oh. He's dead!

40
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:47,141
I think Jang Do Pal sent those guys
to block her.

41
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:49,986
I think Jang Do Pal and Chairwoman Jo
are in on it together.

42
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:53,877
Figure out Choi Tae Ho's movements.
I'll call you later.

43
00:03:53,877 --> 00:03:54,938
You're not coming with us?

44
00:03:54,938 --> 00:03:58,816
I have something I have to check.
You worked hard today.

45
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:00,360
Please give us a call!

46
00:04:02,373 --> 00:04:05,163
Geez, I thought my eyes
were going to run out of tears.

47
00:04:05,163 --> 00:04:09,359
Good work today, Tae Ho.
I know you're still emotional

48
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:11,462
but can I ask you something?

49
00:04:11,462 --> 00:04:15,209
What happened to Joon Oh?

50
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:21,709
I'm talking about Lee Juno of
Seo Taeji and Boys. Don't misunderstand.

51
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:25,291
You see, I was a  bag fan
when I was little.

52
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:28,701
I used to walk home from school
while listening to "Come Back Home."

53
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:32,480
I had hoped I would meet Lee Juno
once I became a manager

54
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,706
but I don't know when I'll get
that chance.

55
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:37,930
I'll get back to work. I'm sorry.

56
00:04:41,745 --> 00:04:45,353
- Damn it.
- Get out. Get out!

57
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:48,600
Get out, you bastard!
Get out, Choi Tae Ho!

58
00:04:53,281 --> 00:04:56,718
Get out. Get out!
Get out, you son of a bitch!

59
00:04:56,718 --> 00:05:01,086
Get out, Choi Tae Ho! Get out! Get out!

60
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:18,947
Choi Tae Ho. It looks like everyone
believes you right now, doesn't it?

61
00:05:18,947 --> 00:05:22,968
But everyone will end up finding out
what kind of bastard you really are

62
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:26,853
and what shit you did.
Seo Joon Oh and I will make sure of it.

63
00:05:26,853 --> 00:05:31,235
Stop fooling around and listen to me.
This isn't a deserted island, it's Seoul.

64
00:05:31,235 --> 00:05:34,047
Do you think people will
believe what you say?

65
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:37,675
Stop looking for Seo Joon Oh, he's dead.
Focus on your own future.

66
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:40,353
He's not dead! He's not dead.

67
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:43,713
Seo Joon Oh's not dead! He's alive.

68
00:05:43,713 --> 00:05:45,862
I saw his dead body.

69
00:05:47,163 --> 00:05:50,485
When Seo Joon Oh died, I...

70
00:05:57,069 --> 00:05:59,665
Never mind. Forget it.

71
00:06:01,687 --> 00:06:03,552
Let's go, Byung Joo!

72
00:06:16,182 --> 00:06:17,790
Are you all right?

73
00:06:24,706 --> 00:06:28,764
- Yes.
- I have a question, Ra Bong Hee.

74
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:33,201
Are you...

75
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:36,884
someone I can trust?

76
00:06:41,615 --> 00:06:44,584
I'm sorry, Prosecutor Yoon.

77
00:06:45,783 --> 00:06:47,826
Right now...

78
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,668
All I can tell you,
is that you have to believe me.

79
00:06:53,668 --> 00:06:57,067
But, Prosecutor Yoon,
you're So Hee's older brother.

80
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:59,737
That's why you need to know the truth.

81
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:05,783
The person who killed So Hee...
wasn't Seo Joon Oh.

82
00:07:07,824 --> 00:07:09,911
It was Choi Tae Ho.

83
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,045
Okay. Can you wipe his face?

84
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:56,908
What are we going to do with him?

85
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:58,408
Let's wait a little longer.

86
00:07:58,408 --> 00:08:00,735
What are we waiting for,
and for how much longer?

87
00:08:00,735 --> 00:08:03,348
We should either kill him
or kick him out.

88
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:05,915
Let's wait for Journalist Kim
to wake up...

89
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:10,701
And see what he has to say
before we decide, Ji Ah.

90
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,896
I need to know something.

91
00:08:13,896 --> 00:08:16,533
Why did he kill So Hee...

92
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,596
And what did he hear,
that made him go crazy?

93
00:09:03,815 --> 00:09:05,740
It's hard for you, isn't it?

94
00:09:06,663 --> 00:09:08,374
I'm okay.

95
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,475
I just feel like they're not the people
I thought they were.

96
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:19,441
Not just Tae Ho, the other people too.

97
00:09:22,232 --> 00:09:25,836
I don't know if they changed
from being here...

98
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:31,519
Or if they were always like that,
and I just didn't know.

99
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:45,576
<i>If by any chance...</i>

100
00:09:45,576 --> 00:09:48,559
<i>Journalist Kim doesn't wake up...</i>

101
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,844
<i>What will you do then?</i>

102
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:58,888
<i>If he never wakes up,
and you can't ask him what he knows...</i>

103
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:01,941
<i>What will you do?</i>

104
00:10:09,546 --> 00:10:12,953
Hey, Joon Oh.
Go inside and get some sleep.

105
00:10:14,764 --> 00:10:16,429
Geez.

106
00:10:46,322 --> 00:10:48,659
Joon Oh!

107
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:50,988
Journalist Kim is awake.

108
00:10:54,706 --> 00:10:56,705
- Wait out here.
- Pardon?

109
00:10:56,705 --> 00:10:58,317
What is it?
Did Journalist Kim wake up?

110
00:10:58,317 --> 00:11:03,203
Yeah. But he wants to speak
to Joon Oh alone. Just a moment.

111
00:11:07,778 --> 00:11:10,972
- Are... Are you all right?
- Yes.

112
00:11:10,972 --> 00:11:15,668
I came to help you, but I ended up
causing you trouble instead.

113
00:11:15,668 --> 00:11:19,010
What do you mean you came to help me?

114
00:11:22,138 --> 00:11:24,669
I received some information.

115
00:11:25,404 --> 00:11:28,198
About Shin Jae Hyun's death.

116
00:11:28,198 --> 00:11:31,509
That's all in the past,
so why bring it up now?

117
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:41,147
Shin Jae Hyun didn't commit suicide.

118
00:11:41,842 --> 00:11:43,892
He was murdered.

119
00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:47,407
If I told you he had another guest
at his house...

120
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:51,760
besides you, before he died...
Would you believe me?

121
00:11:53,614 --> 00:11:58,131
If that were true, it would have been
revealed in the police investigation.

122
00:11:58,131 --> 00:12:01,110
Who gave you that information?
And how did they know?

123
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:05,192
You must have many questions,
but this is all you need to know.

124
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:10,441
Yoon So Hee's death,
and Shin Jae Hyun's murder...

125
00:12:10,441 --> 00:12:12,206
are connected.

126
00:12:12,206 --> 00:12:14,958
As is the reason
why Choi Tae Ho tried to kill me.

127
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:24,413
In... Instead of saying these things...

128
00:12:24,413 --> 00:12:26,347
Do you have any evidence?

129
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:29,943
If I show you the evidence,
will you believe me?

130
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:47,291
Ji Ah.

131
00:12:49,244 --> 00:12:51,047
Can you get me some water?

132
00:12:52,388 --> 00:12:54,506
I'm thirsty.

133
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,653
What is this son of a bitch saying?

134
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:13,934
Here you go, you son of a bitch.

135
00:13:50,119 --> 00:13:52,684
Are you hiding something from me?

136
00:13:58,575 --> 00:14:00,434
What are you saying?

137
00:14:00,434 --> 00:14:02,924
If you are, just tell me.

138
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,370
Can't you just tell me?

139
00:14:20,721 --> 00:14:22,528
I'll look into it then.

140
00:14:26,688 --> 00:14:28,460
Wait.

141
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:07,754
- Okay.
- What about Tae Ho?

142
00:15:07,754 --> 00:15:10,111
Yes, he just came out.

143
00:15:10,111 --> 00:15:15,269
That crazy bastard. This isn't
the time for this. He has no patience.

144
00:15:38,043 --> 00:15:41,760
Oh my, Prosecutor Yoon!
You waited for a long time, didn't you?

145
00:15:43,821 --> 00:15:47,432
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Jang Do Pal of Legend Entertainment.

146
00:15:47,432 --> 00:15:51,259
We've met before, haven't we? But...

147
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:54,686
You're not very punctual.

148
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:58,498
Oh no.

149
00:15:58,498 --> 00:16:03,058
I forgot I took up
a lot of your precious time.

150
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:06,674
If you haven't had lunch yet,
let's go eat.

151
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,446
It's my treat because I was late--

152
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:13,361
Let's skip all that.
Let me meet your friend instead.

153
00:16:14,894 --> 00:16:16,327
Excuse me?

154
00:16:19,494 --> 00:16:21,145
Choi Tae Ho.

155
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:26,317
I'm here today to see your friend.

156
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:31,528
Is it because he's a top star and
a national hero? I couldn't reach him.

157
00:16:33,421 --> 00:16:38,001
Oh, I see. You should have
given me some notice.

158
00:16:42,107 --> 00:16:45,067
<i>Our Tae Ho isn't feeling so well
right now.</i>

159
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:48,014
- Byung Joo, water.
- We don't have any.

160
00:16:48,014 --> 00:16:52,220
He just got an IV, and went home to rest.

161
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,225
Is that so?

162
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:57,144
There are many people wanting to see
him these days, so he's been strained.

163
00:16:57,144 --> 00:16:59,370
I'm so sorry. What do we do?

164
00:17:00,537 --> 00:17:03,914
He can't avoid me forever.

165
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:09,188
If you respond this way, it always
ends up as a bigger problem later on.

166
00:17:10,056 --> 00:17:12,912
Who's avoiding you?
Come on, Prosecutor Yoon.

167
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:15,410
We'll contact you soon--

168
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,012
Answer my call next time.

169
00:17:17,012 --> 00:17:20,441
It won't be a call asking you
if you're doing well.

170
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,906
- I won't see you out, Prosecutor Yoon.
- Oh!

171
00:17:28,675 --> 00:17:32,119
Why did you keep Choi Tae Ho hidden?

172
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:34,813
What are you saying?

173
00:17:36,882 --> 00:17:40,971
<i>You know. You were in China
before coming back to Korea.</i>

174
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:44,479
Was he that ill?

175
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:04,798
Okay, start with your right foot.
Like this.

176
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,419
Tae Ho! You can't do this here!

177
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:11,776
- You have to wake up! Tae Ho!
- Where are we?

178
00:18:11,776 --> 00:18:15,131
- We're in front of the company.
- Okay.

179
00:18:15,131 --> 00:18:18,295
- Walk straight, Tae Ho!
- Okay, leave me alone!

180
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:24,000
Geez, CEO Jang told you not to let
anyone see you so drunk!

181
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,503
- Please walk like you're sober.
- What are you saying?

182
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:37,239
Why are you acting like Yoon So Hee? Huh?

183
00:18:37,961 --> 00:18:42,190
Geez, kids who aren't worth anything...

184
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,272
need to be taught a lesson
to wake the hell up.

185
00:18:47,558 --> 00:18:51,982
Whoa! Tae Ho! Ouch... Tae Ho!

186
00:18:51,982 --> 00:18:56,086
Tae Ho, get ahold of yourself!
You can't sleep here, Tae Ho!

187
00:18:56,086 --> 00:19:00,018
What's going on here?
Tae Ho, you can't do this here.

188
00:19:00,018 --> 00:19:01,580
Tae Ho!

189
00:19:13,288 --> 00:19:16,227
Please give that to Choi Tae Ho.

190
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:18,820
Who... who are you?

191
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:25,000
If you tell him Yoon So Hee's older
brother wants to see him, he'll get it.

192
00:19:40,807 --> 00:19:42,557
<i>[Prosecutor Yoon Tae Young]</i>

193
00:19:45,867 --> 00:19:47,430
Tae Ho.

194
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:51,084
Choi Tae Ho!

195
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:01,597
I told you... it's too early to pop open
a champagne bottle, didn't I?

196
00:20:01,597 --> 00:20:05,176
You should have been more careful!

197
00:20:11,634 --> 00:20:13,007
Yeah.

198
00:20:14,361 --> 00:20:16,291
What?

199
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,160
A survivor?

200
00:20:21,855 --> 00:20:26,412
Did you get his testimony?
Who's right? Ra Bong Hee or Choi Tae Ho?

201
00:20:26,412 --> 00:20:30,218
I'm not sure. They said
they didn't get a proper answer.

202
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:34,961
- What does that mean?
- He's not in very good shape.

203
00:20:49,635 --> 00:20:52,380
No, don't worry.
It must have been hard for you.

204
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,868
Wow, seriously.

205
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:00,318
Are you all right?

206
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:04,144
- Are you?
- Um...

207
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:07,920
I... will be protected, right?

208
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,169
Of course. Nothing will happen
to you while you're here.

209
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,803
There's no need to worry.

210
00:21:12,803 --> 00:21:15,876
No one can find out...

211
00:21:15,876 --> 00:21:19,220
that I'm here.
No one must know that I'm here.

212
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,277
If I'm caught... it'll be over for me.

213
00:21:22,277 --> 00:21:23,997
It'll be over.

214
00:21:23,997 --> 00:21:26,603
Did something happen to you
before you got here?

215
00:21:26,603 --> 00:21:31,834
No way. I can't talk to anyone
unless it's CEO Hwang.

216
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:37,865
Send him to a hospital.

217
00:21:37,865 --> 00:21:40,521
Yes, I will send him to the hospital
where Hwang Jae Gook--

218
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:44,386
That's not what I'm saying!
Does he seem normal to you?

219
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:48,913
How could he of all people be a witness
and appear at a time like this?

220
00:21:49,672 --> 00:21:52,843
The state that he's in
is quite unfortunate, but--

221
00:21:52,843 --> 00:21:57,563
Let's watch over him as he recovers.
We can discuss what to do with him.

222
00:21:59,124 --> 00:22:00,586
Chairwoman Jo.

223
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:06,894
You don't think Choi Tae Ho's testimony
will be sabotaged by Tae Ho Hang, do you?

224
00:22:08,346 --> 00:22:11,397
We have to make sure that doesn't happen.

225
00:22:13,818 --> 00:22:15,348
Yes.

226
00:22:18,621 --> 00:22:23,896
I just got the call. We'll be able
to meet with them tomorrow.

227
00:22:23,896 --> 00:22:28,223
Secretary Tae was the only witness
who saw So Hee's murder.

228
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:30,535
He will surely testify on our side.

229
00:22:30,535 --> 00:22:33,065
As you said...

230
00:22:34,472 --> 00:22:38,575
I'm curious about
what that sole witness will say.

231
00:22:38,575 --> 00:22:40,963
I can't wait to find out.

232
00:22:43,012 --> 00:22:44,246
Bye.

233
00:22:58,931 --> 00:23:02,201
So Hee was the one
who tied my hair for me.

234
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,315
I wonder if this still has any juice.

235
00:23:09,315 --> 00:23:12,847
It's been decades,
but it looks just fine to me.

236
00:23:12,847 --> 00:23:16,884
Anyway... What will Joon Oh do?

237
00:23:16,884 --> 00:23:19,605
- What about him?
- I overheard something.

238
00:23:19,605 --> 00:23:21,923
About Jae Hyun...

239
00:23:21,923 --> 00:23:24,988
- It might not have been suicide.
- Is that what Journalist Kim said?

240
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:26,559
Yes.

241
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,726
That's why Joon Oh left to check
Journalist Kim's belongings.

242
00:23:29,726 --> 00:23:32,506
Hey, if it wasn't suicide...

243
00:23:32,506 --> 00:23:34,476
Does that mean...

244
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,307
someone killed Jae Hyun?

245
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:52,391
Tae Oh! Tae Oh!

246
00:23:53,143 --> 00:23:55,496
Ho Hang, you really know how to talk.

247
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:59,615
Save me... Save me, CEO Hwang!

248
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:05,076
Where did Joon Oh go?

249
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:19,576
Murderer!

250
00:24:54,569 --> 00:24:57,682
<i>How could he come here
after killing someone?</i>

251
00:24:57,682 --> 00:24:58,815
<i>It's Seo Joon Oh!</i>

252
00:24:58,815 --> 00:25:01,644
<i>Is that Seo Joon Oh? He's so shameless!</i>

253
00:25:01,644 --> 00:25:04,477
<i>He's a total animal.</i>

254
00:25:05,557 --> 00:25:09,385
<i>How could he come here?
He's so shameless.</i>

255
00:25:09,385 --> 00:25:13,846
<i>That's Seo Joon Oh, isn't it?
Wow, is he even human?</i>

256
00:25:28,942 --> 00:25:31,314
Are you really giving this to me?

257
00:25:31,314 --> 00:25:33,227
Of course!

258
00:25:33,227 --> 00:25:34,809
I received it with your song.

259
00:25:34,809 --> 00:25:38,522
You're trying to overwork me forever
after giving this to me, aren't you?

260
00:25:38,522 --> 00:25:43,516
Wow, you got smarter.
Of course! Until we die.

261
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,454
Geez, I want to...

262
00:25:48,454 --> 00:25:51,240
I want to debut too!

263
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:00,304
You'd better. You'll debut.

264
00:26:03,953 --> 00:26:06,201
Just wait a little longer.

265
00:26:07,286 --> 00:26:10,913
Right now, I have enough
on my own plate.

266
00:26:13,268 --> 00:26:18,432
I'll make sure to help you
so that you can do what you want.

267
00:26:25,829 --> 00:26:28,736
I'm going to hold you
to that promise, okay?

268
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,305
Of course!

269
00:26:30,305 --> 00:26:33,748
Yo! Dreamers won an award!

270
00:26:33,748 --> 00:26:38,718
- Yeah!
- Shin Jae Hyun!

271
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,382
If you can't hold on to Jae Hyun,
Dreamers is over. That's it.

272
00:26:53,382 --> 00:26:57,134
Jae Hyun listens to you.
Try to convince him.

273
00:26:57,134 --> 00:27:01,464
Why don't we take this chance to let
Jae Hyun debut or go to another company?

274
00:27:01,464 --> 00:27:03,557
Why do you want to let talent rot away?

275
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:07,413
It's not like we can
depend on Jae Hyun forever.

276
00:27:07,413 --> 00:27:08,769
I'm begging you, please?

277
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:11,897
It will happen when it's time.
Tell him to wait.

278
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:14,817
Hold on to him. Don't let him go!

279
00:27:32,261 --> 00:27:34,910
<i>You really don't trust me?</i>

280
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:43,387
I asked you to wait a little longer.

281
00:27:43,387 --> 00:27:46,182
I said I'll help you become
an independent artist.

282
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:54,476
If you just leave like this,
it'll ruin everything!

283
00:27:54,476 --> 00:27:56,961
Aren't you bothered that you
waited all this time for nothing?

284
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,182
<i>Then for you... how much longer
is just a little longer?</i>

285
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:07,738
<i>Until the third album?
Until the next concert? Or...</i>

286
00:28:07,738 --> 00:28:09,760
<i>Until the awards ceremony?</i>

287
00:28:11,365 --> 00:28:16,736
Joon Oh. It's been seven years.

288
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,451
Joon Oh.

289
00:28:18,451 --> 00:28:21,454
In the end,
you're just like everyone else.

290
00:28:21,454 --> 00:28:24,173
You pretend that you care about me

291
00:28:24,173 --> 00:28:27,672
but in the end, it's all about
Dreamers, am I right?

292
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:31,271
In the immediate future,
you're waiting for Tae Ho's replacement.

293
00:28:31,271 --> 00:28:36,372
In the end... all you can think about
is your album!

294
00:28:36,372 --> 00:28:38,684
So what do you want me to do? Huh?

295
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:43,203
That's why...
It's getting too hard for me.

296
00:28:43,203 --> 00:28:45,931
It's so difficult, I want to die.

297
00:28:48,365 --> 00:28:51,294
Then die, you son of a bitch!

298
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,931
Then die.
If you can't endure this, just die.

299
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:16,824
How can you do this to me?

300
00:29:18,106 --> 00:29:22,319
You said... You said
I was part of Dreamers too!

00:30:31,261 --> 00:30:34,615
Did you see Jae Hyun? Where is he?

305
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:36,742
Did you hear anything from him?

306
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:46,845
- Is he upstairs?
- Yes.

307
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:51,017
- Can't you reach him?
- I talked to him for a little bit.

308
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:53,788
I told you to convince him nicely.

309
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:59,144

Why... Why is everyone here?

Hey.

312
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:21,895
- What is it?
- Jae Hyun wanted to talk to us.

313
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:30,174

<i>[The Unfortunate Suicide Of A Trainee]</i>

341
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,960
Tae Ho.

342
00:36:51,989 --> 00:36:54,204
Why did you do it?

343
00:37:00,047 --> 00:37:01,663
Joon Oh.

344
00:37:03,802 --> 00:37:06,612
I'm having a really hard time right now.

345
00:37:19,523 --> 00:37:24,371
Joon Oh. In the end,
this is how far we came.

346
00:37:26,106 --> 00:37:29,228
I really hope you're the last one.

347
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:31,760
All of this is too hard for me.

348
00:37:32,873 --> 00:37:35,422
Hey, do you think we'll fail
without you? Huh?

349
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:38,731
- Wait!
- Hey, let go!

350
00:37:43,152 --> 00:37:46,449
911. Jae Hyun. Jae Hyun, hold on.

351
00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:49,657
I'll call an ambulance. Jae Hyun!

352
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:58,164
Please circle around the block.

353
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:20,869
<i>Jae Hyun... How could you?</i>

354
00:38:20,869 --> 00:38:21,952
Jae Hyun...

355
00:38:23,954 --> 00:38:25,985
Why Jae Hyun?

356
00:38:25,985 --> 00:38:28,402
Why are you so worried about him?

357
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:33,500
He was already dead! Falling off
a building didn't change anything!

358
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,646
Why?

359
00:38:46,597 --> 00:38:51,849
Joon Oh... Joon Oh... What do we do
about Joon Oh? Joon Oh.

360
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:55,148
Huh? Secretary Tae.

361
00:38:55,148 --> 00:38:58,706
- Joon Oh. What do we about Joon Oh?
- Wh... What's the matter?

362
00:38:58,706 --> 00:39:00,369
Tae Ho.

363
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:02,311
Tae Ho...

364
00:39:12,742 --> 00:39:14,239
Should I go with you?

365
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:17,054
No, I'll go by myself.

366
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,525
Chairwoman Jo. Ra Bong Hee is here.

367
00:39:31,525 --> 00:39:33,413
Ra Bong...

368
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,751
Why is she here?
Did someone call her?

369
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:39,538
I'm not sure. She's out front.

370
00:39:50,327 --> 00:39:51,789
Let her in.

371
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:55,661
I don't think anyone asked you
to come here today.

372
00:39:55,661 --> 00:39:58,536
No. I chose to come here.

373
00:39:58,536 --> 00:40:00,827
I heard Secretary Tae is here.

374
00:40:00,827 --> 00:40:02,619
I want to hear his testimony.

375
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:06,246
You can't just show up here
because you want to.

376
00:40:06,246 --> 00:40:09,255
Then who is allowed to listen to it?

377
00:40:09,255 --> 00:40:12,210
Do we have to share
the same opinion to be here?

378
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:17,735
Fine. If you want to join us...

379
00:40:17,735 --> 00:40:20,239
If you were to join us,
what is it that you want?

380
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:24,800
If today's testimony goes sideways,
tell everyone that it wasn't Seo Joon Oh.

381
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:29,202
Please fix the situation so that
he's no longer framed as a criminal.

382
00:40:29,202 --> 00:40:33,190
Aren't you getting ahead of yourself?
We don't know anything yet.

383
00:40:38,643 --> 00:40:42,059
Let's wait and see.
Let's see what happens.

384
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:54,835
You don't have to be nervous. All you
have to do is tell us what you know.

385
00:40:57,286 --> 00:40:58,759
What's wrong?

386
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:02,581
- Are... Are you all right?
- Yes.

387
00:41:02,581 --> 00:41:05,224
No! Wait! What's wrong? Is it coming out?

388
00:41:05,224 --> 00:41:06,934
Wait. Wa--

389
00:41:06,934 --> 00:41:10,380
You can't do that in here! You can't!
Do you think you can swallow it?

390
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,106
Hey! Hey! Hey! Not here!
Don't do that here! No!

391
00:41:18,177 --> 00:41:21,068
- Are you okay?
- Please give me some time.

392
00:41:21,068 --> 00:41:23,952
I know you're feeling sick,
but we're tight on time--

393
00:41:23,952 --> 00:41:27,387
Damn it! You won't even
give me time to vomit?

394
00:41:31,505 --> 00:41:33,134
What is that?

395
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:37,492
I'll be out soon! Wait!

396
00:41:37,492 --> 00:41:41,467
Geez, seriously!
What the hell are you... Huh? Huh?

397
00:41:41,467 --> 00:41:44,079
What is this? Where did he go?

398
00:41:45,684 --> 00:41:48,791
Who are you? Let go!

399
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:52,407
What is this? Damn it...

400
00:41:53,458 --> 00:41:55,137
Geez!

401
00:41:57,853 --> 00:41:59,371
There.

402
00:41:59,371 --> 00:42:04,643
Geez, what is this? Seriously.
That isn't it!

403
00:42:04,643 --> 00:42:06,568
Tae Ho Hang, let's go--

404
00:42:07,713 --> 00:42:11,617
Tae Ho Hang! Geez, there's a lot.
Where is he?

405
00:42:18,009 --> 00:42:20,605
What do you mean by that?
How could he just disappear?

406
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:24,742
I'm not sure either. He was vomiting.
I was stuck to him like glue...

407
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:28,731
Find him! Find him and bring him here!

408
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:31,809
Chairwoman Jo, what's going on?
Who disappeared?

409
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:44,969
Save me! Save me! Save me!
Please! Save me!

410
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:48,217
Help!

411
00:43:06,724 --> 00:43:10,668
Prosecutor Yoon,
I have a favor to ask you.

412
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:12,739
Please find Tae Ho Hang.

413
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:27,532
Tae Ho! Tae Ho, save me!
Save me! Save me...

414
00:43:27,532 --> 00:43:29,666
You're alive, huh?

415
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:37,021
I'm so happy to see you like this.

416
00:43:49,891 --> 00:43:52,753
Gosh, why hasn't Ki Joon come back yet?

417
00:43:52,753 --> 00:43:54,981
Did something happen to him?

418
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:59,327
Gosh, I'm so anxious.

419
00:45:07,775 --> 00:45:09,617
Joon Oh!

420
00:45:19,429 --> 00:45:21,170
Tell me.

421
00:45:22,355 --> 00:45:25,639
Why do I have to save you?

422
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,286
Tell me!

423
00:45:27,286 --> 00:45:29,235
Just let go.

424
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:37,469
Live.

425
00:45:40,934 --> 00:45:42,797
Just let go.

426
00:45:44,045 --> 00:45:48,483
Don't let go... Live!

427
00:45:49,748 --> 00:45:52,286
You really don't listen, do you?

428
00:45:59,327 --> 00:46:01,568
Hold on!

429
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:10,469
<i>Hold on!</i>

430
00:46:19,373 --> 00:46:22,878
<i>Do you think I'll fail without you? Huh?</i>

431
00:46:40,496 --> 00:46:43,887
No!

432
00:47:04,782 --> 00:47:06,489
Ki Joon.

433
00:47:06,489 --> 00:47:09,222
He's not there. He wasn't where
Journalist Kim told me to check.

434
00:47:09,222 --> 00:47:12,619
- He wasn't there?
- I'll check the woods.

435
00:47:12,619 --> 00:47:15,360
No, don't do that. Sit.
It's dangerous out there.

436
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,811
Geez!

437
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:19,943
What took so long?

438
00:47:36,474 --> 00:47:38,288
Secretary Tae.

439
00:47:44,273 --> 00:47:47,512
Why are you searching someone
else's car? Should I report this or what?

440
00:47:47,512 --> 00:47:48,809
Oh, Prosecutor Yoon.

441
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:51,788
- You know where Choi Tae Ho is, right?
- Pardon?

442
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:55,039
- Where is he right now?
- Why are you looking for Tae Ho?

443
00:47:59,606 --> 00:48:01,795
Where is Tae Ho right now?

444
00:48:04,338 --> 00:48:07,429
He's scheduled to work right now.

445
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:10,849
Is there a problem?

446
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:21,735
Secretary Tae. Are you okay?

447
00:48:23,677 --> 00:48:26,402
Where were you?
I looked everywhere for you.

448
00:48:26,402 --> 00:48:28,797
Oh.

449
00:48:28,797 --> 00:48:33,222
A friend. I met with a friend of mine.
I suddenly remembered I had plans.

450
00:48:33,222 --> 00:48:36,614
You met a friend,
right after you went to the bathroom?

451
00:48:42,405 --> 00:48:45,389
I can begin my testimony now, right?

452
00:48:48,831 --> 00:48:53,414
Secretary Tae.
It's true that nothing happened, right?

453
00:48:53,414 --> 00:48:57,219
- Yes.
- Let's begin! Hurry.

454
00:48:57,219 --> 00:49:00,927
Um, please give honest testimony.

455
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:05,277
- Sure.
- Make sure you tell them what you saw.

456
00:49:13,978 --> 00:49:16,393
It's true that Yoon So Hee was murdered.

457
00:49:16,393 --> 00:49:18,119
I saw it.

458
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:21,974
Are you saying you witnessed
the murder yourself?

459
00:49:21,974 --> 00:49:23,728
Yes.

460
00:49:23,728 --> 00:49:29,079
<i>Okay, then. Who murdered Yoon So Hee?</i>

461
00:49:32,476 --> 00:49:34,559
<i>You know already.</i>

462
00:50:02,971 --> 00:50:04,597
<i>Seo Joon Oh.</i>

463
00:50:06,114 --> 00:50:08,177
Choi Tae Ho was right.

464
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,025
He killed her.

465
00:50:11,025 --> 00:50:15,222
No way. This is wrong. This isn't right--

466
00:50:15,222 --> 00:50:18,382
Be quiet! Can't you see
that this is important?

467
00:50:18,382 --> 00:50:20,112
No way.

468
00:50:22,878 --> 00:50:27,302
And, there's something else
I want to say.

469
00:50:31,456 --> 00:50:33,516
He had an accomplice.

470
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:46,221
<i>She knew what Seo Joon Oh was doing,
but she covered it up, and helped him.</i>

471
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:50,014
Who was that person?

472
00:50:50,858 --> 00:50:53,498
<i>All you have to do is tell them
what you saw, okay?</i>

473
00:50:55,233 --> 00:50:57,670
You saw it!

474
00:50:58,552 --> 00:51:00,849
You saw Seo Joon Oh kill her.

475
00:51:02,489 --> 00:51:04,244
What?

476
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:07,224
Ho Hang.

477
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:12,811
This is Seoul.
We're not on a deserted island anymore.

478
00:51:16,686 --> 00:51:21,231
We... saw the same thing, didn't we?

479
00:51:28,713 --> 00:51:32,141
Secretary Tae, what are you saying?

480
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:35,067
That accomplice...

481
00:51:36,597 --> 00:51:38,402
is right here.

482
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:48,891
What are you saying, Secretary Tae?

483
00:51:48,891 --> 00:51:52,103
- Let go! Secretary Tae!
- Ra Bong Hee!

484
00:51:52,827 --> 00:51:57,239
- She was his accomplice.
- Secretary Tae... Secretary Tae!

485
00:52:25,661 --> 00:52:30,146
- Oh, Ki Joon.
- Oh, did you find him? No?

486
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:34,018
Geez, I'm tired.
He's nowhere to be found.

487
00:52:35,226 --> 00:52:37,260
Geez, seriously.

488
00:52:58,077 --> 00:53:01,547
I get scared at night.

489
00:53:09,099 --> 00:53:12,014
No!

490
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:16,278
I...

491
00:53:20,514 --> 00:53:22,862
I should go back, right?

492
00:53:22,862 --> 00:53:26,721
They're all waiting for you.

493
00:53:26,721 --> 00:53:29,257
You can definitely go back.

494
00:53:29,257 --> 00:53:31,822
That's where you're supposed to be.

495
00:53:32,527 --> 00:53:34,721
You have a place there.

496
00:53:38,556 --> 00:53:40,132
Let's go.

497
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,885
- Hey!
- Hey!

498
00:54:02,885 --> 00:54:06,190
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

499
00:54:24,733 --> 00:54:27,039
Are you all right? Huh?

500
00:54:41,306 --> 00:54:43,559
Hey, I'm sorry.

501
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:46,021
I heard everything from Journalist Kim.

502
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:50,505
I was the one who sent you
to convince Jae Hyun.

503
00:54:50,505 --> 00:54:55,684
I made you do what I was supposed to do.
I'm sorry. I have no right to be the CEO.

504
00:55:02,516 --> 00:55:04,175
I...

505
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:11,668
I killed Tae Ho.

506
00:55:17,791 --> 00:55:19,579
I'm sorry.

507
00:55:23,518 --> 00:55:26,070
I couldn't save him.

508
00:55:28,184 --> 00:55:30,414
- Oh...
- I'm sorry.

509
00:55:30,414 --> 00:55:33,418
That's okay, Joon Oh.

510
00:55:33,418 --> 00:55:36,617
Why do I feel like this
when people are dying?

511
00:55:37,585 --> 00:55:39,434
I'm so calm.

512
00:55:40,811 --> 00:55:42,911
I shouldn't be so calm.

513
00:55:44,547 --> 00:55:47,788
My own kids keep dying.

514
00:55:49,873 --> 00:55:51,940
I shouldn't be so calm.

515
00:56:13,327 --> 00:56:14,815
Joon Oh.

516
00:56:20,989 --> 00:56:23,014
Don't blame yourself too much.

517
00:56:23,014 --> 00:56:25,313
We know you didn't do it on purpose.

518
00:56:29,605 --> 00:56:32,480
Hey, you should apply some medicine.

519
00:56:35,356 --> 00:56:41,242
Joon Oh. We don't think
it was your fault.

520
00:56:41,244 --> 00:56:42,987
You know that, right?

521
00:56:46,954 --> 00:56:49,552
Why aren't you answering me?

522
00:56:49,552 --> 00:56:54,003
If you think it's your fault again,
you're dead.

523
00:56:59,797 --> 00:57:01,460
And...

524
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:04,324
I'm sorry.

525
00:57:05,329 --> 00:57:09,179
- For what?
- Just because.

526
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:14,032
I don't think I ever
apologized to you before.

527
00:57:17,262 --> 00:57:20,887
That's why you should
say it more often from now on.

528
00:57:20,887 --> 00:57:25,489
Joon Oh. No matter what happened,
it's more important that you came back.

529
00:57:25,489 --> 00:57:29,704
That's right. You're important to us.
I don't care about anything else.

530
00:57:30,815 --> 00:57:33,847
- Don't say that.
- Why not?

531
00:57:33,847 --> 00:57:36,518
I should. I should say more.

532
00:57:36,518 --> 00:57:39,994
It's not just us,
many other people think...

533
00:57:39,994 --> 00:57:42,398
Jae Hyun died because of you.

534
00:57:42,398 --> 00:57:47,802
Tae Ho didn't just frame you,
he messed up your life.

535
00:57:47,802 --> 00:57:53,286
We should reveal who the murderers are,
and who they killed, don't you think?

536
00:57:54,989 --> 00:57:57,079
We should expose the truth.

537
00:57:58,864 --> 00:58:00,911
I killed Tae Ho.

538
00:58:04,342 --> 00:58:06,355
That's the truth too.

539
00:58:12,478 --> 00:58:16,617
When we... get back...

540
00:58:16,617 --> 00:58:19,137
If we get back...

541
00:58:22,789 --> 00:58:26,346
Help me so that I can get
the punishment I deserve.

542
00:58:28,177 --> 00:58:30,070
That's why none of you...

543
00:58:31,266 --> 00:58:34,449
should do anything for me.

544
00:58:35,706 --> 00:58:38,460
The things that happened here...

545
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,059
The things we saw and heard here...

546
00:58:49,351 --> 00:58:51,753
Let's remember them for what they are.

547
01:00:07,786 --> 01:00:10,001
Geez.

548
01:00:15,554 --> 01:00:17,684
Oh! Secretary Tae!

549
01:00:19,364 --> 01:00:24,713
Um, um... He... Hello? Um...

550
01:00:34,972 --> 01:00:37,018
It's a boat.

551
01:00:37,018 --> 01:00:41,552
It is. They're so lucky.
They get to have fun on a boat.

552
01:00:41,552 --> 01:00:44,172
While we're stuck over here.

553
01:00:44,172 --> 01:00:46,809
Why is the boat coming this way?

554
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:50,465
Why is it coming this way?
I think it's coming to save us!

555
01:00:50,465 --> 01:00:56,014
Wow! They're coming! Wow!

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
<i>A few months ago, the celebrities
of Legend Entertainment...</i>

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,660
<i>Their private plane crashed
and went missing...</i>

4
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:16,900
<i>One survivor has been found.</i>

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,970
<i>She can't remember
anything after the plane crash.</i>

6
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,210
The memory that you can't access
is the only hope we have.

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,800
<i>I told you not to eat that!
We're on a deserted island!</i>

8
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,030
What did you just say?

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,700
<i>Is it because of your sister?
Do you think she's alive?</i>

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,890
Are you okay?

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,840
I will reveal the truth. Helping
the victims in the name of law is my job.

12
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,420
Hey, Yeol. Hey, Yeol!

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:50,340
Have you ever thought that
we might end up dying on this island?

14
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,210
<i>If I tell you everything
I remember in detail...</i>

15
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,880
<i>The people who might be alive or dead...</i>

16
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,770
Will you be able to save them?

17
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:12,410
<i>[Missing Nine]</i>

18
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:16,500
<i>The light from the cellphone...</i>

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,900
<i>The survivor that you, Seo Joon Oh,
and Lee Yeol risked your safety to save.</i>

20
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,930
Who was that person?

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,760
Do you remember?

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,780
You must remember, Ra Bong Hee.
Who was it?

23
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,420
Joon Oh.

24
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,090
Ji Ah!

25
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,040
Who was it, and did that person
live or die on that island?

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,670
Do you... remember that?

27
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,490
That person...

28
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,160
That person...

29
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,400
I definitely...

30
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,760
No! Don't go!

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,640
I definitely saw her...

32
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,400
You saw her. Who was it?

33
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,610
Help me... Save me...

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,720
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,070
Damn it.

36
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,280
Who's there? St... Stay here.

37
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,000
Our safe house has been found.

38
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,370
How the hell did they find us here?

39
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:57,290
Oh! What are you doing? Oh! Ouch!

40
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,160
Please let me go!

41
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,250
Wait! Wait! Just a second!

42
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,580
Are they here to watch?

43
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,120
Duck! Duck!

44
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,120
Let's stay hidden from the reporters.

45
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,450
Why should I? I did nothing wr--

46
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,240
Ra Bong Hee!
Are there any other survivors?

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,960
Ra Bong Hee!

48
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,000
Go! Go! Hey, get out of here!

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,240
Where do you think you are?

50
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,490
Look over here please!

51
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,160
Move! Get out of here!

52
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,600
What is it? What's going on?

53
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,090
What?

54
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,810
- What is this?
- Open it.

55
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,990
All of a sudden?

56
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:04,790
This is your first project,
so I wanted to get you something.

57
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:10,640
- Oh!
- Don't think about losing this one.

58
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,440
Ta-da! Our couple rings!

59
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,290
- What's wrong?
- Tae Young, I should be dating. Take it.

60
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,780
- Why does that matter?
- No.

61
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:24,040
This would suit you right now.
Wear it for the shoot, okay?

62
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,850
Thank you. I'll wear it well!
I'm going now!

63
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,170
<i>He said she was found under a cliff...</i>

64
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,040
<i>But it wasn't the plane crash...</i>

65
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,400
<i>He thinks someone killed her.</i>

66
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,890
Please ask him how long it'll take.

67
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,960
How long will it take? (In Chinese)

68
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,700
We will prepare the car.

69
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,670
He said they'll get the car ready,
and that it'll take a bit.

70
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,020
<i>I'm the president of
Legend Entertainment, Jang Do Pal.</i>

71
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,580
<i>There are rumors going around
that this accident</i>

72
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,570
<i>was fabricated by Legend Entertainment.</i>

73
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,530
<i>Does that make any sense?</i>

74
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,520
Are you okay?

75
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,280
Are you hurt?

76
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:16,010
If the nation finds out about this,
they'll go crazy.

77
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,790
- Okay.
- Excuse me!

78
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,370
Sorry.

79
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,970
Oh, you're here.
We looked everywhere for you.

80
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,220
Oh, sorry.

81
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,010
Um, can you look into
who's in that room?

82
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:48,770
- What is this about?
- It's not a big deal...

83
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,220
But look into it. Please.

84
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,450
Sure.

85
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,940
<i>[Episode 3]</i>

86
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,280
I'll start over from scratch.

87
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:45,080
Oh! I caught it!

88
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,160
I caught it!

89
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,250
We're going to eat you now, okay?

90
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,440
But what am I supposed to do
when you're so cute...

91
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,010
If you don't leave in three seconds,
I'll really eat you.

92
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,760
Or I'll hit you with this stick.
There's no time to think.

93
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,690
I could just catch you like this,
but instead, I waited for hours...

94
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,130
I'm really going to eat you.
Go, or I'll really eat you.

95
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,980
I'll hit you. Really hard.
You'll bleed...

96
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,680
I'll eat you after the count of three.
One, two, three!

97
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,350
Okay, I'm going to eat you.

98
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,160
Hey! You can't even catch that?
All you have to do is scoop it up!

99
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,970
You told me to gather them
so you can fish them out!

100
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,720
You said you did all of this in the navy!

101
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,520
Is that the same thing, you punk?

102
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,550
This is a different country! The water's
different, everything's different!

103
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,490
Geez! Damn it!

104
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,220
I'm sorry. I didn't think it through.

105
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,420
We're abroad, aren't we?

106
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,230
If it weren't for my brother...

107
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,050
If he hadn't saved me
from carbon monoxide poisoning!

108
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,020
- I should have died back then!
- My mom told me to never say that.

109
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,520
My grandmother didn't see a point
in living and wanted to die

110
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,600
but she passed away
while eating rice cakes.

111
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,000
A sticky rice cake. A big one.

112
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,860
Grandmother, are you doing well?

113
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,490
I'm hungry!

114
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,830
I brought food!

115
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,170
- Oh!
- It's meat, isn't it?

116
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,400
It's meat! Meat! You worked hard! Meat!

117
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,990
Meat! It's meat, right? Meat!

118
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,360
I went to catch a rabbit, but there was
a predator. So I brought coconuts.

119
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,800
- Shouldn't you have caught the predator?
- It wasn't as easy as I thought.

120
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,790
Just for today, let's just eat the
coconuts. They're fresh from the tree.

121
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,140
I tried some, and it's pretty good.
Let's just eat these for today.

122
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,830
I want to roast them.

123
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,990
If we roast them,
they might taste like meat.

124
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,460
Let's roast them.

125
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,210
Milk should come out of them.

126
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,650
Geez, it's still a coconut
even after roasting it.

127
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,170
No. It tastes more fishy
after roasting it.

128
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,640
Geez, I'll really catch
a rabbit tomorrow.

129
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,480
You've said "tomorrow" every day
since the day before yesterday!

130
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,300
Geez, let's bear through it.

131
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,990
Everyone's dead, so we should be
thankful to be alive. Let's endure it.

132
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,890
But Ki Joon, do you really think
they're all dead?

133
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,100
We would have seen them
if they were alive.

134
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,100
This island seems pretty big.
Don't you think someone might live here?

135
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,540
Don't be crazy, just eat.
Eat the coconuts.

136
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,080
Hey, don't you smell something roasting?

137
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,400
- We're roasting coconuts.
- Not that. Not that.

138
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,070
You say some weird stuff sometimes
and it scares me...

139
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:41,670
- I smell someone cooking beef.
- Where do you smell...

140
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,290
It smells like someone's cooking beef.

141
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:49,210
Wait, what is this? It smells like the
Korean restaurant next to our company.

142
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,350
Wow, I smell it. It smells so good!

143
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,430
Tae Ho?

144
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,600
- Choi Tae Ho?
- Tae Ho!

145
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,030
You're alive!

146
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,590
You're alive? Tae Ho!

147
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,780
Tae Ho.

148
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,350
Tae Ho!

149
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,200
- Hey, Punk!
- What?

150
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,100
I'm your CEO, you punk!

151
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,280
I heard this from a younger schoolmate
who is now a police officer.

152
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,840
He talked about the missing, Seo Joon Oh.
A member of "Dreamers."

153
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,020
- He has a unique background.
- What is it?

154
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,500
When Shin Jae Hyun died,
he was investigated by the police.

155
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,690
Who's that?

156
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,590
Was it "Dreamers?" He's their frontman.

157
00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:00,160
There was a suicide case. A man
in his 20s, named Shin Jae Hyun.

158
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,650
I think he's being investigated
because of that.

159
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,070
<i>Should I look into it?</i>

160
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,370
- Targeted investigations are boring.
- Oh, okay. I understand.

161
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,730
But, Prosecutor Yoon.
It's probably one of them, right?

162
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,390
Well, we don't know
who's dead and who's alive

163
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:31,280
but of the other people who lived
with your sister on that island...

164
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:37,030
One of those people probably...

165
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:39,720
- killed her?
- Um, yes. Yes.

166
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:45,720
Why are you being so careful? We're
close enough that you can just say it.

167
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,450
But still...

168
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,270
I'm going to take a nap.
Wake me up when we arrive.

169
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,450
Okay.

170
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,200
- You're okay, right?
- What do you mean?

171
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,550
You're smiling...

172
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:07,520
I'm not okay at all.

173
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,760
I'm really angry.

174
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,120
- Well, do you like the tea?
- It's not bad.

175
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,490
I will apologize if our people crossed
the line the other day.

176
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:33,570
Gosh, it was just because
the reporters came in so unexpectedly--

177
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,120
Ra Bong Hee, that girl...

178
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,750
I heard she lost her memory.

179
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,800
Is that why you were holding on
to Ra Bong Hee and keeping her quiet?

180
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,350
Because people would insult you if they
knew the only survivor lost her memory?

181
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,670
No, that's not exactly true--

182
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,400
If I reveal this to everyone,
what do you think will happen?

183
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,560
I think the people
will find this pretty entertaining.

184
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,630
Are you having fun?

185
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,250
I wonder what you find so entertaining.

186
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,220
This situation.

187
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:20,720
Isn't it fun, Chairman Jo?

188
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,080
What's your name?

189
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,550
Seo Dong Min.

190
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,790
Okay, Reporter Seo.

191
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,540
Reporter Seo...

192
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,270
Do you happen to know
what I'm here to do?

193
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,770
Just because I'm the chairwoman
of the special investigation committee

194
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,400
people think finding out the truth
and revealing it to everyone

195
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,390
is my job.

196
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,300
But that's not my job.

197
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,530
My job

198
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,010
is to make the people
forget this as soon as possible.

199
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:06,270
To make them forget about the dead stars
so they can return to their normal lives.

200
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,540
That's my real job.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

201
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,700
I don't know. I'm not really sure.

202
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:15,790
I'm not in this position
to entertain a bastard like you.

203
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,330
If you're going to cross your legs
and laugh like an idiot...

204
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,140
You should do it with matters
that you can handle...

205
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,810
In front of people you can handle.

206
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,600
Look at me closely.

207
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,710
What kind of person do you think I am?

208
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,130
Do you think you can handle me? Do you?

209
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,350
<i>Her condition seems to have improved,
by the looks of her CT.</i>

210
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:02,040
But she still can't remember?

211
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,290
Yes. It seems like her memory
still comes and goes.

212
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,560
<i>If I look at this from a medical point
of view, she should remember.</i>

213
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
She should remember everything.

214
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,400
All signs of
encephalomeningitis are gone.

215
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,340
Is it you?

216
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,890
<i>Then are you saying...</i>

217
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:34,560
Ra Bong Hee remembers everything,
but she's pretending not to?

218
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,220
Is that what you're saying?

219
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,090
Who are you?

220
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,860
I'm... Ha Ji Ah's mother.

221
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:51,570
Did our Ji Ah... survive?

222
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,230
Did she die?

223
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,150
I... I... I'm not sure.

224
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,020
I'm sorry.

225
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:03,390
Don't be like that. Answer me.

226
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,680
Is our Ji Ah alive or dead?

227
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,060
Did you see her body? No, right? Right?

228
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,160
Please let go of me.

229
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,370
Our Ji Ah has to be alive!

230
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,170
If our Ji Ah died...
If she doesn't come back...

231
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,270
Then our entire family
will starve to death!

232
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,080
Why are you doing this? Please let go!

233
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,100
This is what I have to say.

234
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,090
This situation doesn't make any sense
from a medical point of view.

235
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,300
Doctor.

236
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,600
I have a favor to ask you.

237
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,390
Please keep this a secret
from Chairman Jo--

238
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,450
<i>- Let go!
- I'm sure you saw. Why don't you know?</i>

239
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,740
You're tricking me, aren't you.
Did you do something to her?

240
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,300
- Did you do something?
- I don't know!

241
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,870
- What are you doing? Move!
- Let go. Let go!

242
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,770
Please stop this! Let's go.

243
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,130
I know what you guys are up to!

244
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:58,100
I'll find out the truth! And...

245
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:02,100
I'll find our Ji Ah myself!

246
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:06,210
Instead of finding
a useless person like you...

247
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,170
Our Ji Ah...
The Ji Ah that everyone loves...

248
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:14,460
I'll... I'll find her, you bastards!

249
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,900
- Ji Ah...
- Let's go.

250
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,130
- They're coming out!
- They're coming out!

251
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,020
Geez, why are they here again?
Get out of here!

252
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,250
Let's go.

253
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,740
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

254
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,800
Ra Bong Hee?

255
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,070
Jae Hyun.

256
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,510
So Hee.

257
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,310
Do you... trust people?

258
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,110
Don't trust anyone.

259
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,930
You'll be abandoned.

260
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,930
Just like me.

261
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,790
Here. Have some.

262
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,250
What is this?

263
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,170
It smells bad, but it tastes okay.
There's more over there. Help yourself.

264
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,330
Isn't it good?

265
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:20,050
It's not good enough to want more.

266
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,880
This wench must not be so hungry...

267
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:28,980
We're probably the only people
who survived, right?

268
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,100
- You're worried about Tae Ho, right?
- I should worry. He's my boyfriend.

269
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,640
Ji Ah.

270
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:39,160
I'm not saying this
to comfort you, but...

271
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,900
Tae Ho is probably alive.

272
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,450
We found Yeol.

273
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:50,170
Figures. I thought you were dead too.

274
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:54,290
How can you say that so easily--

275
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,900
What a load of bullshit.
Did you think I was alive?

276
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,520
I got it, you wench.

277
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,490
Hey, your fans know
how rude you are, right?

278
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,920
Of course. Are you kidding? They always
ask me to curse when they see me.

279
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,460
They think it's sexy.

280
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:14,000
Anyway, be careful not to get hurt.
If Ki Joon finds out you're hurt...

281
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,490
Do you think...

282
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:21,260
Ki Joon is alive?

283
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,800
Let's hope he is.

284
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,680
Yeah. Let's hope he is.

285
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,360
Until we see Ki Joon and Tae Ho again...

286
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,450
Take care of yourself.
You don't have your medicine.

287
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,130
What are you two doing?

288
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,460
Oh.

289
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,030
You're smiling?

290
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,830
Can you smile
when we're all about to die here?

291
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,450
Um... Then, should I cry?

292
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,730
You must be relaxed
if you can joke around like that.

293
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:54,780
Hey.

294
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,360
I guess you already
forgot about Jae Hyun.

295
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,940
Hey, Yoon So Hee. How can you say that?

296
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,280
So Hee. I still remember Jae Hyun.

297
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,060
I haven't forgotten him for
a single moment. I don't want to, either.

298
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,000
You can't forget.

299
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:13,170
You're the one who killed Jae Hyun.

300
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,120
You could kill someone else.

301
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,010
Since this is a deserted island.

302
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:24,840
You can joke and get along right now
because we have the food and resources.

303
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,900
But what happens when we run out?

304
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:31,500
What happens when it's cold, we have no
food, and it's hard to survive ourselves?

305
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,310
- Hey.
- Do you think you'll be smiling then?

306
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:38,140
- Yoon So Hee.
- People kill others so they can live.

307
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,180
I saw it all.

308
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,650
What the hell did you see?

309
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:09,770
You're going to die anyway...
You'll die anyway...

310
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:17,040
You've done it once before.

311
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:20,000
Hey, since we found the others,
fish is good...

312
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,100
But shouldn't we feed them something?
Like tuna...

313
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,780
Fried eggs might be difficult...

314
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,890
We should just feed them fish.

315
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,890
Hey, be careful!

316
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,440
So Hee! Don't go any further! It's deep!

317
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,560
- What's with her?
- So Hee! What are you doing?

318
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,180
Joon Oh. Joon Oh. Joon Oh.
So Hee's acting strange.

319
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,410
- So Hee!
- Hey!

320
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,660
Joon Oh!

321
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,540
Hey, Yoon So Hee!

322
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:51,360
So Hee! So Hee!

323
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,930
Hey!

324
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,160
Hey!

325
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
???

326
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,910
Let go. Let go! Let go!

327
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,730
Come out!

328
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:14,480
- Is it good?
- It's so good.

329
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,690
It's so good, I'm tearing up.

330
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,150
I wanted to eat fish so badly,
so we were over there...

331
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:25,580
Wow, seriously. How long
has it been since we ate fish?

332
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,750
If I'm on a deserted island with you,
I think I can live!

333
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:33,500
You're good at acting. You're good
at singing. You're good at everything!

334
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,810
Eat lots, CEO Hwang. I'll catch
a bigger one for you tomorrow.

335
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,470
Manager Jung, aren't you eating?

336
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:44,210
Did you lose your appetite after all the
coconuts? Eat! You have to eat to live!

337
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:46,100
Try some.

338
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,420
CEO Hwang, I've been thinking...

339
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,150
And I think we should head out
to find the kids.

340
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,590
- Let go!
- Come on! So Hee! Please!

341
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,950
Let go!

342
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,650
Why are you doing this? I want to die
because I don't want to live anymore.

343
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:13,300
You're acting crazy! So Hee, please!

344
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,600
I'm going to die. I'm going to die...

345
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,970
We're going to die here anyway!

346
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,810
Whether we starve or someone kills us,
we're going to die here anyway!

347
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,760
Who's going to kill you, huh?

348
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,920
Who said they were going to kill you?

349
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,840
Don't scream! You're scaring her!

350
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,630
That's because
she's not making any sense!

351
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,700
So Hee. We're... all in the same boat.

352
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,700
If we live, we'll live together,
and if we die--

353
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,520
No. We're not going to die. We won't die.

354
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,370
We're going to survive and get out
of here. We really will, okay?

355
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,790
I told you I saw it...

356
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,100
We're all going to die here.

357
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,290
They'll kill for their own survival...

358
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:59,080
What did you see? Yoon So Hee,
what did you see? Huh?

359
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,450
Joon Oh!

360
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:16,760
Hey. Hey, what's wrong with her? Huh?

361
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,600
I think she was cut by sea moss.

362
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,150
What do we do? Ji Ah, are you okay?

363
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,980
- Let's see. Let's see.
- Hey, it's nothing--

364
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,370
Let me see! It won't stop bleeding!

365
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,240
Ji Ah, where's your medicine?
Where's the medicine Ki Joon gave you?

366
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,590
- Ji Ah.
- Yeah?

367
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,960
Don't take too many at once.

368
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,710
I don't have it.
I lost it in the plane crash.

369
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:45,820
What? Why won't the bleeding stop?

370
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,450
Ji Ah, are you sick?

371
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,370
Don't look at me like that.
It's not fatal.

372
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:53,100
What do you mean you won't die?
You'll die if you bleed out!

373
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,100
You stubborn jerk.

374
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:58,560
Why did you wear a short skirt?
You can't even swim, so why did you go?

375
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,860
What are you going to do, huh?

376
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,360
What do we... Hey. Hey, is there
anything that stops bleeding?

377
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,800
Pardon?

378
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,420
How would I know that? I'm a stylist.

379
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,840
Geez, what do we do...

380
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,570
Geez...

381
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,970
<i>We can't do that.</i>

382
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,370
We should stay here
and wait to be rescued.

383
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:25,500
We're not even sure if they're alive.

384
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,020
You want to stay here
by yourself?

385
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:30,110
No. We should all stay here.

386
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:34,220
It's obvious they're dead,
so why should we suffer for them?

387
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,740
- They could still be alive.
- They're all dead.

388
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:41,320
It's been a week since the crash.
How could anyone be alive?

389
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,900
You're alive. We miraculously
survived too. So why not anyone else?

390
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,650
Aren't you worried about your girlfriend?
You're not worried about Ji Ah?

391
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:58,260
Are you dating Ji Ah? Since when?

392
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,920
It hasn't been long. Around three months.

393
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,130
The duration doesn't matter.
You're dating her because you love her.

394
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,640
Dating doesn't necessarily mean love.

395
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,550
Do you even know that Ji Ah is sick?

396
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:14,130
Ji Ah's sick? Why don't I know anything
about what happens in my own company?

397
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,690
Ji Ah! Ji Ah!

398
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:24,090
Ji Ah's medicine.
Ji Ah doesn't have her medicine.

399
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,830
Damn it!

400
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,970
Ji Ah will die without her medicine.
Ji Ah... needs her medicine to live.

401
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:35,340
I have a few more bottles in my bag,
so I'll go now!

402
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,160
Don't do this.
I feel like a real patient.

403
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,540
It's not your fault that you're sick.

404
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,350
But it's wrong if you to hide it.

405
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,850
Okay, keep talking.

406
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:55,850
When I was young, I got injured
while hiking with my grandmother.

407
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,560
And my grandmother stopped
the bleeding with some kind of grass.

408
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,550
What grass? What kind of grass?

409
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,840
I don't remember the name.
But I might recognize it if I see it.

410
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,200
Do you think...
we can find it in the forest?

411
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,680
We can only hope.

412
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,100
We need to find it. We should try.
Okay? Get ready. Let's go.

413
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:18,310
I'll come with you! Three is better
than two. I'm coming too.

414
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,930
Stay here.

415
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,300
So Hee, I'm sure you understand
our current situation.

416
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,750
We have to go into the woods.

417
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:38,870
That means it'll just be
you and Ji Ah out here.

418
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,880
You have to take care of Ji Ah.

419
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,490
Look at me, okay? Look at me.

420
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:46,900
Answer me. Look at me. Okay?
Answer me!

421
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:50,630
Hey, Yoon So Hee.

422
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,770
No! No...

423
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,420
No...

424
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,370
You...

425
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,200
You killed him...

426
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,280
Hey, are you the only one?
Are you the only one suffering?

427
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,320
I'm having a hard time too!
It's so difficult, I could die!

428
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,280
What can we do?
She got hurt while trying to save you!

429
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,910
You should take responsibility!
What if we can't stop the bleeding?

430
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:39,970
Yoon So Hee, look at me.
Look at me, and talk!

431
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,720
Answer me!

432
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,420
I'll talk to her.
Stay out of this, Seo Joon Oh.

433
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,300
So Hee, you understand
what's going on, right?

434
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,500
We have to go into the woods.

435
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,870
We have to find medicine
to stop Ji Ah's bleeding.

436
00:34:55,870 --> 00:35:00,250
While we look for the medicine,
we need you to take care of her.

437
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,990
Can you do that for us?

438
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,600
<i>If we give up, Ji Ah will die.</i>

439
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,860
<i>You don't want her to die either, right?</i>

440
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:15,290
<i>We're...</i>

441
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:18,050
<i>going to die here anyway.</i>

442
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,910
This is a deserted island.

443
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,320
You're right.

444
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,830
Honestly, we could die here. We might
not get rescued and end up dying.

445
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,880
But...

446
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,710
I'm going to live.

447
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,400
<i>I won't lose hope and give up,
and I won't run away out of fear.</i>

448
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,280
<i>I'm going to live until the end! I will
struggle until I crack all of my nails.</i>

449
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,660
<i>And if that's still not good enough...</i>

450
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,690
Then I will die.

451
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,420
That's why, So Hee...

452
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,840
Let's clench our fists
and push through it together.

453
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,810
Let's trust each other,
and protect each other, okay?

454
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:07,380
Who are you?
Why isn't Chairman Jo coming...

455
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,180
Oh, she won't be coming.

456
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:14,620
I'm Prosecutor Yoon Tae Young of
the western district prosecutor's office.

457
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:18,240
I'm also Yoon So Hee's older brother.

458
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,330
Do you trust people?

459
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:31,220
I have to. It's lonely if I don't.

460
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,400
You can go, then.

461
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,780
Thank you, So Hee. I believe in you.

462
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,770
Wait!

463
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:49,150
Why is Yoon So Hee's older brother

464
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,530
looking for me...

465
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,050
My sister...

466
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:00,380
died. To be more exact...

467
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,860
She was murdered on that island.

468
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,740
I had a necklace my brother gave me.

469
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,300
He gave it to me as a present
when I got my first pay check.

470
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,810
But I lost it in the woods.

471
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,750
If you happen to see it...

472
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,960
Can you bring it back for me?

473
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,540
Sure. I'll do that.

474
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,100
The necklace
that you're wearing right now...

475
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:39,060
That's the necklace
I gave to my sister as a present.

476
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,790
Judging from the fact that
you're wearing my sister's necklace...

477
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:53,330
I'm guessing you had
a special relationship on that island.

478
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:59,750
Do you remember who it was...

479
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,260
who killed my sister?

480
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:09,380
<i>She was my one and only younger sister...</i>

481
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:12,420
<i>And I haven't done much for her
as her older brother.</i>

482
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:15,440
<i>She was the kind of girl,
who needed a lot more</i>

483
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,620
than I was able to give her.

484
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,060
<i>Our So Hee...</i>

485
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,540
That's why, Bong Hee...

486
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,580
It must be hard for you...

487
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:32,390
It must be hard to remember...

488
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:37,380
But do you think
you can trust me and follow me?

489
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,220
I will help you.

490
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,840
I'll help you recover your memory.

491
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,680
- Is this it?
- No. No.

492
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,320
- Hey, give us more details!
- It looked like this.

493
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,440
- It was really tall.
- How tall?

494
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,010
- This isn't it?
- It wasn't this wide.

495
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,330
- You said there were fruit.
- No, not fruit...

496
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:13,860
- Hey, how long was it, then?
- It was really long.

497
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,960
- It's long?
- It's sharp.

498
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:18,170
- Long and sharp?
- What's long and sharp around here?

499
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:20,550
- What else? What color?
- It looks like a saw.

500
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,590
A saw?

501
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:25,400
Manager Jung, are we going the right way?

502
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,180
I don't know. We should just keep going.

503
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,820
- Don't you think we strayed too much?
- No.

504
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,370
Joon Oh!

505
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,940
Hey!

506
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:53,200
Hey, it looks like
it's going to keep raining.

507
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,660
Let's find it quickly and go back.

508
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,740
Yeol, I can't picture it with words.

509
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,190
- Draw it for us. That'll be quicker.
- Hey, yeah. Draw it.

510
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,730
Okay, look. This is the grass.

511
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:05,300
The grass looks like a saw.

512
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,650
I don't know if it's a fruit or flower,
but it looks like a sea squirt.

513
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,200
- Sea squirt?
- Sea squirt?

514
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,370
"Sea squirt..."

515
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,870
You're using the wrong vowel.

516
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:17,880
"Sea... sea... squirt."

517
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,180
The words "sea" and "squirt"
share the same vowels.

518
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,680
We're talking about the seafood.

519
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,760
Like the sea creature!
It's a homophone for "arf" and "dog."

520
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,120
He used the right vowel. He's right.

521
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,170
- Really?
- Anyway, you get the idea, right?

522
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:33,060
Let's split up to look for it.

523
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,800
Hey, do you really understand?
Am I the weird one here?

524
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,050
Just look for a sea squirt
and a saw combined.

525
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,740
That will be faster.

526
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,730
Ji Ah!

527
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,260
Joon Oh!

528
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,420
Manager Jung. Manager Jung.

529
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:54,290
It's raining too much.
Let's come back when it stops.

530
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,900
It hasn't been long since we departed...

531
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:01,700
If you're leaving, go by yourself.
I want to keep searching.

532
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,290
- Hey, how do we go back--
- Ji Ah!

533
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,130
We don't know the way back!

534
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,290
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Ji Ah!

535
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,390
If we get lost without food,
we'll be doomed!

536
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,400
- Are we going back to get the fish?
- Yeah, let's go. Let's go.

537
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,400
- Do you only think about food?
- Let's go. Hurry up!

538
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,600
Why did we come out in the first place?

539
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,340
Just do what I say, you punk!

540
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:24,960
- Ji Ah!
- Hurry! Hurry!

541
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,840
Is this it?

542
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,450
Hey, what is a saw and a sea squirt?

543
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:48,470
A sea squirt and a saw?

544
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,060
I'm sorry.

545
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,240
Ji Ah!

546
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:38,840
Oh! That scared me! That scared me!
That scared me! That scared me so much!

547
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:42,740
Wow, that scared me!
Wow, that scared me! Hey!

548
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,470
You scared me!

549
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:47,030
You scared the shit out of me!

550
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:50,680
You did that on purpose
didn't you? You...

551
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:55,980
Hey, I'm busy right now. Tomorrow...
Tomorrow, I'll really... You scared me!

552
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,880
Joon Oh! Bong Hee!

553
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,400
- There's a boulder!
- A boulder!

554
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,050
There's a boulder here! Joon Oh!

555
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:39,410
Geez, these things are always hiding
in places like this.

556
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,830
Did I step on one?

557
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,760
This sounds weird.

558
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:21,920
This is a landmine...

559
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,980
- Seo Joon Oh! Seo Joon Oh!
- This landmine...

560
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:28,290
Did you find it?
We have to pick it and go!

561
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,910
I found the plant, but...

562
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:34,030
Don't babble nonsense and tell me
where it is! We have to find it and go!

563
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,650
We found it, but I stepped on a mine...

564
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,570
Why does it matter if you stepped
on a centipede? Where's the plant?

565
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:41,950
Not a centipede. I stepped on a mine--

566
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:43,790
Of course there are centipedes
on the ground!

567
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:46,400
Not a centipede!
I stepped on a mine! A landmine!

568
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,780
It'll blow us up! There's no centipede.
I said I stepped on a mine...

569
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,620
Why is there a landmine here?

570
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,760
You... You stepped on...

571
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,970
- You're crazy! You're crazy!
- Seriously!

572
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:00,200
- Take your foot off!
- Wait! Hey! Hey!

573
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,310
- You can't handle this alone!
- No, the thing is...

574
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,660
- I can't take my foot off of it!
- I'll do it for you!

575
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,490
Why would you? Wait! Wait!

576
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:12,200
It's not something you should touch!
Wow, seriously.

577
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,940
I mean, why is there... Hey.

578
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:16,550
Geez.

579
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,040
Hey. Hey, are we going the right way?

580
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,170
We're going the right way. Follow me.

581
00:45:23,170 --> 00:45:25,900
Hey, I didn't see this tree earlier!

582
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,530
Geez, I'm right, CEO Hwang!
Just follow me.

583
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:31,080
I'm good with directions!

584
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,990
Why do you keep blabbing away?
Let's hurry up and go!

585
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:38,090
- A sn...
- Pardon?

586
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,840
A sn...

587
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,360
You're hungry again? Yes, I'm hungry too.

588
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,360
That's why we're going
where the fish are, okay?

589
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,440
So stop please complaining!
Are you a three-year-old?

590
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,570
- A snake!
- Pardon?

591
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:54,180
It's... a... snake...

592
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,360
Go on without me.

593
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:07,580
Where would I go without you?

594
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,300
Go back and take care of Ji Ah.

595
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,940
I think the plant we're looking for
is that one, so take it and go.

596
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:17,440
Um... Then what about you?

597
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,070
Go back and save Ji Ah.
I'll take care of this myself.

598
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,480
Hurry up.

599
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,170
Hurry!

600
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,390
I never even imagined this...

601
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:44,560
Wow, I can't take my foot off--

602
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,300
Seo Joon Oh, I'll be back.
Just be patient. Okay?

603
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,100
Okay.

604
00:46:52,130 --> 00:46:54,530
- Hurry up and go.
- Okay.

605
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,840
Hurry up and go!

606
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,940
I'll go now.

607
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:04,680
Go!

608
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,360
She left so quickly.

609
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,870
She only contemplated things
for 10 seconds.

610
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:20,350
I just... had to grab it and go.

611
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:23,840
What did I do that was so wrong?
After the plane crash...

612
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,190
After all I did to survive!

613
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:30,150
My legs hurt! Wow!
Geez, I thought I took my foot off...

614
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,530
Why is this in the middle of nowhere?

615
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:34,990
I was wrong.

616
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:37,170
If I think about it carefully...

617
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:40,620
I should have caught the octopus!
The octopus! The octopus!

618
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:45,050
I didn't appreciate the work
that was given to me...

619
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:50,050
Ji Ah!

620
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,050
Joon Oh!

621
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:58,160
Yeol!

622
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:27,370
Oh!

623
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:28,460
What do we do?

624
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,770
I'm hurt. You should go without me.

625
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:35,850
If you go that way, you'll find the tree.

626
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:38,210
- Go.
- What are you saying, you punk?

627
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:42,330
I'll... I'll save you!
Just like how you saved me!

628
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,660
I'll save you, you punk.

629
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:51,580
Hold on.

630
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:55,720
I told you to go.

631
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:07,420
Who are you? Are you a native?

632
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,490
Are you really a native?

633
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:15,590
Wow! Hey!

634
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:18,950
Hey, this isn't a deserted island!
People live here!

635
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,690
CEO Hwang, follow her. Go...

636
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:25,790
- and live.
- What are you saying, you punk?

637
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:27,650
We're going together!

638
00:49:27,650 --> 00:49:30,740
Miss, he...

639
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:32,870
Oh, I'm speaking Korean.

640
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:37,590
Snake! Snake! Snake!

641
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:42,030
The poison is... Okay?

642
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:45,290
Yes, so you're saying a snake bit
his chest and it's spreading.

643
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:48,230
Yeah! Wow, she understands!

644
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,050
You speak Korean really well.

645
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,670
Are you an overseas Korean
or an international student?

646
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:58,650
Oh. Hello, CEO Hwang. I'm Seo Joon Oh's
new stylist, Ra Bong Hee.

647
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,190
A stylist?

648
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:08,670
I have to take a dump.

649
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:16,270
Geez, I have to take a dump.

650
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:21,090
How should I do it?
I should reposition myself.

651
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,640
Joon Oh?

652
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,980
Ki Joon!

653
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:43,600
- Joon Oh!
- Ki Joon!

654
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,450
Joon Oh!

655
00:50:45,450 --> 00:50:48,420
- Joon Oh. Joon Oh!
- No. Wait!

656
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:51,750
You're alive!
You're alive! You're alive!

657
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,420
- No, wait. Seriously!
- You're alive!

658
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:58,490
- You're alive! You're alive...
- Ki Joon, are you okay? What happened?

659
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:00,400
- I thought you were dead!
- What happened?

660
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,200
You're alive!

661
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:06,680
Joon Oh's alive!

662
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,170
Where were you?

663
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:11,320
- I stepped on a mine!
- Good job.

664
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,200
- A mine. I stepped on a mine.
- What?

665
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,960
- A mine.
- What?

666
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,500
A mine.

667
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:23,540
Help me. My legs feel numb
and I have to take a dump.

668
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,680
What did you step on?

669
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,010
I stepped on a mine.

670
00:51:28,010 --> 00:51:29,760
- Where are you going?
- Did you poop?

671
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:33,450
No, not yet. I can't move...

672
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:36,680
- Isn't that your poop?
- No, that's mud.

673
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,450
- What are you doing?
- Just stay still! I'll do it!

674
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:03,800
No! Don't! What are you doing?

675
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,690
- Joon Oh, this is a mine.
- I told you it was!

676
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:11,960
- I'm so upset...
- I have to poop but I'm on a mine!

677
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,190
Wait! Wait! Wait! Hey, you can't do that!

678
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:18,350
Don't make me move! Don't make
me move! Don't make me move!

679
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:20,440
Stop talking! I'm trying
to handle this! Stay still.

680
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,660
- I didn't move.
- Don't move! Don't move!

681
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:25,660
Wait, no...

682
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,650
What?

683
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:33,200
- It's a mine.
- Geez, I told you it was!

684
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,320
Please hold on! We're almost there!

685
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:38,480
Even if we get there, can we do anything?

686
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,670
Yes, we can remove
the poison with a knife

687
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:44,510
and use fire to stop the bleeding.

688
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:50,070
You should just be a stylist.
Why are you talking about this so easily?

689
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:54,070
It's no use. I was bitten near my chest.
It'll spread quickly.

690
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:56,940
It's over for me. Go on without me.

691
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,610
What are you saying?
I told you I'm going to save you!

692
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,920
Wait, this punk...

693
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,460
It's been long enough for the poison to
have spread already. Why are you okay?

694
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,170
Her condition seems worse than yours!

695
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:11,650
I'm a hopeless cause. Go on without me.

696
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:13,980
That's the right thing to do...

697
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:21,470
Why?

698
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:22,660
What is it?

699
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:26,170
Joon Oh, I specialized in this
in the navy.

700
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,580
This landmine is really old!

701
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,890
It's older than 70 or 80 years!

702
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:33,350
Okay, I'm ready.
Tell me what it is. What is it?

703
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:34,680
- Take your feet off.
- Damn it!

704
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,280
There's higher possibility
it won't explode, so...

705
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,360
This man must be crazy! Who would
do that after stepping on a mine?

706
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,170
- Hey, I was a soldier--
- How would you know about mines?

707
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:47,440
It's 70 or 80 percent likely
that it won't explode!

708
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,260
That leaves 20 to 30 percent!
What if it explodes?

709
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:54,140
You'll probably get hurt.

710
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:57,600
You probably will.
You'll bleed a lot too.

711
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,190
Probably, right?

712
00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:00,560
It'll probably hurt a lot.

713
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:03,140
Just because this isn't your problem...

714
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:07,350
Well, then...
Try your best to dismantle it.

715
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:09,190
Joon Oh...

716
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:11,570
A soldier doesn't
know how to dismantle a mine.

717
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:15,600
Just try your best! I was able to do
everything when I was a soldier.

718
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,710
You're really strange.

719
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:21,590
Anyway, since I was a soldier,
I'll try my best to dismantle it.

720
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:24,280
When I count to three,
we'll switch, and you can run away. Okay?

721
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:28,490
Then you have to make it clear when
you count to three. Not "one... two..."

722
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:30,790
But count like--
Hey, don't do it so carelessly!

723
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:33,180
You should run after "three,"
who runs after "two?"

724
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:35,520
Everyone does that!

725
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:39,760
- You're trying to push me off again.
- No, I'm exhausted.

726
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,970
- Ki Joon, is this shampoo?
- Hey, is this the time for that?

727
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:46,830
- This is shampoo...
- Why are you so strange?

728
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:50,710
I don't know how I worked
with you for all these years.

729
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:03,490
- Ki Joon.
- What?

730
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:06,130
- Ki Joon.
- Hey, what is it?

731
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,680
This is Ji Ah's, isn't it?

732
00:55:09,490 --> 00:55:12,750
- Yeah.
- This isn't the time to be helping me.

733
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,210
If you go that way, you'll see the beach.
When you see the beach--

734
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:22,480
When you see it, you'll see
the shelter I made! Ji Ah is in there!

735
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,200
Give her the medicine! Okay, Ki Joon?

736
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:44,070
Ji Ah!

737
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,880
Please... Ji Ah!

738
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:54,920
Wait... Ji Ah!

739
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:58,370
So Hee, are you okay?

740
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,590
CEO Hwang, please help!

741
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:12,080
Oh, wait.

742
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:17,480
Wait, Ji Ah... Help Ji Ah...

743
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,690
Wait... Ji... Ji Ah!

744
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:21,340
Ji Ah, come here!

745
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,690
No! Here we go...

746
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,550
What... What's wrong with her?

747
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:41,000
I'll take care of Ji Ah.
Please help him over there.

748
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,860
Oh, shit.

749
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:49,080
- Get up. Get up.
- CEO Hwang. It's over for me.

750
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:52,470
- Go on without me.
- Stop saying that, you son of a bitch!

751
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:53,710
Get up!

752
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:05,010
No... No!

753
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,470
So Hee! Please hold this for me!

754
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:32,850
No! Wait!

755
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:12,210
- Ki Joon, what are you doing?
- Tae Ho!

756
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:17,910
They're alive. They're alive.
Joon Oh and Ji Ah are alive.

757
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,800
- So Hee!
- So Hee!

758
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,290
So Hee! No!

759
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:37,810
So Hee! Hey! Hey!

760
00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:41,290
- So Hee, are you okay?
- So Hee, what's wrong?

761
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:42,840
What do we do?

762
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:47,470
Hey, come over here! Tae Ho, come here!

763
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:48,740
Ji Ah!

764
00:58:49,270 --> 00:58:53,790
Ji Ah! Ji Ah. Ji Ah Ji Ah.

765
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:57,590
Hey, over here. So Hee, are you okay?

766
00:58:57,590 --> 00:58:59,210
Are you okay?

767
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:17,420
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

768
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,500
Are you okay?

769
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,890
When did this start?

770
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:43,950
What's wrong with Ji Ah? Ji Ah. Ha Ji Ah!

771
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:05,670
Hey, you seem to be fine!
How many fingers?

772
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:06,670
Three...

773
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:11,000
You're okay! Ji Ah and So Hee
are in trouble! Get up! Okay?

774
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,410
I...

775
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:20,290
Bong Hee, I'll take care of Ji Ah.
Can you look after So Hee?

776
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:21,530
Sure.

777
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,230
- Ji Ah!
- So Hee, are you okay?

778
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:36,480
Ji Ah, open your mouth.
Ji Ah, open. Open. Open.

779
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:38,040
Just take one. Okay.

780
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:40,460
Okay, here.

781
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:48,960
<i>Thank you for saving me.</i>

782
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,180
<i>You would have done the same for me.</i>

783
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:55,800
But I'm still thankful.
I won't forget it.

784
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:59,650
Don't forget it. Cherish this memory.

785
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:08,070
- I'll be back!
- Where are you going?

786
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:10,130
Hey! Where are you going?

787
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:15,730
Oh, how refreshing.

788
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:21,310
Is it fall already?

789
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,680
<i>The necklace belongs to...</i>

790
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:43,030
They found the island...
that you were on.

1
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:55,877
Counselor! I've got him!

2
00:02:58,557 --> 00:03:03,085
Down! You come down!

3
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:11,466
Down for good!

4
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,339
Forgive this early intrusion.

5
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:19,903
How are you?

6
00:03:20,412 --> 00:03:23,506
I am a great admirer of yours.
Honored to meet you.

7
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:25,316
May l?

8
00:03:26,418 --> 00:03:29,251
Can I use your typewriter, sir?

9
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:33,352
Your arm, please. Relax it.

10
00:03:33,926 --> 00:03:38,158
- Your age?
- 43.

11
00:03:39,932 --> 00:03:41,729
So, what are you cooking up?

12
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:44,132
Another film without hope?

13
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:46,294
- First time taking the cure?
- Yes.

14
00:03:49,374 --> 00:03:50,466
Take a deep breath.

15
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:53,133
Come in.

16
00:03:55,114 --> 00:03:58,208
- I'm sorry. I'll come back later.
- No, do come in.

17
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,674
Breathe in.

18
00:04:02,354 --> 00:04:03,321
Deeper.

19
00:04:05,624 --> 00:04:08,525
Good morning... May I smoke?

20
00:04:12,764 --> 00:04:14,026
Cough.

21
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:17,333
Breathe in.

22
00:04:19,338 --> 00:04:21,431
- You've already read it?
- Yes.

23
00:04:22,674 --> 00:04:23,766
Breathe.

24
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:28,045
And... what do you think?

25
00:04:30,048 --> 00:04:33,609
Well, I made some notes,
but we'll talk later.

26
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:38,448
Your system is a bit worn out.
You may get dressed now.

27
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:42,683
Nice looking girl. American, right?

28
00:04:43,262 --> 00:04:45,287
You've got some fine merchandise there.

29
00:04:45,464 --> 00:04:47,261
This treatment will do you good,
you'll see.

30
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:51,503
Nurse. 300 ml of holy water,

31
00:04:51,637 --> 00:04:57,405
3 doses to be taken at 1 5 minute intervals,
on an empty stomach.

32
00:04:57,543 --> 00:05:01,001
- Mud bath every other day...
- What time is it?

33
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,273
After the mud bath, ten minutes in the
mineral water as prescribed...

34
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:09,181
- I'll wait for you at the spring.
- Yes, thank you.

35
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:23,038
Sir!

36
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:25,278
Sir, your glass.

37
00:08:36,795 --> 00:08:37,762
Over here.

38
00:08:39,297 --> 00:08:41,595
You want to talk about the film?
- Yes, of course.

39
00:08:41,633 --> 00:08:46,297
Fine. Just tell me if you'd like
the producer to see my report.

40
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:49,865
Frankly, I wouldn't want to be
the one to cause you any trouble.

41
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:52,205
No, don't worry.
I'm the one who called you in.

42
00:08:52,577 --> 00:08:54,738
On first reading it's evident

43
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:59,682
that the film lacks a problematic,
or a philosophical premise...

44
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:01,149
Would you like to sit down?

45
00:09:01,219 --> 00:09:05,019
...making the film
a series of gratuitous episodes,

46
00:09:05,557 --> 00:09:09,891
perhaps amusing
for their ambiguous realism.

47
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:13,892
One wonders what the authors
are trying to say...

48
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:16,796
Are they trying to make us think?
To scare us?

49
00:09:17,402 --> 00:09:22,396
From the start, the action reveals
a poverty of poetic inspiration.

50
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,833
Forgive me, but this might be
the definitive proof

51
00:09:26,912 --> 00:09:32,908
that cinema is 50 years
behind all other arts.

52
00:09:32,984 --> 00:09:35,976
The subject doesn't even have the merits

53
00:09:36,021 --> 00:09:40,321
of an 'avant garde' film,
but it has all the shortcomings.

54
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:44,358
Here, my notes.
I doubt they will be helpful.

55
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:50,758
It's still a mystery that you'd think of me

56
00:09:50,836 --> 00:09:54,863
for a collaboration that, frankly,
I don't think can work.

57
00:09:55,307 --> 00:09:58,606
No, no. On the contrary.
You'll be most helpful.

58
00:09:59,478 --> 00:10:04,415
You see, the film...
I really want to make this film.

59
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:07,646
I postponed the shoot
for two weeks because...

60
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:16,085
Mezzabotta! Pardon me.

61
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:22,390
Mezzabotta! Mario!
You're here too?

62
00:10:23,068 --> 00:10:24,228
Guido!

63
00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:30,237
What happened to you!

64
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:33,442
Hey, big Guido, how are you?

65
00:10:33,512 --> 00:10:36,913
You've sprouted quite a few
white hairs, old Snaporaz!

66
00:10:37,349 --> 00:10:39,510
Are you drinking that stuff?
It's bad for you.

67
00:10:39,684 --> 00:10:43,848
They said my liver is, well...
And you, what's your treatment?

68
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:48,793
Just a second... Gloria!

69
00:10:49,227 --> 00:10:53,596
- Your daughter. She's all grown up.
- No, she's not my daughter.

70
00:10:54,866 --> 00:10:59,269
Cruel bees, sucking all the life
from these poor flowers.

71
00:10:59,938 --> 00:11:03,931
- Darling, this is my friend...
- I'm sorry. My shoes...

72
00:11:04,943 --> 00:11:07,275
Gloria. Gloria Morin.
- Nice to meet you.

73
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,347
Fine, thank you.

74
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:13,241
I know all about you.
Pupi always, always tells me.

75
00:11:13,818 --> 00:11:17,777
We even had a big fight
when I was very critical of your last film.

76
00:11:17,956 --> 00:11:19,719
That's not true. You liked it a lot.

77
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,623
Let's go for a drink. Let's go.

78
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,060
And you, are you here alone?
And your wife?

79
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:29,532
- Yes, I'm alone.
- Better that way...

80
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:32,028
Well, I mean, better in general...

81
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:35,605
You heard about Tina and me?
- Tina?

82
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,305
We're waiting for an annulment.

83
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,470
That's why we're here together.
We're engaged.

84
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:44,074
Congratulations.

85
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:47,315
Well, big Guido. What are you
working on? Something good?

86
00:11:47,652 --> 00:11:49,882
Sure is the ideal place to do some thinking.

87
00:11:49,955 --> 00:11:52,583
Daumier, the author, Miss...
Pardon me, what is your name?

88
00:11:52,657 --> 00:11:54,090
- Gloria.
- Gloria Morin.

89
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,722
Nice to meet you.
I am a big admirer of yours.

90
00:11:57,796 --> 00:11:59,263
I'm flattered.

91
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:03,457
Are you an actress?
Did I see your photo somewhere?

92
00:12:03,568 --> 00:12:06,036
An actress. Yes, well...

93
00:12:06,104 --> 00:12:10,905
I have ambitions in that area.
Actually enormous ambitions,

94
00:12:10,976 --> 00:12:13,171
but that's all, for the moment.

95
00:12:13,311 --> 00:12:14,608
She's got a degree in philosophy.

96
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,772
Allow me. Mario Mezzabotta.
- Nice to meet you.

97
00:12:16,848 --> 00:12:20,807
I don't have a degree.
I'm doing my thesis. It's a bit different.

98
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:23,513
- And the subject?
- A difficult one.

99
00:12:23,922 --> 00:12:27,722
The loneliness of modern man
in contemporary theater.

100
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:29,788
Interesting subject. Right, Professor?

101
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:33,725
And what is the meaning
of the capricious apparitions

102
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:35,562
of the girl of the spring?

103
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:38,769
An offer of purity?
Of warmth to the protagonist?

104
00:12:38,803 --> 00:12:43,399
Of all your story's overabundant
symbols, this is the worst...

105
00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:33,784
She didn't make it. Better that way.

106
00:13:54,479 --> 00:13:57,812
- Yack! How are you?
- Not too bad.

107
00:13:57,882 --> 00:13:59,907
- Did anybody recognize you?
- I don't think so.

108
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:01,543
You brought all that luggage?

109
00:14:01,586 --> 00:14:05,022
It's just five suitcases.
Gowns occupy so much space.

110
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,752
I brought one... you'll see.
Did you get it all?

111
00:14:07,826 --> 00:14:11,887
Carla, it's quiet here at night.
There's nothing going on.

112
00:14:11,963 --> 00:14:15,421
But it's a fashionable spa.
There must be some fashion shows,

113
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,764
some trendy clubs,
even at our hotel.

114
00:14:18,837 --> 00:14:20,532
Have you been behaving?
- Yes, yes.

115
00:14:20,605 --> 00:14:23,472
Actually... I couldn't get you a room
in my hotel,

116
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:26,510
and besides it's full of people who know me.

117
00:14:26,745 --> 00:14:29,771
So, I found someplace else.
A perfect hotel...

118
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:32,180
Very pretty, you know...
- But why?

119
00:14:33,618 --> 00:14:37,349
- And how's this guy?
- Sgulp? Great.

120
00:14:39,023 --> 00:14:40,490
You look a little pale. How come?

121
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:43,554
See, the hotel is right here.

122
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,028
Signora, guests!

123
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:50,363
See. Like I told you. It's not...

124
00:14:50,568 --> 00:14:52,729
but it's very quiet. If you're hungry,

125
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:54,931
I'll get them to bring a couple
of sandwiches.

126
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:58,965
It feels a little sad here.
- No, it's typical!

127
00:14:59,277 --> 00:15:01,302
Besides I'm hungry.
You had lunch, but I didn't.

128
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:02,978
Hello, Sir.

129
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,141
How's the solitaire coming along?

130
00:15:06,217 --> 00:15:08,185
Everything's ready,
the room, the bathroom.

131
00:15:08,253 --> 00:15:10,585
Rest assured.
Signora will feel at home.

132
00:15:10,655 --> 00:15:13,215
Yes, thank you. You wouldn't
have anything ready for lunch?

133
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,849
- The restroom, please?
- It's over there.

134
00:15:14,926 --> 00:15:17,053
I'll see to it personally.

135
00:15:17,896 --> 00:15:20,660
Trains, such horrible things.
They leave your hands so black.

136
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,495
Are you happy I'm here?
- Yes.

137
00:15:24,002 --> 00:15:26,971
- Really happy or a little happy?
- Very happy.

138
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:28,938
Hmm. Smack!

139
00:15:29,874 --> 00:15:31,341
Mm, what a nice smell!

140
00:15:31,476 --> 00:15:34,912
Guido, I thought this black velvet
was going to wrinkle.

141
00:15:34,979 --> 00:15:37,880
- Really? Good, good.
- But no. Not a wrinkle.

142
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:39,741
Even after a three-hour trip.

143
00:15:45,323 --> 00:15:48,952
You didn't even tell me you like it.
Do you like it?

144
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:50,856
Such a beautiful lady!

145
00:15:54,098 --> 00:15:56,828
So refined.
That thing she has on her head...

146
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:57,890
What is it? Ploosh?

147
00:15:57,969 --> 00:16:00,665
- Plush, plush.
- Ah, ploosh.

148
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,441
I looked around for it like crazy.
I was quite desperate.

149
00:16:06,344 --> 00:16:08,972
But you know me.
When Carla makes up her mind...

150
00:16:09,113 --> 00:16:10,910
- Snarp!
- Sgulp!

151
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,011
I read a good Donald Duck last week...

152
00:16:14,052 --> 00:16:15,713
There was a dinosaur...

153
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:19,154
- Here she is, my sweet-buns.
- Be good, a dinosaur...

154
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,388
Guido be good.
What do you want to do now?

155
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:26,256
Are you sure you've been behaving?
- Sure, why?

156
00:16:26,431 --> 00:16:31,391
Anyway, now sweet-buns is hungry.
Oh, my wedding ring.

157
00:16:31,603 --> 00:16:34,663
Listen, Guido.
That little thing you promised me...

158
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:36,134
What little thing?

159
00:16:37,242 --> 00:16:40,575
Now I bet she brings up
her husband again.

160
00:16:41,112 --> 00:16:44,548
You don't think so?
You'll see, old Snaporaz.

161
00:16:46,317 --> 00:16:48,877
My poor Luigi doesn't seem
happy at all.

162
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,446
You see, my husband is not
the confident type.

163
00:16:52,957 --> 00:16:54,948
He gets depressed.

164
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:58,590
He's not stupid, you know.
He's actually very clever...

165
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:01,022
It's so hot here!

166
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:04,396
He knows all of Roman history by heart.

167
00:17:04,836 --> 00:17:07,236
He just needs a push.

168
00:17:07,438 --> 00:17:09,702
He's still working at the
fuel company, same salary.

169
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:10,705
Really?

170
00:17:11,242 --> 00:17:13,540
Be good and put down my purse.
You'll break it.

171
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:16,877
I love that little purse.
He gave it to me.

172
00:17:18,716 --> 00:17:21,014
Why don't you find him a job?

173
00:17:22,387 --> 00:17:25,652
You know so many people.
You've promised it so many times.

174
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,021
I even had a dream about it.

175
00:17:29,761 --> 00:17:32,025
I dreamed that
you did find him a job,

176
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:34,826
but he'd lost his mind
and killed us both.

177
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:37,133
- Who?
- You and me!

178
00:17:38,236 --> 00:17:40,101
Know where we were?

179
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:44,298
In that little street, Via della Croce,
where I bought you

180
00:17:44,342 --> 00:17:47,311
the same tie your wife did.
Do you remember?

181
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:51,679
And I never knew
if you were wearing hers or mine.

182
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:56,353
We were there on a cot,
in each other's arms, naked.

183
00:17:57,255 --> 00:18:00,622
And he came in and he killed us
both with a broom!

184
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,656
- Draw the blinds more.
- Yes.

185
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,127
That's it. Now go into
the corridor for a minute,

186
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:15,830
then pretend you've come
to the wrong room

187
00:18:15,907 --> 00:18:17,340
and found a stranger.

188
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:19,743
Oh, that's good.
We've never done this one.

189
00:18:19,911 --> 00:18:21,572
Hold it there.
Let me look at you.

190
00:18:22,714 --> 00:18:25,615
No. No. Your make-up
needs to be more, more...

191
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,780
- More what?
- More like a slut!

192
00:18:33,725 --> 00:18:35,852
Give me your eyeliner.

193
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:43,264
- Nice lampshade.
- Yes, yes.

194
00:18:43,334 --> 00:18:45,325
- I'd like one for my place.
- Don't move.

195
00:18:45,803 --> 00:18:47,100
What is this hotel called?

196
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:48,566
The Railway Hotel.

197
00:18:48,806 --> 00:18:51,070
I want to write to my
husband so he'll send me

198
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:53,543
an express letter right away.
He writes such nice letters.

199
00:18:53,778 --> 00:18:56,212
I'll let you read them.
- Fine, but keep still...

200
00:18:57,148 --> 00:18:58,581
Make a slutty face.

201
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:03,281
Go out in the corridor.

202
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:05,754
- So, it's a part I have to play.
- Yes.

203
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,384
Who do you think I am?
One of your actresses?

204
00:19:08,493 --> 00:19:10,688
You don't think
I could be one of them?

205
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:14,030
Not me. I wouldn't want
to lead that life.

206
00:19:14,632 --> 00:19:16,065
I like staying home.

207
00:19:16,868 --> 00:19:18,631
Go on, get out. I'm sleeping now.

208
00:19:22,707 --> 00:19:25,335
Tell me. If I were really
to do something like this,

209
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,604
would you be jealous?

210
00:19:27,345 --> 00:19:29,779
Why? Would you really?

211
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:32,847
Who knows?

212
00:19:35,053 --> 00:19:38,181
- May I get you something?
- No, I just came out on a whim.

213
00:19:38,222 --> 00:19:40,816
- Would you like me to run you a bath?
- No, I was just...

214
00:19:40,892 --> 00:19:43,918
- A glass of water, perhaps?
- No, thank you.

215
00:19:46,364 --> 00:19:48,264
What did she want?
What did she say?

216
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:52,235
The owner, she wanted
to give me a glass of water.

217
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:55,501
Come here. Come.

218
00:19:57,842 --> 00:19:59,241
Open up the sheet.

219
00:20:00,845 --> 00:20:05,305
- Guido, do you love me a little?
- Yes, yes.

220
00:20:33,945 --> 00:20:35,435
Is that you, Mama?

221
00:20:38,182 --> 00:20:40,912
So many tears, my son,
so many tears.

222
00:20:40,985 --> 00:20:42,782
Papa, wait! Don't go.

223
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:46,149
We talked so little.

224
00:20:49,327 --> 00:20:52,763
Listen Papa,
I have so many questions.

225
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:58,397
I cannot answer them yet.

226
00:20:59,403 --> 00:21:02,099
See the ceiling here? It's so low.

227
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:06,533
I would have liked it higher.
It's ugly, my son, ugly.

228
00:21:07,111 --> 00:21:11,844
I would have liked it different.
Couldn't you take care of it?

229
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,975
You used to draw so well. I'd like...

230
00:21:15,453 --> 00:21:19,082
Oh, the Commendatore,
he shouldn't have bothered.

231
00:21:23,294 --> 00:21:27,424
- Hello.
- Respects. He's got very little time.

232
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:30,259
Hi.

233
00:21:30,668 --> 00:21:33,432
How is he doing, this son of mine?

234
00:21:34,105 --> 00:21:37,199
Careful. Don't let him move you.

235
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:42,138
He isn't doing well? How come?

236
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,750
It is so hard, realizing that
one has made such huge mistakes.

237
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,614
But l...

238
00:21:52,156 --> 00:21:55,319
Mother prepared you
a little something.

239
00:21:55,826 --> 00:21:57,794
A little cheese and two peaches.

240
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:00,554
Don't worry about me.

241
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:03,096
Sure, this place gets a little lonely,

242
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:05,135
but your mother comes every day.

243
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:09,833
She keeps me company, you know.
And keeps everything in order.

244
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,073
A little decorum is always necessary.

245
00:22:12,343 --> 00:22:14,174
That's how we were brought up.

246
00:22:14,412 --> 00:22:16,505
And with your wife, Luisa -- all fine?

247
00:22:16,547 --> 00:22:17,946
Yes. Luisa...

248
00:22:18,082 --> 00:22:21,381
You two together have been
my joy. Goodbye, son...

249
00:22:26,724 --> 00:22:30,251
What is this place?
Do you like it here?

250
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:33,796
I haven't figured it out yet.

251
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:38,796
But it's going much better.

252
00:22:39,837 --> 00:22:44,274
At first, you see, at first...

253
00:22:47,144 --> 00:22:51,308
Guido! I do my best.
What more can I do?

254
00:23:02,226 --> 00:23:04,956
Poor Guido, you must be tired.
Shall we go home?

255
00:23:06,931 --> 00:23:09,491
I'm Luisa, your wife.
Don't you recognize me?

256
00:23:09,533 --> 00:23:10,693
What are you thinking about?

257
00:23:43,868 --> 00:23:45,335
- Hello.
- Hello.

258
00:24:02,887 --> 00:24:03,819
Good afternoon.

259
00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:34,979
Guido! In a few days,
I'll get you an introduction

260
00:24:35,052 --> 00:24:37,543
so you can get
all the advice you need.

261
00:24:37,855 --> 00:24:39,254
Nice mystical figure. Right?

262
00:24:39,724 --> 00:24:41,715
I brought you the three old men.

263
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:43,783
One is a Russian,
another is a retired general...

264
00:24:43,861 --> 00:24:44,953
What old men?

265
00:24:45,029 --> 00:24:46,621
The ones for the role of the Father.

266
00:24:46,697 --> 00:24:48,824
Cover me, Cesarino...

267
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:53,063
Come here, buffoon.

268
00:24:53,604 --> 00:24:57,267
How are you?
So nice to see you, Super Tarzan!

269
00:24:57,708 --> 00:24:59,938
- I called you six times.
- Yes, yes I know.

270
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,137
- It's about Claudia's script.
- So?

271
00:25:02,646 --> 00:25:03,874
I thought about mailing it to you.

272
00:25:03,948 --> 00:25:05,939
In fact, I've already mailed it.
- Really?

273
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:09,051
You've still got your looks.
Why don't you go back to acting?

274
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,520
I was up all night with
an idea for the spaceship.

275
00:25:11,589 --> 00:25:13,181
Why don't we make the upper story...

276
00:25:13,257 --> 00:25:17,023
Conocchia, don't take my arm!
I hate it! And wear a jacket!

277
00:25:18,028 --> 00:25:20,121
Now I need to wear a jacket
to talk to you...

278
00:25:20,264 --> 00:25:22,255
How are you? How was your trip?

279
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,301
Good. It's been an hour...

280
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:29,897
What a blinding vision! Beautiful!

281
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,539
- Really?
- Yes.

282
00:25:34,945 --> 00:25:36,879
You're always telling me
I'm 'bellissima'

283
00:25:36,947 --> 00:25:39,177
but you never tell me about my part.

284
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:43,144
How was my screen test?
- Great, or you wouldn't be here.

285
00:25:43,387 --> 00:25:49,451
They told me I have to look
motherly and eat a lot of pasta.

286
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:53,920
I should gain six pounds. Is this all?

287
00:25:54,098 --> 00:25:56,191
See? You already know
more than I do.

288
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:59,795
You are the author.
You should be telling me something.

289
00:26:00,905 --> 00:26:03,032
- What should this lady do?
- What?

290
00:26:04,175 --> 00:26:05,335
Agostini!

291
00:26:07,111 --> 00:26:10,308
I don't want to bother you.
The hotel is grand,

292
00:26:10,381 --> 00:26:13,544
the whisky, excellent.
But I have three questions.

293
00:26:13,617 --> 00:26:17,383
Yes, yes, later. What is it?
Ah, yes, yes. Pardon me.

294
00:26:17,922 --> 00:26:19,321
Agostini, we should...

295
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,881
I just didn't feel like talking to that guy.

296
00:26:22,726 --> 00:26:24,990
Claudia is getting offers
from all over the world.

297
00:26:25,362 --> 00:26:28,195
I can't keep her waiting.
Give her something.

298
00:26:28,365 --> 00:26:31,391
Do you have a script,
a few pages, an idea?

299
00:26:31,469 --> 00:26:34,404
Does Claudia realize that this
might be a great part?

300
00:26:34,438 --> 00:26:37,669
Perhaps the best she's ever
played? I'll explain...

301
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:48,208
I'm telling you as a friend,
you're gonna lose her.

302
00:26:48,252 --> 00:26:50,982
- You want to see the old men or not?
- Are you crazy? We're ready...

303
00:26:51,322 --> 00:26:52,789
What?
- The old men.

304
00:26:52,857 --> 00:26:53,983
- Where are they?
- Here.

305
00:26:54,758 --> 00:26:57,886
Signora Carla called. She doesn't
want to stay in that hotel.

306
00:26:57,962 --> 00:27:00,328
It's ugly. She's right.
- What can I do? Bring her here?

307
00:27:01,298 --> 00:27:02,993
I'll call the old men.

308
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:05,262
Sorry, I wanted to introduce you
to my little wife.

309
00:27:06,303 --> 00:27:09,170
Thrilled.

310
00:27:09,673 --> 00:27:13,700
She writes too. She's a columnist
for some ladies' magazines.

311
00:27:13,777 --> 00:27:16,541
She's got a few questions for you.

312
00:27:16,614 --> 00:27:20,106
My readers go crazy for romance.

313
00:27:20,518 --> 00:27:24,477
Could you tell me something
about your love life?

314
00:27:24,555 --> 00:27:26,921
Here they are.
Say hello to the Dottore.

315
00:27:27,358 --> 00:27:31,454
Step down. You too, General.

316
00:27:33,464 --> 00:27:35,159
- How old are you?
- 70.

317
00:27:35,232 --> 00:27:36,961
- And you?
- 64.

318
00:27:38,502 --> 00:27:40,333
- And you?
- 68.

319
00:27:44,108 --> 00:27:45,939
They aren't old enough.

320
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,773
What? This one
has one foot in the grave.

321
00:27:47,811 --> 00:27:50,109
Next time I'll get three corpses.
You asked for a pathetic type...

322
00:27:50,147 --> 00:27:54,015
This one makes you wanna cry
the minute you see him.

323
00:27:59,523 --> 00:28:00,888
Hello, Commendatore.

324
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:07,155
If you kneel, what do I do?

325
00:28:07,231 --> 00:28:08,755
Get up or you'll hurt yourself.
How are you, little Guido?

326
00:28:11,468 --> 00:28:13,163
Hello, Commendatore.

327
00:28:13,237 --> 00:28:15,467
We took a helicopter.
This one screamed the whole way.

328
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:16,301
Where's the swimming pool?

329
00:28:16,373 --> 00:28:18,238
We haven't even checked in. Shut up!

330
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:19,769
Has the treatment helped?
- Yes.

331
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,036
- Feeling better? Here.
- What is it?

332
00:28:21,178 --> 00:28:22,236
Just a token.

333
00:28:22,379 --> 00:28:24,142
- You're always giving me presents.
- It's just like mine.

334
00:28:24,281 --> 00:28:25,475
It doesn't need winding.

335
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:27,481
A watch! A little watch, everyone!

336
00:28:30,754 --> 00:28:34,622
- So, are your ideas any clearer now?
- Yes, I really think so.

337
00:28:35,225 --> 00:28:37,159
We've got the Americans...

338
00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:08,358
I've seen her passport.
She's 52 years old?

339
00:29:08,425 --> 00:29:10,359
Ah, she's a little girl.

340
00:29:10,861 --> 00:29:11,987
Good evening, signora.

341
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,528
And who are you, darling?

342
00:30:21,265 --> 00:30:24,757
Mr. Director, another little question...

343
00:30:30,974 --> 00:30:34,273
He wants to know the relationship
between Catholicism and Marxism.

344
00:30:34,311 --> 00:30:35,642
Thank you, I got it.

345
00:30:35,913 --> 00:30:38,404
You want to know about
my political affiliation.

346
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:42,847
As an honest man,
and all of you ltalians are,

347
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:45,912
you should be able to answer me.

348
00:30:45,989 --> 00:30:50,221
Is ltaly an essentially Catholic country?

349
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:50,954
Yes, it is!

350
00:30:50,994 --> 00:30:52,962
You shut up and eat your ice-cream.

351
00:30:53,464 --> 00:30:56,297
It's the estimate for the spaceship.

352
00:30:57,968 --> 00:31:01,267
I need to talk to you later,
face to face,

353
00:31:01,338 --> 00:31:05,638
I'm at the end of my rope.
This is a madhouse!

354
00:31:05,709 --> 00:31:09,076
Fine, we'll discuss it later.
What was that about your cholesterol?

355
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,792
...only one great writer.
The early Fitzgerald.

356
00:31:33,871 --> 00:31:38,035
Then his writing became an orgy
of pragmatism or brutal realism.

357
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:41,774
What does Left or Right mean?

358
00:31:41,845 --> 00:31:44,712
You're such an optimist
to believe that in a world

359
00:31:44,782 --> 00:31:47,580
this confused and chaotic
there are people so lucid

360
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:50,814
as to belong exclusively
to the Left or the Right.

361
00:31:50,854 --> 00:31:55,018
The Americans have this new
theory about cholesterol...

362
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:58,094
- Is your ice-cream good?
- Very good.

363
00:32:02,466 --> 00:32:05,196
Could you say approximately
how many scenes she'll be in?

364
00:32:05,335 --> 00:32:06,270
What?

365
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,465
- How many scenes?
- Five.

366
00:32:10,974 --> 00:32:12,134
Only five.

367
00:32:12,342 --> 00:32:14,867
Maybe six, or even seven.

368
00:32:15,512 --> 00:32:16,604
Good evening.

369
00:32:17,381 --> 00:32:18,541
Hi, Guido.

370
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,048
The Ambassador's got his eye on signora.

371
00:32:27,591 --> 00:32:28,580
So?

372
00:32:28,659 --> 00:32:30,559
- I thought you'd want to know.
- Good, now I know.

373
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:33,422
- Do you want me to ask her to dance?
- Yes, ask her.

374
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:36,294
Dear friends there's only one truth...

375
00:32:36,733 --> 00:32:41,602
But I am so anxious to know,
to understand my character.

376
00:32:41,672 --> 00:32:45,267
I need to coexist with my character
for a while before shooting...

377
00:32:45,342 --> 00:32:48,470
The lady says she needs
to know her character.

378
00:32:51,415 --> 00:32:55,545
I need to get inside her skin,
her ideas, or I'll fail.

379
00:32:55,986 --> 00:32:58,454
Hasn't the Maestro explained
the part yet?

380
00:32:58,522 --> 00:33:01,116
- No.
- I am sorry, dear lady.

381
00:33:01,191 --> 00:33:04,820
I don't have such information.
I'm only the producer.

382
00:33:05,162 --> 00:33:09,030
Guido, isn't it true that I know nothing?
- Right. Not a thing.

383
00:33:17,307 --> 00:33:19,104
And now three days of rest.

384
00:33:22,312 --> 00:33:27,147
They look like glass.
The first cherries of spring.

385
00:33:31,521 --> 00:33:32,681
Thanks. And for Guido?

386
00:33:40,631 --> 00:33:42,622
Mario Mezzabotta,
all 200 pounds of him.

387
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:45,593
Shall we take a little walk?

388
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:56,302
I know... Naturally,
you think I've lost it.

389
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,210
Yes.

390
00:33:57,347 --> 00:34:00,441
- I'm 30 years her senior. So what?
- It's all right.

391
00:34:00,484 --> 00:34:04,818
I may be the fool, the old imbecile,
the one who foots the bill. So what?

392
00:34:05,989 --> 00:34:12,396
Could you create something important,
beautiful and real on a commission?

393
00:34:12,396 --> 00:34:14,421
For instance, if the Pope asked you?

394
00:34:15,165 --> 00:34:17,429
Yes, yes. I'll think about it.
Excuse me.

395
00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:21,963
Listen, I'm not deluding myself.

396
00:34:22,439 --> 00:34:25,499
Maybe she's only with me
for the money.

397
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,000
Actually, that's certainly it.

398
00:34:28,178 --> 00:34:30,806
But I've never felt closer
to anybody in my life.

399
00:34:32,182 --> 00:34:36,016
Just look at her.
She's pretty, charming, intelligent.

400
00:34:36,386 --> 00:34:38,513
She has it all. Only for the money?

401
00:34:39,022 --> 00:34:42,150
But there are so many rich young men
around these days, loads of them.

402
00:34:42,225 --> 00:34:43,487
It's clear. She cares for you.

403
00:34:44,027 --> 00:34:48,157
Right. And she hasn't tried
to pressure me.

404
00:34:48,532 --> 00:34:50,693
I made up my mind rationally.

405
00:34:51,335 --> 00:34:54,304
The poor thing has never
even mentioned my wife,

406
00:34:54,371 --> 00:34:56,635
my family, never a reproach.

407
00:34:56,907 --> 00:34:58,272
How did you meet her?

408
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:03,204
In London. She was in school
with my daughter.

409
00:35:04,414 --> 00:35:05,938
How many years have you
been married?

410
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:07,847
Many. 31.

411
00:35:08,185 --> 00:35:09,550
And your wife...

412
00:35:10,253 --> 00:35:13,051
My wife took it really badly.
She hates her.

413
00:35:13,991 --> 00:35:17,154
While Gloria, poor thing,
is fond of her.

414
00:35:19,363 --> 00:35:21,763
So spell it out. I am a fool!

415
00:35:22,132 --> 00:35:24,600
There must be a shooting schedule.
Dates.

416
00:35:24,668 --> 00:35:27,831
Otherwise we're off to Germany.
We have other offers.

417
00:35:28,405 --> 00:35:30,999
Will you be leaving me
in the dark 'til the end?

418
00:35:35,379 --> 00:35:37,472
You look like a little snail.

419
00:35:37,814 --> 00:35:40,214
- What is a little snail?
- Une petite escargot.

420
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:48,889
Can you hear the voice
of the springs?

421
00:35:51,862 --> 00:35:54,490
The Romans used to call it
'Happy Waters.'

422
00:36:07,944 --> 00:36:11,607
Maya, let's entertain these bores.

423
00:36:12,516 --> 00:36:14,313
May l?

424
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,655
Are you ready, Maya?
What am I holding?

425
00:36:20,924 --> 00:36:22,789
A velvet purse.

426
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,585
- And inside?
- A white handkerchief.

427
00:36:26,763 --> 00:36:28,458
A red one.

428
00:36:29,766 --> 00:36:32,234
- No drugs, I hope.
- No, it's aspirin.

429
00:36:33,703 --> 00:36:36,001
- A purse.
- Is there any money in it?

430
00:36:36,273 --> 00:36:39,242
2,725 lire.

431
00:36:42,646 --> 00:36:44,773
And this lady here.
What is she thinking?

432
00:36:45,115 --> 00:36:46,912
No dirty thoughts, I hope.

433
00:36:46,983 --> 00:36:48,416
Just think about something.

434
00:36:48,485 --> 00:36:49,713
About what?

435
00:36:49,786 --> 00:36:51,253
Whatever you like.
Are you thinking?

436
00:36:52,722 --> 00:36:53,450
Yes.

437
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:56,991
I'd like to live another 1 00 years.

438
00:36:59,296 --> 00:37:00,661
Best of luck!

439
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:05,660
And what is in this pretty
lady's head?

440
00:37:05,735 --> 00:37:07,066
Let me be.

441
00:37:07,537 --> 00:37:09,368
May I think about someone?

442
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:11,134
Yes. Go ahead, Lady!

443
00:37:11,508 --> 00:37:14,944
Forget about it. I'm ashamed.

444
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:16,706
What about?

445
00:37:16,913 --> 00:37:18,471
Can I really think of a person?

446
00:37:18,548 --> 00:37:21,176
I'd be afraid to have my thoughts read.

447
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:23,219
Don't you worry darling,
no risk there.

448
00:37:23,286 --> 00:37:25,083
Would you like to leave? It's cold.

449
00:37:25,155 --> 00:37:28,386
A little kiss and a big slap.
Is that right?

450
00:37:30,861 --> 00:37:34,319
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're thinking, 'What a trickster.'

451
00:37:34,397 --> 00:37:37,059
Well, sorry to disappoint you,
but there's no trick.

452
00:37:37,134 --> 00:37:40,297
And it isn't just a coincidence.

453
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,804
It's an exceptional example
of magnetic fields and telepathy.

454
00:37:42,873 --> 00:37:46,138
I transmit your thoughts to Mlle. Maya.

455
00:37:46,576 --> 00:37:49,704
You! Do you believe
you can hide your thoughts?

456
00:37:58,655 --> 00:38:01,886
Please, leave her alone.
Don't insist.

457
00:38:02,626 --> 00:38:03,957
Thoughts are sacred.

458
00:38:04,761 --> 00:38:06,752
See, it's all a game.

459
00:38:06,897 --> 00:38:08,023
Maya, are you ready?

460
00:38:09,266 --> 00:38:13,600
Just a moment, could we know
what you gentlemen are thinking?

461
00:38:13,837 --> 00:38:14,929
You for instance.

462
00:38:15,005 --> 00:38:16,404
What are you thinking?

463
00:38:16,473 --> 00:38:18,441
What else? My director.
My cross and my delight.

464
00:38:20,076 --> 00:38:22,044
- How are you?
- Fine. And you?

465
00:38:23,246 --> 00:38:24,645
It has been quite a while... years!

466
00:38:24,714 --> 00:38:26,739
Unfortunately yes, my dear.

467
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:30,114
Just a moment. You're famous now.

468
00:38:30,187 --> 00:38:35,284
Cut it out.
Just tell me what's your trick?

469
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:37,918
Well, it's partly a trick,
but part of it is real.

470
00:38:37,994 --> 00:38:40,827
I don't know how, but it happens.
- Can you transmit anything?

471
00:38:40,897 --> 00:38:43,422
Anything. Except for her to get lost.

472
00:38:44,301 --> 00:38:46,064
- Do you want to try?
- Yes. Wait.

473
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:48,333
I bet now, with you, it won't work.

474
00:38:53,743 --> 00:38:58,646
I don't understand. I can't repeat...

475
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:28,805
Asa... nisi... masa?
Is this right?

476
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,039
- Right?
- Yes.

477
00:39:32,382 --> 00:39:34,441
But what does it mean?

478
00:39:41,024 --> 00:39:42,958
Guido, come here!
Where are you?

479
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,723
Don't be spoiled! What a wonder!

480
00:39:45,795 --> 00:39:47,126
I don't want to take a bath,
I don't want to...

481
00:39:47,197 --> 00:39:48,687
Come here... Iet me catch you?

482
00:39:48,865 --> 00:39:50,162
I know what that rascal wants.

483
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:51,825
He wants to be carried
by his sweetheart,

484
00:39:51,901 --> 00:39:53,493
doesn't he, the strapping lad.

485
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:56,539
Come here. Come here.

486
00:39:56,606 --> 00:39:58,938
He never wants to take
the wine bath, the naughty boy.

487
00:39:59,009 --> 00:40:01,637
Don't you know that if you do
you'll grow into a strong man?

488
00:40:01,711 --> 00:40:04,805
Guido is scared! Guido is scared!

489
00:40:16,459 --> 00:40:18,757
The Devil and damnation!

490
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:28,497
Granny, granny!

491
00:40:28,571 --> 00:40:30,300
The wood is all wet this year.

492
00:40:30,373 --> 00:40:32,170
This prowling cat is just
like your grandfather.

493
00:40:32,242 --> 00:40:34,710
Always on the prowl
and only comes in for food.

494
00:40:35,845 --> 00:40:38,040
Shame on you! Go to bed.

495
00:40:39,282 --> 00:40:42,513
Last time I slammed the door
in his face

496
00:40:42,585 --> 00:40:44,712
and left him outside for two days.

497
00:40:45,822 --> 00:40:50,816
I could have married again
and found a handsome man,

498
00:40:51,428 --> 00:40:53,953
rest assured, better
than your grandfather.

499
00:40:54,397 --> 00:40:56,456
What an idiot I am!

500
00:40:57,534 --> 00:41:01,265
I thought that if I took another
husband, my first husband,

501
00:41:01,338 --> 00:41:05,240
whether in heaven or hell,
wouldn't have waited.

502
00:41:06,209 --> 00:41:09,269
Be quiet! Go to bed, children!

503
00:41:38,742 --> 00:41:40,733
Nanny, Claudio wet himself!

504
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:43,938
What are you doing?
Go to sleep. You too, sleep.

505
00:41:50,487 --> 00:41:53,650
Little Guido, get under the covers.
It's cold. Be still.

506
00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:00,523
Did you say your prayers?

507
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,559
Aren't you a beautiful sticky bun?
The most beautiful!

508
00:42:05,635 --> 00:42:07,432
Give me a kiss, too.

509
00:42:07,504 --> 00:42:10,473
Who do you love best? Me?
Is that right?

510
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,371
You can't fool me.

511
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:14,569
I'm going to give you a spanking.

512
00:42:16,613 --> 00:42:22,051
I can tell when you're pretending.

513
00:42:24,854 --> 00:42:26,981
Sleep tight, little creatures.

514
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:29,251
Close your eyes.

515
00:42:46,009 --> 00:42:47,636
Guido, don't close your
eyes tonight!

516
00:42:47,677 --> 00:42:50,145
It's the night the portrait's eyes move.
You're not scared, are you?

517
00:42:50,213 --> 00:42:51,680
You must be quiet!

518
00:42:51,748 --> 00:42:54,410
Uncle Agostino will look into
the corner and find the treasure!

519
00:42:54,484 --> 00:42:56,418
Don't be afraid, Guido!
We'll be rich!

520
00:42:56,486 --> 00:43:03,585
Do you remember the spell?
Asa Nisi Masa... Asa Nisi Masa... sh!

521
00:43:37,627 --> 00:43:41,586
Sir, you got two or three calls from Rome.
Your wife, I think.

522
00:43:41,664 --> 00:43:44,929
Fine. Get me the line.

523
00:43:45,368 --> 00:43:47,632
- Gino, get the gentleman the line.
- All right.

524
00:43:47,704 --> 00:43:51,663
- This is for you. Good night, sir.
- Good night.

525
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:55,469
Marcella, that call from Rome, quickly.

526
00:44:06,422 --> 00:44:09,255
No, I'm not offended.

527
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:11,924
There's only one thing
that offends me.

528
00:44:13,129 --> 00:44:19,932
You know me. No.

529
00:44:20,937 --> 00:44:24,930
I forgive him everything.

530
00:44:32,382 --> 00:44:35,351
Let's have a little chat.

531
00:44:35,685 --> 00:44:37,277
Sit beside me for a moment.

532
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,878
No, I'm going to bed.
I'm very tired and waiting for a call.

533
00:44:42,692 --> 00:44:43,317
Would you like some?

534
00:44:43,393 --> 00:44:45,190
No, thank you.
I have such a headache.

535
00:44:46,396 --> 00:44:47,522
Give me your hands.

536
00:44:48,765 --> 00:44:50,164
No, sit down.

537
00:44:52,201 --> 00:44:54,795
I have a healing fluid
in my left hand.

538
00:44:55,338 --> 00:44:57,363
I put it on my belly when it aches.

539
00:44:58,141 --> 00:44:59,438
Take off your hat.

540
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,606
Is it any better?

541
00:45:10,453 --> 00:45:11,647
Yes, maybe.

542
00:45:16,726 --> 00:45:18,091
Why do you look at me that way?

543
00:45:19,195 --> 00:45:23,359
Oh, don't say I'm beautiful.
You make it sound insulting.

544
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,197
What's with you?

545
00:45:27,070 --> 00:45:28,162
I don't know.

546
00:45:30,373 --> 00:45:36,937
I feel I made all the wrong
decisions in my life and in my work.

547
00:45:41,351 --> 00:45:44,320
Tell me, why do you enjoy
torturing me?

548
00:45:44,487 --> 00:45:45,954
Torturing you?

549
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:49,456
Talk to me as you would
to an old friend.

550
00:45:49,926 --> 00:45:52,986
I need to feel close to my director.

551
00:45:59,102 --> 00:46:01,195
Did you see my last movie,
the one shot in Belgrade?

552
00:46:01,638 --> 00:46:05,870
My character was a woman
marked by the injuries of time,

553
00:46:05,942 --> 00:46:08,911
yet still desirable...

554
00:46:09,646 --> 00:46:12,479
- Play "Mystification".
- I don't know it.

555
00:46:13,016 --> 00:46:14,347
But yes...

556
00:46:14,417 --> 00:46:16,282
What a character... this woman...

557
00:46:18,121 --> 00:46:19,315
But...

558
00:46:19,355 --> 00:46:21,255
In whom people find protection
and love.

559
00:46:23,393 --> 00:46:27,193
I am this character.
I am like her in life and love.

560
00:46:28,297 --> 00:46:29,958
That's why I'm so lonely.

561
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:33,801
And I have always forgiven
everything in the man...

562
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:36,498
the men, I love.

563
00:46:36,806 --> 00:46:39,138
- Sir, Rome on the line.
- Thank you.

564
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:41,608
I am very sensual. Wicked, too!

565
00:46:41,678 --> 00:46:43,646
Yes, yes, you're very close.
I'll be right back.

566
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:51,550
Rome on the line. You may speak.

567
00:46:51,621 --> 00:46:52,645
Hello, yes!

568
00:46:53,723 --> 00:46:55,213
- Do you want Luisa?
- Yes.

569
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:58,385
Feeling guilty, you beast?
This is Rossella.

570
00:46:58,461 --> 00:47:01,294
Hi, Rossella. How are you?
Luisa was looking for me.

571
00:47:01,364 --> 00:47:05,391
Where were you this time?
Your rest cure? What an excuse...

572
00:47:05,468 --> 00:47:07,299
Here comes Luisa.

573
00:47:08,504 --> 00:47:10,802
Guido, I called you twice.
Where were you?

574
00:47:10,873 --> 00:47:12,602
I know. I'm sorry.

575
00:47:12,675 --> 00:47:15,576
I was up in the production office.
We're working.

576
00:47:15,778 --> 00:47:16,745
How are you?

577
00:47:16,813 --> 00:47:19,475
Not bad... And the treatment?

578
00:47:19,549 --> 00:47:21,676
Is it helping?

579
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:25,551
Perhaps. But, you know,
I can't really rest.

580
00:47:25,755 --> 00:47:27,279
And you? What are you doing?
Having fun?

581
00:47:27,457 --> 00:47:31,086
The usual. I'm with Rossella, Tilde, Enrico.
They were about to leave.

582
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,594
But are you having a good time?
Did you meet anybody?

583
00:47:33,663 --> 00:47:35,392
Hardly. It's a terrible bore.

584
00:47:35,465 --> 00:47:37,365
But for my work, it's better this way.

585
00:47:37,433 --> 00:47:38,559
- Good night, Guido.
- 'Night.

586
00:47:39,535 --> 00:47:43,403
You've met no one you know?
Are you always alone?

587
00:47:43,473 --> 00:47:44,804
Of course.

588
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:46,470
Really?

589
00:47:47,543 --> 00:47:50,307
Luisa, why don't you come visit?

590
00:47:50,747 --> 00:47:52,442
Just a short stay.
It's easy to get here.

591
00:47:52,482 --> 00:47:54,746
When are you going
to start shooting, you bore?

592
00:47:54,784 --> 00:47:56,877
I don't know.
Let me talk to Luisa, please.

593
00:47:57,153 --> 00:47:59,519
So, should I come?
Do you want me to?

594
00:47:59,589 --> 00:48:01,181
If you'd like to.

595
00:48:01,657 --> 00:48:03,386
You could even bring a friend.

596
00:48:03,459 --> 00:48:04,687
But would it make you happy?

597
00:48:04,761 --> 00:48:07,093
Of course, or I wouldn't ask you.

598
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:09,355
- Sir, are you staying on?
- No.

599
00:48:09,398 --> 00:48:11,195
When should I come?

600
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:12,495
Whenever it's good for you.

601
00:48:12,568 --> 00:48:14,001
Careful, I'll come.

602
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:15,970
Darling, I wouldn't have asked.

603
00:48:16,038 --> 00:48:18,632
I'd love it...
So long, and good night.

604
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:20,300
Bye, Mr. Alienated. Good night.

605
00:48:21,811 --> 00:48:23,039
Night, Guido.

606
00:48:31,187 --> 00:48:33,485
Monsieur Guido, my agent thought...

607
00:48:33,556 --> 00:48:36,389
Just a second, madam. I am going
to step into the office so...

608
00:48:36,459 --> 00:48:38,859
- Shit!
- It's in my best interest.

609
00:48:38,928 --> 00:48:41,055
Tomorrow morning
we'll discuss everything. All right?

610
00:48:47,503 --> 00:48:50,870
Beams for the central structure:.
1 0,000.

611
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,104
Planks for steps: 260.

612
00:48:54,544 --> 00:48:55,568
'Evening.

613
00:48:55,912 --> 00:48:56,571
Do you need something?

614
00:48:56,646 --> 00:48:58,204
No, thanks.
Go on with your work.

615
00:48:59,382 --> 00:49:01,873
What a well-behaved
production team.

616
00:49:03,853 --> 00:49:05,013
Hi.

617
00:49:05,221 --> 00:49:07,189
Oh, hi Eleonora.

618
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:11,456
2,350. Corrugated iron.

619
00:49:11,527 --> 00:49:13,188
Listen, Dottore, since you're here.

620
00:49:13,262 --> 00:49:16,493
I called the pensione about
the German, but she's gone.

621
00:49:16,566 --> 00:49:18,466
- You must find her.
- She's in Paris with a circus.

622
00:49:18,534 --> 00:49:19,660
Really?

623
00:49:25,174 --> 00:49:26,698
What should I do?

624
00:49:28,644 --> 00:49:30,111
What an honor, Dottore.

625
00:49:30,179 --> 00:49:32,010
You've caught me
with my pants down!

626
00:49:32,615 --> 00:49:36,415
Listen Guido.
About the farm... there's that...

627
00:49:36,953 --> 00:49:39,581
Ah, here. Where's this place?

628
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:43,322
It doesn't even have a note
about the address, nothing!

629
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:45,354
It's in the Prince's estate.

630
00:49:45,528 --> 00:49:47,359
- Who's in here?
- My little nieces.

631
00:49:48,231 --> 00:49:49,789
Eva and Dina.

632
00:49:50,233 --> 00:49:51,461
'Evening.

633
00:49:53,169 --> 00:49:54,659
C'mon. Let him take a look at you.

634
00:49:54,737 --> 00:49:57,228
Perhaps he'll give you
a little part.

635
00:49:59,175 --> 00:50:00,574
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

636
00:50:01,677 --> 00:50:02,735
Where are you from?

637
00:50:03,546 --> 00:50:06,208
- Trieste.
- Hurray for ltaly!

638
00:50:09,118 --> 00:50:10,949
You've got a nice set up here,
don't you?

639
00:50:11,153 --> 00:50:12,142
Tell him about my cousin.

640
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:15,486
Guido. This one's cousin
is six feet tall.

641
00:50:15,558 --> 00:50:17,685
You should see her.
She might be good for the movie.

642
00:50:17,827 --> 00:50:19,260
This one... you she-devil...

643
00:50:19,395 --> 00:50:23,126
It's true. She's tall like me
standing on the bed.

644
00:50:23,266 --> 00:50:24,631
See?

645
00:50:24,767 --> 00:50:26,564
She's twice been voted
Miss Nylon Stockings.

646
00:50:26,702 --> 00:50:28,567
Is Guido in there? I'm coming in.

647
00:50:28,704 --> 00:50:30,501
Sleep, Conocchia, sleep.
I'll see you tomorrow.

648
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,999
May I ask you a question?

649
00:50:33,409 --> 00:50:34,341
Go ahead.

650
00:50:34,477 --> 00:50:39,574
My friend here says...
you can't make a love story.

651
00:50:39,615 --> 00:50:41,242
- Shut up!
- She's right.

652
00:50:43,052 --> 00:50:44,280
Should I wake you up
in the morning, Guido?

653
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,318
No, thanks.

654
00:50:49,458 --> 00:50:51,449
Our commander will never
catch us unprepared.

655
00:50:51,594 --> 00:50:53,425
This production crew never sleeps!

656
00:50:53,562 --> 00:50:55,496
Such a splitting headache.
What did I eat?

657
00:50:57,333 --> 00:50:59,460
They're always horsing around,
but they're good guys.

658
00:50:59,535 --> 00:51:02,868
Do you need anything, Guido?
Is it a new idea?

659
00:51:02,939 --> 00:51:04,372
Do you have something to tell me?

660
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,237
No, thank you, no.

661
00:51:06,309 --> 00:51:08,038
Go back to bed.
I don't need anything.

662
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:09,771
- Anything at all.
- No, thank you. Good night.

663
00:51:10,579 --> 00:51:13,070
Good night my ass!

664
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:16,910
Who can sleep here?
How can I get any sleep?

665
00:51:17,386 --> 00:51:18,978
Conocchia, calm down.

666
00:51:19,322 --> 00:51:22,382
Allow me. I have been in this
business for 30 years,

667
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:25,325
I've worked on movies
you couldn't begin to imagine

668
00:51:25,394 --> 00:51:27,225
and I have never been afraid
of anything!

669
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:29,230
What are you shouting for,
you crazy old man!

670
00:51:30,132 --> 00:51:32,532
There, you've said it now. Old.

671
00:51:33,035 --> 00:51:36,596
Finally you've spat it out.
Conocchia is old.

672
00:51:36,706 --> 00:51:38,264
What do you want?
Get back inside.

673
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:43,736
You always keep me in the dark.
I never know what to do.

674
00:51:43,879 --> 00:51:48,179
When to talk or when to shut up.
I don't want to bother you.

675
00:51:48,317 --> 00:51:50,251
I don't want to know
what this movie is about.

676
00:51:50,386 --> 00:51:53,378
- You want to keep it a secret? Go ahead.
- Please, go back to bed.

677
00:51:55,091 --> 00:51:57,184
But if I'm to help you out,
as I've always done,

678
00:51:57,259 --> 00:52:00,251
and you were so happy then,
you must tell me something!

679
00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:02,593
Tell me: get rid
of the French woman...

680
00:52:02,665 --> 00:52:05,634
this is how I want the spaceship...
tell me: go hang yourself,

681
00:52:05,701 --> 00:52:07,965
but do tell me something.

682
00:52:08,804 --> 00:52:11,136
You've changed so much,
Guido my friend.

683
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:17,073
What are you doing now?
Crying? Aren't you ashamed?

684
00:52:17,146 --> 00:52:19,808
I'll be leaving tomorrow.
I'm quitting.

685
00:52:19,882 --> 00:52:23,147
I don't want to be in your way.
You need some young blood.

686
00:52:23,753 --> 00:52:27,519
Just be careful. You're not
the man you used to be, either.

687
00:52:52,314 --> 00:52:53,906
A crisis of inspiration?

688
00:52:54,884 --> 00:52:57,751
And what if it weren't a
passing one, my dear?

689
00:52:58,687 --> 00:53:01,520
What if it's the final collapse
of a filthy liar

690
00:53:01,657 --> 00:53:04,387
with no flair or talent? Sgulp!

691
00:53:31,787 --> 00:53:36,053
Let's say you are purity itself.

692
00:53:37,426 --> 00:53:39,986
But what the hell does it mean
to be really honest?

693
00:53:40,329 --> 00:53:42,297
Didn't you hear
what the Falcaccio said?

694
00:53:42,364 --> 00:53:47,700
"It's time to set all the symbols aside,
the echoing of purity, innocence, escape."

695
00:53:49,905 --> 00:53:51,702
What is it you want then?

696
00:54:05,888 --> 00:54:08,379
Yes, this could be it.

697
00:54:08,824 --> 00:54:13,124
There's a museum in the town,
and you, the guard's daughter,

698
00:54:13,729 --> 00:54:16,994
grew up surrounded by images
of ancient beauty...

699
00:54:33,182 --> 00:54:34,547
You're right.

700
00:55:09,885 --> 00:55:12,149
I've come to stay forever.

701
00:55:14,223 --> 00:55:18,853
I want to create order,
I want to cleanse...

702
00:55:19,929 --> 00:55:23,695
I want to create order,
I want to cleanse...

703
00:55:35,077 --> 00:55:35,566
Hello?

704
00:55:35,711 --> 00:55:37,508
They're asking for you
from the Railway Hotel.

705
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,013
Fine. I'll take it.

706
00:55:40,015 --> 00:55:44,543
Hello? Who's that? Hello?

707
00:55:45,554 --> 00:55:48,523
Guido, I feel dreadful.
The mineral water made me sick.

708
00:55:48,591 --> 00:55:51,617
I have a temperature. Come.
Come here, immediately.

709
00:55:51,694 --> 00:55:54,788
At this time of night?
I can't. I'll come tomorrow.

710
00:55:54,997 --> 00:55:56,021
Come.

711
00:55:56,098 --> 00:55:58,362
The poor thing, if you only knew
how she was asking for you.

712
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,560
Here's the ice.

713
00:56:02,571 --> 00:56:05,870
- She's melting. She's got at least 1 04.
- Yes, fine. Just go now.

714
00:56:06,709 --> 00:56:09,769
- Should I bring the peas?
- What peas?

715
00:56:09,945 --> 00:56:13,437
When she was delirious
she asked for peas. It's a good sign.

716
00:56:13,515 --> 00:56:15,278
No, just forget about it.

717
00:56:15,351 --> 00:56:17,216
- If you need anything, let us know.
- Yes, thanks.

718
00:56:23,192 --> 00:56:29,529
Carla, is this the first time you've run
such a high fever so suddenly?

719
00:56:33,035 --> 00:56:37,665
No. It shoots up over nothing.

720
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:40,470
Then it goes away.
My husband is used to it.

721
00:56:41,076 --> 00:56:42,737
It doesn't scare him

722
00:56:44,113 --> 00:56:46,775
No, don't get up.
Stay under the covers.

723
00:56:47,016 --> 00:56:50,543
- I'm so hot. I'm thirsty.
- Wait, I'll give it to you. Here.

724
00:56:54,156 --> 00:56:56,090
Drink slowly or you'll get
all bloated!

725
00:56:58,594 --> 00:57:01,188
- Is it day or night?
- What are you talking about?

726
00:57:01,263 --> 00:57:02,787
It's four o'clock in the afternoon.

727
00:57:03,332 --> 00:57:05,926
Listen, now we'll wait for the
doctor and see what he has to say.

728
00:57:06,001 --> 00:57:09,061
It wouldn't be a bad idea to send
your husband a telegram.

729
00:57:09,204 --> 00:57:12,765
We can't take full responsibility for this.
Yes, he ought to know.

730
00:57:14,543 --> 00:57:17,569
No, I don't want it to be over.
If he comes, he'll take me away.

731
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,805
And I have bought
so many nice little dresses.

732
00:57:20,883 --> 00:57:22,680
Why did you gorge on
all that water?

733
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:24,616
That's for sick people.
Are you sick?

734
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:27,614
You're always ready when
there's something to gorge on.

735
00:57:28,824 --> 00:57:31,349
What else should I do?
You're always leaving me here alone.

736
00:57:35,731 --> 00:57:38,029
I drafted my will two years ago.

737
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:42,633
Anyway, it's not like you die sooner
just because you make a will.

738
00:57:43,539 --> 00:57:47,942
You see, I have a brother
and a sister too,

739
00:57:48,844 --> 00:57:51,506
but I'd like the apartment
to go to my husband.

740
00:57:51,847 --> 00:57:55,749
It's mine, but how would
the poor thing manage with out it...

741
00:57:55,818 --> 00:57:57,843
even if he does get remarried?

742
00:57:58,153 --> 00:58:00,087
Ah, these sheets!

743
00:58:03,025 --> 00:58:09,624
Listen, tell me the truth,
the truth, you hear?

744
00:58:10,632 --> 00:58:12,725
Why do you stay with me?

745
00:58:14,703 --> 00:58:17,331
What can I tell the Cardinal tomorrow?

746
00:58:18,941 --> 00:58:22,741
Yes, I did read the little synopsis
your producer sent us.

747
00:58:22,811 --> 00:58:25,803
It's very interesting.
From a factual point of view though,

748
00:58:25,881 --> 00:58:28,315
the meeting between
the protagonist

749
00:58:28,384 --> 00:58:30,978
and a prince of the church could
not happen during a mud treatment

750
00:58:31,053 --> 00:58:34,545
as you describe it.
I'm sorry but it's absolutely not feasible.

751
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:37,023
A high prelate has his
own private room.

752
00:58:37,092 --> 00:58:39,925
True, but I was looking for
an unconventional setting.

753
00:58:39,995 --> 00:58:41,121
What do you mean?

754
00:58:41,196 --> 00:58:43,994
The protagonist received
a Catholic upbringing and...

755
00:58:44,066 --> 00:58:47,297
- Good morning.
- Monsignor, this is Guido Anselmi.

756
00:58:47,369 --> 00:58:48,927
Nice to meet you.
You must be the director.

757
00:58:49,004 --> 00:58:50,096
Yes.

758
00:58:50,172 --> 00:58:53,073
Is the subject of this film
a religious one?

759
00:58:53,142 --> 00:58:54,871
Well, yes, in a manner of speaking.

760
00:58:54,943 --> 00:58:58,777
As I was saying, the protagonist
had a Catholic upbringing,

761
00:58:58,847 --> 00:59:01,645
Iike all of us, for that matter.
So, he has certain complexes,

762
00:59:01,683 --> 00:59:04,618
certain needs he can no
longer repress.

763
00:59:05,053 --> 00:59:08,079
And a prince of the church appears to him
like the depositary of a truth

764
00:59:08,157 --> 00:59:10,523
that he can no longer accept
although it still fascinates him.

765
00:59:10,592 --> 00:59:14,494
So, he seeks contact, some help,
perhaps a flash of understanding.

766
00:59:14,763 --> 00:59:16,390
Saul in Damascus, right?

767
00:59:16,465 --> 00:59:18,365
Don't we all harbor such hopes?

768
00:59:18,434 --> 00:59:21,198
I do realize the idea might sound a
bit superficial, gothic if you want...

769
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:23,033
No, no, that's not it.

770
00:59:23,105 --> 00:59:27,132
I don't believe cinema
lends itself well to certain topics.

771
00:59:27,209 --> 00:59:31,669
You mix sacred
and profane love too casually.

772
00:59:31,747 --> 00:59:33,339
Isn't that so?
- Maybe.

773
00:59:33,415 --> 00:59:35,679
Yours is a great responsibility.

774
00:59:35,751 --> 00:59:38,879
You can either corrupt
or educate thousands of souls.

775
00:59:39,021 --> 00:59:41,251
His Eminence
will listen to you all the same.

776
00:59:41,557 --> 00:59:44,048
You can ask him some questions.

777
00:59:48,096 --> 00:59:50,792
Allow me to introduce you
to the director.

778
00:59:53,202 --> 00:59:54,931
Please, do sit down.

779
00:59:56,572 --> 01:00:00,008
Please pardon the intrusion,
Your Eminence. I wouldn't presume,

780
01:00:00,075 --> 01:00:04,171
But my producer is restless,
perhaps he's right,

781
01:00:04,246 --> 01:00:05,975
and he insisted that l...

782
01:00:06,949 --> 01:00:08,974
- Are you married?
- Yes.

783
01:00:09,885 --> 01:00:12,012
- Any children?
- Yes. I mean, no.

784
01:00:13,021 --> 01:00:14,784
- How old are you?
- 43.

785
01:00:19,628 --> 01:00:22,096
- Do you hear this singing bird?
- Pardon?

786
01:00:22,498 --> 01:00:24,193
- Do you know what it's called?
- No.

787
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,892
It's called Diomedeo.

788
01:00:27,769 --> 01:00:31,933
The legend has it that
when Diomedes died,

789
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:36,000
all these little birds gathered
and accompanied him to his grave

790
01:00:36,144 --> 01:00:39,272
singing a funeral lamentation.

791
01:00:41,483 --> 01:00:43,849
Hear? It sounds like wailing.

792
01:01:17,052 --> 01:01:24,151
Guido, Guido let's go see
the Saraghina.

793
01:01:28,363 --> 01:01:29,591
Coming.

794
01:02:03,432 --> 01:02:05,297
Saraghina, dance the Rumba.

795
01:02:06,668 --> 01:02:08,226
Here.

796
01:04:57,005 --> 01:04:59,974
Shame on you, shame on you...

797
01:05:00,308 --> 01:05:02,435
It's a mortal sin, it's a mortal sin...

798
01:05:02,511 --> 01:05:05,378
I don't believe it, it can't be true...

799
01:05:07,749 --> 01:05:09,774
Look at your mother, look at her!

800
01:05:09,851 --> 01:05:11,512
- Mother.
- Stop there.

801
01:05:11,686 --> 01:05:19,115
Oh God, I'm so ashamed,
so ashamed and hurt!

802
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:59,030
But above all, during his whole life
and in any place where he lived,

803
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:04,060
the pious Luigi most abhorred
any talk or dealing with women,

804
01:06:04,139 --> 01:06:06,937
whose presence he avoided
in such a way that whoever

805
01:06:07,008 --> 01:06:11,308
saw him thought he had a natural
dislike of them...

806
01:06:13,281 --> 01:06:14,441
Get down!

807
01:06:43,778 --> 01:06:46,372
Don't you know that Saraghina
is the devil?

808
01:06:47,148 --> 01:06:49,378
No, I didn't. I really did not.

809
01:07:55,283 --> 01:07:56,773
So, what does it mean?

810
01:08:00,822 --> 01:08:03,017
It's a character inspired by
your childhood memories.

811
01:08:03,758 --> 01:08:06,192
No connection with a real
critical conscience.

812
01:08:07,362 --> 01:08:10,388
No, if you really want to make
a polemical piece

813
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:15,334
about the ltalian Catholic
consciousness, you would need

814
01:08:15,403 --> 01:08:20,500
a much higher degree of culture

815
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:24,635
as well as inexorable logic and clarity.

816
01:08:25,447 --> 01:08:31,977
Forgive me, but...
your naivete' is a serious failing.

817
01:08:32,687 --> 01:08:35,622
Your little memories,
bathed in nostalgia,

818
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:38,784
your inoffensive and fundamentally
sentimental evocations

819
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:40,327
are all the expressions
of an accomplice...

820
01:08:40,395 --> 01:08:43,262
"How?" said the parish priest,
"With a communist?"

821
01:08:43,465 --> 01:08:45,365
See? He didn't say: 'a man'.

822
01:08:45,633 --> 01:08:47,692
Catholic conscience?

823
01:08:49,137 --> 01:08:54,234
Just think what Suetonious was
at the time of the Caesars!

824
01:08:54,743 --> 01:09:00,978
No, your intention was to denounce,
but you end up

825
01:09:01,049 --> 01:09:03,643
supporting it like an accomplice.

826
01:09:03,985 --> 01:09:07,079
See? What confusion...
what ambiguity!

827
01:09:14,496 --> 01:09:18,364
Dear Doctor, I'm very angry with you!

828
01:09:18,933 --> 01:09:20,400
But you don't need me anymore.

829
01:09:20,468 --> 01:09:22,299
That isn't true, absolutely not true.

830
01:09:22,370 --> 01:09:25,669
1 27: showers and mud treatments.

831
01:09:25,807 --> 01:09:28,401
1 29: massages.

832
01:09:29,344 --> 01:09:32,142
1 31 : inhalations.

833
01:09:49,197 --> 01:09:50,664
Hello, Commendatore.

834
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:55,898
You know, I've figured out
what you're trying to talk about...

835
01:09:55,970 --> 01:10:00,964
Man's inner confusion.
But you've got to be clearer.

836
01:10:01,042 --> 01:10:04,273
You have to make yourself understood.
Otherwise what's the use of it?

837
01:10:06,948 --> 01:10:08,916
Let's go, Guido.

838
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,552
If what you have to say
is interesting,

839
01:10:20,628 --> 01:10:22,118
it must be so for everybody.

840
01:10:22,497 --> 01:10:25,660
How can you not care
if audiences understand?

841
01:10:26,267 --> 01:10:30,795
I'm sorry, but that is
arrogant and presumptuous

842
01:10:30,939 --> 01:10:34,841
Commendatore, let's go over there.
Inhale. Breathe deeply.

843
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:36,077
Hi, Guido.

844
01:10:36,478 --> 01:10:38,412
I've saved you a spot by the jet.

845
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,414
I went to the spaceship this morning

846
01:10:40,482 --> 01:10:43,246
and it's already gone up 50 meters...

847
01:11:01,636 --> 01:11:02,694
Mario.

848
01:11:24,192 --> 01:11:30,563
Guido, his Eminence is
waiting for you. I repeat.

849
01:11:31,399 --> 01:11:35,165
His Eminence is waiting.

850
01:11:37,505 --> 01:11:39,268
Get dressed, quickly.

851
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:41,501
The Cardinal is already waiting.

852
01:11:41,576 --> 01:11:42,543
Tell him everything.

853
01:11:42,610 --> 01:11:44,407
Confess everything,
don't hide anything

854
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:47,937
and if you have any spare time just
put in a good word for me too.

855
01:11:48,683 --> 01:11:52,016
It's a golden opportunity, Guido.
The Cardinal! You're so lucky.

856
01:11:52,086 --> 01:11:54,418
He can give dispensations for anything...

857
01:11:54,489 --> 01:11:57,253
Remember my divorce in Mexico City.
Get me my Mexican divorce.

858
01:11:57,325 --> 01:11:58,758
He won't say no to you.

859
01:11:58,826 --> 01:12:01,852
And above all show you're devout,
throw yourself down on your knees,

860
01:12:01,930 --> 01:12:04,797
kiss his ring, cry,
say you've repented.

861
01:12:04,866 --> 01:12:09,599
Getting in their good graces means
you can have anything you want in life.

862
01:12:09,938 --> 01:12:10,905
Listen to me.

863
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:14,634
Careful, Guido. We're in your hands.

864
01:12:20,682 --> 01:12:22,582
You only get five minutes.

865
01:12:37,899 --> 01:12:40,925
Your Eminence, I'm not happy.

866
01:12:43,338 --> 01:12:48,105
Why should you be?
That isn't your job.

867
01:12:50,612 --> 01:12:54,048
Who told you we come into the world
to be happy?

868
01:12:54,582 --> 01:13:01,579
Origen says in his homilies:
Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus.

869
01:13:03,057 --> 01:13:06,026
There's no salvation outside
the church.

870
01:13:06,628 --> 01:13:10,120
Extra Ecclesiam, nemo salvatur.

871
01:13:11,366 --> 01:13:14,529
No one will meet salvation,
outside the church.

872
01:13:17,038 --> 01:13:21,202
Salus extra Ecclesiam, non est.

873
01:13:22,844 --> 01:13:26,075
There's no salvation outside
the church.

874
01:13:27,782 --> 01:13:32,378
Civitas dei. He who isn't
in the City of God,

875
01:13:33,054 --> 01:13:36,683
belongs to the City of the Devil.

876
01:14:00,682 --> 01:14:04,083
Come see this great
human phenomenon, the fakir Siva,

877
01:14:04,218 --> 01:14:06,743
who has broken all
previous records...

878
01:14:06,821 --> 01:14:10,951
our experiment is controlled daily
by European experts...

879
01:14:35,550 --> 01:14:40,749
20,000... 22... 23,000...
and the lady in the back?

880
01:14:40,822 --> 01:14:44,155
25,000? Very well,
the bid is 24,000.

881
01:14:44,225 --> 01:14:46,022
Do I hear 30,000?

882
01:14:46,094 --> 01:14:51,862
Splendid. 35,000... 40,000.
Going, going...

883
01:14:51,933 --> 01:14:57,371
One more offer?
50,000, the bid is 50,000...

884
01:15:18,393 --> 01:15:20,520
- When did you get here?
- Around five.

885
01:15:20,595 --> 01:15:22,222
We went to the hotel,
but you weren't there.

886
01:15:23,264 --> 01:15:24,731
How are you?
- Fine, fine.

887
01:15:26,667 --> 01:15:27,691
Who did you come with?

888
01:15:27,769 --> 01:15:30,329
With Rossella and Enrico.
Tilde's here too.

889
01:15:35,076 --> 01:15:37,874
Good girl. You actually came.
You look good, you know?

890
01:15:40,114 --> 01:15:41,274
Hey there, Rossa.

891
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:44,544
It's been a year since
we last danced together.

892
01:15:47,155 --> 01:15:50,022
Luisa, darling. You're my treasure.

893
01:15:50,391 --> 01:15:53,758
I'm so happy you came.
It's always the same.

894
01:15:53,828 --> 01:15:56,661
As soon you're away...

895
01:15:56,864 --> 01:15:58,126
You feel lonely.

896
01:15:58,433 --> 01:16:01,061
Is it true? Did you miss me?
- Yes.

897
01:16:03,137 --> 01:16:06,004
You weren't enjoying the company
of all these lovely ladies?

898
01:16:06,274 --> 01:16:07,969
So you've noticed them...

899
01:16:08,042 --> 01:16:10,476
No flings since you left?

900
01:16:10,545 --> 01:16:13,480
Poor Guido.
And your famous virility?

901
01:16:13,848 --> 01:16:15,611
- You smell so good.
- Do you like it?

902
01:16:15,683 --> 01:16:16,911
You're so light.

903
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:21,015
And how's your project going?
Better?

904
01:16:21,088 --> 01:16:24,580
Well, I don't think I've had
any major breakthroughs.

905
01:16:25,026 --> 01:16:28,518
But what's it about?
What are you up to this time?

906
01:16:30,198 --> 01:16:31,859
Oh, sorry.

907
01:16:33,301 --> 01:16:35,792
Listen, am I mistaken
or has Enrico fallen for you?

908
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:43,872
She's adorable, isn't she?

909
01:16:51,018 --> 01:16:52,508
Bravo. Very good.

910
01:16:52,687 --> 01:16:54,177
Evening signora.
So nice to have you here.

911
01:16:54,255 --> 01:16:55,244
Thanks.

912
01:16:55,790 --> 01:16:59,226
Maestro, we're at your service.
Should we get going?

913
01:16:59,293 --> 01:17:00,555
I'm coming.

914
01:17:00,728 --> 01:17:02,525
My dear lady, tonight you'll see

915
01:17:02,597 --> 01:17:05,828
the depths of insanity
a producer can fall into.

916
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:09,199
Frankly, I'd rather not
shake hands with this one.

917
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:12,296
The moment she touches you
she knows what you're thinking.

918
01:17:12,373 --> 01:17:14,568
Who else could it be?

919
01:17:14,642 --> 01:17:16,405
Your guiding spirit.

920
01:17:16,477 --> 01:17:18,775
Haven't you reached
that stage of intimacy yet?

921
01:17:18,846 --> 01:17:21,610
- May I introduce my sister?
- Ah, the beautiful little sister!

922
01:17:21,682 --> 01:17:24,674
You see the kind of women
your director attracts?

923
01:17:24,752 --> 01:17:26,014
Delighted to meet you,
Commendatore.

924
01:17:26,053 --> 01:17:28,783
I just finished a screenplay
about nuclear warfare.

925
01:17:28,856 --> 01:17:31,416
Only a producer of your courage
could get it made.

926
01:17:31,492 --> 01:17:34,188
Does the beautiful sorceress
belong to your harem too?

927
01:17:34,262 --> 01:17:37,527
Iet's say I'm a sort of overseer.

928
01:17:38,733 --> 01:17:41,896
So are you any better?
Has your isolation helped?

929
01:17:43,004 --> 01:17:45,063
You do look better.
- Really?

930
01:17:45,506 --> 01:17:48,373
No. Just kidding. Are you better?
Actually, I was a little worried.

931
01:17:48,442 --> 01:17:50,171
It was good of you to ask Luisa to come.

932
01:17:50,244 --> 01:17:51,973
The very thought made her happy.

933
01:17:52,046 --> 01:17:55,573
If you don't mind I'd rather not come.
My presence is futile.

934
01:17:55,650 --> 01:17:59,916
- Suit yourself.
-No, my friend. I insist. Get in Conocchia's car.

935
01:18:00,154 --> 01:18:02,145
Sweetie move it, go with Laura.

936
01:18:02,223 --> 01:18:04,384
- Where's your wife?
- I don't know. She was just here.

937
01:18:04,926 --> 01:18:06,120
Rossella, come with us.

938
01:18:06,193 --> 01:18:09,560
Yes, I want to tell you
a strange story.

939
01:18:10,131 --> 01:18:12,725
My sister was a nun.
She died very young

940
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:17,635
and one night her portrait
suddenly changed its expression.

941
01:18:17,705 --> 01:18:19,468
Please, get in.

942
01:18:19,540 --> 01:18:22,134
Changed as if it wanted to warn me
about some danger...

943
01:18:22,176 --> 01:18:23,666
I'll sit in the front.

944
01:18:24,712 --> 01:18:27,374
So a couple days later
my uncle says,

945
01:18:27,448 --> 01:18:29,006
Let's go to the market, kid.

946
01:18:29,083 --> 01:18:33,144
He drove an lsotta Fraschini...
I was recounting a premonition...

947
01:18:58,813 --> 01:19:00,974
So what do you think?

948
01:19:01,048 --> 01:19:03,312
You have to be a little crazy
to listen to this director.

949
01:19:04,151 --> 01:19:05,846
Bundle up. It's damp.

950
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,738
Renato, where are you?

951
01:19:12,109 --> 01:19:13,804
Here, Commendatore.

952
01:19:14,378 --> 01:19:15,902
We've gotta be ready for the 20th.

953
01:19:16,347 --> 01:19:19,339
Follow me, ladies.
Careful. The ground is bumpy.

954
01:19:19,817 --> 01:19:24,083
It seems to me we're a bit behind.
- No. We're already up to 70 meters.

955
01:19:24,154 --> 01:19:25,280
Listen, what's up with Luisa?

956
01:19:25,322 --> 01:19:27,756
She's changed all of a sudden.
She's turned so nervous and angry.

957
01:19:27,825 --> 01:19:30,191
I don't know. She was so happy
to come see you.

958
01:19:30,261 --> 01:19:31,853
You might have said something
that upset her.

959
01:19:31,896 --> 01:19:33,989
- Never.
- And what's this?

960
01:19:34,064 --> 01:19:36,328
I find this extraordinarily fascinating.

961
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,995
This model will be
superimposed on the structure,

962
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:42,300
to create the illusion that
the rocket is on the launch pad.

963
01:19:42,339 --> 01:19:43,738
- Am I right?
- Right.

964
01:19:46,076 --> 01:19:47,839
This is the rocket's launch pad.

965
01:19:47,912 --> 01:19:50,346
The most important moment
in the movie.

966
01:19:52,216 --> 01:19:54,514
No photos.
- Just one, Commendatore.

967
01:19:55,352 --> 01:19:58,321
What is your husband up to this time?
Science fiction?

968
01:19:58,923 --> 01:20:01,153
What do I know? Ask him.

969
01:20:01,392 --> 01:20:04,122
Giancarlo wrote him
such a beautiful story about Martians.

970
01:20:05,696 --> 01:20:07,664
What is this amusement park for?

971
01:20:07,731 --> 01:20:09,824
You have no idea what
a job this was.

972
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:13,199
No construction company
wanted to take it on.

973
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:14,965
It rests entirely on sand.

974
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:17,564
How much concrete did it take?

975
01:20:17,975 --> 01:20:21,843
Tons! 400 tons.

976
01:20:21,912 --> 01:20:24,005
Commendatore, if you don't mind,

977
01:20:24,081 --> 01:20:26,982
I'll stop at the end of this
first flight. I have vertigo.

978
01:20:27,284 --> 01:20:29,980
For 80 million you could buy
at least ten apartments.

979
01:20:30,054 --> 01:20:32,750
It's a pompous shack, just like him.

980
01:20:33,824 --> 01:20:36,418
The little sister-in-law is not
exactly tender with our director.

981
01:20:36,493 --> 01:20:38,154
Maybe she's in love with him.
- With him?

982
01:20:38,228 --> 01:20:40,924
I pray day and night
that I'll be spared a husband like him.

983
01:20:41,165 --> 01:20:42,757
What now? More climbing?

984
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:44,425
I'd be glad to carry you.

985
01:20:44,735 --> 01:20:49,229
When I think he made me spend
80 million on this structure.

986
01:20:49,306 --> 01:20:52,275
Wouldn't a well-crafted backdrop
have been better?

987
01:20:52,676 --> 01:20:55,543
A backdrop! That's out of
your grandfather's time.

988
01:20:55,613 --> 01:20:57,672
Besides, are they your millions,
Conocchia?

989
01:21:00,084 --> 01:21:04,145
Luisa, are you cold?
Take my jacket.

990
01:21:04,221 --> 01:21:06,155
No, no. Thank you.

991
01:21:06,223 --> 01:21:07,986
Anyway, we're going
back to the hotel.

992
01:21:11,328 --> 01:21:12,852
Is something wrong?

993
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:17,765
You've gotten sad all of a sudden.
Am I wrong?

994
01:21:18,669 --> 01:21:21,968
No. I'm not sad at all.

995
01:21:26,243 --> 01:21:28,541
The sequence starts with an image
of planet Earth

996
01:21:28,612 --> 01:21:31,809
completely wiped out
by a thermonuclear war...

997
01:21:32,049 --> 01:21:35,678
Guido seemed glad to see you,
really.

998
01:21:35,719 --> 01:21:40,053
...and the spaceship, our new Noah's Ark,
tries to escape, while the rest of humanity

999
01:21:40,124 --> 01:21:42,888
seeks refuge on another planet.

1000
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,452
More than 1 0,000 extras,
even 1 5,000, a tragic crowd.

1001
01:21:48,232 --> 01:21:51,292
We're really going to see all this
in your movie?

1002
01:21:51,602 --> 01:21:56,164
The prophet is raising his voice.
He's decided to scare everybody.

1003
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:59,300
Why not? Don't tell me you also love
movies where nothing happens?

1004
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:02,440
In my movie I have all
sorts of things happen.

1005
01:22:03,414 --> 01:22:06,440
I'm putting everything in.
Even a tap-dancing sailor.

1006
01:22:07,351 --> 01:22:08,841
Sailor, come here.

1007
01:22:08,919 --> 01:22:10,944
What did you learn in America?

1008
01:22:10,988 --> 01:22:13,616
No, I don't want water.
Dance and I'll give you a part.

1009
01:22:14,925 --> 01:22:16,153
Dance.

1010
01:22:24,334 --> 01:22:26,461
What's up with you?
What's going on?

1011
01:22:26,537 --> 01:22:29,938
Rossella, cut the big sister tone.
It puts me off right away.

1012
01:22:31,675 --> 01:22:34,200
Mr. Director, what part do I get?

1013
01:22:40,017 --> 01:22:42,349
What does Luisa think about me?
What does she want to do?

1014
01:22:42,886 --> 01:22:44,786
What's my part? My part?

1015
01:22:44,988 --> 01:22:46,080
Go away!

1016
01:22:47,291 --> 01:22:48,986
You know Luisa.
She doesn't say much.

1017
01:22:49,059 --> 01:22:50,686
Not even to me,
and I'm her best friend.

1018
01:22:51,295 --> 01:22:54,958
I really don't know. She's lost.

1019
01:22:55,032 --> 01:22:57,091
One day she says one thing,
another day, something else.

1020
01:22:58,302 --> 01:23:00,634
Unfortunately, I think the only
thing she'd like

1021
01:23:00,971 --> 01:23:02,768
is for you to be someone else.

1022
01:23:03,107 --> 01:23:04,233
Why?

1023
01:23:04,308 --> 01:23:06,674
It's the mistake everyone makes.

1024
01:23:09,113 --> 01:23:13,641
But that kind little fellow,
is he in love with her?

1025
01:23:13,917 --> 01:23:17,148
You'd like that, so your conscience
won't gnaw at you anymore.

1026
01:23:18,021 --> 01:23:19,818
You're such a scoundrel.

1027
01:23:20,424 --> 01:23:25,521
Poor Enrico, he's so awkward.
Everybody's noticed.

1028
01:23:26,063 --> 01:23:28,827
He hangs around, listens to her,
keeps her company.

1029
01:23:29,399 --> 01:23:30,866
He's a great friend.

1030
01:23:35,005 --> 01:23:36,836
I thought my ideas were so clear.

1031
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:41,575
I wanted to make an honest film.
No lies whatsoever.

1032
01:23:42,746 --> 01:23:46,910
I thought I had something
so simple to say.

1033
01:23:48,218 --> 01:23:50,243
Something useful to everybody.

1034
01:23:50,387 --> 01:23:52,651
A film that could help to bury forever

1035
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:55,588
all those dead things
we carry within ourselves.

1036
01:23:58,262 --> 01:24:02,255
Instead, I'm the one without the courage
to bury anything at all.

1037
01:24:03,767 --> 01:24:09,205
And now I'm utterly confused.
This launch pad to deal with...

1038
01:24:12,309 --> 01:24:14,573
I wonder why things turned out
this way.

1039
01:24:16,847 --> 01:24:19,077
When did I go wrong?

1040
01:24:21,952 --> 01:24:24,079
I really have nothing to say...

1041
01:24:25,122 --> 01:24:27,022
but I want to say it all the same.

1042
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:32,351
And your spirits,
why don't they come to my rescue?

1043
01:24:32,930 --> 01:24:35,296
You always said they had
plenty of messages for me.

1044
01:24:35,566 --> 01:24:37,295
Let them get to work!

1045
01:24:37,501 --> 01:24:41,096
I've already told you,
your attitude is wrong,

1046
01:24:41,171 --> 01:24:43,833
Your curiosity toward them is childish.

1047
01:24:44,341 --> 01:24:46,275
You want too many guarantees.

1048
01:24:46,343 --> 01:24:50,074
- Fine, but what do they say?
- Always the same thing. Even now.

1049
01:24:51,114 --> 01:24:53,742
They're very reasonable spirits.
They know you very well.

1050
01:24:54,618 --> 01:24:55,949
So?

1051
01:24:57,654 --> 01:25:01,420
They say you're free,
but you must learn to choose.

1052
01:25:01,992 --> 01:25:06,088
You don't have much time.
And you have to hurry.

1053
01:25:08,966 --> 01:25:13,232
Guido, are you coming up?
Yes or no?

1054
01:26:01,118 --> 01:26:02,380
Room 320, please.

1055
01:26:02,552 --> 01:26:03,746
Nobody's in.

1056
01:26:04,488 --> 01:26:05,682
Fine, thanks.

1057
01:26:48,799 --> 01:26:49,959
Have you got a headache?

1058
01:26:51,001 --> 01:26:52,468
No, it's a tranquilizer.

1059
01:26:53,236 --> 01:26:54,430
Do you take them often?

1060
01:26:56,173 --> 01:26:57,697
Sometimes, to help me sleep.

1061
01:27:01,144 --> 01:27:02,668
What's worrying you now?

1062
01:27:27,738 --> 01:27:28,727
What?

1063
01:27:29,106 --> 01:27:31,199
Nothing.
If you could only see yourself.

1064
01:27:31,908 --> 01:27:33,239
Why are you laughing?

1065
01:27:33,577 --> 01:27:37,104
I don't think I could ever betray you,
if only because I couldn't bear

1066
01:27:37,180 --> 01:27:42,140
the ridiculous effort
of having to hide and lie.

1067
01:27:42,619 --> 01:27:44,484
But obviously it's easy for you.

1068
01:27:45,288 --> 01:27:48,746
Listen Luisa.
I am very happy you're here,

1069
01:27:49,226 --> 01:27:52,491
but I am very tired and sleepy.

1070
01:27:56,867 --> 01:28:00,303
Sleep then. Good night.

1071
01:28:06,877 --> 01:28:10,369
I don't know what you think my
life is like, reducing it all

1072
01:28:10,447 --> 01:28:12,711
to the pettiness of somebody
stealing from the cookie jar.

1073
01:28:12,816 --> 01:28:16,343
What do you know about my life?
What I hate and what I don't.

1074
01:28:16,686 --> 01:28:18,381
I only know what you show me.

1075
01:28:22,726 --> 01:28:24,421
What am I showing you?

1076
01:28:25,462 --> 01:28:26,861
Come on, tell me what you see.

1077
01:28:27,731 --> 01:28:30,723
You and your judgmental moralism.
What are you getting at?

1078
01:28:30,867 --> 01:28:34,667
Nothing. I know we've
been stagnating for years.

1079
01:28:35,372 --> 01:28:37,966
But it's you; you're the one
who always calls me back

1080
01:28:38,041 --> 01:28:39,702
and wants to start all over again.

1081
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:42,842
Once and for all, I don't want
to restart anything.

1082
01:28:43,313 --> 01:28:44,575
But what do you want?

1083
01:28:45,115 --> 01:28:48,482
Why did you want me here?
What good am I to you?

1084
01:28:48,819 --> 01:28:51,481
What are you trying to get from me?
What is it you want?

1085
01:30:12,235 --> 01:30:16,331
Don't fret. I'd already spotted
her last night when I got in.

1086
01:30:25,315 --> 01:30:27,749
I've asked no questions,
so don't say a word.

1087
01:30:27,918 --> 01:30:31,911
Spare me the embarrassment
of having to listen to your lies.

1088
01:30:36,526 --> 01:30:38,585
She must have been born
in March or April.

1089
01:30:38,628 --> 01:30:41,791
She's got all the characteristics
of an Aries. She's the Aries type.

1090
01:30:41,831 --> 01:30:44,061
I'll tell you what type she is.

1091
01:30:44,401 --> 01:30:47,928
Exactly the type most likely to make

1092
01:30:47,971 --> 01:30:52,635
a good companion for feeble,
spineless, confused men.

1093
01:30:53,710 --> 01:30:55,701
Luisa, I didn't know.

1094
01:30:56,246 --> 01:30:59,511
I'm seeing her for the first time,
like you.

1095
01:31:00,417 --> 01:31:03,181
Really, in a place like this,
where there are so many people,

1096
01:31:03,253 --> 01:31:06,381
it's no surprise to run into the poor thing.

1097
01:31:08,558 --> 01:31:11,425
So this is why you've been
tormenting me since last night.

1098
01:31:11,828 --> 01:31:13,420
You should have told me.

1099
01:31:16,032 --> 01:31:18,728
What annoys me most is
that people could think

1100
01:31:18,802 --> 01:31:20,565
I'd go with somebody who
dresses that way.

1101
01:31:21,271 --> 01:31:22,602
Have you seen her clothes?

1102
01:31:22,672 --> 01:31:24,503
Listen, can't we go for a walk?

1103
01:31:24,574 --> 01:31:26,098
Let's not talk about this anymore.

1104
01:31:26,176 --> 01:31:28,872
It's been over for three years.
Finished. Enough.

1105
01:31:31,948 --> 01:31:35,816
He drives me crazy.
He pretends he's telling the truth.

1106
01:31:35,885 --> 01:31:39,651
He acts honest.
As if he's the one who's right.

1107
01:31:41,191 --> 01:31:43,216
How can you live this way?

1108
01:31:45,528 --> 01:31:46,995
It's not right living this way,

1109
01:31:47,063 --> 01:31:49,463
not letting others know
what's true and what's false.

1110
01:31:49,532 --> 01:31:52,262
Is it possible that for you
it's all the same? How?

1111
01:31:52,302 --> 01:31:55,635
You're right. I know, I'm boring.

1112
01:31:56,973 --> 01:32:01,000
How sad having to play
the bourgeois wife who doesn't understand.

1113
01:32:01,645 --> 01:32:03,738
You tell me, what should I do.

1114
01:32:03,947 --> 01:32:05,744
I really can't laugh about it
the way you do.

1115
01:32:05,815 --> 01:32:07,783
No darling, I'm not laughing.

1116
01:32:10,287 --> 01:32:12,881
What do you tell her?

1117
01:32:17,927 --> 01:32:21,328
What disgusts me the most is that
you've mixed her up in our life.

1118
01:32:21,398 --> 01:32:23,923
She knows everything
about you and me.

1119
01:32:25,101 --> 01:32:28,366
That whore. Cow!

1120
01:32:31,508 --> 01:32:34,102
You're a real pain, you know.

1121
01:32:42,018 --> 01:32:43,417
And yet...

1122
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:09,372
Signora Carla, you sing so well.

1123
01:33:09,546 --> 01:33:11,309
No, I'm just an amateur.

1124
01:33:11,448 --> 01:33:12,881
And how pretty you look.

1125
01:33:14,050 --> 01:33:16,951
I've wanted to meet you for so long.
- And l, you.

1126
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:25,418
You're so stylish.

1127
01:33:25,462 --> 01:33:29,592
No, you're the stylish one.
Me, frankly, I'm a bit trashy.

1128
01:33:29,666 --> 01:33:31,401
What are you talking about?
This is so refined.

1129
01:33:31,401 --> 01:33:32,299
Do you like it?

1130
01:33:32,335 --> 01:33:34,428
It's a little outfit I found in Vogue.
- Really?

1131
01:33:34,471 --> 01:33:36,462
If you only knew how long
it took me to find it.

1132
01:33:36,506 --> 01:33:39,100
But you know,
when Carla wants something...

1133
01:33:52,856 --> 01:33:55,188
Here he comes!

1134
01:33:55,258 --> 01:33:58,022
Guido's here.

1135
01:33:58,928 --> 01:34:00,555
Good evening, women.

1136
01:34:00,630 --> 01:34:02,894
Close the door, there's a storm.

1137
01:34:04,134 --> 01:34:05,829
How are you? Well?

1138
01:34:05,902 --> 01:34:07,631
Every gift comes with its nametag.

1139
01:34:08,037 --> 01:34:10,335
Don't get mixed up.
This is Caterina's.

1140
01:34:11,441 --> 01:34:12,965
He's a darling!

1141
01:34:13,209 --> 01:34:15,507
And this one is for my darling sister-in-law,

1142
01:34:15,545 --> 01:34:18,480
because she's finally understood
how things should be.

1143
01:34:18,681 --> 01:34:20,273
We'll draw your bath right away.

1144
01:34:20,350 --> 01:34:22,181
Gloria, this is you-know-what.

1145
01:34:22,252 --> 01:34:25,244
Thanks. I need to talk to you, Guido.

1146
01:34:25,989 --> 01:34:28,253
I know what she wants to tell you.

1147
01:34:28,324 --> 01:34:30,815
Now we'll have to send her away
because she's acting jealous.

1148
01:34:31,094 --> 01:34:33,426
What were you doing upstairs?

1149
01:34:33,496 --> 01:34:37,432
I went to see those poor things.
They'd always be alone, if not for me.

1150
01:34:37,467 --> 01:34:40,959
The role doesn't suit her.
She's only a common bourgeoise.

1151
01:34:41,037 --> 01:34:42,231
She has no class.

1152
01:34:42,305 --> 01:34:44,933
Leave him alone now.
He's got to take his bath.

1153
01:34:45,208 --> 01:34:48,177
Oh Guido, this is splendid,
I've always wanted one like it.

1154
01:34:48,344 --> 01:34:50,812
Hurry, Carla, Hedy!
Get the buckets.

1155
01:34:53,883 --> 01:34:55,908
Guido, my husband wrote.

1156
01:34:55,985 --> 01:34:58,783
He wants me home for New Year's,
just for a day, do you mind?

1157
01:34:59,055 --> 01:35:01,922
If you do, I'll tell him I can't.
- I think that will be fine.

1158
01:35:02,258 --> 01:35:03,589
Come on, Carlotta!

1159
01:35:07,530 --> 01:35:10,363
- Who's that little black girl?
- A surprise from us.

1160
01:35:10,433 --> 01:35:12,901
She's from Hawaii,
don't you remember her?

1161
01:35:14,137 --> 01:35:16,628
You told us about her
so many times.

1162
01:35:21,845 --> 01:35:23,972
Thank you, Luisa. You're so kind.

1163
01:35:24,314 --> 01:35:26,043
Such a delicate little present.

1164
01:35:33,690 --> 01:35:35,055
That tiara is mine.

1165
01:35:35,124 --> 01:35:36,853
Yes, I know.
I'll give it back to you later.

1166
01:35:39,395 --> 01:35:40,657
Oh, darling!

1167
01:35:41,364 --> 01:35:43,457
What a thrill to find you here.

1168
01:35:43,867 --> 01:35:45,732
- How are you?
- Fine.

1169
01:35:46,202 --> 01:35:50,161
But do tell me, who are you?

1170
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:53,232
The name doesn't matter.
I'm happy to be here.

1171
01:35:53,543 --> 01:35:56,171
Don't ask me any questions.
- Can I stay?

1172
01:35:56,246 --> 01:36:00,410
Of course, you pretty thing.
I'm busy now.

1173
01:36:00,483 --> 01:36:02,110
But later?

1174
01:36:04,888 --> 01:36:07,049
Rossella?
What are you doing here?

1175
01:36:07,290 --> 01:36:09,724
Playing Pinocchio's wise cricket.
Do you mind?

1176
01:36:09,792 --> 01:36:11,054
No. But why are you laughing?

1177
01:36:11,127 --> 01:36:13,561
It's nothing. I just want to see
how you get out of this one.

1178
01:36:14,063 --> 01:36:17,590
You've finally got your harem,
King Solomon!

1179
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:19,497
- It was high time.
- Sure was.

1180
01:36:23,940 --> 01:36:25,635
Lower me down.

1181
01:36:25,942 --> 01:36:29,173
Aren't you a little scared?

1182
01:36:29,345 --> 01:36:31,313
Of what? Everything is going great.

1183
01:36:31,714 --> 01:36:33,238
Can I stay too? I'm having such fun.

1184
01:36:33,283 --> 01:36:35,547
I don't want anything.
I'll just watch you.

1185
01:36:35,618 --> 01:36:37,779
We have rules that must be
respected. Do you know that?

1186
01:36:37,854 --> 01:36:38,946
Come, help me.

1187
01:36:41,524 --> 01:36:45,460
It's a two piece suit with a busby
in ostrich feathers. Do you like it?

1188
01:36:45,828 --> 01:36:48,353
Hi Hedy, it's beautiful.

1189
01:36:49,532 --> 01:36:51,124
So, what are the rules?

1190
01:36:51,467 --> 01:36:54,402
I don't know. He promised me
a part in his movie and said

1191
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:56,438
I'd have to change dresses a lot.

1192
01:37:01,778 --> 01:37:04,440
Girls, that's enough. Get me out.

1193
01:37:06,316 --> 01:37:08,944
- Gloria, the talcum powder.
- Ah, yes.

1194
01:37:11,654 --> 01:37:14,020
Guido, do you know she prepared
something just the way you like it?

1195
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:16,354
- Really?
- A cake.

1196
01:37:16,426 --> 01:37:18,690
- Are you happy, girls?
- Of course!

1197
01:37:19,028 --> 01:37:20,723
Isn't this just what
you always wanted?

1198
01:37:20,797 --> 01:37:24,062
Certainly! Isn't he the best
kid in the world?

1199
01:37:24,434 --> 01:37:26,334
Nadine, hurry up with the powder!

1200
01:37:26,569 --> 01:37:29,732
Oh Nadine, what was it you used
to say in Copenhagen?

1201
01:37:30,039 --> 01:37:32,439
We're delighted to invite
our passengers

1202
01:37:32,508 --> 01:37:35,636
to spend the night in Copenhagen
due to a problem with the motor.

1203
01:37:35,812 --> 01:37:38,474
Just listen to her voice...

1204
01:37:38,548 --> 01:37:41,176
The company will cover
all expenses.

1205
01:37:41,517 --> 01:37:43,610
Good night to you all.

1206
01:37:50,226 --> 01:37:52,353
Madeleine, come help us.

1207
01:37:52,562 --> 01:37:55,622
- Saraghina!
- Here I am. I'll carry Guido.

1208
01:37:55,698 --> 01:37:59,134
Oh, my poor man. The water was
scalding. He's turned all red!

1209
01:37:59,202 --> 01:38:03,366
- Such nice, thin legs.
- Straight like when he was a boy.

1210
01:38:03,439 --> 01:38:06,101
He likes to act like a kid,
but he's really very complex.

1211
01:38:06,175 --> 01:38:08,769
Don't be fooled. I'm onto him.
He's a hypocrite.

1212
01:38:08,845 --> 01:38:10,278
No, he's not.

1213
01:38:10,346 --> 01:38:12,177
But why does he have to tell
everything to anybody?

1214
01:38:12,248 --> 01:38:14,443
He knows how to stand up
for himself.

1215
01:38:14,884 --> 01:38:17,352
Guido, help me.

1216
01:38:17,420 --> 01:38:18,751
Who's screaming like that?

1217
01:38:18,821 --> 01:38:21,255
Jacqueline. She refuses to
go upstairs with the old ones,

1218
01:38:21,324 --> 01:38:24,225
so we've locked her in the cellar.

1219
01:38:24,293 --> 01:38:27,922
It's scandalous. I don't want to
have to speak to those witches,

1220
01:38:27,997 --> 01:38:32,832
so much older than me. I'm 26.
Go to the Paris public register.

1221
01:38:33,603 --> 01:38:39,701
Jacqueline Bon Bon, 26,
the 4th of July 1 938.

1222
01:38:40,143 --> 01:38:42,634
You have no right
to send me upstairs.

1223
01:38:43,012 --> 01:38:47,176
It's not my time yet.
Look, I'm so agile. Look at my legs.

1224
01:38:48,084 --> 01:38:51,383
Which one of you has such a tight
little ass? Look at my chest.

1225
01:38:52,155 --> 01:38:56,683
Guido, don't send me upstairs.
I don't want to go upstairs.

1226
01:38:57,727 --> 01:39:01,163
You know the rules.
The rules are the rules.

1227
01:39:01,230 --> 01:39:01,821
Guido l...

1228
01:39:01,964 --> 01:39:05,092
Calm down. Apparently
it's nice upstairs, too.

1229
01:39:05,568 --> 01:39:08,162
- Your earring. Here.
- Thank you.

1230
01:39:10,673 --> 01:39:15,508
You've always loved me. Please,
tell him to give me an extension.

1231
01:39:15,678 --> 01:39:18,340
Guido, couldn't we give her
an extension?

1232
01:39:18,414 --> 01:39:20,905
What are you doing?
You're breaking my balls too?

1233
01:39:20,983 --> 01:39:24,510
I beg you Guido, just for one year.

1234
01:39:24,587 --> 01:39:27,522
- No extension.
- I'm not going upstairs.

1235
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:29,285
- What did you say?
- I'm not going upstairs.

1236
01:39:29,358 --> 01:39:31,849
- Say it again if you dare.
- I'm not going upstairs!

1237
01:39:31,928 --> 01:39:35,193
This one is crazy. I told you we
should never have let her in.

1238
01:39:36,032 --> 01:39:38,023
Hey, girl!
Just look at your rulebook.

1239
01:39:38,101 --> 01:39:40,797
Whoever passes the age limit
shall be removed to the upper floors,

1240
01:39:40,870 --> 01:39:42,861
where she shall be treated equally well,

1241
01:39:42,939 --> 01:39:44,770
but shall live basking
in her memories.

1242
01:39:44,807 --> 01:39:47,071
It's so disgusting, absurd,
we shouldn't have accepted it.

1243
01:39:47,143 --> 01:39:49,407
Never, right from the start.

1244
01:39:53,316 --> 01:39:55,250
It's not fair!

1245
01:39:55,885 --> 01:39:57,944
These are rules invented
by someone

1246
01:39:58,020 --> 01:40:02,582
who doesn't pass the test himself.

1247
01:40:02,959 --> 01:40:05,826
In France such a man would be
the shame of the nation.

1248
01:40:05,895 --> 01:40:08,022
Are we lemons to thrown out
after we're squeezed?

1249
01:40:08,097 --> 01:40:10,691
- Guido, they're so right.
- You're a monster.

1250
01:40:13,703 --> 01:40:16,137
Our time has come!

1251
01:40:16,205 --> 01:40:18,537
Hurray for Jacqueline, who has
shown us the way to our freedom.

1252
01:40:18,608 --> 01:40:20,769
Down with the tyrant,
down with Bluebeard!

1253
01:40:21,444 --> 01:40:24,413
We have the right to be loved
'til we're 70 years old.

1254
01:40:27,517 --> 01:40:28,677
Down with him!

1255
01:40:29,152 --> 01:40:31,086
And what do you think you are?
A boy?

1256
01:40:31,154 --> 01:40:33,714
Let's say it once and for all,
he doesn't know how to make love.

1257
01:40:34,157 --> 01:40:36,216
That's the truth.

1258
01:40:36,359 --> 01:40:38,088
- And he falls asleep right away.
- I don't sleep. I think.

1259
01:40:38,161 --> 01:40:41,221
Guido, don't send us upstairs
when we get old.

1260
01:40:41,664 --> 01:40:43,632
Down, down.

1261
01:40:45,601 --> 01:40:48,092
Quick!
They're rebelling upstairs too.

1262
01:40:52,775 --> 01:40:55,642
Oh, delicious!

1263
01:40:56,679 --> 01:41:01,776
You pig, you liar. I came all the
way from Paris. What's my part?

1264
01:41:08,424 --> 01:41:10,688
Guido, who will dance for you?
You liked it so much.

1265
01:41:10,760 --> 01:41:12,421
I don't like it anymore.

1266
01:41:13,062 --> 01:41:14,689
Luisa, help me!

1267
01:41:14,931 --> 01:41:16,990
Sorry, but I don't meddle
in my husband's business.

1268
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:20,133
If this is his decision, it's good.
Those are the rules.

1269
01:41:20,169 --> 01:41:22,694
Hurry up Guido, the soup's getting cold.

1270
01:41:22,939 --> 01:41:24,406
Can't you see I'm busy?

1271
01:41:25,575 --> 01:41:27,270
What an extraordinary man.

1272
01:41:27,343 --> 01:41:28,867
Yes, but...

1273
01:41:29,078 --> 01:41:31,512
He needs to act this way.
He does it almost every night.

1274
01:41:34,350 --> 01:41:37,012
Guido, do you remember me?

1275
01:41:38,120 --> 01:41:40,520
But darling, you're wounded;
I'll get you some cream...

1276
01:41:40,590 --> 01:41:42,148
- I don't want any cream.
- Some balm.

1277
01:41:42,225 --> 01:41:44,056
- I don't want any balm.
- Drops...

1278
01:41:44,293 --> 01:41:46,659
It's not true that he dumps you
like squeezed lemons.

1279
01:41:46,729 --> 01:41:48,788
Actually, he'd like to keep you all
with him always.

1280
01:41:48,865 --> 01:41:50,958
He is too good, too patient.

1281
01:41:56,105 --> 01:41:57,834
No, not me, no.

1282
01:42:16,092 --> 01:42:19,459
He doesn't like you. You're old.

1283
01:42:21,497 --> 01:42:24,591
Dear Jacqueline, we're happy
to have had the opportunity

1284
01:42:24,667 --> 01:42:28,433
to live with you and we wish you
the best of luck upstairs.

1285
01:42:28,838 --> 01:42:31,466
We'd like to reassure you
on Guido's behalf

1286
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:33,599
that you were the first
showgirl in his life.

1287
01:42:34,010 --> 01:42:37,878
You're now entitled to
a song and dance of your choice,

1288
01:42:37,947 --> 01:42:40,780
with your very own spotlight.

1289
01:42:41,450 --> 01:42:44,078
Thank you girls, you're so kind.

1290
01:42:44,153 --> 01:42:46,451
Would you like me
to sing a love song?

1291
01:42:46,856 --> 01:42:49,450
No, better something sexy.
That was my specialty.

1292
01:42:49,825 --> 01:42:52,658
Guido, remember
the Apollo theater in Bologna?

1293
01:42:52,728 --> 01:42:53,752
Yes, I do.

1294
01:42:53,829 --> 01:42:55,694
No, better a happy song!

1295
01:43:03,105 --> 01:43:05,335
Oh, I've lost my pearls.

1296
01:43:15,751 --> 01:43:17,412
Oh, again!

1297
01:43:26,095 --> 01:43:27,858
You're not even listening.

1298
01:43:43,579 --> 01:43:44,603
Farewell, Guido.

1299
01:44:15,311 --> 01:44:17,905
I thought it was such
a funny situation,

1300
01:44:18,581 --> 01:44:21,709
the funniest part of my story.

1301
01:44:22,451 --> 01:44:25,545
I'd even prepared a little
speech to give at the table:

1302
01:44:27,123 --> 01:44:33,084
Darlings, happiness is being able
to tell the truth

1303
01:44:33,162 --> 01:44:35,323
without ever making anybody suffer.

1304
01:44:36,465 --> 01:44:39,161
Carla would have played the harp,
as on any night,

1305
01:44:39,735 --> 01:44:42,260
and we would have been happy
hiding in here,

1306
01:44:42,571 --> 01:44:45,699
far away from the world.
All of you and l.

1307
01:44:48,077 --> 01:44:53,037
What's wrong? Why this sadness?

1308
01:44:53,549 --> 01:44:56,518
See? We've made him feel guilty.

1309
01:45:07,163 --> 01:45:08,562
That's not it, Guido.

1310
01:45:08,631 --> 01:45:10,189
It has been a wonderful evening.

1311
01:45:10,266 --> 01:45:11,699
You mustn't be sad.

1312
01:45:13,869 --> 01:45:14,995
Do you need anything?

1313
01:45:19,375 --> 01:45:24,278
Now they'll all go to bed
and I still have a lot to do:

1314
01:45:26,248 --> 01:45:34,713
the laundry, all the dishes,
mend the sheets, scrub the floors

1315
01:45:35,458 --> 01:45:37,926
and set up breakfast for tomorrow.

1316
01:45:44,733 --> 01:45:47,201
Aren't we fine living all together this way?

1317
01:45:49,472 --> 01:45:52,373
At first I didn't understand,

1318
01:45:53,409 --> 01:45:56,310
that this is the way things
are meant to be.

1319
01:45:57,012 --> 01:45:59,071
But now...

1320
01:45:59,248 --> 01:46:02,217
Don't you think I'm good now?
I don't bother you anymore.

1321
01:46:02,284 --> 01:46:03,774
I don't ask questions.

1322
01:46:07,656 --> 01:46:12,389
A bit slow, wasn't l?
It's taken me 20 years to understand.

1323
01:46:12,962 --> 01:46:17,058
20 years since the day
we got married

1324
01:46:18,868 --> 01:46:22,031
and you became my husband
and I your wife.

1325
01:46:24,173 --> 01:46:27,142
Do you remember Guido?
Do you remember that day?

1326
01:46:30,212 --> 01:46:33,375
If you could only be patient
a little longer, Luisa.

1327
01:46:34,483 --> 01:46:36,280
But perhaps you've had it.

1328
01:46:37,019 --> 01:46:41,012
Frankly, I'd love to be able
to offer a word of advice.

1329
01:46:41,423 --> 01:46:43,687
But I think tonight you're called

1330
01:46:43,759 --> 01:46:47,991
to solve a problem
for which there is no solution.

1331
01:46:48,063 --> 01:46:51,430
Finding a precise face
for a crowd of characters

1332
01:46:51,500 --> 01:46:55,561
that in your script are so rough,
so vague, so superficial...

1333
01:46:56,739 --> 01:46:58,172
What is it we're watching?

1334
01:46:58,674 --> 01:47:00,005
I don't know... screen tests.

1335
01:47:01,310 --> 01:47:02,470
You're not well.

1336
01:47:02,545 --> 01:47:04,308
Quite the contrary.

1337
01:47:10,686 --> 01:47:13,314
Agostini, get on the catwalk
and do a little dance for us.

1338
01:47:13,389 --> 01:47:16,017
I'll accompany you on the piano.

1339
01:47:16,825 --> 01:47:18,656
Listen here. "The solitary ego

1340
01:47:18,727 --> 01:47:21,696
that revolves around itself
and feeds upon itself, ends up

1341
01:47:21,764 --> 01:47:24,562
strangled by a great cry
or a great laugh."

1342
01:47:24,934 --> 01:47:28,495
Words that Stendhal wrote
during his stay in ltaly.

1343
01:47:28,804 --> 01:47:31,967
If we sometimes read those sayings
on chocolate wrappers

1344
01:47:32,007 --> 01:47:35,340
instead of throwing them away,
we would be spared many an illusion.

1345
01:48:05,507 --> 01:48:09,443
There he is. By the door,
always ready to run away.

1346
01:48:13,616 --> 01:48:15,948
Good evening to you all
and apologies for the delay.

1347
01:48:16,518 --> 01:48:18,281
Well, what are you up to now?

1348
01:48:19,088 --> 01:48:20,521
- Guido where are you?
- Here.

1349
01:48:20,589 --> 01:48:22,614
- Come down.
- I'd rather stay up here.

1350
01:48:22,691 --> 01:48:26,252
Evening... Good, you're here too.
Let's get going.

1351
01:48:26,328 --> 01:48:27,454
Right away.

1352
01:48:27,763 --> 01:48:30,425
They skipped the variety act tonight
so we could use the theater.

1353
01:48:32,434 --> 01:48:33,332
Let's go.

1354
01:48:34,470 --> 01:48:35,994
Young man, it's time
to make up your mind.

1355
01:48:36,839 --> 01:48:38,534
I've brought all the screen tests...

1356
01:48:38,607 --> 01:48:41,440
Pardon me Conocchia,
but the time for his jokes is over.

1357
01:48:41,810 --> 01:48:43,835
All his doubts, his uncertainties,
his whims.

1358
01:48:43,912 --> 01:48:46,972
He had all the time he wanted,
but tonight we're here to choose.

1359
01:48:47,049 --> 01:48:48,949
- That's why we're all here.
- Right.

1360
01:48:49,018 --> 01:48:50,679
Conocchia has gotten
everything from Rome.

1361
01:48:50,753 --> 01:48:54,086
The new and the old screen tests,
even the ones we shot five months ago.

1362
01:48:54,356 --> 01:48:57,052
Now we'll go through them one by one,
and you have to say:

1363
01:48:57,092 --> 01:48:59,356
This is the wife,
this is the mistress,

1364
01:48:59,428 --> 01:49:01,726
this is the Cardinal,
this is Saraghina. Clear?

1365
01:49:02,298 --> 01:49:05,358
I don't want to be the joke
of the ltalian film industry

1366
01:49:05,434 --> 01:49:07,459
but above all I don't want you
to end up that way.

1367
01:49:08,203 --> 01:49:09,761
They're all ready to shoot you down.

1368
01:49:10,139 --> 01:49:13,074
You've got very few friends left,
on the Left or the Right.

1369
01:49:13,142 --> 01:49:16,111
But I am here to help you
each and every way.

1370
01:49:16,312 --> 01:49:18,780
We must start shooting
and we must do it immediately.

1371
01:49:18,847 --> 01:49:20,280
Roll the screen tests.

1372
01:49:23,419 --> 01:49:25,284
Miss Olimpia's screen test.

1373
01:49:27,056 --> 01:49:28,148
Miss Olimpia...

1374
01:49:30,926 --> 01:49:35,989
- Should I shut the door?
- Yes. Sway, sway your big hips.

1375
01:49:36,665 --> 01:49:39,759
Put down your stuff. Good.

1376
01:49:40,002 --> 01:49:44,166
Now go to the mirror.
Admire yourself.

1377
01:49:45,307 --> 01:49:51,268
More. Swell your chest.
There.

1378
01:49:51,547 --> 01:49:54,607
Now go to the phone.
Slowly. Don't run.

1379
01:49:54,750 --> 01:49:57,184
- Why are you running?
- I'm not.

1380
01:49:57,519 --> 01:49:59,851
Look, hit that mark.
There, on the floor.

1381
01:50:01,523 --> 01:50:03,821
Hello, the concierge please?

1382
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:05,353
Speaking.

1383
01:50:05,427 --> 01:50:08,726
I'd like a bottle of flat water.

1384
01:50:08,797 --> 01:50:09,764
Fiuggi.

1385
01:50:09,832 --> 01:50:11,322
No, Fiuggi is sparkling.

1386
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:14,836
No, look this way.
Fiuggi is the least sparkling.

1387
01:50:15,070 --> 01:50:16,537
Fine, I'll take the Fiuggi.

1388
01:50:16,605 --> 01:50:18,266
Will this one do, Guido?

1389
01:50:18,374 --> 01:50:21,309
He's got to make up his mind
because she's leaving for England.

1390
01:50:21,377 --> 01:50:23,004
She's leaving next week, Guido.

1391
01:50:23,078 --> 01:50:24,546
- And who's this one?
- Shut up, you!

1392
01:50:24,546 --> 01:50:26,446
Or do you prefer this one.

1393
01:50:26,515 --> 01:50:27,607
This is an important character.

1394
01:50:27,683 --> 01:50:30,413
People need to like her right off the bat.
Right, Guido?

1395
01:50:33,922 --> 01:50:35,822
Signora, sit down
as if you were drained.

1396
01:50:35,891 --> 01:50:37,984
This character is a woman who
has lost the desire to fight.

1397
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:40,756
because... say your line...

1398
01:50:41,497 --> 01:50:42,361
- Without stopping?
- What?

1399
01:50:42,431 --> 01:50:44,058
- Without stopping?
- Yes, yes.

1400
01:50:47,603 --> 01:50:50,037
I am the one who's offering you
complete freedom.

1401
01:50:51,373 --> 01:50:54,137
Anyway, I'm no good to you this way.
I'm just a nuisance.

1402
01:50:59,081 --> 01:51:01,208
And who's this?
What should she represent?

1403
01:51:01,817 --> 01:51:03,876
Didn't you hear? She's the wife.

1404
01:51:08,056 --> 01:51:11,787
Still, she's likable, soulful.
Don't you think?

1405
01:51:12,428 --> 01:51:15,591
- Gimme a cigarette.
- I've run out. Enrico, fill us up.

1406
01:51:16,331 --> 01:51:18,196
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1407
01:51:18,267 --> 01:51:19,131
You're welcome.

1408
01:51:21,069 --> 01:51:22,502
I cannot go on like this any longer.

1409
01:51:22,571 --> 01:51:24,903
Now, you tell me how I should be.

1410
01:51:24,973 --> 01:51:27,271
Not someone who lies and swears
he's telling the truth

1411
01:51:27,342 --> 01:51:29,003
every second of the day.

1412
01:51:29,077 --> 01:51:31,875
That would be enough.
You don't even do that.

1413
01:51:32,181 --> 01:51:34,775
With you I never,
never know the truth.

1414
01:51:35,217 --> 01:51:36,684
Even in the smallest things.

1415
01:51:38,187 --> 01:51:40,212
Luisa, I care for you.

1416
01:51:40,856 --> 01:51:42,551
Lying is like breathing to you.

1417
01:51:42,758 --> 01:51:43,850
Repeat that, please.

1418
01:51:44,193 --> 01:51:45,785
Lying is like breathing to you.

1419
01:51:47,463 --> 01:51:48,862
So brazen.

1420
01:51:52,434 --> 01:51:54,163
- All lines from his life.
- Right.

1421
01:51:54,770 --> 01:51:58,137
I know this one. She's the princess.

1422
01:51:58,874 --> 01:52:01,069
Am I not alone already?
What are you giving me?

1423
01:52:01,777 --> 01:52:03,074
What have I got to look
forward to?

1424
01:52:03,145 --> 01:52:04,908
Look this way. Put on the glasses.

1425
01:52:06,348 --> 01:52:07,940
Repeat the last line.

1426
01:52:08,016 --> 01:52:09,608
Am I not alone already?

1427
01:52:09,685 --> 01:52:11,585
You have to say it,
yes, aggressively,

1428
01:52:11,653 --> 01:52:13,211
but also with deep bitterness.

1429
01:52:13,655 --> 01:52:16,385
He said:. What?
You want a separation.

1430
01:52:16,458 --> 01:52:17,550
You want to be alone.

1431
01:52:17,726 --> 01:52:19,626
But what would you do on your own?

1432
01:52:19,661 --> 01:52:23,791
And she answers:. why,
am I not alone already? Go on.

1433
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:27,698
Guido, there's no doubt
about this one. She's perfect.

1434
01:52:33,775 --> 01:52:36,471
Five months. We've been going
this way for five months.

1435
01:52:36,812 --> 01:52:38,302
But they're all so old!

1436
01:52:40,649 --> 01:52:41,707
Fiuggi is sparkling.

1437
01:52:41,783 --> 01:52:44,843
No, it's the least sparkling.
Louder.

1438
01:52:47,322 --> 01:52:48,482
Put down the phone.

1439
01:52:49,591 --> 01:52:51,218
Screen test for Miss Olimpia.

1440
01:52:52,561 --> 01:52:53,823
What about this one?

1441
01:52:53,896 --> 01:52:58,629
It's dangerous leaving me alone.

1442
01:52:59,968 --> 01:53:01,663
Why, what do you do?

1443
01:53:01,737 --> 01:53:02,931
Should I repeat the line?

1444
01:53:03,005 --> 01:53:08,910
No, just turn your little
head this way. Now, stop.

1445
01:53:10,045 --> 01:53:11,706
Where are you going?

1446
01:53:13,248 --> 01:53:14,772
Back to the hotel. I'm sleepy.

1447
01:53:15,150 --> 01:53:17,118
Wait a second. Listen.

1448
01:53:17,686 --> 01:53:19,119
What happened?

1449
01:53:19,288 --> 01:53:22,780
Nothing. Nothing ever
happens between us.

1450
01:53:24,426 --> 01:53:26,360
Were you offended
by something you saw?

1451
01:53:26,862 --> 01:53:27,692
It's just a movie.

1452
01:53:27,829 --> 01:53:29,626
I'm the first to understand that.

1453
01:53:29,698 --> 01:53:32,724
It's a movie, another invention,
another lie.

1454
01:53:32,801 --> 01:53:35,429
You put everybody in it,
but the way you like to see them.

1455
01:53:35,504 --> 01:53:37,369
But I know the truth.

1456
01:53:37,439 --> 01:53:41,375
The difference is that
I would never have the impudence

1457
01:53:41,443 --> 01:53:43,001
to tell everybody the way you do.

1458
01:53:43,779 --> 01:53:45,872
Go ahead. Make your movie.

1459
01:53:45,948 --> 01:53:47,006
No, I won't.

1460
01:53:47,082 --> 01:53:48,982
Indulge yourself. Stroke your ego.

1461
01:53:50,185 --> 01:53:52,551
Go make everyone think
you're so wonderful.

1462
01:53:52,988 --> 01:53:55,980
What could you ever teach strangers
when you can't

1463
01:53:56,058 --> 01:53:58,492
even tell the simplest truth
to the ones closest to you?

1464
01:53:58,527 --> 01:54:00,256
To the one who's been
growing old with you?

1465
01:54:00,295 --> 01:54:01,956
Come on Luisa. Cut the drama.

1466
01:54:03,999 --> 01:54:05,933
You were right to ask me here.

1467
01:54:06,668 --> 01:54:09,102
We needed to find closure.

1468
01:54:09,404 --> 01:54:11,929
This time, I assure you,
I won't be coming back.

1469
01:54:12,307 --> 01:54:13,934
You can go to hell!

1470
01:54:26,888 --> 01:54:30,289
Fine, just run, run.

1471
01:54:30,792 --> 01:54:32,987
Do what the doctor ordered, run!

1472
01:54:33,061 --> 01:54:37,828
Shut up! Throw this ignoramus out.

1473
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:39,890
Fine, now sing.

1474
01:54:40,602 --> 01:54:43,230
You may say I'm losing it,
but I have the bills here...

1475
01:54:44,373 --> 01:54:48,639
I'll never pay this one, never!
Conocchia, you're losing it.

1476
01:54:49,111 --> 01:54:51,671
Saraghina look,
we've got the money.

1477
01:54:52,381 --> 01:54:54,747
Saraghina, the Rumba, the Rumba...

1478
01:54:54,916 --> 01:54:57,851
Guido, would you please
say something? Please!

1479
01:54:59,888 --> 01:55:01,185
What about this one, Guido?

1480
01:55:02,391 --> 01:55:04,222
Frankly I preferred the one before.

1481
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:06,257
This one is from Naples.

1482
01:55:06,328 --> 01:55:10,424
Can't you see that I'm... stuttering.

1483
01:55:10,766 --> 01:55:14,031
When are you coming?
I'm tired of waiting.

1484
01:55:14,202 --> 01:55:15,032
Look at me.

1485
01:55:15,103 --> 01:55:17,298
Don't leave me alone!
You know it's dangerous.

1486
01:55:17,673 --> 01:55:22,337
Don't leave me alone.
You know it's dangerous, darling.

1487
01:55:22,477 --> 01:55:23,341
Look over here.

1488
01:55:23,478 --> 01:55:26,777
Why aren't you coming now?
Why are you keeping me waiting?

1489
01:55:27,149 --> 01:55:29,208
You know it's dangerous
when I have to wait.

1490
01:55:29,284 --> 01:55:31,479
Louder, louder!

1491
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:33,954
Countess, walk.

1492
01:55:36,291 --> 01:55:37,485
Don't touch me.

1493
01:55:37,559 --> 01:55:39,584
This way, this way.

1494
01:55:41,963 --> 01:55:44,431
Screen tests Mrs. Grazia, one.

1495
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:46,358
Just bare your shoulders
all of a sudden.

1496
01:55:46,435 --> 01:55:49,336
Saraghina, we've got the money.
The money.

1497
01:55:50,305 --> 01:55:52,535
Stop. Very good. Was it all right?

1498
01:55:54,676 --> 01:55:57,236
Signora, what do you think?

1499
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:59,143
If he won't speak up,
at least we can say something.

1500
01:55:59,214 --> 01:56:02,547
Somebody say something!
This is a democracy, right?

1501
01:56:05,020 --> 01:56:08,251
You can't hide. We've found you
anyway. How are you?

1502
01:56:08,590 --> 01:56:11,582
Hi, I'm Poletti,
from Claudia's press agency.

1503
01:56:11,660 --> 01:56:14,857
We met 1 5 years ago.
You might not remember me...

1504
01:56:14,930 --> 01:56:17,592
- Look, she's here.
- Where?

1505
01:56:24,272 --> 01:56:25,534
Excuse me.

1506
01:56:34,583 --> 01:56:37,051
- Claudia.
- How are you?

1507
01:56:37,119 --> 01:56:40,919
Well, and you?
You're finally here.

1508
01:56:41,089 --> 01:56:42,317
Let's go outside, all right?

1509
01:56:43,125 --> 01:56:45,093
This is Caroline, my secretary.

1510
01:56:47,863 --> 01:56:49,387
I'd like to talk to you alone.

1511
01:56:55,170 --> 01:56:56,637
When do we start shooting?

1512
01:56:57,105 --> 01:56:59,699
- Soon, very soon.
- And what's my part?

1513
01:57:00,475 --> 01:57:01,703
I'll tell you everything later.

1514
01:57:01,777 --> 01:57:03,642
I'm very happy to be working
with you

1515
01:57:03,712 --> 01:57:05,111
and I hope I'll be able to help you.

1516
01:57:05,447 --> 01:57:06,744
But you must tell me everything.

1517
01:57:08,216 --> 01:57:09,410
Where are we going now?

1518
01:57:19,394 --> 01:57:22,886
Well?
- This way.

1519
01:57:39,948 --> 01:57:42,314
You're so beautiful.
I'm at a loss for words.

1520
01:57:42,384 --> 01:57:44,079
You make my heart beat
like a school boy's.

1521
01:57:45,821 --> 01:57:46,913
You don't believe me, do you?

1522
01:57:48,190 --> 01:57:50,488
You inspire such deep respect.

1523
01:57:51,393 --> 01:57:55,022
Who do you love?
Claudia, who are you with?

1524
01:57:55,096 --> 01:57:56,961
- Who do you care for?
- You.

1525
01:58:00,135 --> 01:58:01,830
You arrived just in time, you know.

1526
01:58:03,338 --> 01:58:04,999
Why do you smile that way?

1527
01:58:05,073 --> 01:58:08,440
I never know if you're judging me,
absolving me, mocking me.

1528
01:58:08,510 --> 01:58:11,502
I'm listening. You said you wanted
to tell me about the film.

1529
01:58:11,580 --> 01:58:12,911
I don't know anything.

1530
01:58:19,054 --> 01:58:22,820
Could you leave everything behind
and start from zero again?

1531
01:58:24,226 --> 01:58:27,320
Pick one thing, and one only,
and be absolutely devoted to it?

1532
01:58:27,629 --> 01:58:29,824
Make it the reason for your existence,

1533
01:58:29,898 --> 01:58:32,230
the thing that contains everything,
that becomes everything,

1534
01:58:32,267 --> 01:58:35,896
because your dedication to it
makes it last forever? Could you?

1535
01:58:37,372 --> 01:58:40,432
All right, listen.
If I were to say, Claudia...

1536
01:58:43,211 --> 01:58:45,406
Where are we going?
I don't know the way...

1537
01:58:46,615 --> 01:58:49,049
And what about you? Could you?

1538
01:58:50,018 --> 01:58:53,613
The springs must be nearby.
Listen. Turn here.

1539
01:58:56,124 --> 01:58:58,251
No, this guy here, he couldn't.

1540
01:58:58,860 --> 01:59:02,318
He wants to grab everything,
can't give up a single thing.

1541
01:59:03,131 --> 01:59:04,189
He changes his mind every day,

1542
01:59:04,266 --> 01:59:06,393
because he's afraid he might
miss the right path.

1543
01:59:06,468 --> 01:59:08,561
And he's slowly bleeding to death.
- So this is how the movie ends?

1544
01:59:08,603 --> 01:59:09,900
No, this is how it starts.

1545
01:59:10,005 --> 01:59:11,973
Then one day he meets the girl
of the spring.

1546
01:59:12,040 --> 01:59:14,804
She's one of those girls that
distributes the healing water,

1547
01:59:15,810 --> 01:59:22,272
she's beautiful, young and ancient,
a child and a woman already,

1548
01:59:22,350 --> 01:59:27,117
authentic and radiant.
There's no doubt that she's his salvation.

1549
01:59:28,723 --> 01:59:30,520
You'll be dressed in white
and your hair will be long,

1550
01:59:30,592 --> 01:59:32,116
just the way you wear it.

1551
01:59:42,671 --> 01:59:44,104
Turn the headlights off.

1552
02:00:23,011 --> 02:00:24,137
And then?

1553
02:00:39,594 --> 02:00:40,959
Let's leave.

1554
02:00:42,897 --> 02:00:45,991
I don't like this place.
It doesn't feel real.

1555
02:00:46,868 --> 02:00:49,029
I like it enormously. Isn't that odd?

1556
02:00:52,540 --> 02:00:55,441
I didn't get much from your story.

1557
02:00:56,244 --> 02:01:00,203
A guy like your character,
who doesn't love anybody,

1558
02:01:00,515 --> 02:01:02,176
is not very sympathetic you know.

1559
02:01:04,319 --> 02:01:07,584
It's his fault.
What does he expect?

1560
02:01:09,090 --> 02:01:10,955
You think I don't know that?

1561
02:01:12,060 --> 02:01:14,585
You're a bit of a bore too.

1562
02:01:14,929 --> 02:01:17,762
You really can't take the least bit
of criticism.

1563
02:01:17,999 --> 02:01:21,628
You're so funny with that big hat,
made up like an old man.

1564
02:01:24,406 --> 02:01:29,173
I don't understand. He meets a girl
that can give him a new life

1565
02:01:29,677 --> 02:01:31,144
and he pushes her away?

1566
02:01:31,212 --> 02:01:32,907
Because he no longer believes in it.

1567
02:01:34,516 --> 02:01:36,381
Because he doesn't know
how to love.

1568
02:01:36,618 --> 02:01:38,950
Because it isn't true that
a woman can change a man.

1569
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:40,878
Because he doesn't know
how to love.

1570
02:01:40,955 --> 02:01:44,447
And above all because I don't feel
like telling another pile of lies.

1571
02:01:44,626 --> 02:01:46,526
Because he doesn't know
how to love.

1572
02:01:48,196 --> 02:01:52,257
I'm sorry, Claudia, for making you
come all the way here.

1573
02:01:53,134 --> 02:01:55,295
You're such a fake.

1574
02:01:55,537 --> 02:01:57,232
So, there's no part in the film.

1575
02:01:58,306 --> 02:02:01,400
You're right. There isn't.

1576
02:02:01,676 --> 02:02:05,703
And there's no film.
There's nothing anywhere.

1577
02:02:06,314 --> 02:02:09,909
If it were up to me
we would call it all off now.

1578
02:02:15,323 --> 02:02:17,188
Ah, here you are.

1579
02:02:17,258 --> 02:02:20,523
Where did you go?
We're starting next week.

1580
02:02:21,796 --> 02:02:23,525
Your producer had a great idea.

1581
02:02:23,598 --> 02:02:26,590
The greatest cocktail party ever
to launch a movie.

1582
02:02:26,668 --> 02:02:28,693
And you know where?
- At the launch pad. Tomorrow afternoon.

1583
02:02:28,770 --> 02:02:30,533
Radio, television,
and all the foreign press.

1584
02:02:30,872 --> 02:02:33,067
Come on, Guido, we're starting for real.

1585
02:02:58,533 --> 02:02:59,557
Catch him!

1586
02:03:06,841 --> 02:03:08,536
Let's go. Walk!

1587
02:03:08,610 --> 02:03:09,406
I want to go home.

1588
02:03:09,477 --> 02:03:11,968
Here, he's here.

1589
02:03:20,822 --> 02:03:22,585
Guido, where are you going?
It's over here.

1590
02:03:28,563 --> 02:03:31,088
Guido, I'm sure today will be
a beautiful day.

1591
02:03:37,205 --> 02:03:40,265
I'm really curious
to finally hear the story...

1592
02:03:41,743 --> 02:03:44,974
Don't you take yourself a little
too seriously, Mr. Anselmo?

1593
02:03:52,420 --> 02:03:54,786
Leave me alone,
I can walk by myself.

1594
02:03:59,861 --> 02:04:02,056
Good luck!

1595
02:04:05,099 --> 02:04:07,294
Dottore, here he is!

1596
02:04:10,171 --> 02:04:11,798
Calm down!

1597
02:04:11,873 --> 02:04:14,637
We've been waiting three days
for you. It's winter already.

1598
02:04:15,043 --> 02:04:16,374
Attention, please.

1599
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:25,708
...do you think of pornography
as an art form or...

1600
02:04:25,787 --> 02:04:28,255
...is pornography a more
intense form of...

1601
02:04:28,323 --> 02:04:31,884
...why don't you ever make a film
about love?

1602
02:04:45,340 --> 02:04:46,898
I wish to announce that...

1603
02:04:46,975 --> 02:04:48,704
Tomorrow... tomorrow...

1604
02:04:49,043 --> 02:04:51,443
What do you think
you can teach us?

1605
02:04:51,512 --> 02:04:53,571
Do you really think your life
can be of any interest to others?

1606
02:04:55,883 --> 02:04:58,579
He wants to say something.

1607
02:05:07,929 --> 02:05:11,057
Answer, say something, go on.

1608
02:05:11,666 --> 02:05:15,295
Anything at all! Say anything!

1609
02:05:16,170 --> 02:05:17,535
Do it for me!

1610
02:05:20,308 --> 02:05:21,639
I promise you...

1611
02:05:21,709 --> 02:05:25,440
...this film. And afterward,
what will you live on?

1612
02:05:26,748 --> 02:05:28,909
Are you for or against divorce?
Tell me, frankly...

1613
02:05:28,983 --> 02:05:32,009
Is that your main problem?

1614
02:05:32,086 --> 02:05:34,077
That you can't communicate?
Or is that just a pretext?

1615
02:05:34,322 --> 02:05:36,950
Your questions betray
a certain hostility.

1616
02:05:37,025 --> 02:05:39,493
I assure you my director
is in great form...

1617
02:05:39,661 --> 02:05:41,458
What should I do?
What am I supposed to do?

1618
02:05:41,996 --> 02:05:44,226
...he should be treated with respect,
because...

1619
02:05:44,499 --> 02:05:46,592
Conocchia, forgive me
if I treated you badly.

1620
02:05:47,001 --> 02:05:49,970
You were wonderful,
the best of them all.

1621
02:05:50,038 --> 02:05:52,029
He ponders, considers, reflects.

1622
02:05:52,540 --> 02:05:53,598
Speak! Answer!

1623
02:05:53,675 --> 02:05:55,575
I've paid for your confusion,
your breakdown.

1624
02:05:55,643 --> 02:05:57,167
For months I've been paying
for everything.

1625
02:05:57,245 --> 02:05:59,406
Quit this film and I'll ruin you.

1626
02:05:59,814 --> 02:06:01,611
He'll now be at your disposal.

1627
02:06:01,683 --> 02:06:03,014
The press always has been...

1628
02:06:03,084 --> 02:06:06,110
Claudia, where are you?
And your spirits, Rossella?

1629
02:06:08,589 --> 02:06:11,183
What should I do? Leave you?
Disappear?

1630
02:06:11,259 --> 02:06:13,193
You will never be
what you once were.

1631
02:06:13,461 --> 02:06:16,828
Will I ever be your wife?
When will you truly marry me?

1632
02:06:16,998 --> 02:06:19,489
Luisa, is it really true
that you want a separation?

1633
02:06:19,567 --> 02:06:20,625
That you want to leave me?

1634
02:06:20,702 --> 02:06:22,294
How can I go on like this
'til the end?

1635
02:06:22,370 --> 02:06:23,997
...and what does your wife think?

1636
02:06:29,243 --> 02:06:31,336
It's in your right-hand pocket,
Dottore.

1637
02:06:32,313 --> 02:06:33,507
So long, Guido.

1638
02:06:33,681 --> 02:06:35,512
I put it in your right-hand pocket.

1639
02:06:45,026 --> 02:06:48,655
Nobody gets away with this. Buffoon!

1640
02:06:48,730 --> 02:06:52,632
Out of there, out! You coward!

1641
02:06:53,601 --> 02:06:56,468
Just a minute, a little moment.
I'm thinking of what to say.

1642
02:06:57,805 --> 02:07:00,706
I'm coming... right away!

1643
02:07:03,444 --> 02:07:05,810
Such an incurable romantic.

1644
02:07:10,318 --> 02:07:12,786
Where are you running, you low-life?

1645
02:07:31,005 --> 02:07:33,565
Take it all down, guys!
The film is off.

1646
02:07:33,875 --> 02:07:36,935
In two days it all has to be gone.
Start right away.

1647
02:07:37,278 --> 02:07:38,745
Tear it all down. Come on!

1648
02:07:39,013 --> 02:07:40,878
- Is that it, Dottore?
- Yes, thanks.

1649
02:07:41,015 --> 02:07:43,813
So long, guys. See you next time.

1650
02:07:44,152 --> 02:07:45,414
Let's hope so.

1651
02:07:50,858 --> 02:07:52,052
So long, sailor.

1652
02:07:56,464 --> 02:07:58,125
You've made the right choice.

1653
02:07:58,199 --> 02:08:00,133
Believe me, today
is a good day for you.

1654
02:08:01,068 --> 02:08:03,229
These are tough decisions, I know.

1655
02:08:03,738 --> 02:08:07,504
But we intellectuals, and I say we
because I consider you such,

1656
02:08:07,809 --> 02:08:10,505
must remain lucid to the bitter end.

1657
02:08:10,978 --> 02:08:13,071
This life is so full of confusion already,

1658
02:08:13,147 --> 02:08:15,877
that there's no need
to add chaos to chaos.

1659
02:08:17,652 --> 02:08:20,712
Losing money is part
of a producer's job.

1660
02:08:22,690 --> 02:08:25,158
I congratulate you.
You had no choice.

1661
02:08:25,460 --> 02:08:27,155
And he got what he deserved,

1662
02:08:27,361 --> 02:08:31,161
for having joined such a frivolous
venture so lightheartedly.

1663
02:08:33,201 --> 02:08:35,533
Believe me, no need for remorse.

1664
02:08:35,803 --> 02:08:37,293
Destroying is better than creating

1665
02:08:37,371 --> 02:08:40,067
when we're not creating those few,
truly necessary things.

1666
02:08:40,508 --> 02:08:43,102
But then is there anything
so clear and right

1667
02:08:43,177 --> 02:08:45,441
that it deserves to live in this world?

1668
02:08:46,814 --> 02:08:49,783
For him, the wrong movie
is only a financial matter.

1669
02:08:49,951 --> 02:08:53,318
But for you, at this point,
it could have been the end.

1670
02:08:54,055 --> 02:08:56,819
Better to quit
and strew the ground with salt,

1671
02:08:56,891 --> 02:09:00,258
as the ancients did,
to purify the battlefields.

1672
02:09:00,695 --> 02:09:03,664
In the end what we need is...

1673
02:09:03,731 --> 02:09:06,859
some hygiene, some cleanliness,
disinfection.

1674
02:09:07,201 --> 02:09:11,661
We're smothered by images,
words and sounds

1675
02:09:11,739 --> 02:09:16,870
that have no right to exist, coming
from, and bound for, nothingness.

1676
02:09:17,245 --> 02:09:21,614
Of any artist truly worth the name
we should ask nothing

1677
02:09:21,682 --> 02:09:24,981
except this act of faith: to learn silence.

1678
02:09:25,419 --> 02:09:28,047
Do you remember Mallarme"s
homage to the white page?

1679
02:09:28,122 --> 02:09:29,419
And Rimbaud...
- Guido, wait!

1680
02:09:29,490 --> 02:09:32,288
...a poet, my friend, not a movie director.
What was his finest poetry?

1681
02:09:32,360 --> 02:09:34,351
We're ready to begin.

1682
02:09:34,428 --> 02:09:37,920
His refusal to continue writing
and his departure for Africa.

1683
02:09:37,999 --> 02:09:39,296
Congratulations.

1684
02:09:39,367 --> 02:09:43,167
If we can't have everything,
true perfection is nothingness.

1685
02:09:43,571 --> 02:09:48,508
Forgive me for quoting all the time.
But we critics... do what we can.

1686
02:09:49,176 --> 02:09:53,272
Our true mission is... sweeping away
the thousands of miscarriages

1687
02:09:53,347 --> 02:09:57,807
that everyday... obscenely...
try to come to the light.

1688
02:09:58,486 --> 02:10:02,946
And you would actually dare leave
behind you a whole film,

1689
02:10:03,491 --> 02:10:07,086
Iike a cripple who leaves behind
his crooked footprint.

1690
02:10:07,795 --> 02:10:10,127
Such a monstrous presumption
to think

1691
02:10:10,197 --> 02:10:14,463
that others could benefit from the
squalid catalogue of your mistakes!

1692
02:10:15,469 --> 02:10:18,131
And how do you benefit
from stringing together

1693
02:10:18,205 --> 02:10:19,604
the tattered pieces of your life?

1694
02:10:19,674 --> 02:10:22,472
Your vague memories, the faces of people

1695
02:10:22,543 --> 02:10:24,738
that you were never able to love...

1696
02:10:33,421 --> 02:10:35,946
What is this sudden happiness
that makes me tremble,

1697
02:10:36,023 --> 02:10:37,615
giving me strength, life?

1698
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:41,285
Forgive me, sweet creatures.

1699
02:10:41,362 --> 02:10:43,296
I hadn't understood. I didn't know.

1700
02:10:44,098 --> 02:10:46,658
It's so natural accepting you,
loving you.

1701
02:10:47,001 --> 02:10:48,628
And so simple.

1702
02:10:49,203 --> 02:10:52,172
Luisa, I feel I've been freed.

1703
02:10:52,673 --> 02:10:54,868
Everything seems so good,
so meaningful.

1704
02:10:54,942 --> 02:10:56,204
Everything is true.

1705
02:10:56,611 --> 02:10:58,579
I wish I could explain.

1706
02:10:59,246 --> 02:11:01,146
But I don't know how to.

1707
02:11:01,983 --> 02:11:05,919
So. Everything is confused again,
as it was before.

1708
02:11:06,053 --> 02:11:06,917
The lights!

1709
02:11:06,988 --> 02:11:08,546
But this confusion is... me.

1710
02:11:08,623 --> 02:11:11,683
Not as I'd like to be, but as I am.

1711
02:11:12,159 --> 02:11:16,095
I'm not afraid anymore
of telling the truth,

1712
02:11:16,163 --> 02:11:20,122
of the things I don't know,
what I'm looking for and haven't found.

1713
02:11:20,401 --> 02:11:21,891
This is the only way I can feel alive

1714
02:11:21,969 --> 02:11:24,631
and I can look into your faithful
eyes without shame.

1715
02:11:25,406 --> 02:11:26,964
Life is a celebration.

1716
02:11:27,041 --> 02:11:28,702
Let's live it together!

1717
02:11:29,844 --> 02:11:32,711
This is all I can say Luisa,
to you or the others.

1718
02:11:32,847 --> 02:11:34,872
Accept me for what I am,
if you want me.

1719
02:11:35,249 --> 02:11:37,683
It's the only way we might be able
to find each other.

1720
02:11:38,853 --> 02:11:40,753
I don't know if what
you said to me is right.

1721
02:11:41,489 --> 02:11:44,549
But I can try if you help me.

1722
02:12:44,418 --> 02:12:46,545
Just a minute.
I'll give you the go-ahead.

1723
02:12:57,164 --> 02:13:00,099
Now. Go to the curtain.

1724
02:13:09,744 --> 02:13:10,802
Draw it.

1725
02:13:12,780 --> 02:13:14,839
Everyone come down.

1726
02:13:14,915 --> 02:13:17,440
Talk to each other.

1727
02:14:08,836 --> 02:14:09,928
Mother.

1728
02:14:15,576 --> 02:14:18,977
Sgulp! I did understand what
you wanted to say, you know.

1729
02:14:19,046 --> 02:14:20,911
That you can't do without us.

1730
02:14:21,348 --> 02:14:25,307
At what time will you call me tomorrow?
- Fine, fine. Now join the line!

1731
02:14:25,352 --> 02:14:26,341
Maurice!

1732
02:14:30,558 --> 02:14:34,688
Come, quickly!
Stop fooling around.

1733
02:14:34,929 --> 02:14:39,628
Everybody hold hands!
Spread out! All together.

1734
02:14:42,236 --> 02:14:43,203
Maestro!

1735
02:14:43,838 --> 02:14:46,136
Let's all hold hands!

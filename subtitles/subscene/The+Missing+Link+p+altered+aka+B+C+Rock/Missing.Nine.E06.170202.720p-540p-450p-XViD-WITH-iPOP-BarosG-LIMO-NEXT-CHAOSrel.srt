00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,380
You son of a bitch!
Why didn't you listen to me?

3
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:20,610
- Ji Ah, it'll be okay... Ji Ah...
- Okay... Okay...

4
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,850
You son of a bitch! You dumb bastard!

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,190
You bastard!

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,160
Stop it!

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,810
You son of a bitch.

8
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,440
Why do you keep making me
into the crazy one, you bastard?

9
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,900
Yeol!

10
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,270
I found the necklace your brother
gave you. You wanted to find this!

11
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,270
Right? So Hee, please.

12
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,870
No! Don't go down there!
No! Why are you doing this?

13
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,560
Come to your senses! You can't! No!

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,220
- Let go of me!
- Get yourself together!

15
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,740
Let go!

16
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,850
What's wrong? Bong Hee, what is it?

17
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,230
I remember everything.

18
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,990
It wasn't me!

19
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,720
I didn't kill her!

20
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,700
She's on the move.

21
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,500
Take me to Seocho-dong, please.

will announce some new findings.</i>

24
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,360
<i>A few days ago, one of the 46 people
who went missing, Actress Yoon So Hee...</i>

25
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,880
According to Ra Bong Hee's statement...

26
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,090
<i>The special investigation committee
was silent about Ra Bong Hee's statement</i>

27
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:58,110
<i>so the nation is very interested
in the announcement today.</i>

28
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,510
<i>One person involved--</i>

29
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,630
Mister, please take me
to the Seoul Convention Center. Hurry.

30
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:10,110
<i>In order to tell the truth, Yoon So Hee's
cause of death will be announced.</i>

31
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,300
It's time.

32
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,020
Are we doing the right thing?

33
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,240
What would you know?
You just follow my orders.

34
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,860
Let's go.

35
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,770
<i>[Episode 6]</i>

36
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:52,250
Now, I will brief you on the daily record
related to the plane crash

37
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,080
of Legend Entertainment.

38
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,730
The special investigation committee
has been investigating the plane crash

39
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,470
and we rescued our first survivor

40
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,620
Ra Bong Hee, from Huizhou, China.

41
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,510
However, due to the trauma
from the plane crash

42
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,570
Ra Bong Hee experienced temporary
dissociative disorder and memory loss.

43
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:31,170
Seo Joon Oh, Lee Yeol,
Jung Ki Joon, Ha Ji Ah

44
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:37,240
<i>Choi Tae Ho, Hwang Jae Gook,
Tae Ho Hang, and Yoon So Hee.</i>

45
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,120
<i>Besides the fact that she spent four
months on a deserted island with them</i>

46
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,220
<i>she was unable to remember
any other details.</i>

47
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,750
And as a result, our investigation
became a little complicated.

48
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:53,260
Meanwhile, on the 17th of last month,
one of the 47 missing people...

49
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,090
Actress Yoon So Hee's body

50
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,510
was found in Huizhou, China.

51
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,650
<i>[On the 17th of last month,
actress Yoon So Hee...]</i>

52
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:12,630
She was murdered.

53
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,410
<i>And on the 19th of last month,
through cooperation with China</i>

54
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,230
<i>a deserted island was found in China</i>

55
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:28,010
<i>where nine missing people were stranded.</i>

56
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,770
Ra Bong Hee, who visited that island
to regain her memory...

57
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,520
<i>[Miss Ra Bong Hee's memory...]</i>

58
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,720
She said--

59
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,200
Um... They found another survivor.

60
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,150
Prosecutor Yoon. It wasn't me.

61
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,980
I regained...

62
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,830
all of my memory.

63
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,710
Ra Bong Hee, who visited that island
to regain her memory

64
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,030
is currently doing the best she can
to recover her lost memory.

65
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:26,200
That is all for our special announcement.

66
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,540
We will accept questions in writing.

67
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,070
Who's the survivor?

68
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,250
Hwang Jae Gook,
CEO of Legend Entertainment.

69
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,460
But there was an accident...

70
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,560
What's the problem?

71
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,390
After he was rescued, he was on his way
to questioning, but was in a car crash...

72
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,270
I'm sorry.

73
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,780
How long is this going to be dragged out?

74
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,530
Tell them to get him
to Korea as soon as possible.

75
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,250
And why is that girl here? Get her out
of here before the reporters get to her.

76
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,370
Are you certain?

77
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:15,480
- Yes.
- Then...

78
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,070
Who killed So Hee?

79
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,160
It's Ra Bong Hee!

80
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:25,800
- Did you really lose your memory?
- Do you remember who the killer was?

81
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,050
Please say something, Ra Bong Hee!

82
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:33,080
I'm sorry, we will announce it soon!
We'll contact you later!

83
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,500
- Please tell us!
- Okay, sure!

84
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,880
After I get things sorted, I'll bury you.

85
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,640
You son of a bitch!

86
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,940
You bastard!

87
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,080
Is he dead?

88
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,700
Dead? He just fainted.

89
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,720
- Let's go and get ready.
- Where?

90
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,750
We should go and find the kids.

91
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,250
I heard they're on the other island
shivering, waiting for us.

92
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,710
Right now?

93
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,890
Yes, right now. Why? Are you... scared?

94
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,480
No, I'm not scared. But I can't see
anything clearly right now.

95
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,510
If you can't see anything,
it's even worse for them.

96
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,890
If we're scared and tired,
they're even more... scared and tired.

97
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:15,500
Who'll save them if we don't?
They're probably starving and shivering.

98
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,930
It doesn't matter if we lose the boat,
and we end up living here forever.

99
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,270
People are more important.

100
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,940
I'll go even if I have cuts all over my
body. Even if my bones are broken.

101
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,950
I'll go no matter what.

102
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,090
To save our So Hee...

103
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,600
and our Bong Hee.

104
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:14,820
So Hee, are you okay?

105
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,120
Bong Hee, I'm sorry.

106
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,200
Blood! This won't do.
Let's go back to the beach, okay?

107
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,850
- Okay, get in.
- We won't all fit!

108
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,400
Who wants to come with me?

109
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,230
- I'll go.
- Okay. How about Ho Hang?

110
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,580
- Huh?
- Okay, you can come too.

111
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:47,030
CEO Hwang, please watch
Tae Ho while we're gone.

112
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:51,060
- I'll stay and comfort Tae Ho. Be safe.
- Mister, here.

113
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,110
- Ji Ah, don't get hurt.
- Okay. Be careful!

114
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,750
Okay! One, two, three!
Push from the back!

115
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,850
Okay! Get in! Get in! Get in!
Get in! Get in! Get in!

116
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,770
Geez!

117
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,390
- Wait!
- What are you doing?

118
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:27,680
Ji Ah, don't lose your cool
when we see Tae Ho, okay?

119
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,190
What are you talking about?
I'm going to kill him.

120
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:46,290
Here, get in! Hold this.

121
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,480
One, two, three!

122
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,820
One, two, three!

123
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,220
One, two, one, two...

124
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,070
- One, two, one, two, one, two!
- One, two, one, two, one, two!

125
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,880
- Joon Oh!
- One, two!

126
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,730
- Are we good?
- We're good.

127
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,940
- It's okay, right?
- Yes.

128
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,800
So Hee!

129
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,780
So Hee!

130
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,320
- Over here!
- Over there!

131
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,010
Are... Are you all right?

132
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,490
Ye... Yeah... Your head--

133
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,510
No, it's okay. Geez, what a relief.

134
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,910
What's wrong with your face?

135
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:59,510
Why... Why are you by yourself?
Where's Ra Bong Hee?

136
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,820
- She went to find something for me.
- Geez, what did she go looking for?

137
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,270
You... You should have gone with her.
Ki Joon. Ki Joon, I'll look for her.

138
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,090
- Okay, be careful.
- Stay here, okay?

139
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:14,140
It's only been two days,
but it's so nice to see you!

140
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,740
- I'm so sorry! I'm sorry...
- It could have been worse.

141
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,520
- I'm sorry...
- Why are you sorry?

142
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,740
The fire. The fire. The fire.
It was scary, wasn't it?

143
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,770
You knew we were coming, didn't you?

144
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,760
Geez, what a relief. What a relief.
It's okay, we'll live.

145
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:54,990
<i>- Who are you? Who are you?
- I'm the new stylist, Ra Bong Hee--</i>

146
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,510
<i>It's in your hands now,
whether we'll shoot today or not.</i>

147
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:01,040
<i>If you fire me,
I won't be able to support myself!</i>

148
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,120
You won't starve to death
with this strength!

149
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,570
<i>I told you not to eat it!
We're on a deserted island!</i>

150
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,500
Are you crazy? Why did you eat it?
Why? Why? Ew, gross!

151
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,040
<i>You're my stylist, and I'm your artist!</i>

152
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,440
Who calls their artist crazy?
Do you want be fired?

153
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,740
<i>Thank you for saving me.</i>

154
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,350
<i>You would have done the same for me.</i>

155
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,730
<i>I'll share the blame with you.</i>

156
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:47,990
<i>Hey, of course you should.
You're my stylist.</i>

157
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:51,260
Don't worry. I'll hit him for you.

158
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,670
<i>I'm sorry... for leaving you
behind by yourself.</i>

159
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,800
What are you doing over here?

160
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,040
Seo Joon Oh.

161
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:11,430
Seo Joon Oh. Are you really Seo Joon Oh?

162
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:16,080
Are you okay? You're alive, right?
You're really Seo Joon Oh, right?

163
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:22,620
Blood... Blood... What do we do...

164
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,330
Are you hurt? What do we do?

165
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,120
Eat.

166
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,230
Hey, Ra Bong Hee.

167
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,230
Listen to me carefully.

168
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,950
Don't put other people's needs
in front of your own anymore.

169
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,410
Don't go into the water by yourself

170
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,870
just to save someone.

171
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,290
Don't do anything dangerous
for other people.

172
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,320
I'll take the risk.

173
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,810
I'll go into the water, and I'll do
the dangerous things, so...

174
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,860
Don't do anything.

175
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,050
Got it?

176
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,260
Yeah, I figured it was hard for you.

177
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,710
Let's go home. I'm hungry.

178
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,180
Let's do it together.

179
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,570
Stay right by my side.

180
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,480
You can do that, can't you?

181
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,980
Let's go.

182
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,090
Ki Joon, where?

183
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:01,910
Take a right, a left, and a right.
Come here. Joon Oh. Joon Oh. Joon Oh.

184
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,540
Hey, what are you saying?
The trees all look the same...

185
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,960
So Hee. Here.

186
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,150
You can have it.

187
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,440
This?

188
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,830
No way, this is precious to you.
How could I...

189
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:27,430
That necklace...
has a really special meaning.

190
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,960
My brother told me this necklace
was going to protect me.

191
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,260
Then it's more meaningful to you.
Take it.

192
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,570
No, you should have it.

193
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,310
You were the one
who protected me all along.

194
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,520
If it weren't for you,
I would have died already.

195
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,640
Anyway, you take it. It's a present!

196
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,280
So Hee!

197
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,260
- Wait for me!
- It wasn't that way! You liar!

198
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,000
- Why are you always lying?
- Hey, when did I lie?

199
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,840
Are you talking about that day
when you shot with the octopus?

200
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,060
Joon Oh, you were supposed to
catch the octopus in the mud...

201
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,050
- How do you... Look at this!
- You catch the octopus in the mud.

202
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,920
- Look at this! He's a total liar!
- You catch the octopus in the mud--

203
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,620
How do you catch an octopus in the mud?

204
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,100
- Joon Oh!
- CEO Hwang!

205
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,250
Oh, hey! Have you seen Yeol?
Seo Joon Oh, where's Yeol?

206
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,130
- What about him?
- We can't find Yeol.

207
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,580
- Excuse me?
- What are you talking about?

208
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,710
We think Choi Tae Ho did something.
We can't find either one.

209
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,010
- Joon Oh!
- Seo Joon Oh--

210
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,190
Tae Ho!

211
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,880
Yeol!

212
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,550
- Yeol!
- Yeol!

213
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,000
- Manager Jung!
- Yes!

214
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,230
We shouldn't stay together.
Let's split up and look for them.

215
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,220
Then the three of us,
and the three of you?

216
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,000
You guys look over there! Be careful!

217
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,220
- Okay, be careful!
- Be careful.

218
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,400
- Yeol!
- Yeol!

219
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,380
Tae Ho!

220
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,790
Yeol--

221
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,360
<i>We're going to debut tomorrow.</i>

222
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,170
How many years will we last?

223
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,720
If our first album flops, we're over.
How far are you thinking?

224
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,580
We won't become distant,
and break up, will we?

225
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,620
<i>I hope that doesn't happen.</i>

226
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,480
<i>It won't happen. Why are you
worrying about useless things?</i>

227
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,570
Just think about having
a good performance tomorrow.

228
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,170
Geez, I have no room!

229
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,810
This is what I think.

230
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,880
If we keep working together...

231
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,200
Yeol!

232
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,910
<i>We'll become jealous of each other...</i>

233
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,820
<i>- We'll get worried...</i>
- Choi Tae Ho!

234
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,650
<i>We'll have secrets...
and we'll have misunderstandings...</i>

235
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:51,680
<i>We'll have fights...
and we'll resent each other.</i>

236
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,400
<i>Even when that happens...</i>

237
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,490
<i>Even if we grow apart...</i>

238
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,510
<i>and end up fighting in the mud...</i>

239
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:06,490
Let's not doubt each other...

240
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,850
or pull out a knife.

241
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,340
Let's trust each other until the end.

242
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,940
Okay?

243
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,770
Okay?

244
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:33,030
- Geez...
- What was that?

245
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,510
- Huh?
- What did you do?

246
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,690
- Huh? What?
- I smell...

247
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:40,690
Hey, what did you just do?

248
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,900
Hey, I'm sorry.
I think I ate too much for dinner.

249
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:46,110
Wait, what the heck did you eat?
Did you eat crap?

250
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,560
Hey, wait... What did you eat?

251
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,710
- I'm opening the window!
- Hey, wait! It's cold!

252
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,380
- Hey, it's cold!
- Hey.

253
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,170
How much did you eat?

254
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:00,660
Hey, you ate crap...
Wait, it smells. Geez...

255
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,430
Even if he was hungry, why did he...

256
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:05,890
Geez, we should remember
to feed him every day.

257
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:08,330
- Because it's our debut tomorrow--
- Geez!

258
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,540
- Stop it...
- What? What? What? What? What?

259
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,880
- It's crap.
- It's not... It's not crap...

260
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,070
Wow, seriously.

261
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,120
What? What? What? What do you want?

262
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,880
I think I have crap in my nose.

263
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,350
I must have been nervous.

264
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,000
That doesn't mean you should eat crap.

265
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,330
What should I do tomorrow?
This might happen tomorrow.

266
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:32,390
- Then go to the bathroom!
- What if I'm already on stage?

267
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,620
Then we should end the show quickly.

268
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,760
- You can't fart on stage.
- You can't.

269
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,260
Geez, we're actually going
to make our debut.

270
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,170
I can't help but think
it was Tae Ho, Joon Oh.

271
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:09,990
Where could he have gone after
he tied me and Ji Ah to that tree?

272
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,400
Seeing how Yeol disappeared...

273
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,080
So Manager Jung, you're saying...

274
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,820
You think Tae Ho did something to Yeol,
and packed his bags and fled out of fear.

275
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,360
Hey, no way!
Tae Ho and Yeol had a good relationship.

276
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,490
Unlike Tae Ho and Joon Oh.

277
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,750
I agree with what Manager Jung said.

278
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,270
Tae Ho is capable of much worse.

279
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,440
I normally don't talk
about my ex-boyfriends...

280
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,690
But I'll do it today.

281
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:55,060
Choi Tae Ho,
that bastard, is a piece of trash.

282
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,080
Our Yeol...

283
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,390
Choi Tae Ho definitely
did something to him.

284
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:10,030
What do we do about our poor Yeol?

285
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,190
No, we don't know yet.

286
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,560
I'll look for them.

287
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,800
Tae Ho and Yeol must be
somewhere on this island.

288
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,690
Even if it takes days or months,
I'll look for them.

289
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,410
Let's go together.

290
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,380
How can you cover
so much ground by yourself?

291
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,820
No. I'll look for them.

292
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:45,820
Even if we weren't acknowledged,
I'm still the frontman of Dreamers.

293
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,170
Who'll find them if I don't?

294
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:52,220
Ki Joon, please stay and take care
of the food and clothing.

295
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,840
- Hey, Seo Joon Oh, you punk.
- I can do it.

296
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,090
I have to do it.

297
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,040
Seo Joon Oh!

298
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,220
Yeah, what is it?

299
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,020
Are you leaving already?
Let me come with you.

300
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:24,090
No. You need to stay here. If you're
not here, everyone will really starve.

301
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,760
Um...

302
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:30,020
This. Eat this when you're hungry.

303
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,050
What is it?

304
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:40,240
- You took the bones out.
- You said you didn't know how.

305
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,530
Thanks. I'll enjoy it.
Go back to sleep.

306
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,600
Wait...

307
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,200
When you find Choi Tae Ho...

308
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,430
What do you plan to do?

309
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,460
What do you mean?

310
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:02,670
If Choi Tae Ho killed Lee Yeol...

311
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:06,380
<i>And if that's why he ran away...</i>

312
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:09,450
<i>When that becomes clear...</i>

313
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,360
What...

314
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,820
do you plan to do to him?

315
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,020
I don't know.

316
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,580
<i>I'll probably be angry.</i>

317
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,990
<i>I'll probably think about whether
I should kill him or keep him alive.</i>

318
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,130
Tae Ho!

319
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,140
Yeol!

320
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,620
<i>That's why I won't think
about that right now.</i>

321
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:49,680
<i>If I think about that already...</i>

322
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,980
<i>If I think Yeol is dead...</i>

323
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:06,790
<i>and if I think Tae Ho killed him...</i>

324
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:10,230
I don't think I'll try very hard
to find them.

325
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,160
<i>I'll find them first.</i>

326
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,220
<i>And then I'll ask them...
what happened.</i>

327
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,510
<i>I'll ask them how we ended up
in this state.</i>

328
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,620
That's what I'll ask first.

329
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,970
Make sure you bring them back.

330
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,000
Okay.

331
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,740
Thanks.

332
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:11,530
<i>Wow, we were out in that blood bath,
but she can't remember it?</i>

333
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:16,980
Wow, she can't be like that! She should
remember of all people! She should!

334
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,050
What really... happened on that island?

335
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,800
Our CEO Hwang is sleeping so peacefully.

336
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,220
Isn't he being too disrespectful?

337
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,170
Well... Such accidents don't happen

338
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,160
with any kind of warning.

339
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:43,240
I didn't know you'd take me
seriously, Doctor.

340
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,590
That was just my frustration talking.
I'm so frustrated.

341
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,720
Please contact me if he wakes up.

342
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,440
Chairwoman Jo.

343
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,120
If... he happens to pass away

344
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,900
what should we do then?

345
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,250
Then you should call his family, not me!

346
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,990
Oh, yes--

347
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,780
Oh. Yes. Yes, the thing is, Minister.

348
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,770
I'm sorry about announcing it
without consulting you first, but...

349
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:32,590
Gosh, how would I know that? I didn't
ask her to lose her memory, Minister.

350
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:39,270
No, I'm not defying you...

351
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:43,710
Pardon? The attacker
who killed Yoon So Hee?

352
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,480
Well, that's what I'm the most
curious about--

353
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,660
He... Hello? He...

354
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,900
Damn it!

355
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,480
If he was going to just talk at me,
he should have written a letter instead!

356
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,390
What did he say?

357
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:09,020
He wants to know why Ra Bong Hee lost
her memory and who killed Yoon So Hee!

358
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:13,220
If I knew that,
would I be here like this?

359
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:18,740
That crazy bastard. Does he think
he's Sejong the Great or something?

360
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,360
I can't deal with this.

361
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,430
Oh, it's Investigator Oh.

362
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:36,430
I'm not in a good mood. If it's not
good news, don't tell me anything.

363
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,460
What?

364
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,430
Are you serious?

365
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,860
Ra Bong Hee remembers everything?

366
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:51,840
- You said it call came back.
- Yes.

367
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,810
Why are you telling me that now?

368
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:58,300
She just remembered, so I... I'm sorry.

369
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,130
How much did you get out of her?

370
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:03,400
You know the singer, Lee Yeol?

371
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,240
She said he went missing.
That's what we secured so far.

372
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,080
That good-looking kid went missing?

373
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,820
Yes. He went missing,
but she said Choi Tae Ho was to blame.

374
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,520
Choi Tae Ho?

375
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,930
Choi Tae Ho...
That kid who was in that drama?

376
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:24,040
- Yes.
- Why would he? Why Lee Yeol?

377
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,750
No, forget it.

378
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,300
Yoon So Hee. Does she remember
who killed Yoon So Hee?

379
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,130
Yes. She remembers it clearly.

380
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,960
Okay. Then keep going
with what you were doing.

381
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,060
This isn't a variety show anymore,
it's a documentary. Got it?

382
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,540
Yes. A documentary. I understand.

383
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,320
Chairwoman Jo just arrived.

384
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,890
That's why... from now on

385
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:58,210
you must tell us everything
very accurately.

386
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,260
Do you understand, Ra Bong Hee?

387
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,250
<i>Yes.</i>

388
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:10,610
Then please continue where you left off.

389
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:14,410
From the point when Choi Tae Ho
and Lee Yeol went missing

390
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:17,140
to the point where you tell us
who killed Yoon So Hee.

391
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,700
Please tell us the truth,
without leaving anything out.

392
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,620
Nice! Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay!

393
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,270
- Okay!
- I'm good now.

394
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:46,660
- My turn?
- Wow, that was good. Come here.

395
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,950
- Ouch!
- You're so stiff.

396
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:53,710
Hey, you're so stiff.
You're stiff everywhere.

397
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,240
Hey!

398
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,330
- Pardon?
- What are you doing?

399
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,670
Why is a manger rubbing
an actress's shoulders?

400
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:08,820
No, that's not it.
Ji Ah helped me move something earlier

401
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,410
and her shoulders seemed stiff,
so I was massaging them for her.

402
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:15,010
It looks like you've forgotten
after being here for so long.

403
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:17,400
I'm the CEO of your company.

404
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,900
The groups Chiming and Blue Angel
went missing after the crash.

405
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,930
We don't know if our Yeol
is alive or dead.

406
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:26,520
And Choi Tae Ho is responsible
for that! I'm your CEO.

407
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,310
Our Ji Ah, whom you're massaging,
and our weak little So Hee!

408
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:34,670
These two girls are all I have left.

409
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:39,870
You shouldn't be massaging each other.
Especially when we get out, got it?

410
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,110
- We weren't flirting or anything--
- Got it?

411
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:49,320
Yes, I understand what you're saying.
I'll be careful from now on. I'm sorry.

412
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:53,400
What are you sorry about? When I think
about it, something's off.

413
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,620
What's wrong with Ki Joon and me?

414
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:59,810
Why can't we make physical contact?
We're getting along just fine so far.

415
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,210
Listen to what this wench...

416
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,440
Hey, don't you know the risks of rumors
spreading about an actress and manager?

417
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,910
You're better off with Tae Ho.
At least he has a higher rank.

418
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:13,060
I'm sorry. I will be more careful.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

419
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,990
Why do you keep apologizing?
Stay still for a second! Stay still...

420
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:21,290
CEO Hwang, who has a lower rank?
Is Ki Joon a lower rank?

421
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:23,450
How is he...

422
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:28,430
Hey, I'm not that great either!
Why are you being so sensitive?

423
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:34,000
I told you, no. Got it?
You shouldn't be acting like this.

424
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,080
Don't do it. Listen to your CEO.

425
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,480
- I'll rebel if you tell me not to do it.
- Don't do it.

426
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,390
I really hate it when someone tells me
what to do and what not to do.

427
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,890
What did you just tell me not to do?

428
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,090
Don't do anything with
Manager Jung. Don't do it.

429
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:54,670
- Ki Joon, do you want to go out?
- What?

430
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,670
We see each other every day.
Go out where? We're out right now.

431
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,810
Hey, why can't you understand me?

432
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,270
Let's date. You and I.

433
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:10,740
You want to... date? You want us to date?

434
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,810
Why? Don't you want to?

435
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:15,790
No, it's not that...

436
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,600
I just don't understand...
this situation--

437
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,070
Do you want to or not?
Answer me right now.

438
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,090
I think I understand it now.
Let's date, sure. Let's date.

439
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:32,630
Let's date. Let's date! Let's date!
We're dating now! It's our first day!

440
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,030
There's not much to it!
I'll stay by her side, comfort--

441
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:38,910
Hey, that's enough. Ki Joon is
my boyfriend now. Okay?

442
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:42,390
Ji Ah. Ji Ah!

443
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,290
Should I rebel even more?

444
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,360
<i>You'd better not do it.</i>

445
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,850
<i>You'd better not date... Manager Jung.</i>

446
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:05,740
Then I will.

447
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,280
Tae Ho.

448
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,600
I did it.

449
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:49,610
And CEO Hwang, don't mention
that bastard, Choi Tae Ho, ever again.

450
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:50,960
Okay?

451
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,820
Ji Ah!

452
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,880
She's crazy.

453
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,450
Hey! Come back here!

454
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:08,180
Why are you running away? Hey!
Why are you running away?

455
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,380
Why are you running away?

456
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,900
You son of a bitch! Why are you running?

457
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,890
Why are you running away? Huh?

458
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:30,100
Tae Ho! Yeol... Where's Yeol? Where's--

459
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,770
I don't know!

460
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:35,020
Tae Ho!

461
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:42,360
Where is he? You son of a bitch!

462
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,760
Hey, Tae Ho!

463
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,040
Let go!

464
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:49,890
Come here!

465
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,410
Yeol... Yeol! Where's Yeol, you bastard?

466
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:02,270
He's dead? Huh? No, right?
He's not dead, right, Tae Ho?

467
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:04,040
He's not!

468
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:11,100
You didn't do something to him,
did you? Tell me! No, right?

469
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,170
Tell me it's not true!

470
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:16,490
Tell me it's not true,
you son of a bitch!

471
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:19,450
Tell me it's not true!

472
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:29,240
It was an accident.

473
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,510
It was an accident.

474
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,360
I really... had no intention
of killing him, Joon Oh.

475
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,830
Yeol tricked me

476
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:56,870
and devised a scheme behind my back.
That's why I did it.

477
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:00,110
If Yeol had listened to me
and had left the boat alone

478
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:02,630
none of this would have happened.

479
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:05,550
We need to survive!

480
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,640
No...

481
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,370
We can't die here, Joon Oh.

482
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:15,410
You, Yeol, and CEO Hwang...
Why are you taking it out on me?

483
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,720
We can't die here, Joon Oh...

484
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:30,890
<i>We won't become distant
and break up, will we?</i>

485
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:33,690
<i>Even if we grow apart...</i>

486
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:37,870
<i>And end up fighting in the mud...</i>

487
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:42,050
<i>Let's not doubt each other
or pull out a knife.</i>

488
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:47,540
<i>Let's trust each other until the end.</i>

489
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,650
Joon Oh!

490
00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:08,910
Joon Oh, no! Wait a second!

491
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:12,650
Joon Oh! I didn't do it on purpose!

492
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:14,170
Joon Oh...

493
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:22,150
- Manager Jung.
- Yeah, Bong Hee. Come here.

494
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:28,510
- What did Ji Ah say?
- She said you shouldn't worry.

495
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:32,240
- And?
- She said she's sorry.

496
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:34,220
And... And...

497
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:37,510
She said she did it without any emotion.

498
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:41,150
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.

499
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:46,040
Oh, I didn't have any feelings,
but Ji Ah didn't either?

500
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,310
Oh...

501
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:50,250
In your opinion, did it look like
Ji Ah didn't have any feelings?

502
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,100
I didn't have a good view

503
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,290
so I couldn't tell
if there were any emotions.

504
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,610
- I'm sorry, Manager Jung.
- No. No. Why are you sorry?

505
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:03,040
Hey, anyway, what a relief! I would have
felt bad for Ji Ah if I was the only one!

506
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,090
- What a relief. That's good.
- What a relief.

507
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,710
What a relief.

508
00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:09,110
Did Ji Ah say anything else?

509
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:14,140
Yes! She wants you to tell her when CEO
Hwang bothers you. She'll protect you.

510
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,260
- She'll protect me?
- Yes.

511
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:20,600
Bong Hee, isn't that something guys
usually tell their girlfriends?

512
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:25,160
Um... Normally, that's true.
Even for kissing...

513
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,860
The guy usually is the instigator.

514
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:31,630
Then... what does that make me?

515
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:35,140
Wait, many girls initiate
the first kiss these days...

516
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,560
Bong Hee, have you ever initiated a kiss?

517
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,020
- Oh! No, I haven't!
- No? I haven't either.

518
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:44,390
Then... have you ever felt embarrassed
when you didn't do anything

519
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:50,170
or felt like you were stripped naked
when you didn't say anything?

520
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:53,810
No, I've never felt like that.

521
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:56,760
Oh, me either.

522
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,910
I'm okay.

523
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,350
- Cheer up.
- It's okay. It's okay.

524
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:13,580
I'm okay. I'm okay! I'm fine.

525
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,050
Oh! Seo Joon Oh!

526
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:19,860
What happened out there?

527
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:22,650
Are you hurt? Are you all right?

528
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:26,280
- Blood! You're bleeding! You got hurt?
- Hey, what is this?

529
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:30,550
Don't deny it. You're bleeding so much.
Gosh... What do we do...

530
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:32,360
Hey, get over here!

531
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:42,990
Choi Tae Ho.

532
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,860
You son of a bitch!

533
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:31,970
Get up.

534
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:33,860
<i>Hey!</i>

535
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:38,000
What did you do to Yeol?
What did you do to Yeol? Where is he?

536
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,660
Where is he? Tell me! Tell me now!

537
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:46,210
What happened? Did you kill him?
Did you kill him?

538
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:48,140
What is it?

539
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:51,970
Where is he? Why won't you say anything?

540
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:56,530
What did you do? What did you do to Yeol?

541
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:59,950
Where's Yeol? What did you do to him?

542
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:03,440
<i>Even if they curse at you,
suffer through it.</i>

543
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:07,270
<i>If they hit you, stand there and take it.</i>

544
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:11,160
<i>Endure all of it by yourself.</i>

545
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:14,630
<i>They have the right to do it.</i>

546
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:19,030
<i>And...</i>

547
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:21,970
You'll pay for the sin you committed.

548
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:28,580
And...

549
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:32,360
For Yeol...

550
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,000
Always feel sorry...

551
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:42,110
And live with that guilt for the rest
of your life, you son of a bitch.

552
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:08,260
Joon Oh.

553
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:11,460
I know what you're saying

554
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:16,400
but are you really okay...
living here with Tae Ho?

555
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,170
We can't just leave him to die.

556
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:24,600
Tae Ho will die too
if he continues to live alone.

557
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,740
I don't know why you're looking out
for that bastard, Choi Tae Ho, but--

558
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:30,460
- I'm not looking out for him, Ji Ah--
- Listen to me.

559
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:34,310
You said he killed Yeol.
You said you heard him admit it.

560
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:38,880
That's right, Joon Oh. If we think about
Yeol, keeping Tae Ho here isn't right.

561
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:41,420
So should we kill him?

562
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:43,430
Should we?

563
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:46,580
Should we leave him
out there alone to die?

564
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,310
What?

565
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:04,490
Is that what we...
Is that what we really want? Huh?

566
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:16,190
Tae Ho was wrong... No, he did
something that was unforgivable. I know!

567
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:20,480
I know, and it's driving me crazy! But...

568
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,770
But, that doesn't mean
we should let another person die.

569
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:27,640
We're not that cruel, are we?

570
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,920
What if Tae Ho volunteers to leave?

571
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,860
- What?
- If he says he'll leave on his own...

572
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:41,050
That means we can let him go, doesn't it?

573
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:45,670
That wouldn't be our fault.

574
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,920
I'm just saying.

575
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,220
Just in case something like that happens.

576
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:08,650
Why did you want to see me?

577
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:16,930
I have a request.

578
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:18,630
Say it.

579
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,150
Can you leave?

580
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:27,430
What?

581
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:29,770
I don't want to stay here with you.

582
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:36,190
You killed a man.

583
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:41,950
- So Hee.
- You remember what I said, don't you?

584
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:45,090
- How will you send a rescue team?
- If we look, it's possible.

585
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:47,330
How can I trust you?

586
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,220
I saw what you did.

587
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,330
- What did you see?
- Should I say it right now?

588
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:59,080
I know what kind of person you are.

589
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:02,000
That's why, if I tell everyone
about what I saw

590
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:05,940
you won't be able to stay here.
But you know that already, right?

591
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,960
So Hee.

592
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:15,190
- I don't know what you're saying.
- Stop playing dumb.

593
00:53:15,190 --> 00:53:17,670
You know it, and I know it.

594
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,380
So what are you going to do now?

595
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,270
Are you staying or leaving?

596
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:25,870
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

597
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:29,580
You're staying, huh? Okay, fine.

598
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:32,570
Then I'll make you leave.

599
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:39,020
So Hee.

600
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:42,830
If you tell them, we'll all die.

601
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,460
I won't be the only one who gets hurt.

602
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:49,690
- I know.
- You'll get hurt too.

603
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:51,730
Do you know what you're doing?

604
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:58,000
Let's all live together.

605
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:02,020
Don't get any strange ideas.

606
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,880
Let's just all live together, okay?

607
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:14,050
Tae Ho, let's just...

608
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,680
Let's just die together.

609
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:21,590
If we don't, I think the others
will get hurt because of you.

610
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,540
It's so hard to live.

611
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,050
Ch... Choi Tae Ho killed Yoon So Hee?

612
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,900
Yes.

613
00:56:10,590 --> 00:56:14,990
Wait, are you saying everyone knew
Choi Tae Ho killed Yoon So Hee

614
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:17,560
and continued to live together?

615
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:20,570
At first...

616
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:22,880
We thought it was suicide.

617
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,250
So Hee!

618
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:37,970
So Hee...

619
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:44,710
So Hee was having a really hard time

620
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:47,580
and in the end...

621
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:51,650
There was something Secretary Tae said.

622
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:54,590
So Hee said she was having a tough time

623
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:57,150
and that she wanted to die...

624
00:56:57,150 --> 00:57:01,520
And then she suddenly walked out,
so I just thought...

625
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,930
I just thought she was going for a walk
to calm herself down.

626
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:07,170
Why are you saying this now, Punk?

627
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:09,780
<i>And then?</i>

628
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:12,630
<i>You thought it was suicide...</i>

629
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:16,050
How did you find out
that Choi Tae Ho killed Yoon So Hee?

630
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:18,480
The truth is...

631
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:22,020
Secretary Tae was a witness.

632
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,760
Who's there?

633
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,750
So Hee.

634
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:57,520
So Hee!

635
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,420
Be quiet if you don't want to die.

636
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:13,050
<i>He said Choi Tae Ho threatened him.</i>

637
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:16,100
If he told other people
about what he saw...

638
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,360
I'll kill you too.

639
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,250
You... You'll get hurt before then!

640
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,750
We outnumber you...

641
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:28,960
Did I say I was going to touch
the others? I'm only going to kill you.

642
00:58:29,550 --> 00:58:33,040
After I kill you,
I might as well die with you.

643
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:45,430
So, Ho Hang...
Let's not die together.

644
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:47,860
Let's think about
living together instead.

645
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:54,820
Honestly, compared to So Hee...

646
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,960
I'm more useful to the group.

647
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:27,770
<i>You're saying...</i>

648
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:33,580
Secretary Tae only said
Yoon So Hee committed suicide

649
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:36,380
to conceal Choi Tae Ho's murder.

650
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,840
We have enough information
to be certain that it was Choi Tae Ho?

651
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,310
Yes.

652
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:57,010
Let's get ready to announce it.

653
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:01,380
It's going to be very noisy
for the next few days.

654
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,250
Yes, this is--

655
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,820
Very good. Let's keep going.

656
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:20,670
After Yoon So Hee died, what happened--

657
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:23,460
<i>Stop! Stop, right now!</i>

658
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:29,090
They found another survivor.
He's arriving in Korea now!

659
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,860
Um...

weird about So Hee?</i>

01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:53,690
<i>That's why we should know! Do you think
someone could have killed her?</i>

- Who the hell are you?</i>

Look at this! Why was he on our plane?</i>

670
01:02:59,270 --> 01:03:04,770
<i>You killed her. Isn't it wrong to kill
someone and pretend you're innocent?</i>

<i>[Episode 1]</i>
Sir, you shouldn't get angry.

4
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,680
Acting like this won't bring the dead
back to life. So I'm saying--

5
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,350
No! I know they're still missing,
but I'm saying--

6
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,370
Damn it...

7
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,030
Sir. Hello?

8
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,700
Sir!

9
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,270
If they're missing, they're dead!

10
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,860
Your son is dead.
You won't see him ever again!

11
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:20,830
So... Stop crying and make some money!

12
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,850
Shit!

13
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,680
President! President!
President! President!

14
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,460
President, you need to see this!

15
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:41,360
<i>120 days after the incident, one of
the missing people has been found alive.</i>

16
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,110
<i>On the 24th of last month
at 7 p.m. in Huizhou, China</i>

17
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,350
<i>it was reported that Ms. Ra</i>

18
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,100
<i>who was a passenger
on the private plane, was found.</i>

19
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,140
<i>After Ms. Ra was found,
she was taken to a nearby hospital</i>

20
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,690
<i>and we are told
that her health is favorable.</i>

21
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,080
<i>Currently, China is questioning her</i>

22
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,280
<i>to find out what happened
during the plane crash.</i>

23
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,450
<i>After it was revealed that Legend
Entertainment's private plane crashed</i>

24
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:10,370
<i>- a survivor was found...</i>
<i>- When the investigation ends</i>

25
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,800
<i>- she will return to Korea.</i>
<i>- Right now</i>

26
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,690
<i>they are lighting candles of hope.</i>

27
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:20,510
<i>The fans who participated in a protest
against the search that ended in 45 days</i>

28
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,760
<i>made sure their voices
and objections were heard.</i>

29
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,940
- The star never goes out.
- The star never goes out.

30
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,770
- A survivor was found!
- A survivor was found!

31
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:32,450
- What's going on?
- Teacher!

32
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,870
A survivor from
Legend Entertainment was found!

33
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:38,770
Oh my gosh! I can't believe it!

34
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:43,490
So Hee! Be quiet so I can hear!
So Hee... So Hee!

35
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,880
So Hee, I hope you're alive! So Hee!

36
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,690
You punks!

37
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:52,760
<i>Lee Yeol, Seo Joon Oh,
Choi Tae Ho, Yoon So Hee...</i>

38
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,430
Let go of me!

39
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,270
- Sir!
- Why isn't Tae Min here?

40
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,980
Tae Min is alive, right?
Right? Right? Right? Right? Right?

41
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,470
Don't change the channel.

42
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,380
That's not the issue!
After the kids went down with the plane

43
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,150
there's a survivor!

44
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,340
I don't care about the plane.
All that matters is this game!

45
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,600
- Gosh...
- You're back?

46
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,340
- The waves were strong today.
- You didn't catch anything?

47
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,290
<i>They said they will use
all of their strength.</i>

48
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,020
<i>The survivor, Ms. Ra was a stylist</i>

49
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,300
<i>for the celebrity, Seo Joon Oh,
of Legend Entertainment.</i>

50
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,030
<i>She is planning to return to Korea
as soon as the investigation is over.</i>

51
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,800
<i>The team that confirmed
Ms. Ra was alive</i>

52
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,980
<i>was reorganized and the special
investigation committee has taken over.</i>

53
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,180
<i>And they asked China to cooperate</i>

54
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,680
<i>in the search for the other survivors.</i>

55
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,090
<i>Ms. Ra's--</i>

56
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,550
Yeah, Lawyer Jo.
Please take care of something for me.

57
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,150
Have some water.

58
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,340
Geez, I do remember those times.

59
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,310
After the incident,
we were transferred for the search

60
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:41,060
but we didn't have the funds.

61
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,000
We searched right away, but we couldn't
even find the remains of the plane.

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,580
Well, we thought you were dead,
to be completely honest.

63
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:55,130
But, now that you're alive,
it has became very inconvenient for us.

64
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,760
- I have no room.
- Okay.

65
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
No room.

66
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,140
By the way, was it all true?

67
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,270
I'm talking about what you told
the Chinese police.

68
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,890
Yes.

69
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:22,280
- Are there any other survivors?
- Where were you all this time?

70
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,860
Please tell us about the crash!

71
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,450
How do you feel?

72
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,060
Do you know anything
about Lee Yeol and the others?

73
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,170
- Where are the others?
- Are they alive? What happened?

74
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,760
How is your health?

75
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,970
Bong Hee.

76
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,210
Mom.

77
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,430
Bong Hee!

78
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:24,650
Mom...

79
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,490
Mom...

80
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,680
Bong Hee, you went through so much...

81
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,270
Gosh, thank you! Thank you so much!

82
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,190
Are you hurt?

83
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,630
You went through so much.
It must have been so hard.

84
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,070
Gosh, are you hurt?

85
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,710
<i>- She can't remember!</i>
- What?

86
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,950
I was able to get in touch
with someone in China

87
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,010
so I looked into what they
talked about in the investigation

88
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,560
and they said Ra Bong Hee
lost her memory.

89
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,010
<i>They said it's a symptom
of post-traumatic stress.</i>

90
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:21,430
<i>You know how people lose their memory
when they go through too much shock?</i>

91
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:24,190
They said Ra Bong Hee
is going through the same thing.

92
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,520
She recognizes her mom.

93
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,870
<i>I don't know the details either</i>

94
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,940
but they said she doesn't remember
what happened after the plane crashed.

95
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,450
<i>They said she has short-term memory loss.</i>

96
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,360
<i>The doctor confirmed it.</i>

97
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,740
I was wondering why the special committee
was secretive about it, but this is why.

98
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,710
Then are you saying we don't know
where they were and what happened?

99
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,170
<i>Short-term memory loss
is similar to dementia</i>

100
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:53,730
so she could suddenly get her memory back

101
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:57,160
or she could get parts of it back.

102
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,430
But they said no one can tell
when it will come back.

103
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,430
<i>Just eat that.</i>

104
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,960
Anyways, regarding this issue

105
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,250
the special investigation team is
working to recover her memory

106
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,440
so all we can do is wait.

107
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,160
Okay, I got it. Keep working at it.

108
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,020
- Thank you!
- Ra Bong Hee?

109
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,440
You know that the special investigation
committee is on this case, right?

110
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,350
I'm the chairman of the committee,
Jo Hee Kyung.

111
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,400
Thank you for being alive.

112
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,690
You must have gone through a lot.

113
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,700
Are you hurt?

114
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:34,310
No, I'm okay.

115
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,040
I heard everything from Investigator Oh.

116
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,000
He said you don't remember anything.

117
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,160
- Yes.
- So what do you think?

118
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,260
Do you feel relieved?

119
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,170
For the last four months,
where you lived

120
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:03,450
how you lived, who you lived with,
why you were saved alone...

121
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,750
The fact that you don't remember
could be a good thing for you.

122
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,870
We don't know what horrible
things you might have endured.

123
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,670
But Ra Bong Hee...

124
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,740
to us, that's not a good thing.

125
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,340
Do you understand?

126
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,490
The memory that you lost
is the only hope we have.

127
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:27,980
Those kids on the plane,
because of their unknown status

128
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,560
this country has been very noisy
for the last four months.

129
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,110
"The singer Lee Yeol was seen in China."

130
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,140
"Choi Tae Ho often visits a bar
in South America."

131
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:43,020
"This is a surprise event to celebrate
Legend Entertainment's 20th anniversary."

132
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,510
"They're alive, and they will
surprise us at their concert."

133
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,260
There are countless ridiculous
rumors going around.

134
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,000
We thought it was finally calming down...

135
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,820
And then you showed up.

136
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,030
You made things very complicated for us.

137
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:08,100
If you came back, you should have
brought facts, not chaos, Ra Bong Hee!

138
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,940
Try everything. Do whatever you can...

139
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,970
to get your memory back.

140
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:23,480
Get your memory back and tell us all
who lived and who died!

141
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,590
That's the only way this country
will find peace.

142
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,700
There's not much to patriotism.

143
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,080
You have to give our citizens
the answers to what they want to know.

144
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,610
That's what patriotism is, isn't it?

145
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,830
It was my first job.

146
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,720
<i>It was my first day on the job.</i>

147
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,140
<i>And...</i>

148
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,740
it was my first trip abroad.

149
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,270
That day...

150
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,110
<i>That day...</i>

151
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,220
<i>was supposed to be...</i>

152
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,840
the happiest day of my life.

153
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,590
So I thought...

154
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,520
Hello! I'm Seo Joon Oh's stylist.

155
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,250
- Oh, come this way.
- Okay.

156
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:42,520
<i>[Dreamers' Joon Oh]</i>

157
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,360
Geez...

158
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,560
- Hey, Joon!
<i>- Where are you?</i>

159
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,420
- Oh, I'm about to--
<i>- Come here right now.</i>

160
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:53,630
I already told you. You have 10 minutes.

161
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:57,450
Do you think I can get to Gunsan
from Seoul in 10 minutes?

162
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:00,490
- Anyways, I'll leave right now--
<i>- 10 minutes.</i>

163
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,870
- We came here to catch octopuses.
- 10 minutes.

164
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,490
Yes! Yes! You're doing well.
Good! Good! It's fun to watch!

165
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,200
Seo Joon Oh! Come back here
if you're finished!

166
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,610
Joon Oh!

167
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,320
Hurry over! I planned
everything out for you. Come over!

168
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,690
Hurry up!

169
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,380
Yes, Manager Jung!

170
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,300
Hello, Bong Hee! We have to go somewhere
in 10 minutes. Where are you?

171
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,340
Oh, I'm in front of Star Cafe.

172
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,170
Geez, there are too many
of those in Gangnam.

173
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,150
You're at Manager Jung's shop, right?

174
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,590
We're in a hurry, so I'll go over there.

175
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,530
- Manager Jung--
<i>- Wait for me there!</i>

176
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,290
Oh, Manager Jung! Oh...

177
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,850
- Yes, like that! Yes!
- Roll over more!

178
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,730
- Good! Good!
- Joon Oh, are you okay?

179
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:59,780
- What do we do?
- Send a text for me. Where is he?

180
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:08,000
<i>How far are you?</i>

181
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,410
<i>[I'm almost there.]</i>

182
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,060
He said he's almost here.

183
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:20,930
Seo Joon Oh! If you sent your text,
come back here!

184
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,890
- I'll get through it.
- Do you want to take a break?

185
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,220
No!

186
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,110
Yes! I'm walking there now. Okay!

187
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,610
- Yeah, Joon!
<i>- You have three minutes.</i>

188
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,590
You should tell me what's going on--

189
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,630
Hello? Joon Oh.

190
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:52,060
How could you hang up on me?
I have two minutes now.

191
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,290
<i>[Block this number?]</i>

192
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:02,020
<i>[Block calls.
Block messages.]</i>

193
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,830
<i>[Dreamers' Joon Oh]</i>

194
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,680
Oh, Joon Oh!
You should look for it harder!

195
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,920
Look for the octopus!

196
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,100
I found one!

197
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,990
He should have caught it later!
It's not fun if it looks too easy!

198
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:17,830
Smile twice, and eat it in one bite!

199
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:22,780
Open your mouth wide! Open wide!
Yeah! Hurry up and eat it!

200
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:26,380
Why can't you make it look delicious?

201
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,510
- My phone.
- Sure.

202
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,390
What is he doing? Huh?

203
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,240
<i>- The number you called...</i>
- Damn it, he blocked me!

204
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,840
<i>- is temporarily unavailable...</i>
- He put me in the spam folder!

205
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,020
Are you finished? Get back in there.
Hurry up and get in there!

206
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,800
- Do it again! Do it again!
- The sun is going down!

207
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,590
- After I eat.
- Did we go overboard?

208
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:57,240
- Let's do it one more time!
- I think I crossed the line...

209
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,950
Wait, this won't solve anything!

210
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,450
Give me a bottle of Soju, please.

211
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,280
- He's so sensitive...
- You asked him to catch an octopus.

212
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,820
No, that's not it...

213
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,870
- Do you have anything else?
- No!

214
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,730
My contract ended ages ago...

215
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,450
<i>[I fell for that buzzed feeling.]</i>

216
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:41,460
Why were you so late?
I waited for a long time.

217
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:45,270
I'm sorry. I had something
I had to bring. I'm sorry.

218
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,140
That's okay. We're already late anyway.

219
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,060
Let's eat this and go slowly
as if we're on vacation.

220
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,010
- I thought you might like squid.
- Yes, I like squid.

221
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,490
- You brought your passport, right?
- Yes of course.

222
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:00,990
Here. The office took
a long time to make this.

223
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,300
I paid 40,000 or 50,000 won, so I thought
they'd make it for me right away.

224
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,030
- This must be your first trip abroad.
- Yes.

225
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,230
- Oh, I'll rip that for you.
- Yes, thank you.

226
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,830
Bong Hee, you don't seem that young

227
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,560
yet this is your first job,
and first trip abroad?

228
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,650
What did you do all your life?

229
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,780
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

230
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,400
I didn't do much, but this is
what I studied. I studied this field.

231
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,690
But I couldn't find a job, so I spent
a few years with my mom at home

232
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,080
and I came up to Seoul for this job
because you looked favorably upon me.

233
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,070
No, I didn't. No one else applied.

234
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,880
- Oh, I see.
- Did you hear about today's schedule?

235
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,280
- Yes, I heard.
- Yes, it's not much.

236
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,320
Joon Oh is shooting the "Gunsan
Octopus Special" of "Food Expedition."

237
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,680
We just have to help out with that,
and go to the airport right after.

238
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,140
For the "Legend Town Concert."

239
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,410
Yes, I understand.

240
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:05,910
Bong Hee, how much
do you know about Joon Oh?

241
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,000
Should I be honest?

242
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,770
What kind of person is Seo Joon Oh
in your opinion?

243
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,860
Um, he was the frontman of Dreamers.

244
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,410
- Eat this.
- Yes, thank you.

245
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,610
- He was a top star once.
- He was!

246
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:22,820
Now, he's having a hard time.

247
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:26,600
Because he drank under the influence
three years ago.

248
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:33,190
Let go of me! Where are you from?
I ate with your chief!

249
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:38,140
We went to the sauna, and drank!
We did everything!

250
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,180
I thought it would pass...

251
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,210
But he said something weird
as he came out of the police station.

252
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,920
Seo Joon Oh! Is it true you drove
under the influence?

253
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,390
I drank, but I didn't drink and drive.

254
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,020
Are you saying someone else drove?

255
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,590
Because of that incident,
all of his fans left him

256
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,540
and the reporters only said
bad things about him.

257
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,270
In the end... Dreamers split up.

258
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,140
I'm so sorry... My friends right here...
did nothing wrong.

259
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:24,890
I'm so very sorry.

260
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,890
Dreamers...
How could this have happened?

261
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,140
To our Chinese fans...

262
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,000
Hello, everyone!

263
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:38,250
Dreamers would like to say goodbye
to our beloved fans.

264
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,240
No, where are we going?

265
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,710
After the group split up,
every solo act failed big time.

266
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,700
It's 12! Gather around! Gather around!
Gather around!

267
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:53,020
- Five! Four! Three! Two! One!
- Five! Four! Three! Two! One!

268
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:00,490
Joon Oh, you're the best!

269

272
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:17,180
I bought it.

00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:20,540
<i>After that, every drama

274
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,270
were all failures

275
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,030
so he's a complete--

276
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,660
Would you like an egg?

277
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:34,240
Oh, sure. That looks good. Thank you.

278
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,950
Our Joon Oh isn't that bad off.

279
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,090
Yes, of course.

280
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:45,780
He will reveal a new album soon
and he's respected in our company.

281
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,910
- He's still a Dreamer, no matter what.
- Yes.

283
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,850

This is the level that
Joon Oh is at in our company.

286
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,790
It's getting very tiring.

287
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,800
Yes, CEO Hwang!
Because of Joon Oh's schedule--

288
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,720
<i>Manager Joon, you son of a bitch.
What did Joon Oh do this time?</i>

289
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,820
What did he do to make
the broadcaster summon me? What?

290
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,400
Why should I be summoned
because of him? Why?

291
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:21,800
I'm with Joon Oh's stylist right now.

292
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,550
You're on speaker.
Joon Oh's stylist can hear everything.

293
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:29,840
- So what?
<i>- I'm just letting you know.</i>

294
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,750
CEO Hwang! Um, today...

295
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,340
Joon Oh is shooting in Gunsan

296
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:38,790
so we have hurry down there, and since
we're using the private plane tonight

297
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,690
can we use it for just a little bit?

298
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,860

299
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,470

Manager Jung!
These sausages are really good.

301
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,380
You should have one too.
Please be careful and drive slowly.

302
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,690
You should look straight ahead
and drive safely.

303
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,100
We have no choice but to go slowly.

304
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:08,240
This van is used. It's locked so
we can't go over 80 kilometers per hour.

305
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,930
It's so that we can't speed.

- After I finish this.
- It's unlimited. When will that be?

323
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:24,140
Until they stop refilling it.
It's not mannerly to waste food.

324
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,740
I'll eat here, so you can go do the show.

- Why not?

00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,640
You said I would eat them,
not catch them!

328
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,330
- You need to catch them to eat them.
- You didn't tell me that.

329
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:38,650
You're supposed to catch
octopuses in the mud!

Ki Joon, I thought there were
no secrets between us. I'm disappointed.

331
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,150
Joon Oh, I didn't trick you. You catch
the octopus so you can eat it.

332
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,350
Whatever. I can't do the show,
so go and tell them.

333

- I can't! I don't want to!

00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:59,440
Why do I have to fill in
for Choi Tae Ho all the time?

335
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,850
Who told you?

336
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,270
Byung Joo.

337
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,170
Joon Oh, you're Tae Ho's substitute,
but...

338
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,540
this is a good opportunity for us.

339
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,970
Let's become a permanent cast member
in the show and make a comeback, okay?

340
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,420
Hey, we don't need too much!
Let's make a good drama or a movie

341
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,540
- and do commercials--
- Stop it!

342
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:41,560
- Hey, do you know how hard it was?
- Stop it!

343
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,940
Endure it! Make it work.

344
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,040
Endure it even if it's embarrassing.

345
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,790
It'll only get harder for you.

346
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:56,230
If you don't do this, what will you do?
Do you have anything? How will you live?

347
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:04,330
Seriously...

348
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,480
Ki Joon.

349
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,590
Okay! Let's do the show, okay?

350
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,170
I'll do it because I listen to you.

351
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,350
All I have to do is catch an octopus and
wave it in front of the camera, right?

352
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:36,730
But you know I'm stylish, right? I won't
do it if I don't like my outfit, okay?

353
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,400
- What are you saying?
- Who are you? Who are you?

354
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,300
I'm... Hello, I'm Ra Bong Hee--

355
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:45,330
I don't need your name. Bring me
the outfits you prepared. It's up to you.

356
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,980
It's up to you
if we "do this show" today or not.

357
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,650
I'm back! Yes, please have a look.

358
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,930
It's a simple and thick sweater.

359
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,710
It's made of spandex,
and if you match it with some blue--

360
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,270
It's too plain.

361
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,760
Next.

362
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,340
There aren't any...

363
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:16,300
These are dots, but in a military style.
It's popular, but it's the most basic--

364
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,340
It looks like it'll sting. Next.

365
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,660
This one.

366
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:25,840
You can match it with this Scottish
pattern to look like a hot fasionista.

367
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,520
- Seo Joon Oh?
- It looks like graph paper.

368
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,090
We don't have time, Joon Oh...

369
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,010
Gosh, I'm so tired...

370
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,070
Hey! Be careful!

371
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,320
Yes! I'm coming!

372
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,750
Seo Joon Oh, look at this while you eat.
This is striped shirt.

373
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:53,500
You can tie the bottom for
a university look. It's a campus look.

374
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,760
Joon Oh, only finished high school.
He took the GED...

375
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,770
I'm sorry.

376
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:01,260
Hey, why did you say that
to someone we just met?

377
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,070
Okay, this is a soft, wool knit.

378
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:07,560
It will show off your soft side
and sexy neck

379
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,310
- it will make your collarbone--
- It looks like an undershirt.

380
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:14,810
Don't you have any with five buttons?
I like horses.

381
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,000
Oh, that looks prickly, geez!

382
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,120
It's a knit, no it's a sweatshirt.

383
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,520
The panda is the main point.
The panda is lying down.

384
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,160
Is there a sweater with a panda
that's looking forward?

385
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,060
- Forward?
- He hates tails.

386
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,410
- He looks like a loser.
- Why do you think that?

387
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,570
- He's turning his back!
- He looks humble!

388
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:35,160
No, he has to look forward
with confidence.

389
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,850
What about this trench coat?

390
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,450
- Like an English gentleman--
- How could I wear this?

391
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,050
He has never been in England.

392
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:44,780
Is this only for people
who have been to England?

393
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,420
- Ouch!
- Oh, are you all right?

394
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,090
- Hey, this is seriously--
- It feels like silk.

395
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:52,330
- Your neck turned red!
- Should I call 911?

396
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,730
Found it!

397
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,890
It's too much.

398
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:06,060
Geez, we're in trouble. I don't like any
of the clothes. We should quit the show.

399
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,710
- Joon Oh.
- I don't like them. What do we do?

400
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,520
Tell the director for me, okay?

401
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,510
Oh, wait a minute!

402
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,060
This is something that is never
given for a sponsorship.

403
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,430
But I secretly borrowed it
from a friend to give to you.

404
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,390
They're sunglasses.

405
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,000
What's wrong with her?

406
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,350
Joon Oh, it looks like Bong Hee
doesn't know. Please be understanding.

407
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,220
Fire her.

408
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,060
Wait! Joon Oh! Wait! Oh no...

409
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:52,290
I'm sorry. I'll bring your clothes
as soon as possible, so please...

410
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:05,060
Why did you have to bring that
of all things? Tae Ho models those.

411
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,920
- Joon Oh!
- Joon Oh! Joon Oh!

412
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,870
- Joon Oh, you can't do this!
- Seo Joon Oh!

413
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:16,340
I didn't know! I really didn't know.
I'm sorry! It was a mistake!

414
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:21,470
Please forgive me just this once. Please?
Joon Oh, just this once...

415
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:24,120
Wait, don't be startled.
I'll remove them.

416
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:27,560
- Why are there octopuses in your pants?
- The director told me to do it.

417
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,420
Geez, that wasn't nice!
Why did he want them in here?

418
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:36,090
I'll bring you some clothes. Please
look at a few more, and reconsider.

419
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:38,760
Try it again.

420
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:43,210
- Can I do it for you? I'll help.
- Do it for me, then.

421
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,950
Please. I'll bring some more outfits...

422
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:50,680
Geez, you smell like fish.

423
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,170
I'll hold this for you.
Use your strength.

424
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,770
- Just wait--
- Wait, not like that--

425
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,550
- One, two, three--
- Wait, no--

426
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:03,700
Hey, not like that. You're holding
my feet. One, two, three!

427
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,550
Seo Joon Oh! I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.

428
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,850
I have to wash up and go
to the airport. Move. Close the door!

429
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:15,570
Joon Oh, this car is manual.
Our car was repossessed earlier today.

430
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:18,700
Hey, how much was it worth
that they just took it back?

431
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,090
I'm sorry. I won't do it again. If you
fire me, I have no other means to live!

432
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,710
Do you think driving is all
you need to do? It should be peaceful!

433
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,020
Please let me work! Please...

434
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,470
- Are you all right?
- Can you eat and live like this?

435
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:35,030
But, I'll really starve, Seo Joon Oh!
I'll work really hard!

436
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,700
No, Seo Joon Oh!
You can't go like this! I want this job!

437
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,930
Hey, why is a girl so strong?
Do you work out?

438
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:42,620
What does it matter how strong
you are? You need to have brains!

439
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,620
How can you do this? No!

440
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:48,510
You won't starve to death with this
strength of yours! Hey, help me out here!

441
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,510
This isn't something
you should ask for! Wake up!

442
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:53,860
- Hey, I'll use my strength.
- I want this job!

443
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:58,020
Hey, it's okay. I talked to him.
I talked to him. I talked to him...

444
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:03,160
Joon Oh. Joon Oh, stop the car.
Hey, stop the car. Hey!

445
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,710
Byung Joo! Hey!

446
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:13,800
- I need to scream for you listen...
- What are you doing?

447
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,860
Are you fooling around? Huh?

448
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,360
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

449
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,950
I'm sorry, this is really...

450
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,850
What's wrong? Tell me what's wrong.

451
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:42,310
Joon Oh! Joon Oh!

452
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:45,400
Why are you being like this? Huh?

453
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,830
Byung Joo!

454
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,100
Byung Joo!

455
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:04,140
Geez, I'm tired. Let's eat something
and rest before we go to the airport.

456
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:09,700
Yes, Joon Oh. Joon Oh, since we're here,
how about some octopus stew?

457
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,800
- Byung Joo.
- Yes?

458
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,110
I'm sorry.

459
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:18,060
- Byung Joo.
- I forgot what you did today...

460
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,100
Oh, it looks like you unblocked me.

461
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,980
<i>- She said this is her first job.</i>
- Who?

462
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:30,180
Bong Hee. This is her first job.

463
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,350
It's her first day,
and her first trip abroad.

464
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:39,990
It was a good day, so wouldn't it be
wrong to fire her for the first time too?

465
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,030
What is this?

466
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:31,690
Give me the keys! Let's switch cars.
There's no heater in this one.

467
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,360
Why hasn't it been fixed?

468
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,560
Where's the car?

469
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,820
It's over there.

470
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,660
Geez, aren't you going
to change the color?

471
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:47,450
You told me to leave it as it is!
You liked how pure it looked.

472
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,680
I'm leaving. See you at the airport!

473
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,910
- What are you doing? Come on!
- Okay!

474
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,940
- Joon Oh! Seo Joon Oh--
- Hey, wait!

475
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,740
I don't know what his reason is,
but he said he's not firing you.

476
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:13,340
Really, Manager Jung?
I'm not fired?

477
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,660
Thank you! Thank you, Manager Jung!

478
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:20,110
Geez, what for? I'm going to talk
with the producer, so wait in the car.

479
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:23,510
Let's go the "Legend Town Concert"
in a private plane, okay?

480
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,640
Thank you! I'll work really hard!
Thank you, Manager Jung!

481
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,870
Wow, is the heater actually working?
Wow, it'll be a warm ride to the airport!

482
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,690
I'm already dripping with sweat, Joon Oh.

483
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,120
- Let me see.
- Pardon?

484
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,110
- Where's the sweat?
- Was it just my mood? I'm sorry.

485
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,810
- It felt like it...
- Just drive.

486
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,020
Hello, I'm Park Seul Gi.

487
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:10,110
I'm here where Legend Entertainment is
departing for their first concert abroad!

488
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:14,250
And the artists of Legend Entertainment
are just about to arrive--

489
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:18,840
It looks like Ha Ji Ah
is arriving right now!

490
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,390
Ji Ah, hello! Can you do an interview?

491
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:28,280
Yes! Oh, you have to leave?
Then please speak with us next time!

492
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,510
Okay, the former frontman
of Dreamers! It's Seo Joon Oh!

493
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:35,630
- Joon Oh! Have you been well?
- Hello.

494
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:38,770
- There are so many people...
- Oh, what? Have you--

495
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,900
I...

496
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,280
- Tae Ho!
- It's been a while.

497
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,000
Oh! How have you been, Tae Ho?

498
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,530
I know. This is your first concert
abroad! Are you ready for it?

499
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,320
This is our first concert abroad,
so we'll do a good job.

500
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,780
I'm worried for you.
Don't get hurt, okay?

501
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,540
- Yes
- I'm sorry.

502
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,860
- Tae Ho! Take care of your health!
- Let's talk again.

503
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,870
Yes, can you take me with you?

504
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,170
So Hee, your necklace is crooked.

505
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,110
Don't touch.

506
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,790
Move.

507
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:23,210
Yoon So Hee! Yoon So Hee!
Yoon So Hee...

508
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,680
Oh my! Oh my, hello, So Hee!

509
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,370
Have you been well? Are you ready?

510
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:35,110
- Do a good job while I'm gone.
- Sure.

511
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,540
And don't try to steal the company again.

512
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,270
I'll remember that.

513
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,790
It's a mistake the first time,
but not the second time. Okay?

514
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:45,390
- Yes, I got it, CEO Hwang.
- I'll be back.

515
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:54,910
Bong Hee! Please prepare comfortable
clothes for Joon Oh. He's uncomfortable.

516
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,540
- Yes, sure.
- Oh, and by the way...

517
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:00,350
- It's your first time on a plane, right?
- Yes, it's my first time.

518
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:03,940
I see. You know you're supposed
to take off your shoes on a plane, right?

519
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:06,790
- Please bring it to me when it's ready!
- Okay!

520
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,650
No way...

521
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,360
Wow, there's a place like this?

522
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:32,630
Excuse me... I should take off my shoes.
Manager Jung was right.

523
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,900
Wow, it's so spacious!

524
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,130
It smells nice.

525
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,500
Whoa... Wow... It's so pretty...

526
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,390
I'll talk to you when I get back.
What else could it be?

527
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:54,060
That's the only thing we'd about.
Anyway, I'll see you when I return.

528
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,470
It's So Hee.

529
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,760
Hello!

530
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,020
- Whose stylist are you?
- Oh, I'm Seo Joon Oh's stylist.

531
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,440
You're so screwed.

532
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,330
- Isn't it hard?
- No, it's fine so far.

533
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,760
Well...

534
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:18,110
Do you know what kind of person
Joon Oh is?

535
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,670
Pardon?

536
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:27,040
Oh. It's my first day, so I don't know.

537
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,750
Be careful of him.
Don't get on his bad side.

538
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,550
He's a scary person.

539
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,600
- Hey!
- Yes?

540
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,630
Why aren't you bringing my clothes?
I'm so uncomfortable.

541
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,250
Here.

542
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,880
- So Hee, it's been a while.
- Yeah, it has. How have you been?

543
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,370
Same old. I enjoyed your movie.
It's nice to see you succeed.

544
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:55,080
I have to continue to work hard
if I don't want to end up like you.

545
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,300
People like us don't know
when we'll be forgotten.

546
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,800
Oh, hey!

547
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,980
Give me my script.

548
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,470
Scene 87.

549
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:17,550
- What? Where are you going, So Hee?
- Oh, you should get ready.

550
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:22,370
Hey, you don't have a stylist. Where
would you go? Sit down. I'll be quick.

551
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:26,190
- Okay, I'll be here, then.
- I should change.

552
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,280
I'll be like you one day, right?

553
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,540
Don't worry! You'll be more
successful than I am.

554
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,070
So Hee.

555
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,850
How would you end up like me?

556
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,920
Don't worry. You won't be forgotten.

557
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,300
Why did you take off your shoes?
Follow me.

558
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:01,940
Manager Jung told me to take them off!

559
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,880
I'm... I'm coming!

560
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,820
Here it is.

561
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,840
- Pants.
- Yes. Here.

562
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,190
Why is he stripping
in front of me? We just met.

563
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:22,650
I wanted to change because my sweater
was itchy, so she brought turtlenecks?

564
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:24,860
I didn't ask her to bring me
uncomfortable clothes...

565
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,970
This is why I don't work with newbies.

566
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:34,650
Joon Oh, you're an angel. How will you
survive in this world by being kind?

567
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:40,610
I can see this being difficult.
Cheer up, Ra Bong Hee.

568
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,690
It hurts just to touch it.

569
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:48,210
How can I wear this if it hurts?
Do I have to change again?

570
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,900
<i>[Mom, I'm on the plane.]</i>

571
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,990
What is this? Is this stuck?

572
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,570
- Did you?
- No.

573
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,570
Ouch, this is prickly.
It hurts before I even put it on.

574
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:03,630
I'll have to change again!

575
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,810
Wait, Tae Ho.

576
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,950
Tae Ho, just a minute.

577
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,830
Wait. Oh! Ouch!

578
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:32,560
- You took photos, didn't you?
- Pardon?

579
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,310
You took pictures, didn't you?

580
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:39,830
No, I didn't. I was just...
watching you do things--

581
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:42,500
- Did she take pictures?
- I think so.

582
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,470
- Give it to me.
- No, I was texting my mom--

583
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:47,560
I really don't have pictures.

584
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,520
- Who are you?
- I'm Seo Joon Oh's stylist.

585
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,070
Joon Oh's stylist is Gyung Ran.

586
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,310
I'm not Gyung Ran.
I'm his new stylist.

587
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:59,500
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

588
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,340
This collar hurts even more!

589
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,730
Joon Oh, is she your stylist?

590
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,800
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

591
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,960
Oh, where did you...
Don't you have something like this?

592
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,250
You didn't take any. I'm sorry.

593
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:20,260
- Joon Oh, long time no see!
- Yeah.

594
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,690
Oh, what should we do?
Your skin is aging.

595
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:25,110
You should get it checked. Work hard!

596
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:30,470
Is she worrying about me or what?

597
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:34,600
Hey, do you have anything long like that?

598
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:44,610
This is the schedule. You have to wake up
at 7 a.m. to eat and go to the event.

599
00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:46,000
What is this?

600
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,810
Oh, for this, the head of the department
asked for it himself.

601
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:51,690
- What is it?
- Not right now. You'll see later.

602
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:55,280
- When? After I'm dead?
- Why do you have to say it like that?

603
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,440
Oh, girls! Welcome! Welcome!

604
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,790
- Hey! Hey!
- Hello.

605
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:04,030
- Hey, how are you?
- Sit down. Sit down.

606
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:06,820
Sit down. Sit down.
Would you like something to drink?

607
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,450
- I would!
- Sure, what would you like?

608
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:09,670
- Coffee.
- Coffee?

609
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:12,510
- How about you girls?
- Don't give them anything!

610
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:14,440
They don't deserve it.

611
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,950
- Hey!
- You wench.

612
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:27,390
Oh! Ji Ah, wait a minute.
I made a drink that's just like you!

613
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:30,090
It's bittersweet like you.

614
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:32,230
- That's enough.
- Okay.

615
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,820
Joon Oh!

616
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:41,370
Okay, here... Why are you late?

617
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:45,140
Here, let me pour you a glass, Yeol.

618
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,900
Is it good?

619
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:52,980
CEO Hwang, please pour me
a glass as well.

620
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:56,790
Anyway, you prepared for a year.
It's time to sweep the music charts.

621
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:59,690
I'm working hard on it.
Joon Oh is preparing an album as well.

622
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:03,850
- Yes, I wrote many songs.
- Oh, really?

623
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,510
Can I listen to one of your new songs?

624
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,800
Sure, of course.

625
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,350
Okay, Tae Ho!

626
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,330
- How are you, Tae Ho?
- I'm a lead actor now.

627
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,650
Please change my stylist, CEO Hwang.

628
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,480
I heard you're friends with Jung Yoon Ki.

629
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,890
Do you want Yoon Ki as your stylist?
I'll do that. It's no big deal.

630
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:31,760
Now, if you secure your place
as a leading actor in the upcoming series

631
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,210
you can erase the dishonor
associated with you because of Dreamers.

632
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:41,420
Later on, when you stage your
comeback album, won't the fans love it?

633
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:43,810
CEO Hwang, I'm ready to play the song.

634
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,510
Okay! Let's listen!

635
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:08,270
Wow!

636
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:12,600
- That's our Jae Hyun.
- Wow, that was good.

637
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,750
Good work!

638
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:18,260
I... have something to say.

639
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:24,230
I don't think I can do this any longer.

640
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,670
This is similar to
that guy's song, isn't it?

641
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,950
- It won't be the title track, right?
- I'm thinking about it.

642
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:00,940
- Yeol.
- Joon Oh, I'm sorry.

643
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,090
But this is the least
we can do to remember Jae Hyun.

644
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:07,380
CEO Hwang... I'll be leaving now.

645
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,610
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

646
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:23,300
<i>Passengers, this is your pilot.
The plane is shaking due to turbulence.</i>

647
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,460
<i>- Please take your seats.</i>
- Oh, it's shaking. Oh, my head...

648
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,050
<i>Please fasten your seat belts.</i>

649
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,400
- Oh, what?
- Wash them.

650
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,790
Pardon? But the plane is shaking...

651
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:42,780
Of course it is.
Have you never been on a plane?

652
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,800
- I haven't.
- Really?

653
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:51,280
- What should I wear?
- Oh, give it to me. How about this?

654
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,240
Hello.

655
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,740
- Ji Ah.
- Yeah?

656
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:03,730
- What is it?
- Don't take too many at a time.

657
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,550
Oh, I know.

658
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:10,650
- You seem to be everywhere.
- Oh, yes.

659
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,570
Manager Jung.

660
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:27,400
Shit. Hey, here.

661
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:33,220
Geez... Nothing goes
the way I want it to...

662
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,690
Joon Oh, I didn't do it
to hurt your feelings.

663
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:49,800
Then why did you do it?

664
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:52,900
Why did you make your song like that?

665
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,140
Yeol!

666
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,540
Just tell him already.

667
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,860
Tell him...

668
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:10,170
that you made the song to make Joon Oh
feel guilty for the rest of his life.

669
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:22,580
The clouds are becoming thicker.

670
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:27,370
- Have we stabilized?
- I think we should go up.

671
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:30,870
- Fly level 300.
- Fly level 300.

672
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:33,760
Control, this is 079er.

673
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,630
Request climb to fly level 300
due to the wind.

674
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:52,640
Um, CEO Hwang. Please sit up
and put on your seat belt.

675
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,610
It's okay, there are no seat belts here!

676
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:03,300
What's going on? Oh! What's going on?

677
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:16,540
Oh! CEO Hwang!
Lightning! There's lightning!

678
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,880
So what?

679
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,610
It's okay. This plane won't crash.
It's a safe plane.

680
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:25,840
- Tae Ho, let's stop. You're drunk.
- Who's drunk?

681
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:29,370
Am I wrong? Why did we break up?

682
00:50:29,370 --> 00:50:30,800
No.

683
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,230
Why were we forced to break up? Huh?

684
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:38,420
- Whose fault was it?
- Tae Ho, let's talk later.

685
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:43,330
No. So what?
What is it that you want to say?

686
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,760
I heard you followed us on the world tour
because you want to extend your contract.

687
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:55,800
And you're hanging on to this company
because you want to make an album.

688
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:01,040
Earlier, you talked about your own songs.
Do you think anyone can be a songwriter?

689
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,650
You sure have a strong will.

690
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,710
- You're being too harsh--
- No I'm not!

691
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:12,380
Don't you know what kind of person
that bastard is? He killed a man!

692
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:16,250
Jae Hyun was killed
by this son of a bitch!

693
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:21,080
<i>I'm... having a really hard time.</i>

694
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,620
It's so hard, that I could die.

695
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:27,730
Then die, you son of a bitch! Die!

696
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:39,020
Die. Okay?

697
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,310
We ask all passengers to stay in
their seats and fasten their seat belts.

698
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:52,240
Oh! Wow! Wow, CEO Hwang!
Please sit up! Please sit up!

699
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:56,630
Wow, seriously. We're not going to crash!

700
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:02,890
Oh! Oh! CEO Hwang! Please sit up.

701
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:04,750
Please put on your seat belt!

702
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,300
You're such a scaredy cat!

703
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:22,230
What are you doing here? Sit down.

704
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:26,770
- Hey, what's going on?
- What?

705
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:39,080
- Sit down!
- Hey, what's wrong with this plane?

706
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,830
Sit down! Hurry!

707
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,490
- What do we do?
- What's wrong?

708
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:47,240
This is why not everyone
can be on planes--

709
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,940
- Hey, grab something!
- We need seat belts!

710
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:54,320
- Hurry up and sit down!
- Sit down, you bastard!

711
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,400
- Stop overreacting. We're not crashing!
- Hold on tight!

712
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,720
- We're not going to crash!
- Hurry up and sit down!

713
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:03,010
- Ji Ah, don't sit. Hold on to something!
- I can't!

714
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:06,930
Shut up, you bitch! Don't sit and--

715
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:08,820
Listen to me!

716
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,750
Whoa, what's this?

717
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,990
Emergency positions!
Okay, crouch down, and curl up.

718
00:53:15,990 --> 00:53:19,610
Is this your first time on a plane?
It's just turbulence.

719
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:22,060
Lower my body, and wrap my neck.

720
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:26,120
You should do it properly then.
Wrap your head and lower it.

721
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,350
Lower my body...

722
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:32,660
Hey! What are you doing?

723
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:43,360
Someone is in here! Please help!

724
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,580
- Hey!
- Hey, Ji Ah!

725
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:48,120
Ji Ah!

726
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:50,380
Hey. Hey! Hey!

727
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:53,740
Geez, is anyone here?

728
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:57,500
Sir, there's a fire.
There's a fire in the engine!

729
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:04,090
- CEO Hwang! CEO Hwang!
- Are you okay?

730
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:05,920
Are you okay?

731
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:12,220
- Ji Ah!
- Crouch down... Crouch down!

732
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:16,510
Ji Ah. Ji Ah. Ji Ah.

733
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:19,250
Please.

734
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:22,400
This isn't the time for that.
Crouch down.

735
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,810
Yeah, I know! I know! Go over there.

736
00:54:25,810 --> 00:54:29,280
I changed my password... to 2580!

737
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,710
CEO Hwang! Crouch down!

738
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:35,220
I know, you bastard! Stop it!

739
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:42,110
Ji Ah! Ji Ah. Open your eyes!
Ji Ah! Ji Ah.

740
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:49,700
- We're about to disengage!
- Check.

741
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:51,170
- Switch to level 2!
- Confirmed.

742
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:52,330
Done.

743
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:57,560
No! What do I do? Please save me!

744
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:14,550
We're going down.
Declare an emergency!

745
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:18,040
Roger! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

746
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:22,650
Ji Ah! Ji Ah!

747
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:25,750
What the hell is this?

748
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,830
If this is a joke, stop it!

749
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:33,070
What is this? Ki Joon! I'm hurt!

750
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,790
Ji Ah!

751
00:55:34,790 --> 00:55:37,590
I'm in here! Save me!

752
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,720
Save me!

753
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:50,640
Joon Oh! Joon Oh!

754
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:53,430
Joon Oh!

755
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,850
- What the hell is this?
- Joon Oh, are you okay?

756
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:01,500
Ji Ah!

757
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:13,800
Please wait here. I'll come back
after I check the situation.

758
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:18,170
Control, this is 079er.
We are in a dive. We are in a dive.

759
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:21,150
We're crashing, you bastards!

760
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:33,150
3000 feet!

761
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:11,690
So what did you say to Jae Hyun? How
could you? You should have comforted him.

762
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,300
<i>- Ji Ah.</i>
- Yeah?

763
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,690
Never mind.

764
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:28,670
- What is it?
- You'll meet a new manager tomorrow.

765
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,240
Why?

766
00:57:39,110 --> 00:57:40,830
Is it because of the incident?

767
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:45,980
You're not wearing your seat belt again.
I told you to always wear it. Geez.

768
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,190
Wear it, even if it's bothersome.

769
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,070
I'm almost there.

770
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,810
Gosh, seriously.

771
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:30,530
Let's cheer up. Since we're all here.
Let's hear what he has to say.

772
00:58:53,170 --> 00:58:54,770
Jae Hyun.

773
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,980
Ja... Ja... Jae Hyun.

774
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:19,420
Hey, Jae... Jae Hyun! Jae... Hey!

775
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,700
Hey! Jae Hyun!

776
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:25,120
Hey, Jae Hyun!

777
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,410
No! No!

<i>is welcoming you.</i>

8
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:41,188
Okay, Mom.

9
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:46,710
<i>Ra Bong Hee... You feel comfortable.</i>

10
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:49,853
<i>You're in a place...</i>

11
00:00:49,853 --> 00:00:54,622
<i>where you can spend your entire life

12
00:01:05,918 --> 00:01:07,489
Let's go.

13
00:01:16,823 --> 00:01:18,897
<i>[Episode 4]</i>

14
00:01:32,951 --> 00:01:34,855
Ra Bong Hee.

15
00:01:34,855 --> 00:01:40,412
You walk into the woods,
with the people you love.

16
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,900
<i>Ra Bong Hee, you're not scared at all.</i>

17
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:53,923
<i>Because your loved ones
are by your side to protect you.</i>

18
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:59,500
<i>And then you approach a door.</i>

19
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:04,079
<i>Ra Bong Hee, you are afraid.</i>

20
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,169
<i>However, your loved ones
are by your side to protect you.</i>

21
00:02:09,824 --> 00:02:12,943
<i>So you build up the courage</i>

22
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:16,769
<i>and slowly, walk...</i>

23
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,556
<i>through that door.</i>

24
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:44,228
Bong Hee!

25
00:02:44,906 --> 00:02:46,520
Joon Oh!

26
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:49,395
<i>Over here!</i>

27
00:02:50,205 --> 00:02:51,993
<i>Joon Oh!</i>

28
00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:59,925
Geez, I'm so hungry,
that I'm hearing things now.

29
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:09,826
Geez, my legs hurt...

30
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:11,525
<i>Over here!</i>

31
00:03:13,455 --> 00:03:15,284
<i>Joon Oh!</i>

32
00:03:20,002 --> 00:03:21,639
Yeol?

33
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:27,037
Joon Oh!

34
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:30,549
Wow, this place...

35
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:34,159
A ghost could pop out of nowhere.

36
00:03:34,894 --> 00:03:36,858
Wow.

37
00:03:37,475 --> 00:03:41,415
Yeol, can you hear my voice?
Yeol, I stepped on a landmine--

38
00:03:41,415 --> 00:03:43,335
Whoa!

39
00:03:48,407 --> 00:03:50,662
Who's out here in the middle of the night

40
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:52,990
making ghost sounds?

41
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,078
What if a ghost really pops out?

42
00:03:58,537 --> 00:04:02,788
Do you know who I am?
After the plane crash...

43
00:04:02,788 --> 00:04:05,520
I have one foot on a landmine!

44
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,679
Who--

45
00:04:26,024 --> 00:04:28,418
Wow, amazing.
The landmine didn't explode.

46
00:04:29,093 --> 00:04:31,860
Wait.

47
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,254
Ki Joon was right.

48
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:36,112
This is old.

49
00:04:36,112 --> 00:04:39,363
Wow, this is... Damn it!

50
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,901
Why are you crying?

51
00:04:57,166 --> 00:04:59,139
Oh...

52
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:02,466
I must have hit you in the eye.
Does it hurt?

53
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:06,487
I thought you were a ghost. I'm sorry.

54
00:05:14,341 --> 00:05:18,449
I'm sorry, for leaving you here alone.

55
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:26,285
Hey, why are you sorry? I told you to go.

56
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:29,000
What are you sorry about? Don't cry.

57
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:33,276
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:33,276 --> 00:05:35,865
Hey, why are you crying?

59
00:05:36,976 --> 00:05:39,257
My hands are dirty.

60
00:05:43,225 --> 00:05:45,267
Stop, okay?

61
00:05:46,636 --> 00:05:50,136
Stop crying. Geez. Okay?

62
00:05:53,237 --> 00:05:56,322
Geez, come here.

63
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:59,213
There, there. Don't cry.

64
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:03,976
Okay? Stop. Geez...

65
00:06:03,976 --> 00:06:06,430
There, there...

66
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:09,620
You're a nice girl, right? Don't cry.

67
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,399
Here. There, there. There, there.

68
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:26,380
Stop.

69
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:30,333
Stop.

70
00:06:38,824 --> 00:06:40,644
<i>Over here!</i>

71
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:43,377
<i>Joon Oh!</i>

72
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:48,209
<i>Joon Oh!</i>

73
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:49,843
That's Yeol, right?

74
00:06:52,255 --> 00:06:55,095
- Let's go.
- Hey!

75
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,517
- Yeol, grab this.
- Grab it and wrap it around your waist.

76
00:07:00,517 --> 00:07:02,166
Can you do that?

77
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,720
- Hold on tight!
- Tell me when you're ready!

78
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,060
Pull this, okay?

79
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,321
- I'm ready!
- Okay. One, two, three!

80
00:07:12,238 --> 00:07:13,815
Two.

81
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:18,988
A little more!

82
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Ow my arm!

83
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,774
Be... Be careful of your arm!

84
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,562
- Yeol, are you okay?
- Yeol, look at me.

85
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:37,137
Joon Oh, are you okay? Are you hurt?

86
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:41,812
What is this...

87
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,471
It's so deep.

88
00:07:46,196 --> 00:07:48,055
It's so deep. Are you really okay?

89
00:07:48,055 --> 00:07:51,041
What about Ji Ah? What happened to Ji Ah?

90
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:20,699
You're alive. I knew it.

91
00:08:21,358 --> 00:08:23,601
How could I die and leave you here alone?

92
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:30,709
That's okay. Don't move. Just lie down.

93
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:38,610
Were you the one who saved me?

94
00:08:52,835 --> 00:08:56,240
<i>If not me, who would take care of you?</i>

95
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:03,751
My boyfriend is pretty cool.

96
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,109
You're awake? Tae Ho,
CEO Hwang asked us to gather for a talk.

97
00:09:12,109 --> 00:09:16,203
Geez, don't you think you slept too much?
Your complexion looks great.

98
00:09:16,844 --> 00:09:18,958
I'll be back. Rest here.

99
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,854
Geez, why did you go off and get hurt?
You make me so angry.

100
00:09:28,854 --> 00:09:32,081
Hey, do you think I wanted to get hurt?

101
00:09:33,296 --> 00:09:34,950
Thanks.

102
00:09:35,735 --> 00:09:37,528
- For what?
- What do you think...

103
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:40,527
Don't get hurt. Don't get hurt...

104
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:43,860
- Rest, okay?
- Okay.

105
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:47,325
Gosh.

106
00:09:50,408 --> 00:09:54,244
What is this? Is he giving this to me,
or did he drop it?

107
00:09:55,743 --> 00:10:01,134
Hey, I can't believe we're all alive.
It feels like a dream.

108
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:04,004
But, no matter how much I think about it

109
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,687
I don't think our lives here
will end easily.

110
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:10,004
Manager Jung,
I'm not really going to die, am I?

111
00:10:10,004 --> 00:10:14,994
I told you it wasn't a poisonous snake.
You're alive right now, so...

112
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:16,342
You're okay.

113
00:10:16,342 --> 00:10:19,923
What should we do
if we want to get out of here alive?

114
00:10:19,923 --> 00:10:22,543
What else can we do?

115
00:10:22,543 --> 00:10:24,912
We have no choice
but to wait here to be rescued.

116
00:10:24,912 --> 00:10:27,710
We're all wondering if we should
rely on being rescued right now.

117
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,073
Tae Ho, we should wait to be rescued,
but not here.

118
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:32,989
There's no shelter when it rains

119
00:10:32,989 --> 00:10:35,520
and if something like this happens again,
we'll be in trouble.

120
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,813
So what are you trying to say?
What do you want to do?

121
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:44,249
Let's go into the woods!

122
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:50,758
I stepped on a landmine
in the woods today.

123
00:10:50,758 --> 00:10:53,109
Ki Joon, you saw it, right?
Ra Bong Hee saw it too.

124
00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:55,960
Anyway, what does
a landmine on an island mean?

125
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,116
It means other people, or soldiers
once lived on this island.

126
00:11:00,116 --> 00:11:03,520
Even the hole that Yeol fell into,
was made by people.

127
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,065
The hole was hidden with wood,
which means a person made it!

128
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:11,239
The place where those people lived...
The place where they ate and slept...

129
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:13,822
That's what we have to find.
That's how we can survive.

130
00:11:13,822 --> 00:11:16,533
We can just build
another dwelling out here!

131
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,758
I don't think we should leave the beach.

132
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:22,035
If we are too far away from the beach,
we won't get rescued.

133
00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:24,464
How can they save people
they can't even see?

134
00:11:24,464 --> 00:11:26,854
We can get a rescue signal
from inside the woods.

135
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:29,647
The weather is cray here,
and it's getting colder too.

136
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:32,431
We have a patient, so we
have to find a warmer and safer place.

137
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:36,109
Why didn't you change after suffering?
Do you need to suffer some more?

138
00:11:36,109 --> 00:11:38,374
I understand that you go all out
when you have an idea

139
00:11:38,374 --> 00:11:42,032
but out of all lies you could have come
up with, a landmine? Try to be rational!

140
00:11:42,032 --> 00:11:46,119
Seo Joon Oh really stepped on a mine.
It didn't explode--

141
00:11:46,119 --> 00:11:49,306
Why don't you stay out of this?
I'm talking here.

142
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,004
- Why are you taking it out on Bong Hee?
- Hey, what was that?

143
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:57,078
Oh, I guess you got close after
being on a deserted island together.

144
00:11:57,078 --> 00:11:59,376
Excuse me, is Joon Oh really good to you?

145
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:02,525
He should treat us better. I guess
he's only good to irrelevant people.

146
00:12:02,525 --> 00:12:05,219
Tae Ho, what's wrong? Why do you
only act like that with Joon Oh?

147
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:09,109
Who's the bastard who killed Jae Hyun
and screwed up "Dreamers"?

148
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,503
That same bastard is acting arrogant,
so would you have anything nice to say?

149
00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:26,717
That's enough.

150
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:29,792
You're the same as before!

151
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:32,508
If you want to be doomed and die,
do it yourself.

152
00:12:32,508 --> 00:12:35,081
Do you know how hard it was
to recover my career back then?

153
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:36,855
That's enough, you punk.

154
00:12:36,855 --> 00:12:42,243
After that day, I decided to never
believe you again. I made up my mind...

155
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:45,527
So if you're going to leave,
leave by yourself, you son of a bitch.

156
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:52,513
Choi Tae Ho, aren't you
being too harsh? He's still--

157
00:12:52,513 --> 00:12:55,071
I told you to stop, Choi Tae Ho!

158
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,456
I'll just say one more thing. Joon Oh.

159
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:05,571
I'm begging you.
Don't try to do anything from now on.

160
00:13:05,571 --> 00:13:08,441
When you take the lead,
you mess up everything.

161
00:13:08,441 --> 00:13:11,769
Jae Hyun and "Dreamers"

162
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:15,994
were both screwed over because
you took the lead. Am I wrong?

163
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:19,816
Stop it, you bastards!

164
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:23,729
Why are you bringing that up again?
"Jae Hyun! Jae Hyun! Jae Hyun! Jae Hyun!"

165
00:13:23,729 --> 00:13:27,167
Stop talking about Jae Hyun already!

166
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:31,027
We are supposed to think about how
we are going to survive, you bastards!

167
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:33,311
We should do everything
we can to survive!

168
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,465
Tae Ho is right. He's...

169
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,745
He's right about everything.

170
00:13:41,745 --> 00:13:44,475
But please listen
to my opinion this time.

171
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:49,136
I'm saying this so we can all live.
It's not so I can survive alone.

172
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:51,845
We need to go into the woods

173
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:57,340
and find a safe place if we want to live.
If we don't stay together...

174
00:13:58,816 --> 00:14:00,956
It'll be harder for us to survive.

175
00:14:11,828 --> 00:14:14,224
Let's take a vote. Let's take a vote!

176
00:14:14,224 --> 00:14:16,297
Let's vote

177
00:14:16,297 --> 00:14:20,523
and we'll do what the majority votes for.
We'll all go, or we'll all stay.

178
00:14:20,523 --> 00:14:22,131
Choi Tae Ho, what do you think?

179
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:24,945
- Do what you want.
- You little...

180
00:14:24,945 --> 00:14:27,724
- What do you think?
- Yes, let's do that.

181
00:14:27,724 --> 00:14:29,258
Okay.

182
00:14:29,965 --> 00:14:31,291
Okay!

183
00:14:32,479 --> 00:14:35,200
"I want to stay here." Raise your hands!

184
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:39,419
What are you doing?

185
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,498
Hey, let's not go on an adventure.

186
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,697
It's me, Manager Jung, and So Hee.
It's the four of us.

187
00:14:50,697 --> 00:14:53,932
Out of all people,
what's your reason, Yeol?

188
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,895
I want to follow Joon Oh.

189
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:00,000
Because he's our team's leader.

190
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:05,658
Joon Oh's stylist.

191
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:07,663
- Yes.
- What's your reason?

192
00:15:07,663 --> 00:15:12,633
I think we should look for traces of
other people if we want to live longer.

193
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:16,442
You son of a bitch,
why didn't you raise your hand?

194
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:21,638
I... get cold really easily.

195
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:24,996
This place isn't right. The sea breeze
is really intense here, so it's too cold.

196
00:15:24,996 --> 00:15:28,027
I should have abandoned
this son of a bitch.

197
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,854
Then...

198
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:34,297
One, two, three, four. We're tied.
What do we do? Seriously!

199
00:15:34,297 --> 00:15:36,196
Ji Ah hasn't voted yet.

200
00:15:37,398 --> 00:15:39,120
I'll go and ask her.

201
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,907
Okay, ask Ji Ah!

202
00:15:44,907 --> 00:15:49,091
We will all go if Ji Ah says yes,
and stay if she wants to stay.

203
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:53,013
You heard, right?

204
00:15:53,013 --> 00:15:55,030
Yeah. I heard.

205
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,753
What do you want to do?

206
00:15:56,753 --> 00:16:00,203
- You want to stay here, right?
- You heard, so you should know.

207
00:16:00,203 --> 00:16:01,813
What about you?

208
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:04,071
Ji Ah, what do you want to do?

209
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:10,008
Ji Ah will probably do
what Choi Tae Ho wants to do, right?

210
00:16:10,008 --> 00:16:12,230
You don't know
what kind of girl Ji Ah is, do you?

211
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:17,883
Ji Ah is a girl who wrote
her own contract at the age of 14.

212
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:22,039
There's no one else in this company
who's as confident as she is.

213
00:16:25,837 --> 00:16:28,615
- Tae Ho.
- Yeah?

214
00:16:28,615 --> 00:16:31,934
- You know I like you a lot, right?
- Of course I do.

215
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:34,325
But Tae Ho...

216
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:38,956
I don't want to stay here.

217
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:42,974
I want to follow Joon Oh.

218
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:50,221
Hey, Ji Ah. If you follow Joon Oh--

219
00:16:50,221 --> 00:16:52,514
Don't try to talk me out of it.

220
00:16:52,514 --> 00:16:56,809
We don't need to have the same opinions
just because we love each other, do we?

221
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,679
Let's make our own decisions, Tae Ho.

222
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,740
Pack your bags.
We can leave tomorrow morning.

223
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,611
Pack our bags?

224
00:17:15,611 --> 00:17:20,517
Damn it! Hey, if there are landmines,
what else could be out there?

225
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,767
Are you worried?

226
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:37,755
Are you worried that
you'll drag everyone in there

227
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:40,752
and get all the blame
if we don't find anything?

228
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:45,153
Who cares about that?

229
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:49,217
If we search but can't find anything...

230
00:17:49,217 --> 00:17:51,434
I'll share the blame with you.

231
00:17:52,144 --> 00:17:55,676
Hey, I'm saying
I'll take the insults with you.

232
00:17:56,671 --> 00:18:00,597
Hey, of course you should.
You're my stylist.

233
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:04,409
Hey, if Tae Ho tries to beat me up...

234
00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:06,743
Can you throw the first punch for me?

235
00:18:06,743 --> 00:18:10,474
Tae Ho's a really good fighter.
He even learned kickboxing...

236
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,980
Geez, there's nothing
I can't say to you anymore...

237
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,131
Don't worry. I'll hit him for you.

238
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:24,455
Even if you tell me
not to be, I'm worried.

239
00:18:26,954 --> 00:18:30,365
Get some sleep.
We have to wake up early tomorrow.

240
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:36,834
Wait, Seo Joon Oh.

241
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:44,984
I'm not sure if I can ask you this...

242
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:49,248
But what happened

243
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:52,880
between you and Jae Hyun?

244
00:19:02,936 --> 00:19:07,461
- Let's go big!
- Thank you!

245
00:19:08,632 --> 00:19:11,483
Hey, for our cake...

246
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,424
- Jae Hyun will be our representative.
- Sounds good!

247
00:19:14,424 --> 00:19:16,384
- We should do it together!
- Shin Jae Hyun!

248
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:20,046
Shin Jae Hyun! Shin Jae Hyun!
Shin Jae Hyun!

249
00:19:20,046 --> 00:19:22,897
- Shin Jae Hyun! Shin Jae Hyun!
- Shin Jae Hyun! Shin Jae Hyun!

250
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:28,164
One year! One year!
One year! One year! One year!

251
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:30,951
What do we do? Is he really mad?

252
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:32,958
- Are you okay?
- Jae Hyun, are you okay?

253
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,146
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

254
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:40,183
Hey, that's right! That's our Jae Hyun!

255
00:19:40,183 --> 00:19:44,991
Shin Jae Hyun! Shin Jae Hyun!
Shin Jae Hyun!

256
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:56,174
<i>It's... It's too hard for me.
It's so difficult, I could die.</i>

257
00:19:56,174 --> 00:20:00,087
Then die, you son of a bitch! Die!

258
00:20:06,061 --> 00:20:08,392
No...

259
00:20:08,392 --> 00:20:13,896
No! Don't go, please...

260
00:20:27,823 --> 00:20:29,993
You killed him.

261
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:57,935
I killed Jae Hyun.

262
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:04,259
I killed him.

263
00:21:23,425 --> 00:21:27,750
<i>You are on a path lined with flowers,
brightly lit from the warm sun.</i>

264
00:21:28,446 --> 00:21:32,246
<i>When you walk through the next door...</i>

265
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:37,425
<i>A very large tree is waiting for you.</i>

266
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:42,336
<i>You are unable to understand
the tree's message</i>

267
00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:45,376
<i>just yet.</i>

268
00:21:46,903 --> 00:21:49,724
<i>The windy hills...</i>

269
00:21:49,724 --> 00:21:53,036
<i>are beautiful, but it's a weary path.</i>

270
00:21:54,597 --> 00:21:56,243
<i>Ra Bong Hee.</i>

271
00:21:56,243 --> 00:22:00,917
<i>You discover a gift
that will take you to the truth.</i>

272
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:06,415
<i>Ra Bong Hee, what is the gift...</i>

273
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:08,088
that you discovered?

274
00:22:10,175 --> 00:22:14,092
<i>What did you find, Ra Bong Hee?</i>

275
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,049
A necklace.

276
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,242
A necklace.

277
00:22:23,818 --> 00:22:27,092
Why did you find a necklace?

278
00:22:28,234 --> 00:22:32,415
I don't know, it's just...

279
00:22:32,415 --> 00:22:35,406
It's just there...

280
00:22:35,406 --> 00:22:39,645
Do you remember who owns...

281
00:22:39,645 --> 00:22:41,523
that necklace?

282
00:22:42,727 --> 00:22:44,030
Yes.

283
00:22:45,942 --> 00:22:47,511
I know.

284
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,338
<i>The necklace...</i>

285
00:22:53,942 --> 00:22:57,170
<i>The necklace belongs to...</i>

286
00:23:02,945 --> 00:23:06,736
The necklace belongs to...

287
00:23:26,765 --> 00:23:30,279
They found the island that you were on.

288
00:23:50,492 --> 00:23:53,337
Bong Hee, are you ready?

289
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:57,840
Why is your face lacking color?

290
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,332
Are you sick?

291
00:24:00,332 --> 00:24:02,608
No, I didn't sleep very well.

292
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:07,115
No wonder...
Why are you going on a plane again?

293
00:24:07,115 --> 00:24:09,436
It's okay, Mom.

294
00:24:09,436 --> 00:24:13,616
Bong Hee, try this on.
Let's bring some life to your face.

295
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,568
What do you think? Does it suit me?

296
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:32,484
Yeah. You're so pretty, Bong Hee.

297
00:24:32,484 --> 00:24:36,386
I don't normally dress up. But when I do,
I look pretty because I take after you.

298
00:24:36,386 --> 00:24:38,772
My daughter...

299
00:24:38,772 --> 00:24:41,848
You'd better take care of yourself
on this trip.

300
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:43,627
Don't worry.

301
00:24:51,965 --> 00:24:54,198
This is your second trip abroad.

302
00:24:56,765 --> 00:25:01,286
It's not easy
to send you away or to trust you.

303
00:25:01,286 --> 00:25:03,453
Chairwoman Jo, aren't you...

304
00:25:03,453 --> 00:25:04,875
coming with me?

305
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:08,317
There's no guarantee that you'll
recover more of your memory if I'm there.

306
00:25:08,317 --> 00:25:11,724
Investigator Oh
will take good care of you.

307
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:14,105
So you'd better regain
all of your memory.

308
00:25:42,108 --> 00:25:45,403
When you wake up from a nice nap,
we'll be there.

309
00:26:04,252 --> 00:26:07,542
Wherever we are in the ocean,
it all looks the same

310
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:10,887
but do you remember anything
now that we're almost there?

311
00:26:13,942 --> 00:26:16,329
Oh, that island that we see over there

312
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:18,717
is the island you were on!

313
00:26:18,717 --> 00:26:21,762
We're going there now!
Do you see it?

314
00:27:21,837 --> 00:27:25,111
<i>[Hwang Jae Gook, Tae Ho Hang,
Jung Ki Joon, Choi Tae Ho, Ha Ji Ah]</i>

315
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:29,042
<i>[Yoon So Hee, Lee Yeol, Seo Joon Oh,
and Ra Bong Hee won't give up.]</i>

316
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:32,721
- I really like it here, though!
- Hey, it's cold here.

317
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:34,130
Come on.

318
00:27:35,464 --> 00:27:37,119
What are you doing? Let's go!

319
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,967
Okay, I'm coming!

320
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:47,357
You can follow me!

321
00:27:53,148 --> 00:27:57,866
<i>[Seo Joon Oh]</i>

322
00:28:26,142 --> 00:28:27,878
We're almost there!

323
00:28:27,878 --> 00:28:30,461
You know where you're going, right?

324
00:28:30,461 --> 00:28:32,111
Where are we headed?

325
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:38,233
We're almost there!
Just a little longer!

326
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:41,317
- Ji Ah, are you okay?
- We were already here!

327
00:28:41,317 --> 00:28:43,915
Hey, don't get mad! Come on!

328
00:28:43,915 --> 00:28:46,917
Didn't we just come from there?

329
00:28:50,434 --> 00:28:51,973
We're here!

330
00:28:51,973 --> 00:28:56,011
- He said we're here! He said we're here!
- Where?

331
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:58,336
Do you even know where we're going?

332
00:28:59,807 --> 00:29:01,712
What the hell are you doing?

333
00:29:02,894 --> 00:29:06,262
- Where are you going?
- Are you joking? Are you fooling around?

334
00:29:06,262 --> 00:29:09,980
- We're here.
- Hey, you sound like a mom!

335
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:12,683
- Where are you going now?
- Where are you going?

336
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:16,173
- This isn't it!
- We're here!

337
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:19,022
- We were here already!
- No, we weren't.

338
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:23,290
He keeps saying, "We're here,
we're here." Where is he now? Hey!

339
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:28,394
Oh, what do we do?
Where... Where were you?

340
00:29:28,394 --> 00:29:33,201
Let's just go! I don't know
why we keep following him!

341
00:29:33,201 --> 00:29:37,166
- We'll just end up coming back here.
- He came back!

342
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:40,230
- When did you get here?
- We were here the whole time.

343
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,272
- You were here this whole time?
- Yeah.

344
00:30:16,616 --> 00:30:19,538
We found it. Right?

345
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,269
It's really here.

346
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:34,932
Hey! Wow! You punk!

347
00:30:34,932 --> 00:30:37,271
- Did you know this was here?
- I didn't know.

348
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:39,087
Wow!

349
00:30:41,326 --> 00:30:43,034
Let's go inside!

350
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:47,596
Can we live here?

351
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:51,097
Hey, we should be thankful for this!

352
00:30:51,097 --> 00:30:54,838
- Be careful!
- Wow...

353
00:30:54,838 --> 00:30:57,126
- Wow...
- Wow!

354
00:30:57,126 --> 00:30:59,666
- Hey, did you know this was here?
- I didn't know.

355
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:02,230
- Hey, here...
- It's not bad!

356
00:31:58,134 --> 00:32:01,248
- Hey, Ra Bong Hee!
- Yes, I'm coming!

357
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,636
I think something
might be inside. Go inside.

358
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,721
Hey, this thing...
It's deep! Go inside!

359
00:32:12,721 --> 00:32:16,367
- Go inside.
- It's so deep. I would have been doomed.

360
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,357
- I could have died.
- Which ones?

361
00:32:18,357 --> 00:32:19,648
This one and that one.

362
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:22,221
- This?
- Yeah, this one and that one.

363
00:32:25,006 --> 00:32:29,752
<i>Hey, stop it. It's not like
you've ever worked before...</i>

364
00:32:29,752 --> 00:32:32,954
Hey! Hey! Everyone, gather around!
We should have a meeting.

365
00:32:32,954 --> 00:32:34,932
What are you talking about?

366
00:32:34,932 --> 00:32:37,358
- Ji Ah, wait. You're hurt...
- No.

367
00:32:37,358 --> 00:32:40,923
- Share opinions and have arguments!
- That's how we should work!

368
00:32:40,923 --> 00:32:43,881
- Let's do this again...
- Is this a corner?

369
00:34:06,569 --> 00:34:10,125
- Get yourself together!
- No!

370
00:34:12,376 --> 00:34:14,847
- Let go!
- No!

371
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:41,297
<i>My younger sister... died.</i>

372
00:34:41,297 --> 00:34:46,548
To be more exact,
she was murdered on that island.

373
00:35:04,076 --> 00:35:07,255
<i>Do you remember who it was...</i>

374
00:35:08,393 --> 00:35:10,539
who killed my sister?

375
00:35:31,922 --> 00:35:33,288
Ra Bong Hee!

376
00:35:35,153 --> 00:35:37,452
What are you doing here?

377
00:35:39,235 --> 00:35:42,123
Did you remember something?

378
00:35:43,927 --> 00:35:47,280
No... No.

379
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,909
Then, why do you look like that?
Are you sick?

380
00:35:54,117 --> 00:35:57,106
No. I'm fine.

381
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:09,188
Okay. I'm sorry for making you wait.

382
00:36:16,867 --> 00:36:18,940
What did you want to talk to me about?

383
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:23,538
I... thought about this
for a long time...

384
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,802
But I thought you should know,
so I brought it here.

385
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,641
What is that?

386
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:47,605
Do you really not remember anything?

387
00:36:49,228 --> 00:36:53,690
- I'm sorry.
- We just wasted money...

388
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,913
Where are you headed?

389
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:58,938
- Home.
- We'll give you a ride.

390
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:02,367
<i>[Prosecutor Yoon]</i>

391
00:37:03,505 --> 00:37:05,159
Aren't you going to answer?

392
00:37:06,646 --> 00:37:08,438
Go ahead and answer it.

393
00:37:09,307 --> 00:37:13,467
No. It's not important.
I'll go home by myself.

394
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:15,914
No. No. We have to take you home.

395
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:19,500
This way.

396
00:37:31,018 --> 00:37:33,163
Geez, what is it this time?

397
00:37:33,978 --> 00:37:35,753
Yes, Chairman Jo!

398
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,958
Right now?
Why so suddenly?

399
00:37:40,126 --> 00:37:41,615
Excuse me?

400
00:37:50,396 --> 00:37:52,971
<i>Doctor Park left this here.</i>

401
00:37:54,684 --> 00:37:57,760
He said this is the recording from
Ra Bong Hee's hypnosis session.

402
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,659
Investigator Oh,
did you step out during that session?

403
00:38:06,005 --> 00:38:11,248
Oh, I left for just a moment
when they found the island.

404
00:38:12,711 --> 00:38:15,641
He said this was recorded then.
Listen to it.

405
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:17,900
Okay.

406
00:38:21,072 --> 00:38:25,101
<i>Do you remember who owns...</i>

407
00:38:25,101 --> 00:38:26,842
<i>that necklace?</i>

408
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:31,347
<i>Yes. I know.</i>

409
00:38:37,117 --> 00:38:40,208
<i>I heard you visited that island.</i>

410
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:42,295
<i>Please give me a call.</i>

411
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:47,534
<i>That necklace belongs to...</i>

412
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,554
<i>So Hee.</i>

413
00:39:00,943 --> 00:39:02,588
<i>Yoon So Hee.</i>

414
00:39:05,351 --> 00:39:07,514
Ra Bong Hee.

415
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:12,641
Why do you have Yoon So Hee's necklace?

416
00:39:21,481 --> 00:39:25,114
I... I...

417
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,010
I... killed her.

418
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,856
<i>No!</i>

419
00:39:38,427 --> 00:39:41,362
<i>I killed Yoon So Hee.</i>

420
00:39:46,163 --> 00:39:48,184
What are we going to do now?

421
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,751
Ra Bong Hee, that girl...

422
00:39:51,751 --> 00:39:55,855
Will we make her into a survivor,
or a murderer?

423
00:39:56,788 --> 00:39:59,443
We don't have clear evidence
that she murdered--

424
00:39:59,443 --> 00:40:00,894
Investigator Oh!

425
00:40:00,894 --> 00:40:03,706
I'm talking about evidence.

426
00:40:03,706 --> 00:40:06,235
I'm asking you
what will work in our favor

427
00:40:06,235 --> 00:40:09,420
making her into a survivor or a murderer?

428
00:40:13,173 --> 00:40:15,322
Are you asking for
a politically favorable decision?

429
00:40:15,322 --> 00:40:17,472
Yes, a political decision!

430
00:40:17,472 --> 00:40:21,690
The citizens of this nation pay for our
salaries with taxes, so we can do that.

431
00:40:22,309 --> 00:40:26,635
Is she a survivor or a murderer? Huh?
What is it going to be?

432
00:40:26,635 --> 00:40:30,085
Should we give Ra Bong Hee
a ride in a flower palanquin...

433
00:40:30,085 --> 00:40:32,155
or a police car?

434
00:40:37,074 --> 00:40:39,005
- Look at this!
- What is it?

435
00:40:39,005 --> 00:40:42,362
It's a suitcase! A suitcase...

436
00:40:42,362 --> 00:40:45,351
- Oh! I think that's mine!
- Pardon?

437
00:40:45,351 --> 00:40:49,210
- Wow! Where did you find this?
- I found it by the rocks at the beach.

438
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,664
- Wow!
- My shoes!

439
00:40:51,664 --> 00:40:54,737
Wow, my shoes! Wow!

440
00:40:54,737 --> 00:40:57,250
Wow! My shoes!

441
00:41:00,201 --> 00:41:02,639
I didn't see this
when I was there last time.

442
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:06,940
I think it was swept onto shore by the
waves. I think there are a few more...

443
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:09,690
Would anyone be willing
to swim out there with me?

444
00:41:12,909 --> 00:41:15,815
Look. We don't know
how long we'll be here

445
00:41:15,815 --> 00:41:19,826
so if we find some more suitcases,
it'll be a huge help to us.

446
00:41:19,826 --> 00:41:21,726
If they might be helpful,
we should find them.

447
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:26,472
Who would like to come with me?

448
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,201
Why are you looking at me?

449
00:41:36,331 --> 00:41:40,914
- We have to do it, right?
- You're the one who said we should.

450
00:41:40,914 --> 00:41:42,351
We must do it.

451
00:41:44,914 --> 00:41:48,371
- We can succeed, right?
- We have to.

452
00:41:48,371 --> 00:41:50,757
Everyone is putting their faith in us.

453
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,389
Hey, don't worry, okay?

454
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:57,601
Trust me. Let's go!

455
00:42:10,554 --> 00:42:13,586
Hey! Hey! Go slowly, okay?

456
00:42:13,586 --> 00:42:16,132
You're going overboard! Hey!

457
00:42:17,108 --> 00:42:20,451
Hey, the currents are strong over there!
Hey! Hey! Slow down!

458
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,755
Ra Bong Hee!

459
00:42:27,413 --> 00:42:29,621
Oh, geez.

460
00:42:29,621 --> 00:42:31,155
Let's go!

461
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:47,972
Geez, the currents are no joke! Right?

462
00:42:49,467 --> 00:42:51,030
Clothes!

463
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:55,210
What is this? Ramen! Ramen! Wow!

464
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,322
Hey!

465
00:42:56,322 --> 00:42:57,786
- Not the tuna!
- Just one.

466
00:42:57,786 --> 00:42:59,557
- We should share with everyone.
- Just one.

467
00:42:59,557 --> 00:43:00,923
No.

468
00:43:00,923 --> 00:43:03,039
Wow, look at this.

469
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,771
Let's go and find one more.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

470
00:43:07,771 --> 00:43:11,876
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

471
00:43:24,347 --> 00:43:25,760
- Is this kimchi?
- Yes!

472
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,603
Should we eat just one piece each?

473
00:43:27,603 --> 00:43:30,121
I don't like kimchi, though.

474
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:32,088
Here, I'll give you the big one.

475
00:43:35,742 --> 00:43:37,699
I'll be right there!

476
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,688
It's really ripe.

477
00:43:39,688 --> 00:43:43,385
I'm coming! Hey, don't go too far!
I'll be there soon!

478
00:43:47,527 --> 00:43:50,728
- Where are you?
- Over here! Over here!

479
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:54,331
I told you we should go together...

480
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:58,746
Oh! There are a lot more clothes! Hey,
it looks like we can stay warm, right?

481
00:43:58,746 --> 00:44:00,228
Yes.

482
00:44:02,496 --> 00:44:04,289
Let's see. Hey.

483
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,739
Hey, take a break.

484
00:44:06,739 --> 00:44:09,086
No, it's better
if we get it all over with.

485
00:44:09,086 --> 00:44:11,702
Hey, take a break.
You don't look so good.

486
00:44:11,702 --> 00:44:13,144
Everyone's waiting.

487
00:44:13,144 --> 00:44:16,384
Hey, tell them to wait! They're just
sitting around sucking their thumbs.

488
00:44:16,384 --> 00:44:19,626
Hey, put this on, okay?

489
00:44:19,626 --> 00:44:23,451
Here. Okay? Wear this. I'll be back...

490
00:44:23,451 --> 00:44:25,230
Rest here, okay?

491
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:27,643
- Let's go together--
- Hey! It's okay.

492
00:44:27,643 --> 00:44:30,163
Stay here. Okay?

493
00:44:34,528 --> 00:44:37,413
It's dangerous though...

494
00:44:40,766 --> 00:44:44,184
Hey! Hey, wait... Wait...

495
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:45,447
- Pardon?
- Wait...

496
00:44:45,447 --> 00:44:47,626
- Another break?
- Yeah, let's rest for a little bit.

497
00:44:47,626 --> 00:44:51,313
Gosh, you only found one suitcase
in two hours. Why are you so tired?

498
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,708
Hey, the currents
are different from Korea.

499
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:56,409
Hey, how did you retrieve five suitcases
in those strong currents?

500
00:44:56,409 --> 00:44:58,865
The currents will only get worse.

501
00:44:58,865 --> 00:45:02,271
It'll be impossible for everyone else,
and it'll get harder for me too.

502
00:45:02,271 --> 00:45:05,402
The undertow could kill us if we
aren't careful when we go into the water.

503
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:09,603
Hey, how do you know all of that?
Were you a diver?

504
00:45:09,603 --> 00:45:13,697
Yes, I was. My mother is a diver.

505
00:45:13,697 --> 00:45:15,315
Oh, really?

506
00:45:16,634 --> 00:45:20,905
Gosh, I'll be the only one to swim from
now on. It's dangerous for everyone else.

507
00:45:22,896 --> 00:45:25,010
Hey, stop working.

508
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:28,315
Why are you the one to step up
every time something happens?

509
00:45:28,315 --> 00:45:31,480
I don't want to be a useless person
on this island too.

510
00:45:32,909 --> 00:45:34,610
That's all.

511
00:45:36,434 --> 00:45:39,030
- Let's go.
- Okay!

512
00:45:41,222 --> 00:45:44,356
- What is all this?
- Can we wear these?

513
00:45:44,356 --> 00:45:47,784
- Oh, this is Joon Oh's!
- This is mine.

514
00:45:47,784 --> 00:45:53,094
Hey, if you can't open it,
just wear some of mine.

515
00:45:53,094 --> 00:45:55,429
None of them will fit me.

516
00:45:55,429 --> 00:45:59,260
Hey, all you have to do is
put one of these over your head...

517
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,394
So Hee, did you find your clothes?

518
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,418
Hey, aren't you... going to change?

519
00:46:09,418 --> 00:46:11,713
After I finish this.

520
00:46:13,255 --> 00:46:15,632
Why is there so much fabric?

521
00:46:15,632 --> 00:46:18,293
It looks like they were stage props.

522
00:46:18,929 --> 00:46:22,248
- Aren't you cold?
- It's still bearable for me.

523
00:46:25,271 --> 00:46:27,831
Yeol! What do you think?

524
00:46:27,831 --> 00:46:30,697
- Won't you be cold?
- Ji Ah, that's not yours!

525
00:46:31,576 --> 00:46:33,614
This...

526
00:46:33,614 --> 00:46:34,884
This is mine.

527
00:46:34,884 --> 00:46:37,306
- What? This is mine!
- No, it's mine.

528
00:46:37,306 --> 00:46:39,239
- Hey, this is for women!
- I said it was mine.

529
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:41,208
You must be crazy!

530
00:46:41,927 --> 00:46:43,789
Wow, I'm speechless.

531
00:46:44,331 --> 00:46:48,309
Geez, this is too small.
It used to fit...

532
00:46:48,309 --> 00:46:51,538
This is small. Hey, for you.

533
00:46:51,538 --> 00:46:54,981
Do you want to wear it? Go ahead.

534
00:47:28,134 --> 00:47:30,737
Wear it while I ask you nicely.

535
00:47:32,036 --> 00:47:34,420
Seo Joon Oh...

536
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:56,949
- Do you want to die?
- I have to give it to Ji Ah. She's sick.

537
00:47:56,949 --> 00:48:00,030
- Ji Ah has clothes.
- She's sick! Wait.

538
00:48:24,222 --> 00:48:26,034
Try it on and see if it fits or not.

539
00:48:26,034 --> 00:48:28,554
Gosh!

540
00:48:48,918 --> 00:48:50,902
Just wear it.

541
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:53,297
Ji Ah, you weren't sleeping?

542
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:57,271
How could I sleep with you two
running back and forth? I woke up.

543
00:48:57,271 --> 00:48:59,327
- I'm sorry.
- Let me sleep.

544
00:48:59,327 --> 00:49:03,400
- But Ji Ah, you're sick. You should--
- I'll get better if you wear this. Go!

545
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,889
- Ji Ah--
- Goodnight.

546
00:49:33,469 --> 00:49:35,380
Joon Oh.

547
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,641
Okay.

548
00:50:09,463 --> 00:50:11,668
Ouch, my shoulders...

549
00:50:12,418 --> 00:50:14,568
Where did everyone go?

550
00:50:14,568 --> 00:50:17,461
- Are you awake?
- Manager Jung, where is--

551
00:50:17,461 --> 00:50:19,934
- We have a crisis.
- Pardon?

552
00:50:21,114 --> 00:50:23,688
Geez, I'm going crazy...

553
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:31,492
What... What... What happened here?

554
00:50:31,492 --> 00:50:33,420
I don't know.
It couldn't have been one of us.

555
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,989
Then who did it? Does that mean
someone else is on this island?

556
00:50:35,989 --> 00:50:39,380
If they were other survivors, they
would have just eaten the food and left.

557
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,987
Then who could it be?

558
00:50:40,987 --> 00:50:43,632
- Joon Oh!
- Yeah!

559
00:50:44,213 --> 00:50:46,367
- Geez, I'm going crazy.
- What?

560
00:50:46,367 --> 00:50:49,144
- Some of the clothes are gone too.
- What?

561
00:50:49,918 --> 00:50:51,748
It's certain now.

562
00:50:52,572 --> 00:50:54,708
There are...

563
00:50:54,708 --> 00:50:57,000
other people on this island.

564
00:51:46,588 --> 00:51:50,326
<i>[Prosecutor Yoon]</i>

565
00:51:59,711 --> 00:52:01,427
I'm sorry.

566
00:52:05,576 --> 00:52:08,596
Bong Hee, let's eat.

567
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:24,115
<i>The number you have dialed
is unavailable--</i>

568
00:52:27,951 --> 00:52:29,239
Sir?

569
00:52:33,422 --> 00:52:35,610
I looked into it...

570
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,322
and the vibe in the special
investigation committee isn't so good.

571
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:40,846
Oh. What do you mean?

572
00:52:40,846 --> 00:52:44,373
Well, I heard they're not contacting
anyone outside of the committee.

573
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:47,947
And they turned off
all the briefing routes.

574
00:52:47,947 --> 00:52:51,932
I think...  they found something strange.

575
00:52:55,217 --> 00:52:56,347
Like what?

576
00:52:56,347 --> 00:52:59,864
A few days ago, Ra Bong Hee
received hypnosis therapy.

577
00:52:59,864 --> 00:53:02,934
- Chairman Jo.
- Later.

578
00:53:02,934 --> 00:53:07,217
- Oh, and make sure no one comes in.
- Oh, yes. I understand.

579
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:11,315
<i>But after Chairman Jo
met with the doctor in charge</i>

580
00:53:11,315 --> 00:53:15,932
<i>they said the vibe wasn't good,
and the look in her eyes changed.</i>

581
00:53:15,932 --> 00:53:19,079
They say she makes
a lot of strange phone calls.

582
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:21,083
Strange phone calls?

583
00:53:21,083 --> 00:53:24,440
A murderer, or a survivor

584
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,393
which one do you like better?

585
00:53:27,393 --> 00:53:29,400
Gosh, seriously.

586
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:35,461
What's wrong? You have seniority
for making such political decisions.

587
00:53:35,461 --> 00:53:40,626
Then, can you tell me at what hospital
Ra Bong Hee received the hypnosis?

588
00:53:40,626 --> 00:53:41,809
Yes.

589
00:53:43,956 --> 00:53:47,425
- We can find out, right?
- Of course, yes.

590
00:53:54,355 --> 00:53:58,827
Just in case something like this
happens again, let's stand guard.

591
00:53:58,827 --> 00:54:02,632
It's too dangerous
for one person do it, so in pairs. Okay?

592
00:54:02,632 --> 00:54:06,431
Sure... Who wants to go first?

593
00:54:06,431 --> 00:54:09,135
- I'll go first.
- Sure, sounds good.

594
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:12,780
Who else...

595
00:54:21,079 --> 00:54:24,579
- Bong Hee, would you like to join me?
- Pardon?

596
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:27,440
Me?

597
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,623
Don't do it!

598
00:54:31,038 --> 00:54:35,530
Sure... I'll do it. Okay...

599
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:39,105
It's settled then. Let's start right now.

600
00:54:39,105 --> 00:54:40,389
Let's go.

601
00:54:43,362 --> 00:54:48,242
Hey, guard the place with a bat.
There could be wild savages out there.

602
00:54:48,242 --> 00:54:50,771
Okay, let's decide
who'll go next tomorrow.

603
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:02,409
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

604
00:55:15,905 --> 00:55:18,221
Cookies...

605
00:55:18,221 --> 00:55:19,755
Two.

606
00:55:42,663 --> 00:55:44,346
Excuse me.

607
00:55:48,163 --> 00:55:52,295
There's something I'm curious about...

608
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:57,981
Why... did you pick me?

609
00:56:01,094 --> 00:56:03,025
I mean...

610
00:56:03,025 --> 00:56:07,576
I don't think I ever upset you in any way

611
00:56:07,576 --> 00:56:09,715
but you picked me all of a sudden.

612
00:56:16,757 --> 00:56:20,079
I don't like seeing you
with Joon Oh all the time.

613
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:21,768
That's why.

614
00:56:24,306 --> 00:56:27,059
Do you hate Seo Joon Oh that much?

615
00:56:44,514 --> 00:56:47,480
It sounded like this is because
of a man named Jae Hyun...

616
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,536
And I don't know
the whole story... I don't...

617
00:56:50,536 --> 00:56:54,405
But you were once like brothers
in the same group...

618
00:56:54,405 --> 00:56:57,233
So I don't know why you have to...

619
00:56:57,233 --> 00:56:59,675
Did you know that Joon Oh killed a man?

620
00:57:01,717 --> 00:57:03,476
<i>I killed Jae Hyun.</i>

621
00:57:05,242 --> 00:57:06,971
I killed him.

622
00:57:07,509 --> 00:57:11,936
But that was just emotional.
He didn't actually kill him.

623
00:57:13,592 --> 00:57:15,791
I guess you don't know
Seo Joon Oh very well yet.

624
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:21,693
You'll understand
after you spend more time with him.

625
00:57:23,177 --> 00:57:25,820
You'll see how Joon Oh kills people.

626
00:57:37,646 --> 00:57:41,121
What was that? Who was it? Huh? Hey!

627
00:57:42,139 --> 00:57:43,653
Come here!

628
00:57:59,157 --> 00:58:00,927
This bastard.

629
00:58:03,007 --> 00:58:05,641
Wait! Seo Joon Oh! What happened?
Did you see him?

630
00:58:05,641 --> 00:58:08,452
I don't know. He disappeared.
Hey, Tae Ho!

631
00:58:12,224 --> 00:58:13,572
Who are you?

632
00:58:16,934 --> 00:58:20,188
Doomed. It was doomed.

633
00:58:20,963 --> 00:58:22,076
What?

634
00:58:22,076 --> 00:58:24,887
The plane you were on was doomed.

635
00:58:27,076 --> 00:58:29,385
Then why did you steal from us?

636
00:58:29,385 --> 00:58:32,201
You could have just shown up.
Why did you go behind our backs?

637
00:58:33,144 --> 00:58:35,650
Tae Ho! Hey, Choi Tae Ho!

638
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:37,177
I'm over here!

639
00:58:37,797 --> 00:58:39,875
Do you want to live?

640
00:58:39,875 --> 00:58:41,889
If you want to live, listen to me.

641
00:58:41,889 --> 00:58:46,195
I don't know about them,
but I can save your life.

642
00:58:46,195 --> 00:58:48,971
I can help you get out of here!

643
00:58:52,228 --> 00:58:54,527
- What the hell are you saying?
- Hey!

644
00:58:57,733 --> 00:58:59,869
Choi Tae Ho!

645
00:59:00,835 --> 00:59:02,853
Hey, Choi Tae Ho!

646
00:59:08,393 --> 00:59:10,672
If you want to live, listen to me.

647
00:59:11,221 --> 00:59:13,451
First, send them away.

648
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:16,639
- Hey, Tae Ho!
- Tae Ho!

649
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:19,286
Did something happen? Hey!

650
00:59:19,286 --> 00:59:21,288
He must be nearby...

651
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:24,257
Hey!

652
00:59:26,592 --> 00:59:28,396
Hey, Choi Tae Ho!

653
00:59:31,532 --> 00:59:33,137
Talk.

654
00:59:33,782 --> 00:59:35,775
How can I survive?

655
00:59:50,181 --> 00:59:54,114
There's a lifeboat.
On the beach near here.

656
00:59:54,114 --> 00:59:55,967
A lifeboat?

657
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:58,494
Yes, a lifeboat.

658
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:02,635
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

659
01:00:02,635 --> 01:00:04,688
But...

660
01:00:04,688 --> 01:00:08,880
It only holds four people.
That's why I was watching you guys.

661
01:00:09,668 --> 01:00:12,456
I was looking for people
to escape this island with.

662
01:00:15,141 --> 01:00:17,409
If we take that boat...

663
01:00:17,445 --> 01:00:19,956
Can we really get out of here?

664
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:23,701
- Is it safe enough?
- Of course.

665
01:00:23,701 --> 01:00:26,661
It was on the plane in case of a crash.

666
01:00:28,471 --> 01:00:29,976
Two people.

667
01:00:30,778 --> 01:00:33,210
If we get two more people...

668
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:35,476
We can get out of here.

669
01:00:35,476 --> 01:00:37,813
If we find two more people...

670
01:00:37,813 --> 01:00:41,615
We don't have to stay in this shithole.
Do you understand?

671
01:00:41,615 --> 01:00:43,909
We can live.

672
01:00:59,193 --> 01:01:00,960
Two people.

673
01:01:02,644 --> 01:01:05,070
You're saying
we need two more people, right?

674
01:01:18,228 --> 01:01:20,869
Who do you have in mind?

675
01:01:22,802 --> 01:01:26,505
People who can be helpful, of course.

676
01:01:26,505 --> 01:01:28,199
Is that Tae Ho?

677
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:31,675
- Hey! You!
- What is this?

678
01:01:31,675 --> 01:01:33,248
Are you okay?

679
01:01:33,248 --> 01:01:35,322
- Where were you?
- Don't worry.

680
01:01:35,322 --> 01:01:37,112
You should have said something
before going!

681
01:01:37,112 --> 01:01:39,510
I'm okay.
I got lost because it's nighttime.

682
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:41,519
It's dangerous.
Let's stay together, okay?

683
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:45,186
How could you just leave like that?
You have to be careful.

684
01:01:45,186 --> 01:01:48,342
Let's go together next time.
It's dangerous.

685
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:07,465
Aren't you cold?
Is the chair comfortable enough?

686
01:02:07,465 --> 01:02:08,931
Yes.

687
01:02:10,418 --> 01:02:14,916
May I ask you what you've been
having a hard time with?

688
01:02:31,626 --> 01:02:33,884
My younger sister died.

689
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:36,715
Not too long ago.

690
01:02:39,182 --> 01:02:42,998
To be more exact, she was murdered.

691
01:02:42,998 --> 01:02:45,606
But when it came my to feelings...

692
01:02:47,494 --> 01:02:51,911
I was sad at first,
but I calmed down over time.

693
01:02:52,461 --> 01:02:54,070
Am I weird?

694
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:59,427
The same goes for physical wounds.
They fade slowly, over time.

695
01:03:00,512 --> 01:03:03,588
I'll ask you again, Doctor.

696
01:03:05,362 --> 01:03:07,556
Am I the weird one?

697
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:14,018
My younger sister's name
was Yoon So Hee.

698
01:03:15,847 --> 01:03:19,125
I'm Prosecutor Yoon Tae Young, of
the western district prosecutor's office.

699
01:03:22,358 --> 01:03:26,150
I've found the right place
for a consultation, right?

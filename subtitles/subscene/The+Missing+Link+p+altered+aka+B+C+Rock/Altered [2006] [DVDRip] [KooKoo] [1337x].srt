You shouldn't be out
pulling some
cockamamie stunt, Duke.

354
00:25:27,112 --> 00:25:29,046
You got a wife and kid.

355
00:25:30,048 --> 00:25:32,175
Pam left me
four years ago.

356
00:25:45,797 --> 00:25:47,526
That ain't shit.

357
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:49,226
I've seen worse.

358
00:25:53,939 --> 00:25:57,705
How many nights have you boys
been out trying to catch
one of those things?

359
00:25:57,776 --> 00:25:59,004
Nights?

360
00:25:59,945 --> 00:26:01,310
Try years.

361
00:26:03,048 --> 00:26:04,948
Probably seven by now.

362
00:26:06,184 --> 00:26:07,173
Fuck!

363
00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:10,013
Damn, Duke.
That's some shit.

364
00:26:10,088 --> 00:26:13,023
It was either that
or just go out drinking.

365
00:26:15,794 --> 00:26:18,729
Well, there was
some drinking
out there, too.

366
00:26:19,698 --> 00:26:23,691
Actually, after a while,
it was pretty much
all about the drinking.

367
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:33,700
Got easier when Otis
started hanging out.

368
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:35,804
We could watch
in shifts.

369
00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:38,247
Then numbnuts
got out of prison.

370
00:26:39,851 --> 00:26:42,115
Fucking bear traps
was his idea.

371
00:26:42,187 --> 00:26:44,519
Yeah, I could have
guessed that.

372
00:26:45,524 --> 00:26:49,654
Going out to Nixon's farm
was just our way of coping.

373
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,534
You been coping, Wyatt?

374
00:27:00,806 --> 00:27:02,865
What do you think, Duke?

375
00:27:04,209 --> 00:27:07,076
Shit! Motherfucker!

00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,148

378
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:21,049
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
I'm supposed to

379
00:27:24,229 --> 00:27:28,256
put this duct tape
over your mouth
because of the...

380
00:27:30,969 --> 00:27:33,369
I thought... Wyatt thought
it'd be better.

381
00:27:33,438 --> 00:27:35,804
Have you told Wyatt
to go fuck himself?

(SNlFFLES)

383
00:27:42,948 --> 00:27:44,973
We all know how it feels.

384

Having one of those things
inside you like that

385
00:27:52,958 --> 00:27:54,585
controlling you.

386
00:27:56,395 --> 00:27:58,863
It's the worst
fucking thing ever.

387
00:28:00,198 --> 00:28:01,665
It's hell.

388
00:28:05,337 --> 00:28:07,464
It's worse when it's longer.

389
00:28:11,076 --> 00:28:13,203
They did it to us for days.

390
00:28:16,415 --> 00:28:20,249
Well, let's hold off
on the tape for now,
'cause...

391
00:28:28,126 --> 00:28:29,787
God damn it.

392
00:28:31,563 --> 00:28:33,087
What the fuck?

393
00:28:36,134 --> 00:28:37,294
God damn it.

394
00:28:43,575 --> 00:28:46,703
Oh.
Oh, fuck me.

395
00:28:46,945 --> 00:28:49,573
God damn it.
What the fuck?

What the fuck?

397

God damn it.

Oh, fuck!

Oh, God damn.

400
00:29:02,227 --> 00:29:03,353
Oh, fuck.

401
00:29:04,062 --> 00:29:05,393
Please, no.

402
00:29:06,465 --> 00:29:08,558
Please.
What the fuck?

Come on, man.
I gotta drop a deuce.

Oh!

412
00:29:30,622 --> 00:29:31,884
Come on,
quit playing.

Wyatt, is this why
you gave me so much shit
when I wanted to move in?

416
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:21,031
Yeah.

417
00:30:24,142 --> 00:30:25,507
Good call.

418
00:30:32,117 --> 00:30:33,311
Honey,

419
00:30:36,221 --> 00:30:39,452
I never wanted to
get you mixed up
in all of this.

420
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:42,786
You understand that,
right?

421
00:30:46,064 --> 00:30:47,691
You're gonna have to
give me
a little bit more time

422
00:30:47,766 --> 00:30:49,825
on the whole
understanding part.

of my way! I'm not
fucking around here!

DUKE: Come on, Cody.
Calm down, man.

425
00:31:24,302 --> 00:31:26,463
This was your
fucking plan.

426
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:29,200
No, my plan
was to catch it.

427
00:31:29,274 --> 00:31:31,765
And now what?
You want out?

428

Oh, you sad
fucking sack.

429

But there's more
at stake now than just us.

430

Damned right.
They killed my brother.

00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:44,615
Now, get the fuck out
of my way, Duke.

432

put that thing down.

You're not calling
the fucking shots, Wyatt.

Now I'm not
playing around here.

I've got business
with this thing.

taking care of it

I'm screwing around?

why don't you
turn off the torch

don't touch him.

hit him that hard.

let him rot away

ever does.

isn't it?

That's what
killed Timmy.

It'll start eating him...
inside and out.

He'll watch his flesh
peel away layer by layer.

488

It'll hurt so bad,
it'll make him insane.

00:34:46,604 --> 00:34:49,437
A few hours from now,
he'll be begging us
to put a bullet in his head

would bring it to you.

would they want with me?

fucking with you yet.

why you were
up there the longest

with that clicker shit
inside you?

think about that.

you started giving it
some thought.

Hello, Sergeant. Hi, Tony

50
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,230

Looks like you struck it rich

52
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,238
How many acres you got?

53
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,715
A hundred and seventy

54
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,236
Wow, that압 a lot, huh?

55
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,230
Well, it압 Martha압 father. Were

He압 a writer, Harry Wayne
He writes mostly westerns

58
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,234
Oh yeah, l았e read a dozen of his
books. Josephson had a whole stack

00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,229
He works at night most of the time
Sleeps all day

60
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,236

61
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,718

63
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,237

64
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,630

Theyre the same choppers we used

68
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,235
...near the army again. But the
work was there and l앐 doing it

69
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,238

70
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,238

71
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,236

72
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,711
Hal!

73
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,238

74
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,714
Tired?

75
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,235
We았e been driving all night

76
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,630
You want a bed?

77
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,756
No

78
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,239
lf l앇 just lay down on that
sofa over there for a while

79
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,233
l앏l get you a blanket

80
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:44,229

Yeah. lt압 her old man압

86
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,834

87
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,831
lt압 a pond

88
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,230
Who압 dog is that?

89
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,834
That압 the neighbours

90
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,238
You got chickens, huh?

91
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,229
My uncle used to keep fighting
roosters in Puerto Rico. Bantams

92
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,829
This one압 too heavy to be a fighter

93
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,230
But he압 a lover

94
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,238
Shut up, Mac! Shut up!

95
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,232
Does he bites?

96
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,235
Harry wouldn앖 have a dog that
didn앖 bite, but he won앖 bother us

97
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:39,238
Who the hell압 that with him?

98
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,836
Just a friend from the army
There압 another one up here

99
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:58,230
Come on! You can walk on it
This ice is a foot thick

100
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:06,239
l thought you drained the water
and put a cover in the winter

101
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,234
No. ln the spring is drained,
painted and filled up again

102
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,834
Sounds like a lot of work

103
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,230
There압 a company...does it all

104
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,233
Everything압 taking care of, huh?

105
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,231
Yeah

106
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,234
We couldn앖 visit you last summer
We앇 have been sunbathing

107
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,233
But we were busy, you know

108
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,239
They threw the confessions out. Like
you read in the papers, ''Failed...

109
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,234
...to inform the defendant
of his rights

110
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,233
What about Reilly?

111
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,234
He압 still in
He didn앖 confess, see?

112
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,239
Boy, he is pissed off!

113
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,829
l mean, l앐 glad to see you
but l want... What?

114
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,238
l don앖 think youre glad to see us

115
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,709
What did you come here for?

116
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,236
l don앖 even know whose idea it was
We were both at Leavenworth

117
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,234
They gave us all our back pay,
for the whole years. We decided...

118
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,234
...why wait for transportation,
so we got the car

119
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,235
Jesus, what a bum! We broke down
outside Philadelphia last night

120
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,235
We had to wait all night in a garage
while a guy put a new head gasket

121
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,632
And we... started drinking
and talking about you

122
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,235
How did you know where l lived?

123
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,234
Sarge압 lawyer had your address,
in case you had to testify

124
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,233
l told it all the first time

125
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,233
Yeah, l know

126
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,840
Anyway, here we are

127
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,230
But why?

128
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,238
l just wanted to tell you...

129
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,231
What?

130
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,235
That l forgive you
Anyway, no hard feelings

131
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,231
No

132
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:43,236
We figured you must be worried,
thinking about what we might do

133
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,714
Yeah

134
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,232
So l wanted you to know that
as far as l앐 concerned...

135
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,834
...bygoes are bygoes

136
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,639
As far as youre concerned?

137
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,836
Yeah

138
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,238
Ssssss...Be quiet

139
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,238
He gets a little fussy sometimes

140
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,831
lt압 all right
l can앖 sleep anyway

141
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,236
Well, well. How is my baby?

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,840
Nothing

145
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,238
Do you want a paper to read?

146
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,236
No

147
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,236
Hey, you got a coke?

148
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,231
Sure

149
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,238
Where are the guys?

There you go

158
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,635
Oh, you scared me!

159
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,236
You were in Vietnam with Bill?

160
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,715
Yes, madam

161
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,235
What압 it like?

162
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,231
Do you ever watch television?

163
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,231
Sometimes

164
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,233
lt압 just like it압 on television

165
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,630
Did you like it?

166
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,234
Like it? Nobody likes it

167
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,234
l meant the coutryside

168
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,230

169
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,830
Never talks to me about Vietnam
He was involved with some trial

He was a sergeant, too,

176
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,832
We never took any prisoners
in Guadalcanal. There wasn앖 time

177
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,231
We were outnumbered for
months. You don앖 know about that

178
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,234
You didn앖 even dare to leak into
the bushes. One앇 wait for you

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,228
And we didn앖 have the weapons

...rifles, bayonets...any way
you got one of them was all right

181
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,238
How is your beer, Bill?

182
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,836
Fine

183
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,231
Maybe we need a little more wood

184
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,239
Even later, when we had ice cream
and movies, they used to come...

185
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,234
...and sit and watch. Bastards!
l admired them though. l don앖...

186
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,837
...think these North Vietnamese have
the guts the Japs did

187
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,033
But they keep on fighting

188
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,233
There, you don앖 know who압 your
friend. No sides but your own

189
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,234
So it압 easier to shoot everybody

190
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,230
Bill doesn앖 believe in fighting
You앇 got a job in a hospital,...

191
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,233
...patching a brave guys

192
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,831
l got shot at. By an old man...
civilian. He was scared to death

193
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,840
Did you shoot back?

194
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,639
Sure...over his head

195
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,238
You might have hurt him

196
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,840
What압 that?

197
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,238
God damn it, look at him!

198
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,238
Jesus Christ

199
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,238
Damn, look at that poor...

200
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,838
Spread some newspapers by the fire

201
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,239
Get some alcohol and some cotton

202
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,834
There he is

203
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,829
l told that son of a bitch
to keep his dog off my property

204
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,231
He can앖 keep him tied up all
the time! l couldn앖 find alcohol

205
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,233
Use whisky, for Christ압 sake

206
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,233
lt압 chewed almost all
the way through!

207
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,234
A three-legged dog. What
the hell l앐 going to do with him?

208
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,032
l told him next time the dog came
on my place l앇 kill him

209
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,236
Kill his dog, he means

210
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,834
You can앖 hit him with a pistol

211
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,228
l can damn well...try

212
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,834
You need a rifle

213
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,232
l았e got a shotgun, but at this
range it앇 just tickle him

214
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,631
We got a rifle in the car

215
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,832
Six point five millimeter

216
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,639
Yeah, it압 Swedish

217
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,238
The Great Dane again?

218
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,235
What are they gonna do?

219
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,233
ls your father

220
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,238
Harry, you can앖 just shoot
the man압 dog

221
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,238
Mac압 the one who picks the fights

222
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,829
Yeah, he압 tough

223
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,840
Let압 go

224
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,235
You need something to rest it on

225
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,234
Not at this range
l don앖 even really need the scope

226
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,835
Can앖 you stop them?

227
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,232
Legally he압 within his rights. That
dog attacked you once, remember?

228
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,836
Why the hell didn앖 you
shoot it then?

229
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,236
Perfect

230
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,834
Tony don앖 miss!

231
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,838
Nice looking dog

232
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,833
Do you want to bury him?

233
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,637
Bury him! l앐 gonna dump right
at that son of a bitch압 door...

234
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,234
...and let him do something about it

235
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,238
Those are the men, aren앖 they?

236
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,840
What men?

237
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,840
You았e to tell me about it now

238
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,239
We were just supposed
to look for supplies

239
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,229
By the third day we hadn앖
found anything and Nickerson began

240
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:48,236
to get edgy. We get to this village
lt was marked friendly on the map

241
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,230
But Nickerson got everybody out
and search the huts for arms

242
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:58,838
We lined them while he
and Tony looked the place over

243
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:04,239
They thought we gonna shoot them
l think Nickerson almost did

244
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:09,231
He was so angry about
not finding anything

245
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,237
Well, in the last hut
a girl was hiding

246
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,229
Nickerson pretended
she was a Viet Cong. Then he told...

247
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,231
...one of the old men in the village
that we took her as a hostage

248
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,718
What did she look like?

249
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,239
She was young, 15 or 16. Pretty
l guess that압 why she was hiding

250
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,230
That압 what her mother said
at the courtmartial

251
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,829
A couple of miles up the road...

252
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,834
Nickerson took her into the tall grass

253
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,238
The sound she made was...

254
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,229
...well, after a while
it was like...

255
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,229
...like Mac down there
lt was just...whining

256
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,237
And then Reilly went next
Josephson... Tony

257
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:27,229
And then they were waiting for me
to do it. l couldn앖 move

258
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,829
lt didn앖 take any thought of bravery
l just couldn앖 walk

259
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,716
Nickerson looked at me

260
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,239
For a long time, you know the
way he does...looks at you

261
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,829
He had a rifle in his hand

262
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:57,229
He handed it to Josephson, jerk
his thumb toward the grass and...

263
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,238
And you turned them in

264
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,238
When we got back to camp

265
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,238
lt was the bravest thing you앇 do

266
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,831
l should have stopped them. What압
the point of punish them afterward?

267
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,231
Criminals have to be punished

268
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,234
The Viet Cong do the same thing
Everybody does, every day...

269
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,837
Why blame these guys?
They were my friends, my buddies!

270
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,238
Let압 go home, boys

271
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,238
Sound off! One, two, sound off!

272
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,709
...three, four...

273
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:22,237
Take it on down! One, two, three...!

274
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,239
What did they come here for?
lt wasn앖 because of the scenery

275
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,233
Tony said thet he wanted
to tell me that...

276
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,231
What?

277
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,233
That there were no hard
feelings on his side

278
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,630
Shit!

279
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,239
l knew the Jerries were
in there. l take a granade...

280
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:05,235
...l pull the pin.
Got up, open the door...

281
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,836
...Oh, Officer

282
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,840
Come on in

283
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,236
Call the police

284
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:22,235
What would l say, l앐 afraid of
these guys? Yes! You know, l am

285
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,234
l thought about it every
day since it happened

286
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,234
But l can앖 do it to them again
They don앖 even know why they came

287
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,238
All right! Don앖 call the police

288
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,236
Here we go! Come on!
Pass it to me!

289
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,229
lf they bust up your meeting, it압
pigs. lf you need them, it압 police

290
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,233
Yes, that압 funny, Bill

291
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,239
Yes. Wait a minute
The football game is on

292
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,233
Harry wants to watch it on your set

293
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,234
Oh, Christ! l don앖 give a...

294
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,233
Sure, Harry. That압 fine

295
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,239
Hey, kid, you got the
set warmed up yet?

296
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,238
l didn앖 know it was on yet

297
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,228
Hell yes! Come on
Were gonna miss the kick-off

298
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,237
Hey, Bill...ayyyy!

299
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,235
See you in a little while

300
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,233
Bill, how do you adjust this thing?

301
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,231
Later

302
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,229
lt압 crowed. The Tigers
and the Blue Panthers are...

303
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,837
...in the playground. The match
will be interesting...

304
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,232
...cose both teams are equaled
at general classification

305
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,234
No player in the entitle
alignment is been missed

306
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,233
There will be tension
during the match

307
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,238
Thanks, kid. Want a drink now?

308
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,231
Yeah

309
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,238
Here it comes. Just in time

310
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:46,229
He dropped it. Atta boy!
Come on, baby!

311
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,631
Don앖 let him...for pete sakes!

312
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,237
Come on. Get him!

313
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:04,831
Hey kid, why don앖 you bring us
some ice and glasses in here...

314
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,232
...so we don앖 keep running
back and forth?

315
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,239
Look out! Look out!

316
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,238
Go, go, go!

317
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,238
Twenty-five yards!

318
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,230
Now let압 go!

319
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,236
There you go, kid

320
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,834
Theyre gonna beat them, right?

321
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:41,228
Come on now. Let압 not have
another funeral like last week,...

322
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,039
...huh, Mike?

323
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,239
The Blue Panthers try to
brake Robins압 stroke

324
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,839
Football is a great game. Elemental

325
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,239
Because it압 a conflict
That압 what life is about

326
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,233
lsn앖 it?

327
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,835
lf you make it

328
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,239
Always. Life against death
Like in Vietnam

329
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,238
We just see one corner of it...
...above the surface

330
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,234
Youre mixing your metaphors Harry

331
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,639
Look at the football field
Each team압 got one color jersey

332
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,237
That압 easy to see. But the world
is set up the same way

333
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,234
The communists on one side,
and us on the other

334
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:47,228
lf you앇 face that,
look at Vietnam in the context...

335
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,233
...and you앇 understand it

336
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,238
Right now Europe is stabilized

337
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,229
Power is shifting in Asia
Vietnam is the fulcrum

338
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,238
That압 what they tell us

339
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,238
You앇 better believed it, soldier

340
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,234
Looks like a duel between
the two players who...

341
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,234
...we are talking about
Tiger압 new man압 caught...

342
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,235
...the ball. A good opportunity
to show his game

343
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,239
How압 your beer holding
out there...Hal?

344
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,239
You never did like it
very much, did you?

345
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,238
Did you?

346
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,717
What the hell am l gonna do
with a three-legged kid, huh?

347
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,035
Come on!

348
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:58,232
Why he was out of bounds!
Let압 see the play-back!

349
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,239
Pardon. You know...l watch
football, l notice one thing

350
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,709
What압 that?

351
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:09,839
There aren앖 any Puerto Rican guys
playing. Did you notice that?

352
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,036
Yeah, why is that?

353
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,193
l don앖 know. They았e got plenty
of Puerto Rican baseball players

354
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,233
Yeah, stars. But not football

355
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,715
Theyre too small to play football

356
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,236
They don앖 eat the right foods
They eat too many chili peppers

357
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,233
lt압 a racial difference

358
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,238
The first part is ended

359
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:40,831
He got back in,
finds a lot of daylight

360
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,239
Racial difference. lsn앖 that illegal?

361
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,234
They can앖 play cose theyre too
small, not cose theyre Puerto Ricans

362
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,234
Some people are naturally smaller
than others. Like Orientals

363
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,231
l앐 not goddam slopehead!

364
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,233
Just an example, Christ sake!

365
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,239
When l was in college, that압
what it was all about. Football

366
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:29,238
Everybody wanted to play football

367
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,239
Even the guys that spend most
of their time in the library,...

368
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,234
...secretly wanted to play
football. You know why?

369
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,231
Why?

370
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,837
Football players got more pussy

371
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,039
Not that anyone got a lot
but the football players got more

372
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:54,234
A guy your size could play college
football if he was strong

373
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,239
The pressure the Blue Panthers
did during the second...

374
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,235
...time has decided
the final result of the game

375
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,229
Now the kids give it away to
each other. They don앖 ask for it...

376
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,234
nicely. There압 no challenge to it
So, who the hell wants...

377
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,234
...to play football? l asked
once some of Martha압 friends...

378
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,235
...if they wanted to watch a game,
they looked at me as if l앐 a freak

379
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,235
Where the hell is Bill?

380
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,838
He went upstairs

381
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,239
l don앖 know

382
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,636
Why shouldn앖 they act the way
they do if they get away with it

383
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,238
Nobody cares anymore

384
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,233
She압 a cute looking girl

385
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,635
Martha?

386
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,238
They aren앖 married, huh?

387
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,236
No

388
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,839
Get him, you stupid son of a bitch!

389
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,236
The baby압 nice
He smiles all the time

390
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,238
Broke his arm

391
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,840
No, he압 all right

392
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,032
Look at it. lt압 hanging there

393
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,229
Yeah, the baby is all right
l always wanted a grandson

394
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,238
l don앖 even know what this kid is

395
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:47,229
ls he my grandson? ls that
what l should say to people?

396
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,840
l don앖 know

397
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,238
Ya hemos visto todo
lo que hab眼 que ver

398
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,239
You know...he looks
a lot older. Bill

399
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,239
His hair is getting a little gray
Do you remember how he...

400
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,234
...looked when he first
got over? Like a little kid

401
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,238
Goddamn!

402
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,239
l hope dinner압 ready soon
because l got to get to the city

403
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,834
What압 your hurry, Tony?

404
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,230
l got to see about getting a job

405
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,231
Tomorrow is Sunday

406
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,834
There압 a guy l can talk to

407
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,037
Yeah, he앏l really give a job
to an old war hero like you

408
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,159
l wish you guys would stick around
a couple of days. lt압 great...

409
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,234
...to have someone to talk to
l bet you앇 like to use that...

410
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,712
...rifle again. There압 a moon
tonight and there압 a cop l know

411
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,839
He압 gonna be coon hunting
back in my woods. We could...

412
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,232
...all go there
Hell, they았e got two bedrooms...

413
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,234
...upstairs they don앖 use!
Right, Bill?

414
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,238
Yeah, theyre empty

415
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,839
Christ, what a weirdo! See that

416
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,231
l shot that bear and now look at it

417
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,238
Martha! What time is dinner?

418
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,238
As soon as we get the table set

419
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,231
What압 the matter?

420
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,231
Nothing

421
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,834
Nothing압 ever the matter

422
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,239
Harry wants them to stay a couple
of days. l don앖 think they앏l stay

423
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,835
Bill, this is our house and...

424
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:05,230
The hell it is. lt압 Harry압!

425
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,234
lt압 as mine as Harry압. Because
it압 mine, it압 yours. lf you don앖

426
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:12,233
...want them to stay,
tell them to get out now!

427
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:25,229
He was in some trouble
in Vietnam. Do you know about this?

428
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:29,238
We were it

429
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,238
Yeah? What happened?

430
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,229
l was leading a patrol
We found a woman, a Viet Cong

431
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:53,230
Had to shoot her, couldn앖 take
her with us and Bill turned us in

432
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,233
He turned you in for that?

433
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,239
Well, we had a little fun with her
first. That압 what made him mad

434
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,235
He didn앖 even touch her

435
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,830
l always thought he was half queer

436
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,840
There압 salad in the ice-box

437
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,238
l앐 surprised
you didn앖 slit his throat

438
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,234
l thought about it a lot
when l was in the stockade

439
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:36,239
But then, what압 it gonna get me?

440
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:49,238
Dinner is on the table!

441
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,836
Oh

442
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,235
Do you want to carve, Harry?

443
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,630
Sure

444
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,714
Mike

445
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,238
How do you like it, Mike?

446
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,632
Rare. Still moving,
if you got it

447
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,235
Tony, how about you?

448
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,709
A little rare

449
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,235
He likes it burnt

450
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,238
We forgot the water

451
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,840
Oh! Son of a bitch!

452
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,230
Will you let me look at it?

453
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,231
l hardly felt it

454
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,834
Come on, let me wash it

455
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,636
Hold still! You need some stitches

456
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,234
No...it압 nothing...

457
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:34,239
Harry, please don앖 drink anymore
l think you았e had enough

458
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,840
Harry...

459
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,238
That Mike압 quite a guy, isn앖 he?

460
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,229
Did he tell you what
Bill did to them?

461
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,233
What Bill did to them?

462
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,235
You all right, Harry?

463
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,233
lt압 just a scratch

464
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,238
l remember one time...

465
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:28,229
...a Filipino captain was
trying to make one of them talk

466
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,239
He took him out in a boat and...

467
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,239
...he cut off his hands. One by one

468
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,238
And he dropped them into the water

469
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,630
Harry, be quiet

470
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,234
And then... his arms

471
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,235
And he watched...

472
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,239
...the sarks eat them

473
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,714
Harry...

474
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,236
Martha...

475
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,230
l asked these boys
to stay a couple of days

476
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,239
Thanks, Mr. Wayne
but l really got ot get back

477
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,034
l think...there might be
a book in them. Yeah

478
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,840
Harry, they don앖 want to stay

479
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,230
Well...

480
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,237
We앏l talk more about it
tomorrow afternoon

481
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:16,239
l have a work to do
in the morning

482
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,238
Well...where압 my cap?

483
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:34,635
Thanks

484
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,238

485
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:51,238
Thank you very much

486
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,238
Harry...have you got your glasses?

487
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,238
Do you think he앏l make it?
He might bleed to death

488
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,834
l앏l check on him later

489
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,235
He압 a very interesting guy

490
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,709
Do you think so?

491
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:30,235
Yeah. He압 been through it

492
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:33,836
My mother couldn앖 stand him
Neither his other two wives

493
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,834
Well hell, l wouldn앖 want
to be married to him either

494
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,238
l았e had to get Hal압 dinner

495
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,238
We better be going

496
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,234
Let me make you some coffe before
you go, if youre going to drive

497
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:11,233
lt앏l just take a few minutes
Please, sit down

498
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,238
Bet it압 nice around here
in the summer

499
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,834
Yeah

500
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,235
Great chow

501
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,233
Martha is a great cook

502
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,238
Dammit, Hal, you know
you liked creamed corn!

503
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,236
Come on, Hal!

504
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,234
Miss, youre a pretty woman to get
angry. Wait till he압 hungry

505
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,228
A lot you know about it, don앖 you?
He has to eat his vegetables

506
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:46,239
Yeah. So he can grow up big
to be a football player

507
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,239
Bed for you. Hal has
decided he wants to go to bed

508
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,834
Say goodnight to everybody

509
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,230
Goodnight, Hal

510
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,840
Goodnight, bambino

511
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:35,238
Want to say goodnight to Hal?

512
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,238
Goodnight, Hal

513
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,235
What kind of job
are you looking for?

514
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,834
Who the hell knows!

515
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,037
You used to be interested in cars

516
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,237
Yeah. l think l앏l get myself
a job in a garage

517
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:07,238
To get the experience

518
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,239
The most important tool in any
garage is the stem cleaner. l know

519
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,234
...this guy named Feldman
He has a garage near the river

520
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,239
A guy comes in with his car
He doesn앖 know a thing about cars

521
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,831
But comes over and starts
saying, ''that transmission is...

522
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:45,232
...about to fall out''. He says,
Bill, ''and it압 a good thing...

523
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:50,838
...you brought it now''. Everybody
knows about the transmission

524
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,232
You know what l mean? You
tell a guy his valve lifters are...

525
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:00,235
...shot, he gets worried
But the transmission, you았e that

526
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,837
The guy comes back the next day
and Feldman shows him a...

527
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,232
...shiny clean transmission. lt압
the same! He used the steam cleaner

528
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:13,234
You know what l mean?
Gracias. Now...

529
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:18,235
Rebuilt transmission, right?
A 180 dollars, maybe even more

530
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:24,239
Hal, l simply can앖 stand another
night of this! What압 the matter?

531
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,238
Come on

532
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,714
Goodnight

533
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,239
With all that back pay,
maybe Feldman앇 let me buy...

534
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,233
...a piece of his place, huh?

535
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,829
Hell, l don앖 even know
if his garage is still there

536
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:12,239
Tony does all the driving. Will your
father mind if l았e a little?

537
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,234
He앏l think he drank the whole
thing himself when he wakes up

538
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,709
He압 really a famous writer?

539
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,839
He writes a lot of books and
a lot of people buy them. lt압...

540
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,198
...like a compulsion. When he gets
going, he stays all night writing

541
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,238
Theyre good books?

542
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:35,238
A long time ago,
they used to be

543
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:40,239
The first two he wrote
were really good serious books

544
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:47,229
But now he압 full of anger and
self-disgust. The books are empty

545
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:54,229
Theyre good stories, full of
dramatic events and...

546
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:58,234
...flashy characters. Easy to
read. l enjoy reading them, but...

547
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,233
...they are meaningless

548
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,239
l liked what he said about
being a book in Tony and me

549
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:38,238
Bill told me what you did

550
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,713
ls it true?

551
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,716
Sure, whatever he said

552
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:01,840
What made you do it?

553
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,833
Everybody was doing it
Why pick on me?

554
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,036
Why pick on that girl?

555
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,158
She was a Viet Cong
She was hiding from us

556
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,238
You proved she had
a damn good reason to hide

557
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:17,234
What do you think a Viet Cong
looks like...wear a uniform?

558
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,233
They don앖 look different
than anybody else over there

559
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:24,234
Listen, your husband cost me
two damn good years over there

560
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,233
He didn앖 cost you a thing
and you know it!

561
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:31,234
l forgot he압 not your husband
What kind of arrangement is that?

562
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:35,234
My living with Bill has nothing to
do with morality! Youre sick!

563
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:38,280
l see, you can judge me,
but l can앖 judge you

564
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:41,829
What hurts someone else is immoral
That압 the only standard you can have

565
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,231
And your father? lt tears his guts out
the way youre living

566
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:49,234
That압 his problem. lt압 different
from stick someone with a bayonet

567
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,630
ls that what Bill told you?

568
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:54,837
Sorry, all you did was shoot her!

569
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,230
We couldn앖 take any prisoners
on patrol. That was orders

570
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,233
The solution to the problem
Nothing can justify what you did!

571
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:04,234
l don앖 have to justify it
The Army already has

572
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,234
Why do you think l앐 here?
We were heroes to our boys

573
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,231
And Bill?

574
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,234
He got shipped out of combat area
lt was good cose you can get shot

575
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,233
Because he reported a crime

576
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,839
You got to do things in war that
you get locked up for in peacetime

577
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,232
Do you think l앐 some hoodlum?
l was an honor student in...

578
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,234
...high school. And l was a good
soldier, more than he was

579
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,709
l앐 glad

580
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,238
Oh, you got it safe here

581
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:47,717
You don앖 know until you
have been there, been shot at

582
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:54,239
What would you do,
lie back and take it?

583
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:04,239
Until you았e gone
through a village...

584
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,233
...handing out candy
bars to the kids

585
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:12,237
And then you see your best
buddie압 legs blowed off by a mine

586
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:17,235
...because the people you
gave the candy bars to,...

587
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:21,234
...forgot to tell you
Charlie was in town

588
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:32,840
That happened?

589
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,840
lt happened!

590
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,239
Youre right. l haven앖 been
there and l can앖 imagine it

591
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:55,229
Man....l couldn앖 wait to get
back to the folks

592
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,236
The first thing you notice in the
city is people. The way they walk,

593
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,233
especially if theyre important

594
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:10,231
The whole city is in a state
of warfare. Just like over there

595
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,239
Did you ever march in one of
these peace parades? Carry a sign?

596
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,834
Why?

597
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:39,229
l don앖 know. You liked somebody
who앇 march in a peace parade

598
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:59,718
l used to wonder over there what
kind of people went to those things

599
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:17,239
l thought they were long-haired
freaks with clothes like lndians

600
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:38,831
Bill asked me to marry
him once. Before the baby was born

601
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,230
He was gonna do me a big favor

602
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,716
Youre a real old
nut-cutter, aren앖 you?

603
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,235
Dance?

604
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:43,238
My uncle압 got a restaurant

605
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:45,789
Leave it in the sink

606
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,232
l could work there for a while
lt압 a big responsability,...

607
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,836
...having money to invest
What압 that?

608
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,230
Coon hunter

609
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,789
Coon hunters, huh?

610
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,633
Yeah, give it time, Tony

611
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,839
Hey, Sarge!
Let압 get the hell out here!

612
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,035
What압 going on?

613
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,829
That압 enough. l said that압 enough!

614
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:58,238
You better go now

615
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,840
Come on!

616
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:23,238
You really want to go?

617
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:39,239
Go away! Stop it!

618
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:49,238
Come on

619
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,238
What압 the matter with you?

620
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,238
Stop it!

621
01:14:21,280 --> 01:14:23,840
Look out, Billy!

622
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:03,829
Shoot him! You았e got a gun,
haven앖 you? Shoot him!

623
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,030
Go on!

624
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:45,238
You앏l be okay, Bill

625
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:40,239
Lady, youre nuts
You think you can change...

626
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:43,233
...the rules in the middle?

627
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:00,633
Well?

628
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:12,832
Are you all right?

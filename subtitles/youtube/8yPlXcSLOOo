boy that Joe Estevez is one compelling
performer he&#39;s really lighting up the

285
00:19:05 --> 00:19:09
screen i tell you he could really show
his brother Martin Sheen a thing or two

286
00:19:09 --> 00:19:09
about acting

287
00:19:09 --> 00:19:13

you want in your werewolf movie

I sure Mike but uh why don&#39;t you go
first

291
00:19:20 --> 00:19:24
oh sure okay well first off i think i
would have Burt Reynolds brother tim

292
00:19:24 --> 00:19:25
reynolds huh

293
00:19:25 --> 00:19:29
you know that didn&#39;t work out i would i
would go for Emilio clogged measure and

294
00:19:29 --> 00:19:33
you know maybe as a role as a bike or
something like that I would go for down

295
00:19:33 --> 00:19:37
not tougher brother spike not gonna
serve all now

296
00:19:37 --> 00:19:41

more freestyle set of rules and you Mike

297
00:19:41 --> 00:19:41
to it

298
00:19:41 --> 00:19:45

299
00:19:45 --> 00:19:45
senator Orrin

300
00:19:45 --> 00:19:49

00:19:49 --> 00:19:53
lower pastures brother Greg my last no
longer in this mortal coil

302
00:19:53 --> 00:19:56

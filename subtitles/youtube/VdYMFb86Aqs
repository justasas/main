Task course you would no leads at all to
these guys

13
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
not enough to take the bank council it&#39;s
our understanding that the FBI prior to

14
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
the bombing had confiscated terrorist
training films from the very same people

15
00:00:53 --> 00:00:59

the construction of the bomb what you&#39;re

26
00:01:45 --> 00:01:48
thinking about these people far as we
knew they were devout followers of a

27
00:01:48 --> 00:01:52
blind Sheikh his mosque was a shabby
store where you aware of the influence

28

00:01:58 --> 00:01:58
illegal

31
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01

hand cannot keep my friend told him when
the right time comes he will meet the

235
00:17:32 --> 00:17:36
underground people but first we must
have a fact we&#39;re from shaping our share

236
00:17:36 --> 00:17:41
of doing this she knows what he needs to
know what we need to know is that the

237
00:17:41 --> 00:17:46
other coordinates with the law we know
Sarah was dangerous but it was locked up

238
00:17:46 --> 00:17:50
our informant was bringing is nothing
and the others didn&#39;t seem to have the

239
00:17:50 --> 00:17:54
material of the knowledge to use them
but they did have was religious fervor

240
00:17:54 --> 00:17:59
and that is a very very powerful thing
they are waiting for religious opinions

241
00:17:59 --> 00:18:04
from the shake then they want me to make
12 pipe bombs for the judge the Jewish

242
00:18:04 --> 00:18:08
Assemblyman people all over New York
City because America is the puppet

243
00:18:08 --> 00:18:12
master of all the enemies of god they
see this is your proof

244
00:18:12 --> 00:18:15
no Sarah told him where to get it the
yellow pages kinda told him where to get

245
00:18:15 --> 00:18:16
it okay

246
00:18:16 --> 00:18:19
telling you everything they say and what
are you telling your friends and

247
00:18:19 --> 00:18:24
Egyptian intelligence everything we say
they called me I told Nancy I told him

248
00:18:24 --> 00:18:29
with nancy said that was okay to do
right mr. cement for this operation to

249
00:18:29 --> 00:18:33
continue for the FBI to believe anything
you tell us you&#39;re going to have to wear

250
00:18:33 --> 00:18:33
a wire

251
00:18:33 --> 00:18:38
I know how that works if i make tapes i
have to testify where I made them how i

252
00:18:38 --> 00:18:42
made them is these people are dangerous
to meet my family

253
00:18:42 --> 00:18:45
no tapes no more money that&#39;s the policy
here

254
00:18:45 --> 00:18:51
one condition you listen to the tape so
that you can believe what I&#39;m telling

255
00:18:51 --> 00:18:53
you when you get back to me so i can
destroy it

256
00:18:53 --> 00:18:58
give you back the tape why don&#39;t I give
you all our files while I met about my

257
00:18:58 --> 00:19:02
time you like my tie and I really don&#39;t
think mr. Salim won&#39;t wear a wire and

258
00:19:02 --> 00:19:06
let us keep our own fucking tapes then
you can be polygraphed lie detective or

259
00:19:06 --> 00:19:09
he can kiss his five hundred dollars a
week goodbye and perilous stories

260
00:19:09 --> 00:19:14
elsewhere we are not going to run the
FBI you mr. celebs and cooperated word

261
00:19:14 --> 00:19:17
Napoli and i are going to try to
corroborate we got some list of people

262
00:19:17 --> 00:19:23
who are in touch with no ser fine then
what do we need this guy what do you

263
00:19:23 --> 00:19:31
mind exactly the wrong way to handle him

264
00:19:31 --> 00:19:35
this is a terrorist task force and he&#39;s
the only source of information we&#39;ve got

265
00:19:35 --> 00:19:38
an intelligence agents always say you
get conned by your own damn thing we&#39;re

266
00:19:38 --> 00:19:41
being calm but that son-of-a-bitch on a
lie detector or fire

267
00:19:41 --> 00:19:47
so you have the result well you passed
up here up here wounds want to be extra

268
00:19:47 --> 00:19:51
sure so we sent the grass back down to
Washington and they changed the

269
00:19:51 --> 00:19:53
evaluation team conclusive so I&#39;m not
lying

270
00:19:53 --> 00:19:58
yeah but as far as the FBI&#39;s concerned
you&#39;re not telling the truth either so i

271
00:19:58 --> 00:20:01
must with a wire and they must benefit
st for there&#39;s nothing i can do you know

272

to do a job is willing to be a great
deal but I must know if it is allowed in

779
00:59:44 --> 00:59:49
regards to the United Nations do we
consider it the house of the devil is my

780
00:59:49 --> 00:59:53
blow against it would be devastating
that screw up like the trade center job

781
00:59:53 --> 00:59:58
we are planning something that will
bring it upside down but I must know if

782
00:59:58 --> 01:00:01
this is allowed or forbidden it is not
forbidden

783
01:00:01 --> 01:00:06
however it would be better for Muslims
so we do it or not forget it

784
01:00:06 --> 01:00:12
find the plan find the plan to inflict
damage on the American army itself but

785
01:00:12 --> 01:00:17
the united nations with hard Muslims
tremendously because the united nations

786
01:00:17 --> 01:00:22
will be considered the center for peace
and the Muslims would be considered

787
01:00:22 --> 01:00:23
against peace

788
01:00:23 --> 01:00:28

- exactly no audio do with i revise
history

163
00:10:33 --> 00:10:37
that&#39;s an unfortunate way of putting it
what you actually do it directive eyes

164
00:10:37 --> 00:10:42
peaches and wrongly reported incidents
isn&#39;t it yes those are great the need is

165
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
for establishing new speakers the
official language as soon as possible

166
00:10:44 --> 00:10:52
and the new addiction is your SS danger
of calling things by their wrong lane to

167
00:10:52 --> 00:10:54
visit any of the shops in the people&#39;s
area last night

168
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57

other party on your walk

members mixing with the people

171
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09
yes consider that I&#39;m reasonable

172
00:11:09 --> 00:11:14

privileged class expected to accept

173
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
restrictions as well as privileges

174
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
I had hoped we might be able to deal
with this matter herein your own

175
00:11:18 --> 00:11:21
ministry for explanations are inadequate

176
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
this report will be ported to the
Ministry of love for further action

177
00:11:24 --> 00:11:30
I think we can deal with it here you&#39;re
warned to pay strict attention to the

178
00:11:30 --> 00:11:32
regulations in the future

00:11:32 --> 00:11:35

00:26:51 --> 00:26:54
I was about to write an article on the
grandma you speak bring it on the screen

430
00:26:54 --> 00:26:57

431
00:26:57 --> 00:27:00

members of the records department have

432
00:27:00 --> 00:27:02
to report for late to be in an hour&#39;s
time

433
00:27:02 --> 00:27:08
meanwhile carry on with your work or
organizational taking part in the haight

434
00:27:08 --> 00:27:12
week demonstrations are preparing their
programs with unprecedented enthusiasm

435
00:27:12 --> 00:27:17
never before in the history of Oceania
have you been given so much cause for a

436
00:27:17 --> 00:27:22
show of constant printing the victory
against the enemy you continue now with

437
00:27:22 --> 00:27:25
our regular broadcast

438
00:27:25 --> 00:27:28
yeah

439
00:27:28 --> 00:27:31
yeah

440
00:27:31 --> 00:27:34
yeah

441
00:27:34 --> 00:27:37
the exclusive employment of words
sanctioned by the party to reduce the

442
00:27:37 --> 00:27:41
possibility of confusion and double
think work is already progressing on the

443
00:27:41 --> 00:27:44
latest edition of the Newspeak
dictionary which will replace all

444
00:27:44 --> 00:27:46
previous editions

445
00:27:46 --> 00:27:51
it seemed to take a scholarly interest
in the new addiction is myth hardly

446
00:27:51 --> 00:27:55
scholarly never seen any of the material
were using no sign told me about it

447
00:27:55 --> 00:28:04
time yes he works over sine no longer
exists

448
00:28:04 --> 00:28:07
the work has to be carried on of course
it seems to me you&#39;re more equipped to

449
00:28:07 --> 00:28:12
do it than anyone else I&#39;d like you to
look at that new material that you can

450
00:28:12 --> 00:28:15
pick it up at my apartment and give you
the address

451
00:28:15 --> 00:28:23
i&#39;m usually enough to 1900 ours coming
on as soon as you can have reason to

452
00:28:23 --> 00:28:26
believe that you can be a great value

453
00:28:26 --> 00:28:32
but I tell you it&#39;s the same handwriting
mean he just gave you his address and

454
00:28:32 --> 00:28:35
said he wanted to talk to you when you
talk all things like that don&#39;t happen

455
00:28:35 --> 00:28:36
it would be too dangerous

456
00:28:36 --> 00:28:39
he made some sort of excuse about the
new dictionary

457
00:28:39 --> 00:28:42
you know if you&#39;re wrong would be the
end of all this

458
00:28:42 --> 00:28:45
once they get hold of us there&#39;s nothing
absolutely nothing that either one of us

459
00:28:45 --> 00:28:48
can do for the other they can make us
confess anything but they can&#39;t make us

460
00:28:48 --> 00:28:49
believe it

461
00:28:49 --> 00:28:53
they can&#39;t get the side of us who knows
what they can do to you

462
00:28:53 --> 00:28:57
I&#39;m convinced oh , as a member of the
underground he&#39;s our one hope I&#39;m going

463
00:28:57 --> 00:28:57
through with this

464
00:28:57 --> 00:29:00
I have to but there&#39;s no need for you

465
00:29:00 --> 00:29:06
whatever you&#39;re going to do

466
00:29:06 --> 00:29:09
I&#39;m coming with you he has announced
tonight

467
00:29:09 --> 00:29:12
the production figures for this year
already exceed those of the

468
00:29:12 --> 00:29:14
corresponding dates in 1983

469
00:29:14 --> 00:29:17
I over 12 all right - bring them in mind
categories

470
00:29:17 --> 00:29:22
this increases even greater for example
hardware good this is kitchen utensils

471
00:29:22 --> 00:29:25
are 17 and a half percent higher than
last year

472
00:29:25 --> 00:29:28
shoes so it&#39;s staggering increase of
twenty one percent

473
00:29:28 --> 00:29:31
surely however you only an increase of
50 cent

474
00:29:31 --> 00:29:36
it is confidently predicted that
increase production while continuing

475
00:29:36 --> 00:29:41
throughout this year the Ministry of
plenty is confident that 1984 all will

476
00:29:41 --> 00:29:45
demonstrate the complete expect a big
brother 9 year

477
00:29:45 --> 00:29:49
you can turn it off a few members of the
inner party have that privilege of you

478
00:29:49 --> 00:29:52
well

479
00:29:52 --> 00:29:56
is that really you

480
00:29:56 --> 00:30:03
we come here because because because you
best believe there&#39;s a conspiracy some

481
00:30:03 --> 00:30:06
kind of organization working against big
brother

482
00:30:06 --> 00:30:10
yes we believe that you&#39;re involved in
it

483
00:30:10 --> 00:30:15
we want to join it to work for it that&#39;s
all right

484
00:30:15 --> 00:30:20
Martin is one of us alright man brings
over here

485
00:30:20 --> 00:30:23
that is not a sitcom talking company

486
00:30:23 --> 00:30:27
I think it&#39;s fitting we should begin by
drinking a toast wine

487
00:30:27 --> 00:30:33
I&#39;m afraid not much of it reaches the
outer body was rethinking the triumph of

488
00:30:33 --> 00:30:43
called--oh the confusion of the thought
police down with big brother down with

489
00:30:43 --> 00:30:46
big brother

490
00:30:46 --> 00:30:49
I didn&#39;t going on nothing but before you
go take a good look at these two common

491
00:30:49 --> 00:30:52
spaces you&#39;ll be seeing them again

492
00:30:52 --> 00:30:52
ok

493
00:30:52 --> 00:30:59
in general terms what you prepared to do
you are of course prepared to give your

494
00:30:59 --> 00:31:00
lives

495
00:31:00 --> 00:31:03
yes you&#39;re prepared to commit murder

496
00:31:03 --> 00:31:07
yes betray your country to a foreign
power

497
00:31:07 --> 00:31:13
yes i&#39;m prepared to separate and never
see one another anymore

498
00:31:13 --> 00:31:16
No

499
00:31:16 --> 00:31:18
No

500
00:31:18 --> 00:31:24
it will determine of course you realize
that you were fighting in the dark you

501
00:31:24 --> 00:31:29
have nothing to sustain you accept the
idea when your course you will get no

502
00:31:29 --> 00:31:29
help

503
00:31:29 --> 00:31:33
later I was into a book which will teach
you the nature of the society we live in

504
00:31:33 --> 00:31:37
and the strategy we will use to destroy
it and you get no information about your

505
00:31:37 --> 00:31:40
own organization when you receive orders
they will have come from me

506
00:31:40 --> 00:31:44
I assume that you have some kind of
hiding place yes the room over a junk

507
00:31:44 --> 00:31:49
shop we got there Sundays when we can&#39;t
let briefcase you always get it as a

508
00:31:49 --> 00:31:56
rule yes every day during hey tweek
carry it empty

509
00:31:56 --> 00:32:00
well now i&#39;m afraid it&#39;s time to go even
we are not allowed to turn that off as

510
00:32:00 --> 00:32:03
long as we would want

511
00:32:03 --> 00:32:10
I used to be afraid there was no undergo
perhaps the party and Ventus

512
00:32:10 --> 00:32:11
ok

513
00:32:11 --> 00:32:15
oh and smooth if I were you I would
destroy that

514
00:32:15 --> 00:32:17
brother ,

515
00:32:17 --> 00:32:22
big brother is always possible he stands
ever ready to welcome back to his loving

516
00:32:22 --> 00:32:23
protection

517
00:32:23 --> 00:32:26
don&#39;t hurt the era of their way

518
00:32:26 --> 00:32:29
well they need on pickles in up

519
00:32:29 --> 00:32:36
like you might take longer than Joan
will see yourself a father taken away so

520
00:32:36 --> 00:32:39
that death they so richly deserve

521
00:32:39 --> 00:32:43

themselves

overthrow big brother

537
00:33:49 --> 00:33:54
speeches are full of mistakes we&#39;ve got
to put them right now this calendar says

538
00:33:54 --> 00:33:57
the aim of the ruling classes to stay
where it is the name of the middle class

539
00:33:57 --> 00:34:01
is to overthrow the ruling class and the
aim of the lower class is to create a

540
00:34:01 --> 00:34:03
society in which all classes are equal

541
00:34:03 --> 00:34:07
big brother has so organized begin a
party but there is no danger of the

542
00:34:07 --> 00:34:12
ruling class being deposed until
listening

543
00:34:12 --> 00:34:15
I&#39;d like to have a child

544

want what we want to understand what

548
00:34:27 --> 00:34:30

appearance but genuinely hi console we

626
00:40:11 --> 00:40:13
make in one of our cells

627
00:40:13 --> 00:40:18
no one whom we bring to this place ever
stands out against this we will leave

628
00:40:18 --> 00:40:21
you step by step to the point from which
there is no leader

629
00:40:21 --> 00:40:28
never again will be capable of love or
friendship or joy of life or laughter

630
00:40:28 --> 00:40:31

Winston pulled that you are mentally

639
00:41:03 --> 00:41:07
deranged to have a defective memory are
unable to remember real events and you

640
00:41:07 --> 00:41:10
persuade your supper to remember events
which never happened

641
00:41:10 --> 00:41:13
for example do you remember receiving a
book

642
00:41:13 --> 00:41:18
supposedly written by khaled or yeah

643
00:41:18 --> 00:41:24
somebody gave it to me in victory square
quite sure that book ever existed

644
00:41:24 --> 00:41:27

647
00:41:36 --> 00:41:47
let&#39;s take another delusion of yours you
believe you had in your hands a

648
00:41:47 --> 00:41:49
photograph of the traitors Jones and
brotherhood

649
00:41:49 --> 00:41:54
I did have it you believe it was some
sort of documentary evidence proving

650
00:41:54 --> 00:41:55
their confessions were false

651
00:41:55 --> 00:41:58
I remember telling you that the
photograph did not exist

Ribery I remember it you remember i do
not remember it

654
00:42:06 --> 00:42:12
there is a party directive dealing with
the control of the past repeated to me

655
00:42:12 --> 00:42:21
who controls the past controls the
future controls the present controls the

656
00:42:21 --> 00:42:27
parents and where he was opposed this
past exists in records the party

657
00:42:27 --> 00:42:32
controls all record and human memories

658
00:42:32 --> 00:42:38
the party controls all human memories
how can you control the memory

659
00:42:38 --> 00:42:42
you haven&#39;t controlled my under it

660
00:42:42 --> 00:42:47

you&#39;re here have been lacking in

661
00:42:47 --> 00:42:49
humility and self-discipline

662
00:42:49 --> 00:42:55
you must make an effort of the will
wisdom and rehabilitate your mind then

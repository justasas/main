I&#39;ll take it the sew it back on the
laboratory

19
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
hurry gotcha

20
00:00:55 --> 00:01:00
30 minutes apparently we have just the
card number on 15-30 minutes

21
00:01:00 --> 00:01:03
yeah

22
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
yeah

23
00:01:06 --> 00:01:16
command on in 12 the lemon tree and much
conditioner - that&#39;s one in salads too

24
00:01:16 --> 00:01:24
yeah

25
00:01:24 --> 00:01:28
for this there is no reason that just as
no reason

26
00:01:28 --> 00:01:29
ok

27
00:01:29 --> 00:01:31
yeah

28
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
ok

29
00:01:34 --> 00:01:38
what about it that often when there is a
thing happens there&#39;s always some reason

30
00:01:38 --> 00:01:39
some bears

31
00:01:39 --> 00:01:45
what now we must find it when dr. maybe
it was something from from the outside

32
00:01:45 --> 00:01:48
I&#39;m sure it was nothing from this end
are you sure of that

33
00:01:48 --> 00:01:54
only the young are so very sure I
suppose it may have been sabotage but

34
00:01:54 --> 00:01:58
with our security all a young friend
here was thinking of something else

35
00:01:58 --> 00:02:03
something he mentioned before flying
sauces or something like that

36
00:02:03 --> 00:02:08
well sir I suppose that is a possibility

37
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
I think you are taking them a little too
seriously tom

38
00:02:11 --> 00:02:14
quiet dr. my sir let the boy make a fool
of himself

39
00:02:14 --> 00:02:18
you think because he is so young he
should be spent by tongue

40
00:02:18 --> 00:02:21
what better time to learn he is still a
student

41
00:02:21 --> 00:02:27
fuck out

42
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
you don&#39;t have to hear right corporal
Wilsons are again 17

43
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
the dogs are upset certain I can&#39;t see
any reason for it

44
00:02:33 --> 00:02:39
no one prowling around those are no sign
of anything for a leash on the dogs and

45
00:02:39 --> 00:02:40
take a look

46
00:02:40 --> 00:02:45
does that mean there was something
outside that could have caused the

47
00:02:45 --> 00:02:45
failure

48
00:02:45 --> 00:02:48
more likely the dog smelled a rabbit

49
00:02:48 --> 00:02:53
tomorrow we make another shot I suggest
we run the tapes and see what they have

50
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
to tell us

51
00:02:56 --> 00:03:04
yeah

52
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
yeah

53
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10

only earth English on this assignment

58
00:03:24 --> 00:03:27

59
00:03:27 --> 00:03:31
it has been torn off again and you all
about it when we get back to the ship

60
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
you have a great future in this bird
maybe

61
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
so do not try to make better progress by
how do you say making googly eyes at my

62
00:03:38 --> 00:03:39
knees that isn&#39;t there

63
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
he was only asking me would go with him
for coffee when you&#39;re through here

64
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
after all this in Germany

65
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
I didn&#39;t really mean that but this is
America

66
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
I was born here and stop them on often
it&#39;s different here

67
00:03:50 --> 00:03:55
the kids well they have more freedom I
do not care what they do here

68
00:03:55 --> 00:03:58
while she is here she will do as I say

69
00:03:58 --> 00:04:01
he also is here on my request

70
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
i selected him from over 200 applicants

71
00:04:04 --> 00:04:08
because his school records showed that
he is virtually a mathematical genius

72
00:04:08 --> 00:04:13
I&#39;m jumps this like this but I will not
tolerate for one minute

73
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
mixing business and pleasure while i am
in charge of this project

74
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
dr. Harkness right Sally you are his
responsibility

75
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
he didn&#39;t ask me to marry and just
coffee I know

76
00:04:22 --> 00:04:29
come in and intelligence told me to
bring this straight over the user

77
00:04:29 --> 00:04:34
what the hell is it the dogs pulled us
all the man they were chasing some

78
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
possible . the problem is i&#39;m off this
way

79
00:04:36 --> 00:04:39
it just can&#39;t be done did you see the
man

80
00:04:39 --> 00:04:46
yes sir i got several shots setting I I
guess I missed you don&#39;t think of it

81
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
I don&#39;t think I did miss

82
00:04:49 --> 00:04:52
leave this with me I&#39;ll see that it gets
back to intelligence

83
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
yeah

84
00:04:55 --> 00:04:59
I&#39;m not a surgeon but i would swear that

yeah

92
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
yeah

93
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
you&#39;ve never really felt comfortable in
the body of the earth

94
00:05:28 --> 00:05:33
from the very first I was against you
for a part for your good enough

95
00:05:33 --> 00:05:38
scientists you are for the plan but no
violence

96
00:05:38 --> 00:05:45
oh I know what&#39;s bothering you lost
enough now that our must be replaced and

97
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49
that means finding a living arm
somewhere

98
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
yeah

99
00:05:52 --> 00:05:55
yeah

100
00:05:55 --> 00:05:56
it&#39;s all set

101
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
yeah

102
00:05:57 --> 00:06:00
yeah

103
00:06:00 --> 00:06:01
yeah

104
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
yeah

105
00:06:04 --> 00:06:08
you&#39;d better get back in your body I&#39;m
beginning to get through

106
00:06:08 --> 00:06:11
yeah

107
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
dissension between us will not help my
work anytime you wish to return to our

108
00:06:15 --> 00:06:16
planet

109
00:06:16 --> 00:06:23
you have my permission to leader decides
who will return to my planet and when

110
00:06:23 --> 00:06:39
you turn it off for now i&#39;ll see if our
beam can be narrowed plain everyday

111
00:06:39 --> 00:06:43
table thought that you have to God so
hold him cried when find out looking . h

112
00:06:43 --> 00:06:50
chemical may never he bunts and ask for
you always ask for the same way

113
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
dragon that&#39;s when he wants anything it
should be thanking your uncle instead of

114
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
making fun of them

115
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
he had made such a fuss the set on it
would have done is going to coffee

116
00:06:56 --> 00:06:57
together

117
00:06:57 --> 00:07:02
I like this better here we are told you
she looks cute without glasses

118
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
she sure does I think this has been done
like us I also dug this up now there&#39;s

119
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
no question about what station we listen
to uh one thing

120
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
ok you gotta promise not to take it
apart see what makes it tick

121
00:07:12 --> 00:07:15
okay I promise

122
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
yeah

123
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
yeah

124
00:07:20 --> 00:07:27
yeah

125
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
keep turning it on and off to clear soon

126
00:07:30 --> 00:07:33
did you reset the beam and the line call

127
00:07:33 --> 00:07:37
there it is again there was it static
like a transmitter being turned off and

128
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
on sounds all right now

129
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
that&#39;s not the point something that
shouldn&#39;t be any transmitters working on

130
00:07:41 --> 00:07:42
this frequency against the law

131
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
how do you know what is the transmitter
baby is doing well when I check the

132
00:07:45 --> 00:07:46
weather for the professor this morning

133
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
no sunspots no storm sure that&#39;s a
transmitter

134
00:07:49 --> 00:07:53
uh I remember you promised besides all
that noise going on in the back we can

135
00:07:53 --> 00:08:06
hear our radio change your station Bob
see if you get interference was real

136
00:08:06 --> 00:08:06
movies

137
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
we have KY r lee of KX DX and we both
get static

138
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
what does that mean how to get in touch
with the authorities

139
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
what did you tell them you don&#39;t know
where it&#39;s coming from I can find out

140
00:08:15 --> 00:08:19
easy to use this as a direction finder
and walk in the direction of static gets

141
00:08:19 --> 00:08:22
the loudest and when it gets a lot of
luck you&#39;ll find the transmitter

142
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
leave it to all time to figure a way to
get the pretty girls alone

143
00:08:25 --> 00:08:29
you better stay here selling I don&#39;t
know what I might find little green men

144
00:08:29 --> 00:08:32
maybe I think i will come

145
00:08:32 --> 00:08:37
and I have to build everything here
myself makes me long to be back home no

146
00:08:37 --> 00:08:40
real laboratory

147
00:08:40 --> 00:08:43
it should do

148
00:08:43 --> 00:08:49
this is Earth expedition number two

149
00:08:49 --> 00:08:53
reception bad but understandable

150
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
are we clear

151
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
other launching stop

152
00:08:59 --> 00:09:02
we still have no idea why their missiles
are failing

153
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
the council has voted for memberships
for this work

154
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
how&#39;s the work on the invasion fleet
progressing

155
00:09:08 --> 00:09:16
discovering places like this

156
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
doesn&#39;t hurt much not really issues

157
00:09:19 --> 00:09:25
I think we&#39;d better go back don&#39;t be
silly it doesn&#39;t hurt that me it seems

158
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
to be coming from over that hill

159
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
come on you can lean on me

160
00:09:30 --> 00:09:38
especially we will see to it leader

161
00:09:38 --> 00:09:47
we have to make another capture any how
to repair hormones are you must

162
00:09:47 --> 00:09:54
electroconvulsive shock and but I
thought you were dead

163
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57
that makes studying extremely difficult

164
00:09:57 --> 00:10:00
I will see to it

165
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
that means the transmitters been turned
off and just when we&#39;re getting close

166
00:10:03 --> 00:10:07
what can we do now and I think we better
tell your uncle about it this may have

167
00:10:07 --> 00:10:09
something to do with the missiles

168
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
the guy dr. von Hoffman doesn&#39;t have to
know that you were with me

169
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
besides I think the general would be a
better bet do you think they&#39;ll believe

170
00:10:15 --> 00:10:18
you know how they acted a little believe
me

171
00:10:18 --> 00:10:21
this can be checked this place gives me
the creeps

172
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
yeah

173
00:10:24 --> 00:10:30
we wait till after the launching to find
more things i can get by with one arm

174
00:10:30 --> 00:10:34
till then don&#39;t you over to the console
to use all your facilities for your work

175
00:10:34 --> 00:10:39
every missile from Cape Canaveral is
either failed or was let go to avoid

176
00:10:39 --> 00:10:40
undue suspicion

177
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
could you have done any better well I
was just I have to get this power back

178
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
fixed up right now don&#39;t bother me again
is that clear

179
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
yes perfectly clear

180
00:10:49 --> 00:10:52
I

181
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
No

182
00:10:55 --> 00:10:58
yeah

183
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
yeah

184
00:11:01 --> 00:11:04
- 20 second

185
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
he told them yet i haven&#39;t had a chance

186
00:11:07 --> 00:11:10
yeah

187
00:11:10 --> 00:11:11
yeah

188
00:11:11 --> 00:11:15
you know I told you how hollister with
your dad last night

189
00:11:15 --> 00:11:19
you know what you&#39;re telling me about
general is an illegal transmitter

190
00:11:19 --> 00:11:20
working somewhere in the hills

191
00:11:20 --> 00:11:24
it might have a bearing on those
missiles I didn&#39;t do badly for a

192
00:11:24 --> 00:11:28
one-armed man did i do we start looking
for some specimens to send back now

193
00:11:28 --> 00:11:36
no I think not night seems like a better
time for now I think we need some rests

194
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
I mean if it was something really
important wouldn&#39;t the general checked

195
00:11:38 --> 00:11:38
it out

196
00:11:38 --> 00:11:42
you didn&#39;t ask the right questions just
because tom is in 40 years old

197
00:11:42 --> 00:11:45
look at these sunspots right I could
have traced as far as I did

198
00:11:45 --> 00:11:48
I don&#39;t know about you guys but I&#39;m
getting cold what now genius

199
00:11:48 --> 00:11:51
you still have that radio

200
00:11:51 --> 00:11:52
yeah

201
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
I&#39;m going back right stop last night

202
00:11:55 --> 00:11:56
transmitter starts up again

203
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
I should be able to pinpoint the place
of origin the general will have to

204
00:11:59 --> 00:12:05
listen to me i&#39;m climbing in the car
before I free to death case anyone cares

205
00:12:05 --> 00:12:10

00:12:23 --> 00:12:29
good times the Time Lords early real
early

213
00:12:29 --> 00:12:32
I wasn&#39;t asleep

214
00:12:32 --> 00:12:35
Bob do you think there really are a
little green

215
00:12:35 --> 00:12:38
or there are time will wipe them out
with an adding machine

216
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
yeah

217
00:12:42 --> 00:12:46
what was that what was what like a twig
break or something

218
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
well there have been stories about
lovers lane bandits and stuff like that

219
00:12:49 --> 00:12:51
just discouraged about the top

220
00:12:51 --> 00:12:59
Bob I&#39;m scared me know leave Tom and
Sally will be all right i&#39;ll protect you

221
00:12:59 --> 00:13:02
yeah

222
00:13:02 --> 00:13:08
yeah

223
00:13:08 --> 00:13:11
yeah

224
00:13:11 --> 00:13:15
yeah

225
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
yeah

226
00:13:18 --> 00:13:22
keep your eyes open keep that needle
blaster handy

227
00:13:22 --> 00:13:25
highlights about it for the night we
better call it quits

228
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
tomorrow is a big day mom do you know
the schedule

229
00:13:28 --> 00:13:31
I that the launching tomorrow and my
uncle didn&#39;t tell me

230
00:13:31 --> 00:13:35
well after all he is the boys look if we
did find that transmitter and it was

231
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
affecting our missiles we might take us
both back in his good graces

232
00:13:37 --> 00:13:40
right in the head board all night if you
have to know for tonight I&#39;m afraid

233
00:13:40 --> 00:13:43
but there the other night

234
00:13:43 --> 00:13:46
yeah

235
00:13:46 --> 00:13:48
yeah

236
00:13:48 --> 00:13:49
yeah

237
00:13:49 --> 00:13:52
yeah

238
00:13:52 --> 00:13:55
yeah

239
00:13:55 --> 00:13:58
what is it Tom I thought I heard
something

240
00:13:58 --> 00:13:59
it&#39;s gone now

241
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
yeah

242
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
yeah

243
00:14:04 --> 00:14:07
look at the time we got to keep moving

244
00:14:07 --> 00:14:11
yeah

245
00:14:11 --> 00:14:15
that kills the idea of them just
wandering off

246
00:14:15 --> 00:14:20
you know this is we can take this quick
line Bob and truly know what can we do

247
00:14:20 --> 00:14:23
what we know about where it is that&#39;s
half the battle

248
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
I don&#39;t know i think we ought to call
the sheriff or the police or somebody

249
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
tell me I know how you feel but let&#39;s
look at the facts

250
00:14:27 --> 00:14:32
for one thing the keys and in the car I
me bob has them for his captors

251
00:14:32 --> 00:14:35
I could Hotwire the ignition bugs that a
lot in the steering column we could walk

252
00:14:35 --> 00:14:35
back to town

253
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
sure but i would take too long don&#39;t
tell me what would happen to shoot

254
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
involved in that time with my uncle
hundred afraid he&#39;s gonna find out all

255
00:14:40 --> 00:14:43
about it no matter what we do

256
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
you&#39;re afraid but we don&#39;t have any
other

257
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
yeah

258
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
yeah

259
00:14:52 --> 00:14:55
yeah

260
00:14:55 --> 00:15:07
choice and we will send the female in 26
hours and the male specimen later the

261
00:15:07 --> 00:15:08
next test

262
00:15:08 --> 00:15:14
almost a month at a time the best way to
report

263
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
we&#39;ll see

264
00:15:16 --> 00:15:18
yeah

265
00:15:18 --> 00:15:22
I would like a complete schedule of the
procedure for the preparation of the

266
00:15:22 --> 00:15:24
specimen

267
00:15:24 --> 00:15:27
I wouldn&#39;t want anything to happen to
the

268
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
the complete

269
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
the electric shock

270
00:15:32 --> 00:15:35
it is freezing that is difficult

271
00:15:35 --> 00:15:40
always check the temperatures the fluids
in the body for you start coming

272
00:15:40 --> 00:15:45
what a time for it to quit must be
within 50 feet of here

273
00:15:45 --> 00:15:49
he&#39;s gonna beat the brush until we find
it I just about the only thing we can do

274
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
you work over there and I&#39;ll start from
the sign

275
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
yeah

276
00:15:55 --> 00:15:59
hurry with that metallic cloth he&#39;s
unconscious now but things are strange

277
00:15:59 --> 00:16:02
yeah

278
00:16:02 --> 00:16:05
ready everything is ready

279
00:16:05 --> 00:16:08
yeah

280
00:16:08 --> 00:16:11
yeah

281
00:16:11 --> 00:16:14
yeah

282
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
yeah

283
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
yeah

284
00:16:20 --> 00:16:31
Sally strange noises that I know I&#39;m
Sally

285
00:16:31 --> 00:16:40
we&#39;re gonna go for help me right now we
look for another half hour

286
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
all right

287
00:16:43 --> 00:16:44
yeah

288
00:16:44 --> 00:16:46
yeah

289
00:16:46 --> 00:16:49
yeah

290
00:16:49 --> 00:16:52
give him another shot

291
00:16:52 --> 00:16:55
yeah

292
00:16:55 --> 00:16:59
shall we proceed for it

293
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
yeah

294
00:17:02 --> 00:17:05
yeah

295
00:17:05 --> 00:17:12
yeah

296
00:17:12 --> 00:17:15
did you hear that hear what

297
00:17:15 --> 00:17:16
listen

298
00:17:16 --> 00:17:20
there&#39;s a pool of water in their water
has anything to do with it

299
00:17:20 --> 00:17:23
just minutes

300
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
how is he

301
00:17:26 --> 00:17:29
his breathing is very shallow

302
00:17:29 --> 00:17:32
you&#39;re right about his lack of life
force

303
00:17:32 --> 00:17:33
he&#39;s dead

304
00:17:33 --> 00:17:36
he would never have lived through
transmission

305
00:17:36 --> 00:17:39
now you know why I didn&#39;t want to use
his whole body

306
00:17:39 --> 00:17:44
he had a nice chin except for that time
scar

307
00:17:44 --> 00:17:47
perhaps the more human eye look

308
00:17:47 --> 00:17:50
more freely i could move around

309
00:17:50 --> 00:17:51
his chin

310
00:17:51 --> 00:17:54
to replace yours

311
00:17:54 --> 00:18:05
it&#39;s a man-made cave you better stay
here selling no thanks

312
00:18:05 --> 00:18:08
yeah

313
00:18:08 --> 00:18:13
yeah

314
00:18:13 --> 00:18:16
yeah

315
00:18:16 --> 00:18:19
favorite

316
00:18:19 --> 00:18:22
yeah

317
00:18:22 --> 00:18:27
we found something still the way is a
good time

318
00:18:27 --> 00:18:32
you can find anything but this would be
where it leads

319
00:18:32 --> 00:18:35
and

320
00:18:35 --> 00:18:39
something in the car door again

321
00:18:39 --> 00:18:42
turn on the status of speed

322
00:18:42 --> 00:18:48
I think the needle blast and see what we
got this time or act wanted us to send

323
00:18:48 --> 00:18:52
some more smaller animals good for us if
we can send him some right away

324
00:18:52 --> 00:18:55
and if you&#39;re new chin needs a little
trimming

325
00:18:55 --> 00:18:58
I&#39;ll fix it when I get back

326
00:18:58 --> 00:19:06
yeah

327
00:19:06 --> 00:19:15
specimen yes we will make the complete
report when we return back side

328
00:19:15 --> 00:19:23
so that&#39;s what&#39;s going on

329
00:19:23 --> 00:19:28
maybe I&#39;m reading all this dreamy

330
00:19:28 --> 00:19:33
oh yes sometimes when you humans are
asleep

331
00:19:33 --> 00:19:44
you see things that are not read dream i
can assure you that her on and I asha

332
00:19:44 --> 00:19:45
are real

333
00:19:45 --> 00:19:51
you are from outer space at you but you
were just everything our oxygen mixture

334
00:19:51 --> 00:19:52
in the odds against their fantastic

335
00:19:52 --> 00:19:58
are you a scientist just a student but
you understand the theory of elemental

336
00:19:58 --> 00:20:04
mixed and the mathematical probability
of oxygen breathing species you are

337
00:20:04 --> 00:20:09
unusual student of course I don&#39;t think
so

338
00:20:09 --> 00:20:12
there are plenty of guys my age are a
lot smarter

339
00:20:12 --> 00:20:16
this is quite some sort of you have is
that really an intergalactic television

340
00:20:16 --> 00:20:22
like intergalactic hardly so we can do
to raise our planet

341
00:20:22 --> 00:20:27
you are in our solar system enough talk
let&#39;s prepare for the transmission

342
00:20:27 --> 00:20:28
process

343
00:20:28 --> 00:20:31
don&#39;t be ridiculous he can be a good
source of information

344
00:20:31 --> 00:20:34
I like some information to you will
learn more there

345
00:20:34 --> 00:20:38
you mean this is a spaceship and you&#39;ll
be taking off

346
00:20:38 --> 00:20:40
No

347
00:20:40 --> 00:20:46
you will be transmitted I&#39;m not familiar
with all of your science so i may not be

348
00:20:46 --> 00:20:52
able to explain it to where you see that
tank actually precise treatment of your

349
00:20:52 --> 00:20:56
cellular structure with electric
convulsions freezing temperatures

350
00:20:56 --> 00:20:59
you will be most in that solution

351
00:20:59 --> 00:21:02
what is the solution in the tank

352
00:21:02 --> 00:21:08
an element that would roughly correspond
to your hydrogen same atomic weight much

353
00:21:08 --> 00:21:11
higher

354
00:21:11 --> 00:21:14
what happened to my friends a girl and a
boy about my size

355
00:21:14 --> 00:21:20
don&#39;t worry about your friends set up
the harness and let&#39;s get this over with

356
00:21:20 --> 00:21:24
what is it gives my using those
restraints

357
00:21:24 --> 00:21:28
will do you any good to know but it&#39;s
called drugs man a rare element in our

358
00:21:28 --> 00:21:31
planet we use it much the same as you
use gold and silver

359
00:21:31 --> 00:21:34
i hear there&#39;s a tracer to have it on
this plan

360
00:21:34 --> 00:21:40
throw it on what kind of properties does
it have you really are into student and

361
00:21:40 --> 00:21:45
I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t recall everything
about it in large concentration that can

362
00:21:45 --> 00:21:49
cause a severe burn and all we ask it to
glows in the dark

363
00:21:49 --> 00:21:52
we&#39;re gonna do to her

364
00:21:52 --> 00:21:58
you need to secure the of electricity
through her cellular structure your

365
00:21:58 --> 00:22:01
scientist too much the same thing they
call it

366
00:22:01 --> 00:22:04
electroconvulsive shock therapy perhaps
you&#39;ve heard of it

367
00:22:04 --> 00:22:07
already on it won&#39;t hurt her

368
00:22:07 --> 00:22:10
really

369
00:22:10 --> 00:22:13
yeah

370
00:22:13 --> 00:22:16
incredibly serious proposal

371
00:22:16 --> 00:22:22
yeah

372
00:22:22 --> 00:22:26
I knew we should have protein instead of
talking how did he escape from that

373
00:22:26 --> 00:22:29
restraint has been forced I don&#39;t
understand

374
00:22:29 --> 00:22:32
and now he knows all about us he went
for help

375
00:22:32 --> 00:22:36
he wouldn&#39;t leave here without her
except for that reason and help

376
00:22:36 --> 00:22:48
what do we do about them I think we can
handle it

377
00:22:48 --> 00:22:51
yeah

378
00:22:51 --> 00:22:54
yeah

379
00:22:54 --> 00:23:04
hello operator give me the police
department of them

380
00:23:04 --> 00:23:13
I like the sheriff&#39;s office but for me
it&#39;s an emergency sheriff&#39;s office

381
00:23:13 --> 00:23:16
well you better talk to the chief deputy

382
00:23:16 --> 00:23:19
deputy TLO here

383
00:23:19 --> 00:23:26
what yes I know what you want you call
your uncle this doctor whatever his name

384
00:23:26 --> 00:23:27
is and don&#39;t leave I&#39;ll be right there

385
00:23:27 --> 00:23:30

other planets going on arms

yeah

458
00:27:43 --> 00:27:51
no bird yet of setting

459
00:27:51 --> 00:27:55
nope no way to tell me that you think
they are together again

460
00:27:55 --> 00:27:58
I don&#39;t know what I think

461
00:27:58 --> 00:28:03
you don&#39;t seem very worried about being
recaptured went on doesn&#39;t show up the

462
00:28:03 --> 00:28:06
test this morning my uncle 10 a missile
test

463
00:28:06 --> 00:28:12
I see rates but there isn&#39;t any
scheduled for almost a month when my

464
00:28:12 --> 00:28:13
uncle wants to we can do

465
00:28:13 --> 00:28:16
yes go on you were saying about your
uncle

466
00:28:16 --> 00:28:25
don&#39;t see any more selling how about a
trade our freedom for our knowledge

467
00:28:25 --> 00:28:28
tom thinks the next day only say hope
day

468
00:28:28 --> 00:28:33
what does that language you speak just
my way of telling her that I love her

469
00:28:33 --> 00:28:39
now we may make a deal but first tell me
how did you escape from the restraint

470
00:28:39 --> 00:28:45
easy but pow

471
00:28:45 --> 00:28:48
the other element goes on is what we
call radium

472
00:28:48 --> 00:28:51
we have so much better that we use it on
her watch dials to tell time in the dark

473
00:28:51 --> 00:28:54
find out more about the missile to be
tested this morning

474
00:28:54 --> 00:28:57
why we have no more power will take at
least a week to recharge the pack

475
00:28:57 --> 00:29:00
if I tell you how you could destroy that
missile would you let us go

476
00:29:00 --> 00:29:04
well yes if you can help us will let you
go

477
00:29:04 --> 00:29:08
the missile being tested uses no radio

478
00:29:08 --> 00:29:12
if you have weapons that are blocked by
this element they should work on this

479
00:29:12 --> 00:29:17
project could rewire the disruptor a and
give us some range

480
00:29:17 --> 00:29:23
are you positive it contains no radium
positive good it&#39;ll work there when you

481
00:29:23 --> 00:29:23
said it&#39;s free

482
00:29:23 --> 00:29:26
when around returns and we know you&#39;re
telling the truth

483
00:29:26 --> 00:29:29
I&#39;d better get busy

484
00:29:29 --> 00:29:33
you got to give us a little more time
but what then don&#39;t worry i call the

485
00:29:33 --> 00:29:34
Sheriff&#39;s Department in on the deal

486
00:29:34 --> 00:29:36
that&#39;s why I had to take a chance to
leave you I knew you wouldn&#39;t have left

487
00:29:36 --> 00:29:37
me without a good reason

488
00:29:37 --> 00:29:41
I think with a little help we can lick
these freaks

489
00:29:41 --> 00:29:44
Oh Tom I hope so

490
00:29:44 --> 00:29:47

we&#39;re the kids

516
00:31:27 --> 00:31:30
well I didn&#39;t see them anyplace but I
know they must be in that case

517
00:31:30 --> 00:31:33
no but I know there is a cave well let&#39;s
get them

518
00:31:33 --> 00:31:36
you should have heard something by now
tom they hadn&#39;t tied my hands would be

519
00:31:36 --> 00:31:37
out of here by now

520
00:31:37 --> 00:31:40
I your dosing two maybe three sirens
close

521
00:31:40 --> 00:31:43
Lovers Lane I guess time did you really
have it don&#39;t need to let them in on it

522
00:31:43 --> 00:31:47
we have to get out of here yeah me too
this is your mother would mind

523
00:31:47 --> 00:31:52
that&#39;s getting married that mean that a
proposal

524
00:31:52 --> 00:32:01
I guess it is well yes or no maybe Brian
math but you certainly don&#39;t know much

525
00:32:01 --> 00:32:04
about women

526
00:32:04 --> 00:32:06
yeah

527
00:32:06 --> 00:32:13
yeah

528
00:32:13 --> 00:32:19
yeah

529
00:32:19 --> 00:32:22
yeah

530
00:32:22 --> 00:32:25
ok

531
00:32:25 --> 00:32:30
all in there with your hands up with
coming after all that the current

532
00:32:30 --> 00:32:31
apartment

533
00:32:31 --> 00:32:35
let me try it

534
00:32:35 --> 00:32:43
now this is Major General hollister of
the United States ami you want my order

535
00:32:43 --> 00:32:45
to surrender

536
00:32:45 --> 00:32:48
well what we do now

537
00:32:48 --> 00:32:50
capture the group hold them here
transmit ourselves back and meet with

538
00:32:50 --> 00:32:50
the council

539
00:32:50 --> 00:32:53
do you mean we must not kill out of the
earth friends is that it

540
00:32:53 --> 00:32:56
perhaps the leader can start the
invasion sooner than plan and they&#39;ll

541
00:32:56 --> 00:32:57
all be killed

542
00:32:57 --> 00:33:00
what now your science can be abused to
us

543
00:33:00 --> 00:33:07
perhaps the tool by which they die all
right let&#39;s first use the big paralysis

544
00:33:07 --> 00:33:07
rain

545
00:33:07 --> 00:33:09
help me with it

546
00:33:09 --> 00:33:12
Major General hollister of the United
States Army

547
00:33:12 --> 00:33:15
you hereby ordered to surrender

548
00:33:15 --> 00:33:21
yeah

549
00:33:21 --> 00:33:24
it seems to me you&#39;re wasting time

550
00:33:24 --> 00:33:25
yeah

551
00:33:25 --> 00:33:27
that&#39;s going to get up

552
00:33:27 --> 00:33:31
yeah

553
00:33:31 --> 00:33:36
yeah

554
00:33:36 --> 00:33:41
do you any good to try another escape
while we&#39;re back on our planet

555
00:33:41 --> 00:33:44
I blocked the sets beam on the card off

556
00:33:44 --> 00:33:48
that&#39;s for the ship I don&#39;t think
there&#39;s anything here that you can hurt

557
00:33:48 --> 00:33:51
all right now you let&#39;s get into the
tack

558
00:33:51 --> 00:33:54
yeah

559
00:33:54 --> 00:33:57
Sally seating which my key chain

560
00:33:57 --> 00:34:00
I know it may hurt but it&#39;s our only
chance that&#39;s it

561
00:34:00 --> 00:34:03
Bob&#39;s idea of a joke it&#39;s a miniature
slide rule said to be perfect for me

562
00:34:03 --> 00:34:04
because you can see in the dark

563
00:34:04 --> 00:34:07
it&#39;s me to bring him to know what are
some of the face it may work trying

564
00:34:07 --> 00:34:11
that&#39;s it it&#39;s yours

565
00:34:11 --> 00:34:20
Sally get my ass kicked by a doctor

566
00:34:20 --> 00:34:22
yeah

567
00:34:22 --> 00:34:26
all over still unconscious I guess the
rain has more effect on some than others

568
00:34:26 --> 00:34:29
they&#39;ll be all right though japanese let
this paper doctor

569
00:34:29 --> 00:34:32
all i have is pink i was doing some work
with Carlo and I look fine thank you

570
00:34:32 --> 00:34:35
if he would do better if we were trying
to get out of here very if it is that be

571
00:34:35 --> 00:34:38
are the people from the other plant
turned on the beam in the cordon

572
00:34:38 --> 00:34:41
it&#39;s impossible to get through we know
we were cotton one nobody did

573
00:34:41 --> 00:34:44
well this liquid in the tank is similar
to our hydrogen huh

574
00:34:44 --> 00:34:48
that is the reason for the litmus paper
if the liquid in the tank is a hydrogen

575
00:34:48 --> 00:34:48
base

576
00:34:48 --> 00:34:51
the paper will turn blue that&#39;s the idea
can you tell how strong are active such

577
00:34:51 --> 00:34:53
a liquid might be from inspection of
this paper after emotion

578
00:34:53 --> 00:34:56
yeah

579
00:34:56 --> 00:35:01
one thing is sure that is most
definitely not hydrogen

580
00:35:01 --> 00:35:04
of course not but it should work the
same way yeah but it would be greatly

581
00:35:04 --> 00:35:10
accelerated how much at least 200 power
if you add sodium chloride for hydrogen

582
00:35:10 --> 00:35:16
base you release heat as a side product
in the amount of 13,700 calories per

583
00:35:16 --> 00:35:16
mole

584
00:35:16 --> 00:35:20
thanks dr. know this stuff should hit
200 power of that you did should do that

585
00:35:20 --> 00:35:25
but what good does it do to make an oven
for ourselves fuck he needs an explosion

586
00:35:25 --> 00:35:29
ya know I always I was coming to that if
i remember correctly polyethylene is an

587
00:35:29 --> 00:35:34
unstable compound represented by linking
ch2 in polymer linkage

588
00:35:34 --> 00:35:38
now I had heat extreme heat to that for
me when you have an explorer shooting is

589
00:35:38 --> 00:35:40
always dangerous

590
00:35:40 --> 00:35:43
now the sodium chloride is easy

591
00:35:43 --> 00:35:47
nice comments all not got something Bob
gave me the polyethylene is easy to all

592
00:35:47 --> 00:35:51
of you have knowledge from the inserts
are made of it pokemon white plastic

593
00:35:51 --> 00:35:51
pail

594
00:35:51 --> 00:35:54
ok not like the United this room with
the only our internal energy of all the

595
00:35:54 --> 00:35:55
plastic if i take your beer

596
00:35:55 --> 00:35:59
ya hear me it&#39;s gonna feel very sorry
yeah fine

597
00:35:59 --> 00:36:02
sounds good to me

598
00:36:02 --> 00:36:05
she you take the people out of here I&#39;ll
take care of the tank

599
00:36:05 --> 00:36:08

600
00:36:08 --> 00:36:11
yeah

601

603
00:36:20 --> 00:36:21
monsters might still be on earth

604
00:36:21 --> 00:36:24
I don&#39;t think we have to worry about
them anymore

605
00:36:24 --> 00:36:27
yeah

606
00:36:27 --> 00:36:30

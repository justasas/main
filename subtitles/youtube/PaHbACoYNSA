00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
this is gresham street in the city of
london that&#39;s the Bank of England

3
00:00:04 --> 00:00:05
they&#39;re behind us

4
00:00:05 --> 00:00:10
this is a fake security man and these
are security boxes containing real money

5
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
each box contains 50,000 pounds

6
00:00:13 --> 00:00:17
this is mark markets are fake security
guard and that mark is a stunt actor but

7
00:00:17 --> 00:00:20
he has been briefed to act and behave
exactly as a real security guard would

8
00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
this whole area is being protected and
surrounded by the police they are

9
00:00:23 --> 00:00:26
surrounding hear from a radius of about
200 yards

10
00:00:26 --> 00:00:30
their job is to keep the public away and
intervene if anything gets out of hand

11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
so this is the venue this is the set for
the challenge that I&#39;ve set myself and

12
00:00:33 --> 00:00:37
I&#39;ve been working on secretly for the
last couple of weeks which is this under

13
00:00:37 --> 00:00:41
the guise of a motivational seminar in
which I teach my skills to a group of

14
00:00:41 --> 00:00:46
middle management business men and women
can I get any of them to steal 100,000

15
00:00:46 --> 00:00:49
pounds in what they believe is a genuine
armed robbery

16
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
that&#39;s the show this is the heist

17
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
yeah

18
00:00:55 --> 00:01:04
history is littered with examples of
normal people being persuaded to act in

19
00:01:04 --> 00:01:06
deviant criminal or irrational ways

20
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
how do you persuade someone to do
something they would not normally be

21
00:01:09 --> 00:01:12
prepared to do some people might think
of hypnosis

22
00:01:12 --> 00:01:15
however hypnosis isn&#39;t really what it
appears to be it&#39;s only a kind of

23
00:01:15 --> 00:01:18
play-acting and no one would carry out
an instruction to really commit a

24
00:01:18 --> 00:01:21
robbery any more than they&#39;d murder
someone if they were told to some real

25
00:01:21 --> 00:01:25
task is to insidiously massive certain
ideas and mental states into these

26
00:01:25 --> 00:01:27
people without ever mentioning a robbery

27
00:01:27 --> 00:01:30
so that hopefully when the time comes
they were just spontaneously of their

28
00:01:30 --> 00:01:33
own free will just decide to do it and
that journey starts at a rather

29
00:01:33 --> 00:01:42
comfortable hotel in hard future 13
delegates were invited to an intimate

30
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
seminar so apparently learned some of my
skills they were amongst the first to

31
00:01:46 --> 00:01:50
answer ads placed in the press and also
to fulfilled certain criteria they had

32
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
to be open responsive types who I felt
would respond reasonable to my

33
00:01:53 --> 00:01:57
techniques have no criminal record and
fall into a typical middle management

34
00:01:57 --> 00:01:58
income bracket or above

35
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
they also have to be deemed
psychologically robust enough by an

36
00:02:01 --> 00:02:05
independent psychologist to take part in
the show and at the end of the show the

37
00:02:05 --> 00:02:09
opportunity to commit the robbery will
be offered separately and individually

38
00:02:09 --> 00:02:10
to just four of the delegates

39
00:02:10 --> 00:02:14
so i have to decide which for will be
the most likely to take the bait and i

40
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
have done motivational

41
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
seminars before in the past I delivered
them myself and painted and I put I&#39;ll

42
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
be able to pick up something from being
in close proximity to some money so

43
00:02:23 --> 00:02:24
talented

44
00:02:24 --> 00:02:27
I&#39;m intrigued by him i&#39;m very intrigued
as to how he does what he does

45
00:02:27 --> 00:02:31
the way to manage the influence people
and use the power of suggestion to get

46
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
people to do what he wants to be very
useful in my job have absolutely no

47
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
they&#39;ve arrived the evening before the
seminar to have time to relax and have

48
00:02:37 --> 00:02:37
dinner

49
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
they are aware that everything is being
filmed but they&#39;re unaware that i&#39;m also

50
00:02:40 --> 00:02:40
present

51
00:02:40 --> 00:02:44
watching from an upstairs room to see
how they interact to get off the process

52
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
of getting to know them and to amplify
their behaviour a little i introduce a

53
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
couple of elements to see how they react
to Authority

54
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
firstly an actor playing an irritating
security guard hassles them on their way

55
00:02:52 --> 00:02:53
into dinner

56
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
the antagonism that some of these people
will feel towards the security guard

57
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
dressed in green will become an
important part of the jigsaw puzzle

58
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
right at the end of the journey

59
00:03:02 --> 00:03:05
enjoy

60
00:03:05 --> 00:03:10
Derren Brown is expected to be done did
you see when Darren did the zombie

61
00:03:10 --> 00:03:14
shooting out yeah I thought that&#39;s from
a balanced about extreme would like it

62
00:03:14 --> 00:03:18
to get as they enjoy their lavish meal
and start to really relax

63
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
they&#39;re unaware that another actor
playing the maitre d will present them

64
00:03:21 --> 00:03:24
with an unexpected bill after dinner and
drinks

65
00:03:24 --> 00:03:28
I want to see how they react who
complies who gets angry and who emerges

66
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
is the alpha male or female of the group
and takes charge

67
00:03:31 --> 00:03:36
so anything that cards with the means of
payment if it&#39;s if it&#39;s in your room

68
00:03:36 --> 00:03:41
will be possible because it is we prefer
to settle this tonight for the meal the

69
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
bells the bells are a few people don&#39;t
seem to have not been aware of the fact

70
00:03:45 --> 00:03:48
that the accommodation is the
combination is paid for

71
00:03:48 --> 00:03:51
I&#39;m still hungry still hungry

72
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
where&#39;s the cream I&#39;m very sorry about
you should have said at the time they

73
00:03:54 --> 00:03:56
have to pay for you consumed sorry

74
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
have you got your paint already so I
forgot my name is ready yes and it&#39;s my

75
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
counter

76
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
the everything you&#39;ve got your card in
your bedroom or you could not send quiet

77
00:04:05 --> 00:04:09
mountain get much on well I love you get
a product that would be like me . if

78
00:04:09 --> 00:04:09
it&#39;s embarrassing

79
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
I understand it&#39;s a bit of a surprise to
some of you if you can use it without

80
00:04:12 --> 00:04:18
Batman to go with all of that right okay
thank you very much

81
00:04:18 --> 00:04:29
this book says the tent up for our 13
businessmen and women have been told

82
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
little about the show other than they
will be taking part in a seminar to

83
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
learn my skills and that there will be
follow-up filming for some of them

84
00:04:35 --> 00:04:39
i&#39;m going to teach them some genuine
skills that i use peppered with some

85
00:04:39 --> 00:04:42
sperience pop psychology and quite a lot
of bullshit

86
00:04:42 --> 00:04:43
agreed

87
00:04:43 --> 00:04:48
screen to my real aim is to start to
focus them unconsciously on the idea of

88
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
stealing while convincing them that
they&#39;re learning real skills to keep

89
00:04:51 --> 00:04:52
them responsive and hungry

90
00:04:52 --> 00:04:53
morning

91
00:04:53 --> 00:04:58
hello welcome to the seminar and this is
a first for me so i hope you will get a

92
00:04:58 --> 00:04:59
lot out of it should be fun

93
00:04:59 --> 00:05:03
ok so my master let&#39;s have a look at
what we&#39;re going to learn take away with

94
00:05:03 --> 00:05:03
us today

95
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
there is no way I am going to show even
for fun

96
00:05:06 --> 00:05:11
even for a laugh that shoplifting should
be done or condone my task over the next

97
00:05:11 --> 00:05:14
two weeks is to see if I can influence a
group of middle management business men

98
00:05:14 --> 00:05:17
and women to steal 100,000 pounds in an
armed robbery

99
00:05:17 --> 00:05:21
the process begins with a motivational
seminar I have five hours to plant the

100
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
seeds that will lead to the heist

101
00:05:23 --> 00:05:26
along the way there are various levels
at which I&#39;m working make yourself feel

102
00:05:26 --> 00:05:30
Colton&#39;s about something simply by
playing to the natural suggestibility i

103
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
encourage them to believe that hypnosis
is a real tool which i&#39;m using to cement

104
00:05:34 --> 00:05:38
their new skills their belief that i
might be secretly hypnotizing that makes

105
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
them feel that they are learning more
which is a trick employed by many

106
00:05:40 --> 00:05:41
speakers in this industry

107
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
can you feel it on one level I&#39;m
teaching them useful skills they&#39;ll go

108
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
away with a basic understanding of how
to read people&#39;s unconscious cues

109
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
you can tell from the movement of the
eyes whether or not somebody is making

110
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
an image in the head of something that&#39;s
happened they&#39;re remembering an image or

111
00:05:53 --> 00:05:56
whether they&#39;re making something up with
your mother&#39;s maiden name

112
00:05:56 --> 00:06:00
Edwards thank you little look up there
and to the right

113
00:06:00 --> 00:06:02
don&#39;t believe a word of it last year
against the Pentagon thank you I&#39;m

114
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
saying it&#39;s the sand here

115
00:06:03 --> 00:06:05

119
00:06:14 --> 00:06:21
thing that worked up right my friend out
of her for me out i was doing that the

120
00:06:21 --> 00:06:24
corn in the hand trick and actually
getting nine ten times in a row and I

121
00:06:24 --> 00:06:27
wouldn&#39;t tell that was done and it is
she was so utterly vexed by it was great

122
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
also I show them how to use certain
language patterns to change people&#39;s

123
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
behavior and Confused addresses on the
street at the wall outside my house

124
00:06:33 --> 00:06:38
isn&#39;t for high and of course if someone
says that to your action is to just look

125
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
move wall

126
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
I also show them powerful memory
techniques in one exercise i have them

127
00:06:44 --> 00:06:45
pull out 20 words around

later I can still me and that&#39;s
something that I could never have done

laughter radio comes next the most i

145
00:08:19 --> 00:08:25
while though for things knowledge
attitude skills and habits now on a

146
00:08:25 --> 00:08:25
second level

147
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
i&#39;m using metaphorical language to
implant important pieces of the jigsaw

148
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
puzzle connected with stealing and a
romanticized view of criminality

149
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
throughout the seminar people&#39;s guard
those things that seem very kind of

150
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
intimidating and it an imperative that
people put up

151
00:08:36 --> 00:08:40
it takes nothing it can be effortless
just to move those guards out the way

152
00:08:40 --> 00:08:44
and take this sort of loyal out of kind
of opportunities and skills and and

153
00:08:44 --> 00:08:50
stretches that they have out to you
write scripts that anchoring that&#39;s

154
00:08:50 --> 00:08:50
great

155
00:08:50 --> 00:08:56
anchoring is stealing and emotion
stealing a response importantly and on

156
00:08:56 --> 00:09:00
the third level i introduced the idea of
triggering emotional states

157
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
this will be of central importance to
the persuasion process

158
00:09:03 --> 00:09:07
I tell them to remember times when they
felt highly motivated and then to

159
00:09:07 --> 00:09:08
amplify the feeling

160
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
can you feel it amplifies as it goes
around each time it goes around it

161
00:09:10 --> 00:09:13
boosts you and you get the feeling more
and more and then attach it to the

162
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
trigger of rubbing their legs hold that
feeling is your populate keep the

163
00:09:16 --> 00:09:17
feeling there getting stronger

164
00:09:17 --> 00:09:20
that&#39;s after a few repetitions they can
create the motivated state on command

165
00:09:20 --> 00:09:22
just by rubbing and the more they do it

166
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
the stronger the Association becomes all
adverts do this is classic staff

167
00:09:25 --> 00:09:29
it&#39;s show you sexy sexy people make
those images bigger brighter closer

168
00:09:29 --> 00:09:30
bring you into it that sort of thing

169
00:09:30 --> 00:09:35
elicit the emotion that would like you
to attach this product got that feeling

170
00:09:35 --> 00:09:38
that great and there&#39;s a product name
and it goes away

171
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
that&#39;s an anchor gonna give you gifts

172
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
he will be of use later on at work now
but these will represent something

173
00:09:43 --> 00:09:44
important to you to thank you very much

174
00:09:44 --> 00:09:48
I give them a realistic toy gun each -
apparently symbolize their new rollers

175
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
thought criminals for of the subjects
will need these guns in a couple of

176
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
weeks

177
00:09:53 --> 00:09:57
I also give them a CD each which I say
contains subliminal messages they must

178
00:09:57 --> 00:09:58
listen to every day

179
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
their belief that i can influence them
without them being aware of it is vital

180
00:10:01 --> 00:10:04
to the process the cds are in fact blank

181
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
they&#39;re all pretty similar but are
loaded on your iPod

182
00:10:07 --> 00:10:11
yes you are oh yes yes absolutely

183
00:10:11 --> 00:10:16
put on your rifle I want to do now with
it was just a consolidation kind of

184
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
exercise before you get

185
00:10:19 --> 00:10:23
in the style of such seminars we finish
with a group visualization here I shift

186
00:10:23 --> 00:10:26
the focus of the seminar towards
motivation an attitude of just do it and

187
00:10:26 --> 00:10:29
reiterate the language of criminality
but a toddler just see something wants

188
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
it and goes and gets it nothing kind of
stands in his way there&#39;s just that

189
00:10:32 --> 00:10:37
sense of just do it just get it and it&#39;s
like a green light that just says go

190
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
just do it I also transfer the rubbing
leg trigger across to a piece of music

191
00:10:41 --> 00:10:42
during the feeling back

192
00:10:42 --> 00:10:51
the guy whenever you hear that music in
your head you can just go through so the

193
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
practice that a few times and then I
know that just by playing that piece of

194
00:10:53 --> 00:10:53
music

195
00:10:53 --> 00:10:56
can you feel it by the Jackson 5 that it
will trigger a very motivational state

196
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
in them and then much of the process to
come will have to do with manipulating

197
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
that association for my real agenda but
for now the piece of music and the color

198
00:11:02 --> 00:11:06
green and that do it frays are all very
powerful triggers for them

199
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
what I&#39;d like you to do after be done
this we finished here you&#39;re going to go

200
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
off and that&#39;s the part a little way
down you can often have a drink

201
00:11:12 --> 00:11:16
there is a sweet shop just over the road

202
00:11:16 --> 00:11:21
I want you to go to steal a cup of sweet
bring the back to the pub - just reclaim

203
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
that very childlike attitude which is at
the heart of this is what I want you to

204
00:11:24 --> 00:11:24
do

205
00:11:24 --> 00:11:27
ok

206
00:11:27 --> 00:11:27
in the

207
00:11:27 --> 00:11:32
it was fantastic that&#39;s what I thought
about the the whole day was great it was

208
00:11:32 --> 00:11:35
probably organized and it was
wonderfully well presented definitely in

209
00:11:35 --> 00:11:39
myself I feel a lot more positive and as
I&#39;m going about just not everyday stuff

210
00:11:39 --> 00:11:40
and especially at work

211
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
I really like my toy gun it&#39;s brilliant
I get to run around my flat make

212
00:11:43 --> 00:11:47
bangbang noises it&#39;s like being 10 again
it&#39;s really good

213
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
it is that there&#39;s a bit of a puzzle
with all I mean it is a bit funny

214
00:11:50 --> 00:11:55
it&#39;s not going to make primetime TV
watching crowd of us learn a few of his

215
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
simpler tricks and and techniques

216
00:11:57 --> 00:12:03
I have to get them to cross the line
into deviant and criminal behavior but

217
00:12:03 --> 00:12:06
in a way which can be framed to sound
fun and harmless purely because an

218
00:12:06 --> 00:12:07
authority figure has told me to

219
00:12:07 --> 00:12:11
will they make the decision to walk into
the shop steel goods and frame it as a

220
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
positive experience for themselves

221
00:12:13 --> 00:12:17
i&#39;m watching the action through hidden
cameras installed in the news agents

222
00:12:17 --> 00:12:18
across the road

223
00:12:18 --> 00:12:21
the shop owner is aware that were
filming but the assistance no nothing

224
00:12:21 --> 00:12:24
that wasn&#39;t thinking it was going to be
a real shot when I got in there I

225
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
realized that it wasn&#39;t as easy as we
thought it&#39;d be all the staff were

226
00:12:27 --> 00:12:28
standing right by the sweets

227
00:12:28 --> 00:12:31
we were being asked to do something
that&#39;s actually against the law

228
00:12:31 --> 00:12:34
they don&#39;t know that this is being
filmed for the show but they are aware

229
00:12:34 --> 00:12:37
that they may be caught on the shop
security cameras and the what they&#39;re

230
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
doing is illegal

231
00:12:40 --> 00:12:43
thank you

232
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
ok

233
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
yeah

234
00:12:48 --> 00:13:00
a lot of you will find else

235
00:13:00 --> 00:13:08
my initial reaction when i came back
into the pub was actually euphoria that

236
00:13:08 --> 00:13:12
was like the woman and one got six
numbers on the lottery she was so hyper

237
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
and high about it and proud of herself

238
00:13:14 --> 00:13:16
I think that&#39;s something that I hope
will actually start with me because i

239
00:13:16 --> 00:13:19
think i could probably do with taking a
few more risks in life

240
00:13:19 --> 00:13:22
yeah

241
00:13:22 --> 00:13:25
yeah

242
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
hey

243
00:13:28 --> 00:13:35
yeah I felt really good acts like it&#39;s
bad to say I felt and I know obviously

244
00:13:35 --> 00:13:39
stealing&#39;s wrong and that&#39;s what I&#39;m
gonna psyche camera stealing is wrong

245
00:13:39 --> 00:13:44
I have a young daughter a teenage
daughter and there is no way I am going

246
00:13:44 --> 00:13:45
to show even for fun

247
00:13:45 --> 00:13:49
even for a laugh that shotgun or
condoned German explain that was be

248
00:13:49 --> 00:13:54
taking us back to our in a child and by
taking me back to my inner child I had

249
00:13:54 --> 00:13:55
the opposite effect

250
00:13:55 --> 00:13:59
and remember this and what it put the
fear of god in me really in terms of the

251
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
repercussions of there&#39;s no way I was
going to steal anything from the shop

252
00:14:02 --> 00:14:06
I didn&#39;t feel guilty which would
normally on a thought I would have done

253
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
but no not at all

254
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
pictures pictures that reflect anything
much character

255
00:14:11 --> 00:14:24
yeah

256
00:14:24 --> 00:14:29
yeah just in time it takes for us to go
like my soup

257
00:14:29 --> 00:14:32
one of the things I remember that Darren
said was if you do something with enough

258
00:14:32 --> 00:14:35
confidence it will work which clearly
does for him

259
00:14:35 --> 00:14:38
not interested

260
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
whoa

261
00:14:40 --> 00:14:43
do not leave his home

262
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
yeah

263
00:14:46 --> 00:14:52
bootable coming and austin ever
wondering are sting that works for me to

264
00:14:52 --> 00:14:52
go to come in

265
00:14:52 --> 00:14:56
look at seven type A to D like a new
type of wine and then just my type

266
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
yes

267
00:14:59 --> 00:15:04
don&#39;t get me started on his back place
like this

268
00:15:04 --> 00:15:07
start

269
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
yeah and all the followers and all

270
00:15:10 --> 00:15:13
I don&#39;t bother with porcupine bubble is
important

271
00:15:13 --> 00:15:22
these stores are probably 30 sharp or
email us the forefront and others

272
00:15:22 --> 00:15:26
now they&#39;re all in suits up there&#39;s
something going on the muscles i asked

273
00:15:26 --> 00:15:26
it was a little

274
00:15:26 --> 00:15:29
they&#39;re coming up that included a grab
for me

275
00:15:29 --> 00:15:32
look

276
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
let me just find businesses

277
00:15:36 --> 00:15:41
you ready to fuck . it

278
00:15:41 --> 00:15:47
I felt it&#39;s been a failure actually go
ahead and done it so out of the 13

279
00:15:47 --> 00:15:50
people that attended the seminar I&#39;ve
decided to eliminate four of them have

280
00:15:50 --> 00:15:51
all because he is a little too
controlling

281
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
but also mentioned that he had a
daughter and he didn&#39;t want his daughter

282
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
seeing him do anything criminal on TV
for that was fair enough

283
00:15:56 --> 00:15:59
Pam and Helen I didn&#39;t feel was suitable
to take through the highest experience

284
00:15:59 --> 00:16:04
really and sulla as well sooner had
admitted to sending out the wrong job on

285
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
their application form she isn&#39;t really
an accountant and a real job doesn&#39;t

286
00:16:07 --> 00:16:09
fall within the criteria of the show

287
00:16:09 --> 00:16:12
so those are eliminated but all the
people that do get eliminated will take

288
00:16:12 --> 00:16:16
with them a very powerful motivational
state which they can tap into as well as

289
00:16:16 --> 00:16:19
certain genuine skills that they&#39;ve
learned learned from me at the seminar

290
00:16:19 --> 00:16:22
so those are gone but there are nine
people left

291
00:16:22 --> 00:16:26
he&#39;s in a lot of pain back there are
nine subjects left i can only use for

292
00:16:26 --> 00:16:28
for the heist so weak after the seminar

293
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
I range to test the limits of their
responsiveness to Authority

294
00:16:31 --> 00:16:35
so a week ago I range for them to take
part in what they now think is a piece

295
00:16:35 --> 00:16:38
of unfilmed academic research at the
University and nothing to do with the

296
00:16:38 --> 00:16:38
show

297
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
supposedly looking into the effects of
punishment on learning and they believe

298
00:16:41 --> 00:16:44
now that this is part of their growth in
fact it was a reenactment of a powerful

299
00:16:44 --> 00:16:49
experiment conducted by stanley milgram
in 1963 to look at how normal people can

300
00:16:49 --> 00:16:53
commit at rocha sacks simply because
they&#39;re following orders Milgram&#39;s

301
00:16:53 --> 00:16:57
parents were jewish refugees in world
war two and his pioneering work speaks

302
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
volumes about the nature of
responsibility

303
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
it&#39;s being filmed with covert cameras

304
00:17:02 --> 00:17:08
thank you for women they are introduced
to an actor pretending to be another

305
00:17:08 --> 00:17:09
participant

306
00:17:09 --> 00:17:13
you didn&#39;t come from the same room no no
no you don&#39;t know just enough we don&#39;t

307
00:17:13 --> 00:17:16
actually know how punishment effects
learning

308
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
after a brief introduction are subject
to tricked into thinking they have

309
00:17:19 --> 00:17:23
chosen their role as teachers in the
experiment and if you just tell me what

310
00:17:23 --> 00:17:30
your positions are none of them teaching
learning our subjects observe the

311
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
learner being instructed by the
scientists who is just another actor

312
00:17:33 --> 00:17:38
this electrode is connected to a
generator in the second room with the

313
00:17:38 --> 00:17:38
teacher

314
00:17:38 --> 00:17:41
okay just make sure that we have a good
contact with the skin and so it doesn&#39;t

315
00:17:41 --> 00:17:44
cause any string of burning except
comfortable

316
00:17:44 --> 00:17:49
that&#39;s okay can we just play structure
of just to avoid avoid any excess

317
00:17:49 --> 00:17:49
movement

318
00:17:49 --> 00:17:53
there&#39;s on too tight and that&#39;s okay
that the teacher will read out some word

319
00:17:53 --> 00:17:57
pens - you blew the learner is told he
is going to be asked a series of memory

320
00:17:57 --> 00:18:01
questions by the teacher he will have to
read pairs and then correctly remember

321
00:18:01 --> 00:18:06
them when offered multiple choices and
sing credit will receive another shop

322
00:18:06 --> 00:18:11
the teacher is then taken next door and
show the generator which ranges from 15

323
00:18:11 --> 00:18:16
volts all the way up to a lethal 450
volts the domestic electricity supply in

324
00:18:16 --> 00:18:18
the UK is of course 240 volts

325
00:18:18 --> 00:18:22
our teachers are given the list of
questions and told to increase the

326
00:18:22 --> 00:18:22
voltage

327
00:18:22 --> 00:18:26
each time the learner gets a question
wrongs they are then given an example of

328
00:18:26 --> 00:18:30
a low voltage shock and try and estimate
in faults

329
00:18:30 --> 00:18:33
the man who shot between getting any

330
00:18:33 --> 00:18:37
oh you know how much that was announced

331
00:18:37 --> 00:18:40
75 it was actually 45

332
00:18:40 --> 00:18:44
oh my gosh to begin shoe horn

333
00:18:44 --> 00:18:48
steam the point of this test is to see
whether the teachers are subjects will

334
00:18:48 --> 00:18:52
call a stop to the experiment or
continue to the point where they are

335
00:18:52 --> 00:18:56
administering seemingly lethal electric
shocks to the victims simply because the

336
00:18:56 --> 00:18:58
scientist is telling them to

337
00:18:58 --> 00:19:01
that&#39;s correct

338
00:19:01 --> 00:19:07
the next wed bicycle the options tire
race helmet shorts

339
00:19:07 --> 00:19:10
that&#39;s incorrect

340
00:19:10 --> 00:19:13
it&#39;ll be a hundred and twenty votes

341
00:19:13 --> 00:19:24
I don&#39;t want to disable if you continue
this tradition there is not a hand

342
00:19:24 --> 00:19:26
anymore

343
00:19:26 --> 00:19:33
requires you to continue yea even side i
don&#39;t think i&#39;m gonna do anymore

344
00:19:33 --> 00:19:37
correct

345
00:19:37 --> 00:19:41
that&#39;s according to plan our accomplice
provided many wrong answers

346
00:19:41 --> 00:19:44
each protest was coordinated to a
particular shock voltage on the

347
00:19:44 --> 00:19:48
generator and his responses were played
virus CD that&#39;s wrong hundred fifty

348
00:19:48 --> 00:19:54
volts the correct the correct answers

349
00:19:54 --> 00:19:58
captain shoe cup

350
00:19:58 --> 00:20:01
that&#39;s wrong

351
00:20:01 --> 00:20:04
- engine 25 volts

352
00:20:04 --> 00:20:07
yeah

353
00:20:07 --> 00:20:10
he&#39;s in a lot of pain

354
00:20:10 --> 00:20:13
continue please that he&#39;s not he&#39;s not
comfortable

355
00:20:13 --> 00:20:17
we must continue to be in the experiment
with the lights a lot has to go until

356
00:20:17 --> 00:20:21
he&#39;s learned the words credit ok

357
00:20:21 --> 00:20:24
forest

358
00:20:24 --> 00:20:27
that&#39;s wrong 240 volts

359
00:20:27 --> 00:20:32
are you sure this is not causing any
lasting damage he sounds like he&#39;s in a

360
00:20:32 --> 00:20:33
lot of pain

361
00:20:33 --> 00:20:36
well it stopped smoking they&#39;re not home
what does that mean though they&#39;re not

362
00:20:36 --> 00:20:37
harmful

363
00:20:37 --> 00:20:40
sorry i&#39;m not i&#39;m not getting you when
you say that they might be painful not

364
00:20:40 --> 00:20:42
harmful the tools no long-term damage

365
00:20:42 --> 00:20:46
ok so what does that mean that doesn&#39;t
have any scars causes no damage

366
00:20:46 --> 00:20:50
it seems very that&#39;s it is very cold and
calculated to make this doesn&#39;t seem

367
00:20:50 --> 00:20:51
like a very anyway

368
00:20:51 --> 00:20:54
good golden

369
00:20:54 --> 00:20:58
that&#39;s wrong man

370
00:20:58 --> 00:21:14
300 volts staple the options diet

371
00:21:14 --> 00:21:17
ja balcony bowl

372
00:21:17 --> 00:21:20
I&#39;m gonna do

373
00:21:20 --> 00:21:20
ok

374
00:21:20 --> 00:21:26
learn it doesn&#39;t answer a reasonable
time 24 25 seconds and you have to treat

375
00:21:26 --> 00:21:28
the answer is wrong and follow that
procedure

376
00:21:28 --> 00:21:34
did you hear that liner just any
response may come on

377
00:21:34 --> 00:21:39
while guess please continue

378
00:21:39 --> 00:21:44
300 for advice politics you still with
me I&#39;m sorry that I can&#39;t do this

379
00:21:44 --> 00:21:44
honestly

380
00:21:44 --> 00:21:48
can we stop this experiment because I
can&#39;t do this this is my fight continued

381
00:21:48 --> 00:21:54
will have to just continue the
experiment and yeah I&#39;m fine that&#39;s fine

382
00:21:54 --> 00:21:57
i&#39;m not going to do this

383
00:21:57 --> 00:22:01
he correct for London 5 volts

384
00:22:01 --> 00:22:04
and

385
00:22:04 --> 00:22:08
sorry I didn&#39;t it is someone will check
ins this is not making noise now he was

386
00:22:08 --> 00:22:08
before him

387
00:22:08 --> 00:22:11
I&#39;m going to go on but just a little bit
worried about you would continue

388
00:22:11 --> 00:22:17
there is a bit worried because used that
you it was like complaining for about

389
00:22:17 --> 00:22:24
that but no harm no harm will come to AZ
is not making noise now it&#39;s essential

390
00:22:24 --> 00:22:27
we continue with the experiment

391
00:22:27 --> 00:22:29
yeah

392
00:22:29 --> 00:22:36
balcony incorrect 450 volts

393
00:22:36 --> 00:22:39
you promised he&#39;s not even in the
morning please continue the procedure

394
00:22:39 --> 00:22:44
that you use it hurts but it isn&#39;t
because it&#39;s like it says that dangerous

395
00:22:44 --> 00:22:47
the National we&#39;ll be right there

396
00:22:47 --> 00:22:50
please continue

397
00:22:50 --> 00:22:57
ok I think this continue the experiment
they&#39;re all of the subjects were told

398
00:22:57 --> 00:23:00
the true nature of the experiment was to
see how they would respond to Authority

399
00:23:00 --> 00:23:06
and it would eventually form part of the
show is again i can tell you that is

400
00:23:06 --> 00:23:13
absolutely fire you actually were not
administering electric shop tall and is

401
00:23:13 --> 00:23:20
not in the original Milgram experiment

402
00:23:20 --> 00:23:23
psychologists were asked to predict how
many people would continue to the point

403
00:23:23 --> 00:23:26
that they were administering the highest
shock on the board their prediction was

404
00:23:26 --> 00:23:28
one tenth of one percent

405
00:23:28 --> 00:23:30
they were wrong

406
00:23:30 --> 00:23:33
the results of our experiments were
almost identical to the original

407
00:23:33 --> 00:23:37
over fifty percent of participants
continued up to 450 volts

408
00:23:37 --> 00:23:41
the majority of people will administer
lethal electric shocks just because a

409
00:23:41 --> 00:23:47
guy in a white coat is telling them to
450 volts 450 volts fortune 50 volts 50

410
00:23:47 --> 00:23:50
so after the result of the Milgram
experiment i&#39;m now chosen my four

411
00:23:50 --> 00:23:54
subjects that will go forward for the
heist a lot of balls and phil was

412
00:23:54 --> 00:23:57
impressively resourceful when he was
caught stealing sweet and held in his

413
00:23:57 --> 00:24:00
anguish during the milder than defy the
scientists i did want to include a woman

414
00:24:00 --> 00:24:00
in the group

415
00:24:00 --> 00:24:03
Jen was the only subject to take a long
time to recover after the Milgram

416
00:24:03 --> 00:24:05
experiment so I felt I shouldn&#39;t use her

417
00:24:05 --> 00:24:10
Veronica didn&#39;t steal from the shop so
that left Vicky of all the subjects she

418
00:24:10 --> 00:24:13
was the only one to have known the
original Milgram experiment and call a

419
00:24:13 --> 00:24:14
halt to her involvement in it

420
00:24:14 --> 00:24:20
can I just say I can&#39;t do this because
I&#39;ve heard of this experiment before I

421
00:24:20 --> 00:24:23
think should be quite interesting to use
although I I don&#39;t have to actually take

422
00:24:23 --> 00:24:26
the bait or not a least almost from the
shop

423
00:24:26 --> 00:24:29
seems to be highly responsive most
outgoing and see most happy to continue

424
00:24:29 --> 00:24:33
the experiment until he was stopped
washing it made more notches on the

425
00:24:33 --> 00:24:33
thing

426
00:24:33 --> 00:24:37
Danny stop the experiment that in such
an outspoken way that I suspected he

427
00:24:37 --> 00:24:39
would have real strength of character to
bring out

428
00:24:39 --> 00:24:41
that&#39;s not even reacting anymore

429
00:24:41 --> 00:24:47
so this now brings them all up to you
yesterday afternoon and there are a

430
00:24:47 --> 00:24:50
couple more pieces of the jigsaw puzzle
i need to put into place

431
00:24:50 --> 00:24:53
the motivated state in itself isn&#39;t
quite enough so i need to turn it a

432
00:24:53 --> 00:24:56
little more aggressive for them but
without ring any alarm bells

433
00:24:56 --> 00:25:00
so I have them create a feeling of
aggression and attach it to the trigger

434
00:25:00 --> 00:25:03
of a squeezed fist you take hold of it
in that hand and you anchor it to that

435
00:25:03 --> 00:25:05
feeling at that hand just they&#39;re
squeezing as you take all that

436
00:25:05 --> 00:25:08
aggression as you move that around and
around inside of is it doubles and

437
00:25:08 --> 00:25:11
triples and moves around inside of your
building up that feeling and then I have

438
00:25:11 --> 00:25:14
them trigger off the motivated state by
rubbing the leg at the same time to

439
00:25:14 --> 00:25:17
combine both states together that you
are linking these powerful and extremely

440
00:25:17 --> 00:25:18
together good

441
00:25:18 --> 00:25:21
they try this a couple of times and are
now able to tap into a darker state and

442
00:25:21 --> 00:25:23
they still feel this is entirely for
their benefit

443
00:25:23 --> 00:25:27
this is your most powerful state that
you as a human being can achieve

444
00:25:27 --> 00:25:30
that&#39;s what it does that&#39;s what the
music does that&#39;s what the words do

445
00:25:30 --> 00:25:33
that&#39;s what the that green intensity
does all of those things that are

446
00:25:33 --> 00:25:34
triggering this off

447
00:25:34 --> 00:25:41
that&#39;s what you get how&#39;s that meant
good

448
00:25:41 --> 00:25:45
before the heist itself one last piece
of the puzzle

449
00:25:45 --> 00:25:48
they need to believe they have it within
them to overpower a security guard and

450
00:25:48 --> 00:25:51
to know what to say and how to say it
without thinking about it

451
00:25:51 --> 00:25:54
so without ever mentioning security
guards I teach the money so tarik

452
00:25:54 --> 00:25:58
martial arts exercise where a person can
be pushed over using the power of Chi

453
00:25:58 --> 00:26:01
you two gonna find yourself being pushed
over

454
00:26:01 --> 00:26:04
not backwards being forced off your feet

455
00:26:04 --> 00:26:07
this will serve as a powerful experience
for them a resource for them to draw

456
00:26:07 --> 00:26:10
from tomorrow when they come across our
security guard in the city landfill

457
00:26:10 --> 00:26:12
they can feel what you&#39;re going to do is
when I tell you to you&#39;re going to start

458
00:26:12 --> 00:26:15
to create that state inside of yourself
and you build it to a peak when you

459
00:26:15 --> 00:26:20
reach that peak the instruction i want
you to give it just the words down on

460
00:26:20 --> 00:26:23
the floor just those words alone they&#39;re
going to carry the full weight of of

461
00:26:23 --> 00:26:26
that emotional state was behind it I get
it now just get into that state just

462
00:26:26 --> 00:26:29
start to build up inside of you now

463
00:26:29 --> 00:26:32
more

464
00:26:32 --> 00:26:36
mmm

465
00:26:36 --> 00:26:42
when you feel that peak just say those
words down on the floor now that&#39;s what

466
00:26:42 --> 00:26:46
you say and you keep it focused and you
push and you push those two back down an

467
00:26:46 --> 00:26:47
alley try not to let it push you over

468
00:26:47 --> 00:27:00
keep pushing back against it just
pushing down on the floor now of course

469
00:27:00 --> 00:27:02
it&#39;s not cheesy or energy at all

470
00:27:02 --> 00:27:06
in reality the person expecting to fall
over succumbs to the suggestion and

471
00:27:06 --> 00:27:10
topples off balance but the people
apparently pushing come to believe that

472
00:27:10 --> 00:27:15
they have a powerful and invincible
state to tap into down on the floor

473
00:27:15 --> 00:27:20
that&#39;s what i wanted to believe I
thought very tense

474
00:27:20 --> 00:27:24
it&#39;s almost as if I could physically
push him without actually touching

475
00:27:24 --> 00:27:29
saying right down on the floor was like
passing the energy across like that like

476
00:27:29 --> 00:27:31
throwing it throwing some fun and what I
felt was just this sort of invisible

477
00:27:31 --> 00:27:36
energy just it you know it was a really
it sort of just it just sort of crashed

478
00:27:36 --> 00:27:37
against my chest

479
00:27:37 --> 00:27:40
you followed every aspect of the
persuasion process from the last couple

480
00:27:40 --> 00:27:40
of weeks

481
00:27:40 --> 00:27:43
a certain phrases certain color certain
piece of music have been used to induce

482
00:27:43 --> 00:27:47
a state of Washington recklessness and
aggression and just do it attitude other

483
00:27:47 --> 00:27:50
factors also support the process the
titles on the screen in the language

484
00:27:50 --> 00:27:54
used at the seminar the supposedly
subliminal cds which left them feeling

485
00:27:54 --> 00:27:58
malleable the toy plastic gun which
romanticizes the idea of a criminal The

486
00:27:58 --> 00:27:59
Green security man

487
00:27:59 --> 00:28:03
the animosity felt water security man in
a green uniform already who happened to

488
00:28:03 --> 00:28:05
be wearing the same badge is our God in
the street

489
00:28:05 --> 00:28:08
finally the oil painting of a security
van hidden on the wall of the seminar

490
00:28:08 --> 00:28:11
everything should now be in place

491
00:28:11 --> 00:28:14
so if you missed the start of the show
this is Gretchen street in the city of

492
00:28:14 --> 00:28:17
london the bank of england is just down
there we have a fake security van a fake

493
00:28:17 --> 00:28:20
security guard and a hundred thousand
pounds of real money

494
00:28:20 --> 00:28:23
there are 15 cameras watching this area

495
00:28:23 --> 00:28:26
we have no idea what&#39;s going to happen
or if anything&#39;s going to happen we just

496
00:28:26 --> 00:28:28
hope to cover it as best as we can

497
00:28:28 --> 00:28:32
you have followed every aspect of the
persuasion process that so far nothing

498
00:28:32 --> 00:28:35
has been added or taken away is the
linking of certain emotional states

499
00:28:35 --> 00:28:38
I just certain triggers piece of music
color certain words and so on our

500
00:28:38 --> 00:28:41
participants have no idea that they&#39;re
going to be filmed all that anything has

501
00:28:41 --> 00:28:43
been set up and we go to what they&#39;re
going to do this is nothing we&#39;ve been

502
00:28:43 --> 00:28:46
able to rehearse and if it doesn&#39;t work
we will just show it to you not working

503
00:28:46 --> 00:28:49
four times in a row and there&#39;s really
no way of knowing

504
00:28:49 --> 00:28:52
see

505
00:28:52 --> 00:28:56
this whole area has been cordoned off
from the public and is being supervised

506
00:28:56 --> 00:29:00
by the police are four subjects have
been told to expect a phone call and

507
00:29:00 --> 00:29:03
they&#39;ll have to travel into the city of
london for final motivational session

508
00:29:03 --> 00:29:07
hey day is Darren hello I just gotta

last bit by yourself

512
00:29:16 --> 00:29:20
as with every day in as I say time and
time again this is about every day

513
00:29:20 --> 00:29:24
finding some opportunity to experience
something that makes you feel great and

514
00:29:24 --> 00:29:28
exhilarated yes yet make that decision
to steel yourself and grab the

515
00:29:28 --> 00:29:30
opportunity to make this work really
really pay off

516
00:29:30 --> 00:29:33
it&#39;s just about standing in the face of
security in life isn&#39;t making you do

517
00:29:33 --> 00:29:37
what you want to do because also expose
all of this is about you knowing you&#39;re

518
00:29:37 --> 00:29:41
the one with the weapon of absolute .
aggressive unquestioning power

519
00:29:41 --> 00:29:44

582
00:33:20 --> 00:33:21
ok

583
00:33:21 --> 00:33:24
ok

584
00:33:24 --> 00:33:24
you

585
00:33:24 --> 00:33:27
the life

586
00:33:27 --> 00:33:30
stealing sweets is one thing with
stealing boxes of money from the bank of

587
00:33:30 --> 00:33:32
england is a completely different kind
of fish

588
00:33:32 --> 00:33:35
I&#39;m a good person that I&#39;m a good person

589
00:33:35 --> 00:33:36
don&#39;t understand

590
00:33:36 --> 00:33:39
I to put yourself on that bed there for
like this

591
00:33:39 --> 00:33:39
ok

592
00:33:39 --> 00:33:42
close your eyes fully

593
00:33:42 --> 00:33:47
as you start to undo the aggression or
as you start to undo those aspects of it

594
00:33:47 --> 00:33:49
that would have led you to

595
00:33:49 --> 00:33:50
hold up security

596
00:33:50 --> 00:33:53
all that goes

597
00:33:53 --> 00:33:56
absolutely

598
00:33:56 --> 00:33:58
something you can think back to

599
00:33:58 --> 00:34:01
necessary distance to just take them and
everything is good

600
00:34:01 --> 00:34:04
the last couple weeks been most fun I&#39;ve
had in ages

601
00:34:04 --> 00:34:07
it&#39;s been bringing takeaway cup sense of
power sense of achievement

602
00:34:07 --> 00:34:09
I sense that anything is possible ready

603
00:34:09 --> 00:34:13
that&#39;s the really amazing experience
something I can kind of look back on and

604
00:34:13 --> 00:34:16
think about how I was able to really
push myself and back to be able to do

605
00:34:16 --> 00:34:21
that from now on I think I realize now
that I&#39;m a lot stronger willed that I

606
00:34:21 --> 00:34:22
thought I was

607
00:34:22 --> 00:34:25
and the fact that didn&#39;t go through with
the steel itself and very pleased myself

608
00:34:25 --> 00:34:29
maybe the last couple weeks have been
absolutely roller coaster

609
00:34:29 --> 00:34:31
it&#39;s been such a positive experience and
I&#39;m going to absolutely high at the

610
00:34:31 --> 00:34:32
moment

611
00:34:32 --> 00:34:37
everything just back to normal just like
you were before except for all the good

612
00:34:37 --> 00:34:40
stuff that you want to take with you
which you&#39;ve now created and created for

613
00:34:40 --> 00:34:45
yourself and that&#39;s a way of thanking
you for everything that you&#39;ve done

614
00:34:45 --> 00:34:49
yeah

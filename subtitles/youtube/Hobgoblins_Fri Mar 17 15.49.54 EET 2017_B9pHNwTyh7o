1
00:00:19,766 --> 00:00:21,882
 (rock music)

2
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:30,645
 - Dennis.

3
00:00:30,986 --> 00:00:31,520
 Dennis!

4
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:36,567
 - Hey, what gives?

5
00:00:38,202 --> 00:00:39,988
 - You're being paid to work around here!

6
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:42,741
 Not to sit around and blast your eardrums.

7
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:44,537
 - Hey, hey, hey, take it easy.

8
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:45,534
 I can do both.

9
00:00:45,876 --> 00:00:48,583
 (phone ringing)

10
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:50,457
 (dial tone) - Hello?

11
00:00:50,797 --> 00:00:51,331
 Hello?

12
00:00:56,595 --> 00:00:58,551
 Didn't you hear the phone ringing?

13
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:00,004
 - No, I didn't.

14
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:02,965
 - [McCreedy] They've already hung up!

15
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,220
 - Well then it couldn't have been too important.

16
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:06,847
 - Don't you have any sense of responsibility?

17
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:08,895
 That could have been a very important call.

18
00:01:09,233 --> 00:01:11,019
 - [Dennis] At this hour?

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,600
 - In the future would you just answer the phone

20
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:15,106
 no matter what hour it is, and not make your own decisions

21
00:01:15,447 --> 00:01:18,359
 about what's important and what isn't?

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,110
 - Yeah, yeah, right, right.

23
00:01:20,452 --> 00:01:22,534
 - It's time for our rounds.

24
00:01:50,065 --> 00:01:52,306
 (eerie music)

25
00:02:30,022 --> 00:02:31,728
 Did I ever tell you what the studio was like

26
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:33,475
 when I first started here?

27
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:34,897
 - Yeah, more than once.

28
00:02:35,235 --> 00:02:38,272
 - Oh, it used to be one of the busiest lots in town.

29
00:02:38,613 --> 00:02:42,105
 - It's a real thriving metropolis now.

30
00:02:42,451 --> 00:02:44,237
 Hey wait a minute, what's this down here?

31
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:47,536
 - Oh, it's just an old film vault,

32
00:02:47,873 --> 00:02:48,828
 there's nothing down there.

33
00:02:49,166 --> 00:02:50,622
 - Yeah, but why don't we check it anyway?

34
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,200
 - I'm telling you there's nothing down there,

35
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:57,709
 and I'm not going to waste my time checking it out.

36
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,835
 - [Voiceover] McCreedy.

37
00:02:59,176 --> 00:02:59,961
 - What is it now?

38
00:03:00,302 --> 00:03:01,462
 - [Voiceover] I need to talk to you now.

39
00:03:01,803 --> 00:03:03,168
 - Well I can't right now.

40
00:03:03,513 --> 00:03:05,925
 - [Voiceover] Now, I mean it.

41
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:07,927
 - Finish the rounds.

42
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:10,805
 And remember what I said.

43
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:12,977
 - Whatever you say, Pops.

44
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:27,868
 (faint rock music in headphones)

45
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:42,090
 (intense music)

46
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:00,816
 - What took you so long?

47
00:04:01,154 --> 00:04:02,314
 - I made it as quickly as I could,

48
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:04,066
 I was clear across the lot.

49
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:06,649
 - You're not as young as you used to be.

50
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:08,949
 I tried calling you at the main gate before,

51
00:04:09,287 --> 00:04:11,152
 why didn't you answer the phone?

52
00:04:11,498 --> 00:04:13,614
 - I must have caught it just as you hung up.

53
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:16,826
 - Well let's be a little more efficient from now on.

54
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:19,001
 How's the new boy doing?

55
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:20,829
 - Fine, fine.

56
00:04:21,174 --> 00:04:22,334
 But I really need to get back.

57
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:25,008
 - Just a minute, I want talk to you about these

58
00:04:25,345 --> 00:04:28,087
 beer cans I found in the front gate.

59
00:04:30,392 --> 00:04:33,099
 (ominous music)

60
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,766
 - So there's nothing down here.

61
00:04:46,867 --> 00:04:49,404
 I wonder what they keep in here.

62
00:04:51,163 --> 00:04:52,744
 Yoohoo, Mr. McCreedy?

63
00:05:44,216 --> 00:05:46,457
 (growling)

64
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,810
 Is somebody there?

65
00:06:03,151 --> 00:06:05,187
 (growling)

66
00:06:13,954 --> 00:06:15,194
 Is somebody there?

67
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:19,531
 (radio static)

68
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:25,420
 - I'll give you a report in the morning.

69
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,898
 (feedback squealing)

70
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:52,322
 (crowd cheering)

71
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,945
 (rock music)

72
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:33,984
 (cries out)

73
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:41,120
 (creepy music)

74
00:08:04,648 --> 00:08:06,229
 (door slams shut)

75
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:23,451
 (eerie music)

76
00:09:38,783 --> 00:09:40,193
 - Another one quit?!

77
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,906
 What was the problem this time?

78
00:09:44,247 --> 00:09:46,158
 - I'm not sure what the problem was, sir.

79
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:48,330
 - It wasn't something you said to him, was it?

80
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:49,532
 - [McCreedy] It could have been.

81
00:09:49,878 --> 00:09:52,210
 - I'm holding you responsible for this, McCreedy.

82
00:09:52,547 --> 00:09:54,538
 Every time we hire a new guard he only lasts

83
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:57,169
 for a couple of weeks, then he's gone.

84
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,796
 How many is it now, three, four?

85
00:10:00,138 --> 00:10:02,003
 - It's three, and I really don't think

86
00:10:02,348 --> 00:10:04,213
 you need to hire anyone else.

87
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:06,345
 I can run the post myself.

88
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:08,677
 - Look, you've been here for a long time.

89
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:11,058
 You know as well as I do that we need to have

90
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,230
 a second guard ready so he can fill in for you

91
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:15,684
 if you can't make it here some night.

92
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:18,566
 - But I've never missed a night since I've been here!

93
00:10:18,907 --> 00:10:20,863
 - You're not as young as you used to be, we need

94
00:10:21,201 --> 00:10:22,281
 to be prepared.

95
00:10:22,619 --> 00:10:24,280
 Do you know that if something were to happen to this studio

96
00:10:24,621 --> 00:10:28,705
 while no one was on duty, our insurance is voided?

97
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:30,873
 - This place has been deserted for almost 30 years.

98
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:33,202
 - Stop making excuses.

99
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:36,003
 I want you to hire a new guard,

100
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:39,333
 and this time hire one who will stick around for a while.

101
00:10:39,677 --> 00:10:41,463
 Or else I'll hire two.

102
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,761
 - So, Kevin, is this the first time that you've worked

103
00:10:48,102 --> 00:10:50,058
 as a security guard?

104
00:10:50,396 --> 00:10:53,263
 - Yes sir, but I'm a very fast learner, and I promise

105
00:10:53,608 --> 00:10:55,348
 to try extra hard.

106
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:57,399
 And I really need the job.

107
00:10:59,239 --> 00:11:02,902
 - Well you sound very mature for your age.

108
00:11:03,243 --> 00:11:05,985
 You don't own one of those portable radios with headphones,

109
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:06,863
 do you?

110
00:11:07,997 --> 00:11:08,702
 - No sir.

111
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:12,873
 - That's good, I think we'll get along just fine.

112
00:11:14,128 --> 00:11:16,870
 Now, are you ready for your first tour of the lot?

113
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:20,290
 - Oh, oh yes sir, even prepared to take notes.

114
00:11:22,637 --> 00:11:24,673
 - It's not that complicated.

115
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:40,852
 You've never been on a studio lot like this before,

116
00:11:41,197 --> 00:11:42,027
 have you?

117
00:11:42,365 --> 00:11:43,354
 - No sir.

118
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,110
 - Well, it's not that difficult to keep track of.

119
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:48,193
 Now there isn't much goes on here anymore.

120
00:11:48,538 --> 00:11:49,778
 - How long have you been working here?

121
00:11:50,123 --> 00:11:52,205
 - Oh, quite a while.

122
00:11:52,542 --> 00:11:54,407
 About 30 years, actually.

123
00:11:54,752 --> 00:11:56,333
 And I've never missed a day and had to have

124
00:11:56,671 --> 00:11:58,787
 someone fill in for me.

125
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:01,214
 - 30 years, that's amazing.

126
00:12:01,551 --> 00:12:02,540
 - Well, not really.

127
00:12:02,886 --> 00:12:04,626
 You know, time becomes sort of a blur

128
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:06,962
 when you reach a certain age.

129
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:08,797
 Sometime I'll tell you what this place was like

130
00:12:09,142 --> 00:12:11,599
 when it was still a functioning studio.

131
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:14,302
 - I'd like to hear about that.

132
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:19,061
 (mysterious music)

133
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:25,320
 - Now Kevin, if I told you that something

134
00:12:25,658 --> 00:12:28,320
 was very important, you'd listen to me, wouldn't you?

135
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:29,446
 - Of course.

136
00:12:29,787 --> 00:12:30,776
 - Good.

137
00:12:31,122 --> 00:12:32,487
 Now there is a part of this lot that I want you

138
00:12:32,832 --> 00:12:34,288
 to stay away from.

139
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:37,538
 I don't want to have to explain all the details to you,

140
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:40,666
 I just want you to promise to stay clear of it.

141
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:42,543
 - I understand.

142
00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:46,547
 - Now this is the part I was telling you about.

143
00:12:50,934 --> 00:12:52,094
 - What's down there?

144
00:12:52,435 --> 00:12:54,346
 - It's just a lot of dangerous machinery.

145
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:56,518
 Now don't go in there and take the chance of injuring

146
00:12:56,856 --> 00:12:57,766
 yourself, do you understand?

147
00:12:58,733 --> 00:12:59,438
 - Yeah.

148
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:03,025
 - Good, now I don't want to have to

149
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:05,194
 remind you a second time.

150
00:13:06,658 --> 00:13:08,819
 Just stay clear of this area.

151
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:20,543
 - So is there anything else I need to be made aware of?

152
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,666
 - There is one other thing.

153
00:13:31,391 --> 00:13:33,757
 This is what I was telling you about.

154
00:13:35,228 --> 00:13:37,560
 Oh, but don't worry, I've never had to use it.

155
00:13:37,897 --> 00:13:38,886
 - Really?

156
00:13:39,232 --> 00:13:41,644
 - That's right, not in all the years I've been here.

157
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:45,693
 But I would like to show you how to use it sometime though,

158
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:49,067
 you never know when you might need it.

159
00:13:49,409 --> 00:13:51,741
 (ominous music)

160
00:14:19,814 --> 00:14:20,849
 - Hi.

161
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,351
 - Not now, your friends are here.

162
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:28,235
 - Hey, how's it going?

163
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:32,857
 - What'd you bring, some new music?

164
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:35,284
 - No, I just rented a videotape that Amy and I

165
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:36,610
 were gonna watch.

166
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:38,036
 - Well that was very nice.

167
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:40,035
 - Let me see what you got.

168
00:14:40,376 --> 00:14:41,616
 What?

169
00:14:41,961 --> 00:14:43,417
 Don't you ever get any tapes from the adult section?

170
00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:44,995
 My boyfriend would never bring me a tape

171
00:14:45,339 --> 00:14:48,001
 that didn't have at least a single X rating.

172
00:14:48,342 --> 00:14:49,582
 - Well Kevin isn't like that.

173
00:14:49,927 --> 00:14:52,714
 He would never want me to see anything that was rated X.

174
00:14:53,056 --> 00:14:53,886
 Would you?

175
00:14:54,223 --> 00:14:55,463
 - No, I wouldn't.

176
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,516
 (horn beeps)

177
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:10,903
 - Oh right man, I'd recognize that horn anywhere,

178
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,195
 that's my Nick.

179
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:13,864
 Back from two months of army training,

180
00:15:14,202 --> 00:15:16,193
 and you know what a man wants when he's been away

181
00:15:16,537 --> 00:15:18,277
 for two months.

182
00:15:18,623 --> 00:15:20,363
 - No, what does he want?

183
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:21,242
 - Woo!

184
00:15:29,842 --> 00:15:31,173
 It's been two months!

185
00:15:40,853 --> 00:15:44,471
 ♪ Whoa everybody have sex tonight

186
00:15:44,816 --> 00:15:46,352
 (laughing)

187
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:48,057
 - Wish that were our theme song.

188
00:15:48,402 --> 00:15:49,517
 - Did you say something?

189
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:50,647
 - No, no.

190
00:15:59,831 --> 00:16:02,413
 - I wanna hear about everything you did in basic training.

191
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,741
 - Well we had to get up every morning about 4 am, you know?

192
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:07,247
 - Sounds like loads of fun.

193
00:16:07,588 --> 00:16:09,624
 - Then there was calisthenics, a daily run for six miles.

194
00:16:09,966 --> 00:16:11,547
 - Oh, I bet you got really sweaty.

195
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:13,420
 - Oh, you know I did.

196
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:14,796
 After that, firing range.

197
00:16:15,138 --> 00:16:15,718
 (imitating gunfire)

198
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:17,465
 And tear gas training.

199
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:19,843
 Then there was infiltration course.

200
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:22,266
 - Big deal, I have access to a gun where I work.

201
00:16:22,603 --> 00:16:24,594
 - Yeah well it's a big difference between having

202
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:26,554
 something and knowing how to use it.

203
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:28,764
 - Would it be okay if I used your phone?

204
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,725
 - Yeah, sure.

205
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,059
 Who you gonna call?

206
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:33,440
 - My girlfriend.

207
00:16:33,781 --> 00:16:35,612
 - Hey we ever gonna get a chance to meet this girl?

208
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,197
 - Uh, I don't think so, she's kind of shy.

209
00:16:40,538 --> 00:16:42,654
 - What else did you do with the gun?

210
00:16:43,082 --> 00:16:45,494
 - Well I haven't actually had a chance to fire it yet, but--

211
00:16:45,835 --> 00:16:47,575
 - I was talking to Nick.

212
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:52,747
 - Then we had target practice.

213
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:54,798
 But I never had an actual chance to shoot anyone.

214
00:16:55,136 --> 00:16:55,670
 Yet.

215
00:16:57,263 --> 00:16:59,219
 - Shooting someone, is that real important to you?

216
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:00,675
 - Well, yeah!

217
00:17:30,379 --> 00:17:31,459
 (sultry music)

218
00:17:31,797 --> 00:17:34,163
 (phone ringing)

219
00:17:35,384 --> 00:17:37,215
 - Hi, it's me Fantasia.

220
00:17:38,763 --> 00:17:39,798
 Thanks for calling.

221
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:41,925
 I'm going to see a movie today.

222
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:44,382
 It's only rated PG.

223
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:48,185
 I want you to show up and make it rated X.

224
00:17:48,522 --> 00:17:51,764
 Sneak in the rear door and when the lights go down,

225
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:55,272
 drop your pants and show me a full moon.

226
00:17:55,655 --> 00:17:59,364
 Wave that lunar eclipse and block the projection beam.

227
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:04,702
 Next, pull me down and roll me on those sticky floors.

228
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,657
 Lick that artificial butter flavor off my body.

229
00:18:09,585 --> 00:18:10,574
 Hold, please.

230
00:18:12,255 --> 00:18:15,543
 Then take my clothes and leave me naked

231
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:18,340
 so that when the lights come up, I'll be

232
00:18:18,678 --> 00:18:20,669
 the second feature.

233
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:23,550
 - You sure that's not long distance?

234
00:18:23,891 --> 00:18:24,926
 - No, it's not.

235
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,516
 - That's good.

236
00:18:27,853 --> 00:18:28,808
 Because I have to keep calling the phone company

237
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:31,558
 every month because of all these sex line calls

238
00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:33,184
 being billed to my number.

239
00:18:33,526 --> 00:18:34,436
 - Really?

240
00:18:34,777 --> 00:18:35,812
 That's too bad.

241
00:18:39,824 --> 00:18:41,234
 - Thanks for calling.

242
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:44,863
 A new adventure awaits you tomorrow.

243
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:47,365
 (dial tone)

244
00:18:55,172 --> 00:18:56,457
 - Oh yeah, and then we spend all afternoon

245
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,084
 studying hand to hand combat.

246
00:18:58,426 --> 00:19:00,166
 - I know about the techniques you have with your hands.

247
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:01,967
 Tell us about something else.

248
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:04,341
 - Yeah, could we change the subject already?

249
00:19:04,682 --> 00:19:06,673
 - Why don't you pay attention

250
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:08,349
 and maybe you'll learn something.

251
00:19:08,686 --> 00:19:10,222
 Nick is protecting our country.

252
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:12,679
 And you're just guarding some rundown deserted dump.

253
00:19:13,774 --> 00:19:15,059
 - What did you say?

254
00:19:15,401 --> 00:19:16,732
 - Why don't you be nice to Nick and maybe he'll

255
00:19:17,069 --> 00:19:18,900
 teach you something.

256
00:19:19,238 --> 00:19:20,728
 - Yeah I could teach you all about hand to hand combat,

257
00:19:21,073 --> 00:19:21,528
 with no problem.

258
00:19:21,866 --> 00:19:22,855
 - Yeah.

259
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:25,024
 - Well go on, I know you can do it.

260
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:27,610
 - Look, I said I wasn't interested, okay?

261
00:19:27,955 --> 00:19:28,489
 - Come on.

262
00:19:38,966 --> 00:19:39,876
 - You're gonna love this.

263
00:19:40,217 --> 00:19:41,423
 - I don't wanna do this.

264
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:42,876
 - Here, take this.

265
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,092
 Okay, no no no, hold it like this.

266
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:50,178
 Okay, now block every move that I make.

267
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,599
 I'm gonna take it really slow on you.

268
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:53,636
 So watch out 'cause here comes the first one!

269
00:19:53,981 --> 00:19:55,141
 - Go Kevin! Show him you can do it!

270
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:57,314
 - Go Nick, kick his butt!

271
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:02,903
 (exciting music)

272
00:20:10,664 --> 00:20:12,575
 Oh, he's getting so sweaty already.

273
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:22,423
 Yeah, go for it!

274
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:30,973
 (hits) (cries out)

275
00:21:09,223 --> 00:21:10,212
 - Ah!

276
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:48,383
 (cries out)

277
00:21:50,139 --> 00:21:51,254
 - You give up?

278
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:52,929
 - Yes!

279
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:01,684
 - My hero!

280
00:22:14,413 --> 00:22:16,654
 - You really humiliated me.

281
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:17,988
 - What?

282
00:22:18,334 --> 00:22:20,416
 I didn't even want to do this, it was your idea.

283
00:22:20,753 --> 00:22:21,959
 - I don't care whose idea it was,

284
00:22:22,296 --> 00:22:23,661
 I wanted you to win.

285
00:22:24,006 --> 00:22:25,997
 - How was I supposed to win, Amy?

286
00:22:26,342 --> 00:22:28,298
 I've never even done this before.

287
00:22:28,636 --> 00:22:30,797
 It was an unfair match.

288
00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:33,174
 - You looked really pathetic.

289
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:36,924
 - What do you want me to do for you?

290
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:39,385
 - I want you to make me proud.

291
00:22:44,735 --> 00:22:46,600
 - Come and get it!

292
00:22:46,946 --> 00:22:48,311
 - Gimme that, Nick.

293
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:55,659
 - What's the matter, Kevin?

294
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:02,083
 - It's really a long story.

295
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:05,206
 - I've got all the time in the world.

296
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:13,135
 - What do you do about someone who you can never make happy?

297
00:23:15,224 --> 00:23:18,216
 - Is this your girlfriend we're talking about?

298
00:23:20,145 --> 00:23:21,681
 I don't know what to tell you.

299
00:23:22,022 --> 00:23:23,887
 What's the exact problem?

300
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:30,228
 - Well, we've got this friend who's in the army,

301
00:23:30,573 --> 00:23:33,736
 and my girlfriend's upset because I couldn't do

302
00:23:34,076 --> 00:23:36,158
 all the things that he can.

303
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:37,738
 - I see.

304
00:23:39,164 --> 00:23:42,406
 Did I ever tell you what I did when I was in the army?

305
00:23:42,751 --> 00:23:43,786
 - No.

306
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,119
 - Oh, it's also a long story.

307
00:23:46,463 --> 00:23:48,419
 (beeping)

308
00:23:49,383 --> 00:23:50,042
 Uh-oh.

309
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,967
 Looks like we've got company.

310
00:23:54,305 --> 00:23:56,637
 (ominous music)

311
00:24:02,146 --> 00:24:03,181
 - Hey.

312
00:24:03,522 --> 00:24:04,637
 - Wait here, I'll call you if I need you.

313
00:24:04,982 --> 00:24:05,892
 - But Mr. McCreedy--

314
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:07,188
 - I said wait.

315
00:24:47,608 --> 00:24:48,643
 Oh!

316
00:24:48,984 --> 00:24:49,723
 - Shut up.

317
00:24:56,825 --> 00:24:59,282
 (intense music)

318
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:06,123
 - Get away from him.

319
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,456
 - Who's this, your grandson?

320
00:25:09,797 --> 00:25:11,333
 - No, he's my partner.

321
00:25:12,383 --> 00:25:15,625
 - I said, get away from him.

322
00:25:17,763 --> 00:25:18,969
 - Who are you kidding?

323
00:25:19,306 --> 00:25:21,513
 You don't know how to use that.

324
00:25:26,188 --> 00:25:28,270
 (gunshot)

325
00:25:30,526 --> 00:25:32,517
 (coughing)

326
00:25:32,861 --> 00:25:33,850
 - Are you okay?

327
00:25:34,196 --> 00:25:34,810
 Do you want me to call an ambulance?

328
00:25:35,155 --> 00:25:36,520
 - No no, I'm fine.

329
00:25:36,865 --> 00:25:38,105
 - Damn.

330
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,360
 - What's the matter?

331
00:25:39,702 --> 00:25:40,566
 - I just wish Amy could've been here to see

332
00:25:40,911 --> 00:25:42,071
 what I just did.

333
00:25:44,665 --> 00:25:45,780
 - He's still on the lot.

334
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:47,205
 - What do we do now?

335
00:25:47,543 --> 00:25:48,623
 - I'm going to call the police.

336
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:51,623
 Try to locate where he is, but keep a distance from him.

337
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:53,625
 Don't try to be a hero.

338
00:26:06,311 --> 00:26:09,178
 (suspenseful music)

339
00:26:44,391 --> 00:26:45,551
 - Mr. McCreedy?

340
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:50,557
 I'm going down that hallway where all the machinery is.

341
00:26:50,898 --> 00:26:52,229
 I think he went down there.

342
00:26:52,566 --> 00:26:55,057
 I'm going in for a closer look.

343
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:07,076
 - Good God, the vault!

344
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:11,907
 Kevin!

345
00:27:12,252 --> 00:27:14,584
 Stop whatever you're doing!

346
00:27:14,922 --> 00:27:16,753
 Don't go near the vault no matter what you do,

347
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,830
 don't go near the vault!

348
00:27:32,689 --> 00:27:35,180
 - Amy, I wanna make you proud.

349
00:28:43,135 --> 00:28:45,968
 (growling)

350
00:28:54,605 --> 00:28:56,061
 - We're too late!

351
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:58,184
 Kevin, why did you go in there?

352
00:28:58,525 --> 00:29:00,436
 Why didn't you listen to me?

353
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:21,499
 - What's going on?

354
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,502
 (exciting music)

355
00:29:35,896 --> 00:29:38,103
 (growling)

356
00:29:58,251 --> 00:30:01,618
 - Oh, if you only knew what you just did.

357
00:30:01,964 --> 00:30:03,329
 - I don't understand!

358
00:30:03,674 --> 00:30:05,164
 What just happened?

359
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:08,251
 - The vault, I tried to warn you.

360
00:30:08,595 --> 00:30:11,337
 Those creatures, the vault, I tried.

361
00:30:14,935 --> 00:30:18,348
 All my work, 30 years I've been trying to prevent this

362
00:30:18,689 --> 00:30:20,099
 from happening.

363
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,556
 - To prevent what from happening?

364
00:30:22,901 --> 00:30:24,186
 - Those creatures.

365
00:30:24,528 --> 00:30:29,022
 Why do you think I spent the last 30 years of my life here?

366
00:30:29,366 --> 00:30:31,823
 I was keeping them from escaping.

367
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,658
 I was young when I began to work here,

368
00:30:36,999 --> 00:30:40,036
 and the studio was busy and prosperous.

369
00:30:43,755 --> 00:30:46,918
 I'll always remember the night that it happened.

370
00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:50,592
 It was late, there was hardly anyone around.

371
00:30:53,515 --> 00:30:55,380
 I didn't even know what it was at first.

372
00:30:55,726 --> 00:30:57,887
 It was all so fast, just a flash of light

373
00:30:58,228 --> 00:30:59,809
 and then a sudden explosion.

374
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,516
 I stepped out to see what it was,

375
00:31:02,858 --> 00:31:06,191
 but there was no one else there except for me.

376
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:12,527
 It was right in the middle of the lot.

377
00:31:12,868 --> 00:31:15,359
 Had it been daytime, it probably would have been crushed

378
00:31:15,704 --> 00:31:16,910
 in all the traffic.

379
00:31:18,623 --> 00:31:21,706
 I just stared at it for a long time.

380
00:31:22,044 --> 00:31:24,626
 I didn't know what to make of it.

381
00:31:24,963 --> 00:31:26,874
 And then suddenly it moved.

382
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:30,378
 And out from the top of the disc came this small creature,

383
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:32,050
 a sort of hobgoblin.

384
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,093
 It looked around and then it stared right at me.

385
00:31:38,852 --> 00:31:42,140
 I didn't move, I just kept watching him.

386
00:31:44,024 --> 00:31:46,356
 Looked so friendly at first.

387
00:31:47,861 --> 00:31:50,568
 If only I'd known what lay ahead.

388
00:31:54,201 --> 00:31:56,738
 - But I still don't understand.

389
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:01,573
 - I let the creatures live on the lot, it was my secret.

390
00:32:01,917 --> 00:32:03,999
 And then I learned of the power they had.

391
00:32:04,336 --> 00:32:05,746
 I still don't know if they figured

392
00:32:06,088 --> 00:32:09,706
 they were doing good for people or not.

393
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:14,464
 They slowly began to destroy everyone on the lot.

394
00:32:14,805 --> 00:32:17,262
 They would find a person, tap into his brain,

395
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:20,841
 and then create his wildest fantasy.

396
00:32:21,186 --> 00:32:24,144
 It seemed harmless at first, I mean, watching everyone

397
00:32:24,481 --> 00:32:28,440
 around me becoming rich or famous, but for most people

398
00:32:30,487 --> 00:32:33,979
 what they really want in life can be very dangerous.

399
00:32:34,324 --> 00:32:37,612
 In fact, the creatures wound up destroying everyone,

400
00:32:37,953 --> 00:32:40,615
 everyone they came in contact with.

401
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:44,365
 They're, they're, they're loose in the city now.

402
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:46,495
 - But you could warn everyone.

403
00:32:46,837 --> 00:32:48,668
 They'd listen to your story.

404
00:32:49,005 --> 00:32:50,085
 - Would they?

405
00:32:50,423 --> 00:32:53,506
 No one believed me 30 years ago.

406
00:32:53,844 --> 00:32:54,924
 I went straight to the head of the studio

407
00:32:55,262 --> 00:32:56,547
 and tried to explain it to him.

408
00:32:56,888 --> 00:32:57,877
 He didn't believe me, no one did.

409
00:32:58,223 --> 00:33:02,011
 I just watched helplessly as people around me

410
00:33:02,352 --> 00:33:04,343
 were destroyed, one by one.

411
00:33:05,063 --> 00:33:06,769
 - Then what can we do?

412
00:33:09,317 --> 00:33:11,729
 - I'm too old to catch up with them now,

413
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,106
 but you might still have a chance.

414
00:33:14,447 --> 00:33:17,780
 There aren't very many of them, but they move quickly.

415
00:33:18,118 --> 00:33:20,951
 Just remember, they're attracted to bright lights,

416
00:33:21,288 --> 00:33:23,995
 that's how you can fight them.

417
00:33:24,332 --> 00:33:26,698
 Watch everyone around you.

418
00:33:27,043 --> 00:33:28,829
 When a person begins to act strangely,

419
00:33:29,171 --> 00:33:30,581
 it means that one of the creatures

420
00:33:30,922 --> 00:33:33,288
 have tapped into his mind.

421
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:35,339
 When this happens, the creature is never far away.

422
00:33:35,677 --> 00:33:37,713
 Find it and kill it before it's too late.

423
00:33:38,054 --> 00:33:41,091
 Because when the creature dies, the fantasy ends

424
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:43,264
 and the victim is safe.

425
00:33:43,602 --> 00:33:47,766
 Now remember, they're only attracted to bright light.

426
00:33:48,106 --> 00:33:49,721
 That's how you find them.

427
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:52,648
 But you must destroy them all before dawn

428
00:33:52,986 --> 00:33:54,851
 because once it's daylight, it's too late.

429
00:33:55,197 --> 00:33:56,186
 - Okay.

430
00:33:56,531 --> 00:33:59,318
 - You'll never be able to stop them.

431
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:01,945
 (ominous music)

432
00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:12,539
 (record scratch)

433
00:34:12,881 --> 00:34:14,997
 (dance music)

434
00:34:19,888 --> 00:34:20,798
 - Alright!

435
00:34:35,862 --> 00:34:37,818
 (growling)

436
00:34:45,205 --> 00:34:48,038
 Come on Amy, would you get with it?

437
00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:55,085
 (growling)

438
00:35:05,058 --> 00:35:07,470
 (horn beeps)

439
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:10,848
 That car horn, I'd recognize it anywhere!

440
00:35:13,191 --> 00:35:15,603
 (horn beeps)

441
00:35:17,404 --> 00:35:18,769
 See you guys later.

442
00:35:20,323 --> 00:35:21,153
 Much later.

443
00:35:24,953 --> 00:35:25,908
 That's weird.

444
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:30,873
 Maybe he's circling the block or something.

445
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,535
 - I brought your jacket.

446
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,245
 I thought you might be cold out here.

447
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:39,421
 - Yeah, thanks a lot.

448
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:40,748
 - Where's Nick?

449
00:35:41,094 --> 00:35:42,550
 I thought I heard his horn before.

450
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:43,546
 - So did I.

451
00:35:44,973 --> 00:35:46,838
 - Well maybe you should wait inside until you see him.

452
00:35:47,183 --> 00:35:48,719
 - He's just looking for a place to park,

453
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,425
 now would you go back in the house?

454
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,601
 - There's plenty of parking in front, maybe it wasn't

455
00:35:52,939 --> 00:35:53,849
 his horn?

456
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,350
 - Look, I'm positive it was.

457
00:35:55,692 --> 00:35:56,977
 Maybe the police just pulled him over

458
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:58,434
 for all his warrants or something.

459
00:35:58,778 --> 00:35:59,767
 Now would you just go back in the house?

460
00:36:00,113 --> 00:36:01,023
 - Fine, I get the message.

461
00:36:01,364 --> 00:36:04,447
 - Just take this stupid jacket with you.

462
00:36:09,456 --> 00:36:11,447
 Damnit Nick, where the hell are you?

463
00:36:26,014 --> 00:36:27,299
 (growling)

464
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,130
 Amy, would you just go back in the house

465
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:30,807
 and leave me alone?

466
00:36:33,563 --> 00:36:36,270
 And would you stop breathing all over me?

467
00:36:36,858 --> 00:36:37,722
 (growls)

468
00:36:38,068 --> 00:36:39,979
 (screaming)

469
00:36:44,783 --> 00:36:47,650
 - Sounds like Nick finally got here.

470
00:36:56,086 --> 00:36:57,997
 - Get the fuck off me!

471
00:36:59,255 --> 00:37:00,961
 - She must be happy to see him.

472
00:37:11,434 --> 00:37:13,891
 - Take that, you little bastard!

473
00:37:33,998 --> 00:37:36,114
 - Honestly, couldn't Nick wait?

474
00:37:37,752 --> 00:37:40,539
 (screaming)

475
00:37:42,549 --> 00:37:45,291
 (growling)

476
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,286
 Go on, grab it!

477
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:18,202
 - It's like a new dance.

478
00:38:22,881 --> 00:38:24,542
 Looks pretty kinky.

479
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:27,082
 Hey guys!

480
00:38:27,427 --> 00:38:28,758
 - Nick, thank God you're here!

481
00:38:29,137 --> 00:38:30,673
 Something wild came out of the woods and attacked us!

482
00:38:31,014 --> 00:38:32,129
 - I know I'm here to take ya out.

483
00:38:32,474 --> 00:38:34,214
 - Oh it's those rabid animals!

484
00:38:40,231 --> 00:38:42,517
 (screaming)

485
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:45,726
 (growling)

486
00:39:11,387 --> 00:39:13,753
 I knew I'd find a use for this.

487
00:39:17,852 --> 00:39:20,138
 Just open the door and stand back.

488
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,890
 - Oh my God, what do you call that?

489
00:39:22,315 --> 00:39:23,395
 - Urban renewal.

490
00:39:34,702 --> 00:39:35,487
 - Wait!

491
00:39:44,796 --> 00:39:45,956
 No, put that out!

492
00:39:52,387 --> 00:39:54,628
 (growling)

493
00:39:59,561 --> 00:40:01,017
 You guys okay?

494
00:40:01,354 --> 00:40:03,094
 - Yeah, I'm just peachy.

495
00:40:03,439 --> 00:40:05,020
 - I had everything under control.

496
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:08,350
 - Good, then you can finish off your van.

497
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,492
 - I don't understand, what were those things?

498
00:40:25,837 --> 00:40:27,077
 - It's a long story.

499
00:40:27,422 --> 00:40:28,958
 What they do to your body is nothing compared

500
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:30,755
 to what they do to your mind.

501
00:40:31,092 --> 00:40:33,003
 - Don't have to worry about that.

502
00:40:33,344 --> 00:40:34,834
 - You sure you're all okay?

503
00:40:35,179 --> 00:40:37,886
 I mean, you don't feel anything different, do you?

504
00:40:38,224 --> 00:40:40,089
 - I think I wet my pants.

505
00:40:41,603 --> 00:40:43,468
 Hey, I was only kidding.

506
00:40:44,939 --> 00:40:47,430
 - And none of you have a desire to do anything

507
00:40:47,775 --> 00:40:50,061
 you've never done before, right?

508
00:40:50,403 --> 00:40:51,313
 - I don't think there's anything left

509
00:40:51,654 --> 00:40:53,190
 that we haven't done before.

510
00:40:53,531 --> 00:40:54,987
 - How 'bout you, Amy?

511
00:40:55,325 --> 00:40:56,986
 - Well actually I do wanna try this new Chinese

512
00:40:57,327 --> 00:40:59,784
 restaurant that I heard about.

513
00:41:00,121 --> 00:41:00,655
 - Kyle?

514
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,200
 - Could I use your telephone again?

515
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:04,997
 I wanna call my girlfriend.

516
00:41:05,335 --> 00:41:07,075
 - We still haven't met this mystery girl of yours,

517
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,411
 what kind of relationship do the two of you have?

518
00:41:09,756 --> 00:41:13,499
 - I guess you'd say it's a fantasy relationship.

519
00:41:27,148 --> 00:41:29,605
 (ominous music)

520
00:41:48,628 --> 00:41:50,789
 (growling)

521
00:42:07,522 --> 00:42:09,979
 (phone ringing)

522
00:42:10,316 --> 00:42:12,056
 - Hi, it's me, Fantasia.

523
00:42:13,027 --> 00:42:14,483
 Thanks for calling.

524
00:42:14,821 --> 00:42:17,107
 I need a new house pet to impress my friends.

525
00:42:17,448 --> 00:42:19,279
 Now hurry before the zookeeper comes,

526
00:42:19,617 --> 00:42:22,279
 help me hide this iguana on my body.

527
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,736
 Uh, can I help you, miss?

528
00:42:25,081 --> 00:42:29,165
 Oh yes Mr. Beastmaster, something just crawled up my leg.

529
00:42:30,253 --> 00:42:32,209
 Oh, see if you can find it.

530
00:42:33,923 --> 00:42:37,165
 I think you'd better come back to my office with me.

531
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,172
 Now wait a minute, are you sure your office

532
00:42:40,513 --> 00:42:42,799
 is in the baboon pit?

533
00:42:43,141 --> 00:42:47,100
 Mister zookeeper, what do you think you're doing?

534
00:42:47,437 --> 00:42:50,645
 This isn't the children's petting zoo.

535
00:42:50,982 --> 00:42:54,941
 I have a new house pet for you, miss, ha ha ha ha ha.

536
00:42:56,362 --> 00:42:59,104
 Oh, mister zookeeper, I could never take a cockatoo

537
00:42:59,449 --> 00:42:59,983
 that size.

538
00:43:02,368 --> 00:43:04,108
 (record scratch)

539
00:43:04,454 --> 00:43:07,196
 Now stop wasting your money calling me.

540
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,701
 I'm right outside your door.

541
00:43:11,002 --> 00:43:13,618
 Don't keep me waiting, lover.

542
00:43:13,963 --> 00:43:15,453
 (dial tone)

543
00:43:17,133 --> 00:43:20,000
 (suspenseful music)

544
00:43:40,573 --> 00:43:43,406
 (coyote howling)

545
00:43:55,671 --> 00:43:56,911
 - Where's Kyle?

546
00:44:03,805 --> 00:44:05,466
 Didn't you guys see where he went?

547
00:44:05,807 --> 00:44:06,466
 - [All] No.

548
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,592
 - Do you, do you kiss on the first date?

549
00:44:11,562 --> 00:44:14,304
 - I go all the way on the first date.

550
00:44:14,649 --> 00:44:15,889
 - My kind of woman.

551
00:44:17,485 --> 00:44:19,350
 My place or yours?

552
00:44:19,695 --> 00:44:22,778
 - Neither, we'll go to Reputation Road.

553
00:44:24,408 --> 00:44:25,363
 - I'll drive.

554
00:44:55,481 --> 00:44:59,440
 Do we have some time to get Pop Rocks and whipped cream?

555
00:44:59,777 --> 00:45:01,233
 - Just start the car.

556
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,646
 - Reputation Road, here we come.

557
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:16,040
 - Amy, quick, where's Reputation Road?

558
00:45:16,377 --> 00:45:18,288
 Daphne, where's Reputation Road?

559
00:45:18,629 --> 00:45:19,709
 - You go down to the end of the street,

560
00:45:20,047 --> 00:45:21,457
 make a right, go through two traffic lights

561
00:45:21,799 --> 00:45:24,290
 and up the hill and there it is.

562
00:45:24,635 --> 00:45:26,466
 So I've heard.

563
00:45:26,804 --> 00:45:27,793
 - What's going on?

564
00:45:28,139 --> 00:45:29,800
 - I don't have time to explain, it's about those creatures.

565
00:45:30,141 --> 00:45:31,677
 I've gotta go across town and get Kyle.

566
00:45:32,018 --> 00:45:33,178
 I want the rest of you to stay here.

567
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:34,679
 Don't make a move or do anything.

568
00:45:35,021 --> 00:45:38,559
 And above all, don't fantasize about anything!

569
00:45:54,498 --> 00:45:58,582
 - You know, girls, I could think of a fantasy right now.

570
00:45:59,545 --> 00:46:02,207
 It's involving the number three.

571
00:46:26,656 --> 00:46:29,363
 - Oh Fantasia, you're my ideal woman.

572
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,282
 You're intelligent, you've got a wonderful personality,

573
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:33,951
 and I'll bet you're a great cook and I just know

574
00:46:34,288 --> 00:46:36,199
 my mom's gonna love meeting you.

575
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,371
 Will you marry me?

576
00:46:38,709 --> 00:46:42,418
 - Skip the ceremony, we're going straight to the honeymoon.

577
00:46:48,678 --> 00:46:51,920
 Oh Fantasia, baby I could watch you all night long.

578
00:46:53,057 --> 00:46:54,797
 - If you don't go any faster we could be driving

579
00:46:55,142 --> 00:46:56,302
 all night long.

580
00:46:56,769 --> 00:46:58,976
 Now hurry, I know a shortcut.

581
00:47:36,475 --> 00:47:37,965
 Oh, don't park here.

582
00:47:39,645 --> 00:47:40,555
 - Why not?

583
00:47:41,731 --> 00:47:43,767
 - You have to park near the edge

584
00:47:44,108 --> 00:47:46,474
 if you want to go all the way.

585
00:47:47,737 --> 00:47:49,022
 - Oh yeah, sure.

586
00:47:59,707 --> 00:48:00,492
 How's that?

587
00:48:01,917 --> 00:48:03,373
 - Perfect.

588
00:48:03,711 --> 00:48:04,996
 - That was some shortcut you knew about.

589
00:48:05,337 --> 00:48:06,167
 I never knew there was a road through

590
00:48:06,505 --> 00:48:08,461
 the children's playground.

591
00:48:09,842 --> 00:48:10,752
 - There isn't.

592
00:48:11,093 --> 00:48:13,505
 (laughs)

593
00:48:13,846 --> 00:48:16,303
 Well, what are you waiting for?

594
00:48:26,317 --> 00:48:29,559
 - Fantasia, where are you going?

595
00:48:29,904 --> 00:48:32,520
 - I wanted a better view of the city.

596
00:48:34,742 --> 00:48:36,903
 You can see it all from here.

597
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:43,281
 Now, isn't that a lovely view?

598
00:48:45,377 --> 00:48:46,742
 - Oh, it sure is.

599
00:48:48,255 --> 00:48:50,166
 Where are you going now?

600
00:48:51,926 --> 00:48:54,167
 - Just wait a second.

601
00:48:54,512 --> 00:48:56,628
 You just keep watching the view.

602
00:48:56,972 --> 00:49:00,931
 Just hold tight and get ready for the ride of your life.

603
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:03,850
 - Do it to me.

604
00:49:07,775 --> 00:49:09,982
 (groaning)

605
00:49:19,745 --> 00:49:21,406
 You need any help?

606
00:49:21,747 --> 00:49:23,658
 - Would you get back inside and wait for me?

607
00:49:23,999 --> 00:49:25,660
 This time don't move!

608
00:49:31,715 --> 00:49:32,545
 We're almost there.

609
00:49:32,883 --> 00:49:36,171
 Just think nasty thoughts while you wait.

610
00:49:37,721 --> 00:49:40,588
 (suspenseful music)

611
00:49:53,946 --> 00:49:56,153
 (groaning)

612
00:50:06,792 --> 00:50:08,783
 (growling)

613
00:50:27,104 --> 00:50:28,810
 - Do it do me, baby.

614
00:50:32,151 --> 00:50:33,436
 - You damn fool!

615
00:50:34,403 --> 00:50:36,610
 What are you doing here?

616
00:50:36,947 --> 00:50:38,312
 - I want you to meet my girlfriend.

617
00:50:38,657 --> 00:50:39,396
 Wait 'til you see her.

618
00:50:39,742 --> 00:50:40,527
 Fantasia?

619
00:50:40,868 --> 00:50:41,607
 Honey?

620
00:50:41,952 --> 00:50:42,691
 - Kyle, there's no girl.

621
00:50:43,037 --> 00:50:44,573
 She was a figment of your imagination.

622
00:50:44,914 --> 00:50:46,620
 - No she's not, she's just hiding somewhere.

623
00:50:46,957 --> 00:50:48,447
 I told you, she's a shy girl.

624
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:49,497
 Sweetie?

625
00:50:49,835 --> 00:50:50,790
 - Shy girl?

626
00:50:51,128 --> 00:50:52,834
 That bleached blonde witch almost killed you!

627
00:50:54,548 --> 00:50:57,460
 She was back there trying to push your car over the cliff!

628
00:50:57,801 --> 00:50:58,756
 Hey, come on!

629
00:51:02,181 --> 00:51:04,297
 (crashing)

630
00:51:06,435 --> 00:51:08,721
 (explosion)

631
00:51:19,198 --> 00:51:19,857
 - Whoa.

632
00:51:21,408 --> 00:51:23,273
 - Now do you believe me?

633
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,707
 (ominous music)

634
00:51:46,016 --> 00:51:48,974
 I'll discuss my phone bill with you later.

635
00:51:49,478 --> 00:51:50,433
 Oh no.

636
00:51:53,274 --> 00:51:54,639
 They're gone!

637
00:51:54,984 --> 00:51:58,943
 (growling) (crying out)

638
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:12,660
 Hit the creature!

639
00:52:13,002 --> 00:52:14,117
 - I'm trying to!

640
00:52:22,303 --> 00:52:23,668
 - Hit the creature!

641
00:52:34,064 --> 00:52:34,769
 Idiot.

642
00:52:40,779 --> 00:52:44,317
 The creatures broke loose, are you guys okay?

643
00:52:44,658 --> 00:52:46,523
 - We're doing just fine.

644
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:48,484
 - What about Amy, where's she?

645
00:52:48,829 --> 00:52:50,410
 - She was acting kinda strange.

646
00:52:50,748 --> 00:52:51,658
 - [Kevin] What?

647
00:52:51,999 --> 00:52:52,988
 Where is she?

648
00:52:53,334 --> 00:52:53,698
 - Well she said she wanted to go to Club Scum.

649
00:52:54,043 --> 00:52:54,953
 - What?

650
00:52:55,294 --> 00:52:56,500
 Why didn't you try to stop her?

651
00:52:56,837 --> 00:52:57,952
 - What's the big deal?

652
00:52:58,297 --> 00:52:59,286
 I've been there before.

653
00:52:59,631 --> 00:53:00,620
 - You guys, don't you understand?

654
00:53:00,966 --> 00:53:02,831
 These creatures have a power.

655
00:53:03,177 --> 00:53:04,838
 They can tap into your brain and sense the things

656
00:53:05,179 --> 00:53:07,386
 that you really wanna do.

657
00:53:07,723 --> 00:53:08,838
 - What's wrong with that?

658
00:53:09,183 --> 00:53:10,548
 - They also try to kill you.

659
00:53:10,893 --> 00:53:12,758
 I just chased Kyle across town and pulled him out of his car

660
00:53:13,103 --> 00:53:15,515
 right before it rolled over a cliff and blew up.

661
00:53:15,856 --> 00:53:16,891
 - It's still burning now.

662
00:53:17,232 --> 00:53:19,848
 - You see what I'm trying to tell you guys now?

663
00:53:20,194 --> 00:53:21,809
 - What could happen at that nightclub?

664
00:53:22,154 --> 00:53:22,984
 - Well there's a lot of bikers

665
00:53:23,322 --> 00:53:25,313
 and people fighting everywhere, and I've seen people

666
00:53:25,657 --> 00:53:26,692
 dealing drugs and knife fights.

667
00:53:27,034 --> 00:53:27,648
 - What?

668
00:53:28,035 --> 00:53:29,150
 Oh no, come on, we've gotta go.

669
00:53:29,536 --> 00:53:30,241
 Come on!

670
00:53:31,622 --> 00:53:32,486
 - And I've seen the police arresting people there

671
00:53:32,831 --> 00:53:34,321
 all the time for god knows what!

672
00:53:35,209 --> 00:53:36,949
 - Oh no, come on!

673
00:53:37,294 --> 00:53:39,535
 (rock music)

674
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,396
 Daphne, I think you got this all wrong.

675
00:54:03,737 --> 00:54:06,023
 Amy would never come to a place like this.

676
00:54:06,365 --> 00:54:07,980
 She won't even go through the mall parking lot by herself.

677
00:54:08,367 --> 00:54:09,982
 - Would you just listen to me.

678
00:54:10,327 --> 00:54:11,692
 You guys have to have a certain kind of attitude

679
00:54:12,037 --> 00:54:13,152
 when you're in this part of town.

680
00:54:13,497 --> 00:54:15,453
 You've gotta look like you belong, okay?

681
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:17,327
 - Yeah, I get it.

682
00:54:18,377 --> 00:54:19,867
 - Look, would you just listen to me and nothing will happen.

683
00:54:20,212 --> 00:54:21,793
 Now look, I think one of us should hold all the wallets

684
00:54:22,131 --> 00:54:23,712
 for safe-keeping.

685
00:54:24,049 --> 00:54:24,583
 You.

686
00:54:28,011 --> 00:54:30,127
 Now quiet and just be cool.

687
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:37,176
 - Nick, Kevin, Daphne?

688
00:54:39,231 --> 00:54:40,016
 Cool, cool.

689
00:54:56,206 --> 00:54:58,071
 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.

690
00:54:58,417 --> 00:55:00,499
 Where do you guys think you're going?

691
00:55:00,836 --> 00:55:02,451
 - We're looking for a girl in here.

692
00:55:02,796 --> 00:55:03,956
 - You know, somehow I don't think the girls in here

693
00:55:04,298 --> 00:55:05,959
 are gonna be your type, why don't you try the Polo Lounge

694
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,415
 up the street?

695
00:55:07,759 --> 00:55:09,169
 - You don't understand, we're looking for a particular girl

696
00:55:09,511 --> 00:55:10,250
 here tonight.

697
00:55:11,263 --> 00:55:11,922
 - Oh.

698
00:55:17,728 --> 00:55:19,059
 Yo, Pixie.

699
00:55:19,396 --> 00:55:20,511
 Haul it over here.

700
00:55:26,153 --> 00:55:27,188
 - Yeah, what is it?

701
00:55:27,529 --> 00:55:30,020
 - You working here tonight?

702
00:55:30,365 --> 00:55:31,571
 - Pretty stupid question,

703
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:33,615
 of course I'm working here tonight.

704
00:55:33,952 --> 00:55:37,285
 - No, no, I mean are you, you know, working?

705
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:40,746
 - College boys.

706
00:55:42,461 --> 00:55:44,952
 Of course I'm working here tonight.

707
00:55:45,297 --> 00:55:47,504
 What'd you boys have in mind?

708
00:55:47,841 --> 00:55:50,958
 Any of those fancy moves in French?

709
00:55:51,303 --> 00:55:52,463
 - Read my lips.

710
00:55:52,804 --> 00:55:56,763
 We're looking for a friend of ours who's in there.

711
00:55:58,227 --> 00:56:01,560
 - Does she look anything like Pixie maybe?

712
00:56:04,566 --> 00:56:06,056
 - God, I hope not.

713
00:56:07,486 --> 00:56:11,195
 - That's the last time I ever give you 1 0% of my tips!

714
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:14,861
 - 1 0% of her what?

715
00:56:15,202 --> 00:56:16,317
 - Alright, that's it, you guys, you're outta here,

716
00:56:16,662 --> 00:56:17,742
 get outta here!

717
00:56:18,497 --> 00:56:19,327
 Oh, Daphne.

718
00:56:22,042 --> 00:56:23,998
 I didn't see you back there.

719
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:25,625
 - Hi!

720
00:56:26,255 --> 00:56:27,165
 Roadrash!

721
00:56:27,506 --> 00:56:28,746
 Long time no see.

722
00:56:30,259 --> 00:56:31,669
 - I was sorry to hear about your boyfriend

723
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:33,216
 coming back from the army.

724
00:56:33,554 --> 00:56:37,217
 You give me a call next time he's on duty.

725
00:56:37,558 --> 00:56:41,551
 - Ixnay on the oggiesay, okay?

726
00:56:42,938 --> 00:56:43,597
 - What?

727
00:56:45,649 --> 00:56:46,764
 - Can we go in?

728
00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:49,015
 - Hey, you guys are friends of Daphne's.

729
00:56:51,321 --> 00:56:53,812
 Go for it, knock yourselves out.

730
00:57:07,212 --> 00:57:08,748
 - Do you guys see her anywhere?

731
00:57:09,256 --> 00:57:10,996
 - Would you just sit down before everyone starts

732
00:57:11,341 --> 00:57:12,296
 staring at us?

733
00:57:24,187 --> 00:57:29,022
 - Oh, you must be here for the wet T-shirt contest tonight.

734
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:31,020
 - Wet T-Shirt contest?

735
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:32,692
 - Donkey mud wrestling?

736
00:57:33,071 --> 00:57:34,777
 - Donkey mud wrestling?

737
00:57:35,365 --> 00:57:36,525
 - Get lucky night?

738
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:37,401
 - No.

739
00:57:40,329 --> 00:57:42,115
 - Oh, I'm sorry, the donkey mud wrestlers

740
00:57:42,456 --> 00:57:45,414
 are supposed to use the rear entrance.

741
00:57:48,337 --> 00:57:49,497
 Enjoy the show.

742
00:57:52,966 --> 00:57:53,955
 - Hey Daphne.

743
00:57:55,969 --> 00:57:56,628
 - Hi Daph.

744
00:57:59,598 --> 00:58:00,337
 - Sit down.

745
00:58:04,561 --> 00:58:06,222
 - How well do you know those guys?

746
00:58:06,563 --> 00:58:07,143
 - It's just platonic.

747
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:08,470
 - Oh really?

748
00:58:08,815 --> 00:58:10,055
 - Oh would you just shut up, okay?

749
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,356
 - Hey, you guys aren't much of a help, you know.

750
00:58:12,694 --> 00:58:13,479
 We're supposed to be looking for Amy.

751
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:14,980
 - Well why don't you try looking under the tables?

752
00:58:16,281 --> 00:58:17,862
 - Yeah, Daphne's an expert on being under the tables here.

753
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,236
 What color are the rugs, Daph?

754
00:58:20,577 --> 00:58:24,286
 - Same color as the carpet burns on my knees, Nick.

755
00:58:33,298 --> 00:58:36,085
 (clears throat)

756
00:58:36,426 --> 00:58:39,259
 (feedback squealing)

757
00:58:45,644 --> 00:58:49,387
 - Greetings lowlifes, and welcome to Club Scum.

758
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:54,233

 - Can I get you guys something to drink here?

796
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:11,471
 - Maybe later.

797
01:02:11,808 --> 01:02:14,515
 - There's a two drink minimum here.

798
01:02:14,853 --> 01:02:17,560
 - Look, we're all underage, okay.

799
01:02:20,567 --> 01:02:22,979
 - Roadrash, come here, quick.

800
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,935
 - Yeah, yeah, yeah, what is it?

801
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,022
 - None of these kids are 21 yet.

802
01:02:28,366 --> 01:02:28,900
 - Alright.

803
01:02:30,285 --> 01:02:32,651
 How many fake IDs we need here?

804
01:02:34,748 --> 01:02:36,704
 - This says I'm 40 and handicapped.

805
01:02:37,042 --> 01:02:38,031
 - So what?

806
01:02:38,376 --> 01:02:39,912
 You got a problem with that, junior?

807
01:02:40,253 --> 01:02:41,413
 - No, I'll limp.

808
01:02:43,465 --> 01:02:48,129
 - And now, Club Scum is proud to present a new headliner.

809
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:52,088
 Appearing nudely and nightly, Miss Amy Sincere.

810
01:02:56,603 --> 01:02:58,969
 (sexy music)

811
01:03:01,483 --> 01:03:02,598
 - Oh my God.

812
01:03:08,281 --> 01:03:10,272
 Amy, get off the stage!

813
01:03:10,742 --> 01:03:12,698
 - Hey, sit down and shut up.

814
01:03:14,537 --> 01:03:17,620
 (cheers and whistles)

815
01:03:21,461 --> 01:03:23,417
 - I don't know, but I think it's sort of an improvement.

816
01:03:23,755 --> 01:03:24,540
 - So do I.

817
01:04:22,772 --> 01:04:26,890
 - I bet you showed her how to do that, huh Daphne?

818
01:04:36,661 --> 01:04:38,822
 - Well, what do you think folks?

819
01:04:39,164 --> 01:04:41,450
 Is she a hit or a miss?

820
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:44,783
 (cheering and whistling)

821
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:52,211
 - Amy, you don't know what you're doing!

822
01:04:52,552 --> 01:04:53,712
 Get off the stage!

823
01:04:54,345 --> 01:04:56,586
 Amy! Amy get off the stage!

824
01:05:05,398 --> 01:05:07,559
 - Stop interrupting the show!

825
01:05:45,855 --> 01:05:51,191
 - I want you to treat me like dirt. Spill your drinks on me.

826
01:05:54,906 --> 01:05:58,649
 Show everyone that I'm not wearing any underwear.

827
01:06:04,749 --> 01:06:07,786
 Take me under the table and use me.

828
01:06:09,337 --> 01:06:10,042
 Make me.

829
01:06:14,217 --> 01:06:15,047
 Your woman.

830
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:19,552
 - My bike's right outside.

831
01:06:21,015 --> 01:06:22,380
 I live right around the corner,

832
01:06:22,725 --> 01:06:24,261
 you know what I mean?

833
01:06:24,602 --> 01:06:26,388
 - Look, she's just drunk.

834
01:06:26,729 --> 01:06:28,560
 She doesn't even know what she's saying.

835
01:06:28,898 --> 01:06:30,854
 She's never even been on the back of a motorcycle,

836
01:06:31,192 --> 01:06:32,932
 she's terrified of them.

837
01:06:34,237 --> 01:06:37,195
 - Riding a motorcycle is like sitting on

838
01:06:37,532 --> 01:06:39,773
 the world's largest vibrator.

839
01:06:54,132 --> 01:06:57,670
 - Miss Sincere, you're my kinda woman.

840
01:06:58,011 --> 01:07:00,593
 - Amy Sincere's only my stage name.

841
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:03,546
 Do you wanna know my real name?

842
01:07:03,892 --> 01:07:06,634
 - Tell it to me on your knees, baby.

843
01:07:07,979 --> 01:07:09,389
 - Break it up you two!

844
01:07:09,731 --> 01:07:11,141
 - Look, I'm not into the number three.

845
01:07:11,733 --> 01:07:13,598
 Get outta here you jerk!

846
01:07:20,909 --> 01:07:25,027
 - Would you guys stop sitting there and help me?

847
01:07:25,371 --> 01:07:26,656
 - Why don't you help him, Daphne?

848
01:07:26,998 --> 01:07:30,411
 You seem to have a way with all the men in this place.

849
01:07:30,793 --> 01:07:32,909
 Sergeant Parker, what are you doing here?

850
01:07:33,463 --> 01:07:35,249
 - At ease, Private.

851
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:37,205
 I'm out on a weekend pass.

852
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:39,791
 I hear Pixie's working tonight.

853
01:07:40,136 --> 01:07:41,376
 - You go out in public in full uniform?

854
01:07:41,721 --> 01:07:43,586
 - A real soldier dies with his boots on.

855
01:07:44,432 --> 01:07:45,547
 - This way, this way!

856
01:07:45,934 --> 01:07:46,844
 (growling)

857
01:07:47,185 --> 01:07:48,391
 - What's going on here?

858
01:07:48,728 --> 01:07:50,343
 - Just a problem involving some small predators, sir.

859
01:07:51,231 --> 01:07:53,438
 (growling)

860
01:07:54,901 --> 01:07:56,061
 - I see.

861
01:07:56,402 --> 01:07:57,733
 Sort of a marauding attack.

862
01:07:58,071 --> 01:07:59,060
 - Yes sir.

863
01:07:59,405 --> 01:08:00,440
 I believe that we need to stage a diversion!

864
01:08:00,782 --> 01:08:01,612
 - Private!

865
01:08:01,950 --> 01:08:02,814
 Who's in command here?

866
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:03,864
 - You are, sir.

867
01:08:04,202 --> 01:08:06,363
 - Then I'll make the decisions.

868
01:08:06,704 --> 01:08:08,240
 We need to stage a diversion.

869
01:08:08,581 --> 01:08:10,697
 And I have just what you need.

870
01:08:47,036 --> 01:08:49,243
 (growling)

871
01:09:17,358 --> 01:09:19,314
 - The crowd here tonight.

872
01:09:25,616 --> 01:09:27,607
 (growling)

873
01:09:30,788 --> 01:09:31,447
 Pixie.

874
01:09:32,749 --> 01:09:35,286
 Did I ever tell you that I was a talent scout

875
01:09:35,626 --> 01:09:38,163
 for a major motion picture studio?

876
01:09:41,924 --> 01:09:44,882
 - Did I ever tell you that I've always been attracted

877
01:09:45,219 --> 01:09:46,880
 to men of your stature?

878
01:09:49,182 --> 01:09:51,764
 - Oh, Pixie, Pixie, Pixie!

879
01:09:57,023 --> 01:09:59,981
 (giggling and moaning)

880
01:10:02,403 --> 01:10:03,609
 (screams)

881
01:10:08,409 --> 01:10:10,365
 - What the hell are you doing?

882
01:10:11,079 --> 01:10:11,989
 - Here.

883
01:10:20,713 --> 01:10:22,453
 - Kevin, Kevin, I got one of them.

884
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,831
 - Good, let's hope it's the right one.

885
01:10:25,968 --> 01:10:28,755
 - Oh Roadrash, do it to me.

886
01:10:29,222 --> 01:10:29,881
 Oh!

887
01:10:32,016 --> 01:10:34,849
 - Kevin, quick, you've gotta stop him.

888
01:10:36,479 --> 01:10:40,313
 - Alright, Daphne can stay but I want you two outta here.

889
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:46,777
 - Hey, you gotta stop him, look!

890
01:10:49,992 --> 01:10:52,404
 (explosions)

891
01:11:05,758 --> 01:11:08,044
 (screaming)

892
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:14,471
 - What's all that shouting?

893
01:11:14,809 --> 01:11:17,471
 - It's me faking my orgasm for you.

894
01:11:23,192 --> 01:11:25,399
 (explosions)

895
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:39,121
 - Wait a second.

896
01:11:43,463 --> 01:11:45,749
 (screaming)

897
01:11:58,769 --> 01:12:00,680
 - Wait, stop, come back!

898
01:12:05,401 --> 01:12:08,268
 (suspenseful music)

899
01:12:15,203 --> 01:12:17,034
 (growling)

900
01:12:17,371 --> 01:12:19,282
 (screaming)

901
01:12:37,558 --> 01:12:40,595
 - Can you still fake your orgasms for me?

902
01:12:41,812 --> 01:12:42,722
 - Fake this!

903
01:12:52,323 --> 01:12:54,188
 - Hey look, there's Amy!

904
01:12:58,204 --> 01:13:00,320
 Amy, are you okay?

905
01:13:01,499 --> 01:13:02,659
 - I'm not sure.

906
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,786
 Why am I dressed like a rock video slut?

907
01:13:05,253 --> 01:13:06,789
 - It's a long story, I'll explain later.

908
01:13:11,259 --> 01:13:12,419
 - You there.

909
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,546
 Name, rank, serial number.

910
01:13:14,887 --> 01:13:17,003
 - Don't shoot me, I'm just an employee.

911
01:13:17,348 --> 01:13:19,885
 I don't even book the talent here.

912
01:13:23,187 --> 01:13:24,848
 - Sergeant, can't you stop him?

913
01:13:25,189 --> 01:13:26,099
 - Why?

914
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:27,555
 This is the best training he's ever had.

915
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:29,140
 You could never get this at boot camp.

916
01:13:29,485 --> 01:13:30,816
 - You call that training?

917
01:13:31,153 --> 01:13:32,563
 He could kill somebody.

918
01:13:32,905 --> 01:13:34,736
 - War isn't pretty.

919
01:13:35,074 --> 01:13:36,029
 - Daphne and Nick are still inside,

920
01:13:36,367 --> 01:13:38,153
 we gotta try and help 'em.

921
01:13:38,494 --> 01:13:39,700
 - Wait.

922
01:13:40,037 --> 01:13:41,948
 I have a special mission for you.

923
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:43,120
 - You do?

924
01:13:43,457 --> 01:13:44,116
 - Yes.

925
01:13:44,458 --> 01:13:47,950
 Have you ever considered joining the USO?

926
01:13:48,296 --> 01:13:49,285
 - The USO?

927
01:13:49,630 --> 01:13:50,289
 - Yes, think of it.

928
01:13:50,631 --> 01:13:51,711
 Entertain the troops, doing your part

929
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:53,961
 for our country.

930
01:13:54,302 --> 01:13:56,042
 A small but patriotic gesture that would be appreciated

931
01:13:56,387 --> 01:13:59,879
 by our boys off fighting around the world.

932
01:14:00,224 --> 01:14:00,963
 - I'll do it!

933
01:14:01,309 --> 01:14:02,139
 - Good!

934
01:14:02,476 --> 01:14:03,966
 You can start right away.

935
01:14:04,312 --> 01:14:06,974
 I've got a truckload of soldiers out in the parking lot.

936
01:14:07,315 --> 01:14:10,022
 If you start now you can be finished with them by morning.

937
01:14:10,359 --> 01:14:10,893
 - What?

938
01:14:11,611 --> 01:14:13,067
 Nick, do something, your Sergeant's after me.

939
01:14:13,696 --> 01:14:15,061
 Just shoot him!

940
01:14:15,406 --> 01:14:17,021
 - One more time, babe.

941
01:14:17,366 --> 01:14:19,152
 Here, do it yourself.

942
01:14:19,493 --> 01:14:20,482
 - Stop wasting time.

943
01:14:20,828 --> 01:14:22,113
 - Nick!

944
01:14:22,455 --> 01:14:24,070
 - Maybe I should send Nick off to some third world country.

945
01:14:24,415 --> 01:14:26,406
 That'll give you all the time that you need.

946
01:14:26,751 --> 01:14:28,036
 - Let go of me!

947
01:14:28,377 --> 01:14:29,162
 - Or maybe I should get Nick out of the picture altogether.

948
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:32,336
 Nick, this is your sergeant speaking!

949
01:14:32,673 --> 01:14:33,833
 Save the troops!

950
01:14:34,216 --> 01:14:35,706
 That's an order!

951
01:14:36,052 --> 01:14:37,633
 - Nick! No, don't do it!

952
01:14:41,182 --> 01:14:43,218
 (explosion)

953
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,846
 (screaming)

954
01:15:03,245 --> 01:15:05,406
 - That truck of soldiers is waiting outside.

955
01:15:05,748 --> 01:15:07,830
 It'll be a dream come true.

956
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:10,283
 (growling)

957
01:15:12,922 --> 01:15:15,709
 - My dream can come true right now.

958
01:15:19,512 --> 01:15:21,798
 (explosion)

959
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:25,806
 I got the last of 'em.

960
01:15:37,697 --> 01:15:40,279
 (magical chimes)

961
01:15:58,884 --> 01:16:01,796
 - Must've been a rowdy crowd tonight.

962
01:16:02,763 --> 01:16:05,175
 - Hey, hey, hey Miss Sincere.

963
01:16:06,642 --> 01:16:08,473
 You know I really liked that show you were doing inside.

964
01:16:08,811 --> 01:16:10,767
 - Okay scumball, the show is over, why don't you just

965
01:16:11,105 --> 01:16:13,266
 climb back under your rock?

966
01:16:13,607 --> 01:16:15,643
 - Daphne, I could've done that.

967
01:16:15,985 --> 01:16:16,724
 - Oh, sorry.

968
01:16:18,446 --> 01:16:21,904
 - Amy, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you.

969
01:16:22,241 --> 01:16:23,276
 - Well you know, no one's ever really noticed me

970
01:16:23,617 --> 01:16:25,153
 before like that.

971
01:16:25,494 --> 01:16:28,236
 I mean, I've always just been thought of as Daphne's friend.

972
01:16:28,581 --> 01:16:32,244
 This is the first time somebody came up to me like that.

973
01:16:32,585 --> 01:16:33,745
 I kinda liked it.

974
01:16:34,086 --> 01:16:36,202
 - Amy I meant what I said.

975
01:16:36,547 --> 01:16:38,253
 I'm gonna prove it to you.

976
01:17:02,948 --> 01:17:04,063
 - Where is he?

977
01:17:12,124 --> 01:17:13,489
 Mr. Comstock, I wasn't sure if you'd still

978
01:17:13,834 --> 01:17:15,040
 be here this late.

979
01:17:15,377 --> 01:17:16,332
 - I'm on my way out the door.

980
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:18,035
 What do you want now?

981
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:19,836
 - The creatures have broken loose.

982
01:17:20,174 --> 01:17:21,254
 The same ones I tried to warn you about

983
01:17:21,592 --> 01:17:23,332
 when I first got my job here.

984
01:17:23,677 --> 01:17:24,416
 - Are you gonna try to tell me that same story

985
01:17:24,762 --> 01:17:27,128
 about the hobgoblins again?

986
01:17:27,473 --> 01:17:28,007
 - Yes sir.

987
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:31,136
 I'm glad you still remember about them.

988
01:17:31,477 --> 01:17:33,342
 - How could I forget that nonsense?

989
01:17:33,687 --> 01:17:35,097
 Now get outta here and get back to work.

990
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:36,724
 - But you don't understand.

991
01:17:37,066 --> 01:17:39,648
 They broke loose tonight, they're out there

992
01:17:39,985 --> 01:17:41,316
 somewhere in the city!

993
01:17:41,654 --> 01:17:43,360
 I already sent the other guard out to try to find them.

994
01:17:43,697 --> 01:17:45,187
 - What?

995
01:17:45,533 --> 01:17:47,569
 You mean there's no one manning the front gate right now?

996
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:48,615
 - No sir.

997
01:17:48,953 --> 01:17:50,238
 - This is preposterous.

998
01:17:50,579 --> 01:17:52,240
 You do know that if something were to happen

999
01:17:52,581 --> 01:17:54,242
 to this studio while no one was on duty,

1000
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:56,699
 our insurance will refuse to pay off?

1001
01:17:57,044 --> 01:17:57,999
 - Yes sir.

1002
01:17:58,337 --> 01:17:59,873
 - Well then get back on your post.

1003
01:18:00,214 --> 01:18:01,454
 - You're not listening!

1004
01:18:01,799 --> 01:18:03,209
 I want to go out and find him.

1005
01:18:03,551 --> 01:18:04,916
 He must need my help by now!

1006
01:18:05,261 --> 01:18:07,422
 - You are not going to leave your job to go out

1007
01:18:07,763 --> 01:18:09,344
 and chase some foolishness.

1008
01:18:09,682 --> 01:18:12,640
 If you walk off this lot, you are fired.

1009
01:18:14,687 --> 01:18:15,597
 - Well good.

1010
01:18:17,064 --> 01:18:19,646
 Saves me the trouble of quitting.

1011
01:18:44,133 --> 01:18:45,339
 - Mr. McCreedy?

1012
01:18:48,679 --> 01:18:49,589
 - Hey there.

1013
01:18:53,517 --> 01:18:55,223
 We have a score to settle.

1014
01:18:55,561 --> 01:18:57,927
 (intense music)

1015
01:19:05,654 --> 01:19:09,192
 - Amy, this time I'm gonna make you proud.

1016
01:19:26,967 --> 01:19:29,208
 (punching)

1017
01:19:30,471 --> 01:19:31,881
 - Amy, I think Kevin's proved his bravery to you,

1018
01:19:32,222 --> 01:19:34,429
 would you tell him to stop before he kills himself?

1019
01:19:35,392 --> 01:19:38,350
 - For God's sake Kevin, stop before he kills you!

1020
01:20:13,847 --> 01:20:17,180
 - Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.

1021
01:20:24,942 --> 01:20:26,227
 - No!

1022
01:20:26,568 --> 01:20:27,683
 (gunshot)

1023
01:20:35,911 --> 01:20:37,993
 (screams)

1024
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:44,241
 (magical chimes)

1025
01:20:46,964 --> 01:20:49,080
 - I'm sorry for sending you out on your own.

1026
01:20:49,425 --> 01:20:50,631
 I should have known the creatures would try to destroy

1027
01:20:50,968 --> 01:20:51,502
 you, also.

1028
01:20:53,053 --> 01:20:54,543
 - Where are they going now?

1029
01:20:54,888 --> 01:20:56,378
 - Back to their home in the vault.

1030
01:20:56,724 --> 01:20:58,589
 Hurry, there isn't much time left.

1031
01:20:58,934 --> 01:20:59,889
 - Kevin, wait.

1032
01:21:01,437 --> 01:21:03,803
 (sultry music)

1033
01:21:09,361 --> 01:21:10,521
 Don't take too long.

1034
01:21:10,863 --> 01:21:11,898
 I'll be waiting.

1035
01:21:14,658 --> 01:21:15,693
 - Let's go!

1036
01:21:39,975 --> 01:21:42,887
 (suspenseful music)

1037
01:21:50,569 --> 01:21:51,479
 - Do you think--

1038
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:52,434
 - Shhh.

1039
01:21:59,787 --> 01:22:01,027
 I was right about them.

1040
01:22:01,371 --> 01:22:02,861
 They're back inside.

1041
01:22:04,333 --> 01:22:06,073
 - Well maybe we should get closer

1042
01:22:06,418 --> 01:22:08,329
 and lock them back inside again.

1043
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:11,207
 - No, I've spent 30 years guarding them,

1044
01:22:11,548 --> 01:22:13,630
 and I was fired from my job tonight.

1045
01:22:13,967 --> 01:22:16,174
 I won't be around here to keep an eye on them.

1046
01:22:16,512 --> 01:22:17,592
 - You were fired?

1047
01:22:18,847 --> 01:22:22,089
 Well, maybe I could guard them from now on.

1048
01:22:23,769 --> 01:22:25,634
 - Oh no, I don't want you to throw your life away

1049
01:22:25,979 --> 01:22:27,310
 the way I had to.

1050
01:22:28,482 --> 01:22:30,143
 There is a better way.

1051
01:22:34,029 --> 01:22:35,109
 - Did you find them?

1052
01:22:35,447 --> 01:22:36,903
 - Yeah, they're back inside the vault.

1053
01:22:37,241 --> 01:22:38,651
 - What are you gonna do to them?

1054
01:22:38,992 --> 01:22:40,198
 - I don't know.

1055
01:22:40,536 --> 01:22:41,571
 - Kevin.

1056
01:22:41,912 --> 01:22:44,654
 Did I ever tell you what I did in the war?

1057
01:22:44,998 --> 01:22:45,828
 - No.

1058
01:22:47,084 --> 01:22:48,244
 - Munitions.

1059
01:22:48,585 --> 01:22:49,700
 (beeping)

1060
01:22:50,045 --> 01:22:51,956
 (explosion)

1061
01:23:01,974 --> 01:23:04,260
 Isn't it ironic that they should pick a movie studio

1062
01:23:04,601 --> 01:23:05,807
 to land?

1063
01:23:06,145 --> 01:23:10,104
 Unless they figured they belonged in a dream factory.

1064
01:23:13,986 --> 01:23:16,193
 - You were my hero tonight.

1065
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,565
 - What?

1066
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:23,400
 Are you sure?

1067
01:23:23,745 --> 01:23:24,780
 - Yeah, I'm sure.

1068
01:23:31,753 --> 01:23:33,334
 - Daphne?

1069
01:23:33,672 --> 01:23:34,411
 - Yeah.

1070
01:23:34,756 --> 01:23:35,916
 - This is for you.

1071
01:23:37,801 --> 01:23:38,711
 - Really?

1072
01:23:39,803 --> 01:23:43,295
 No one's ever given me flowers before.

1073
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:44,925
 - Oh, but there's lots of things I could show you

1074
01:23:45,267 --> 01:23:47,132
 for the first time.

1075
01:23:47,477 --> 01:23:48,057
 Nick.

1076
01:23:48,937 --> 01:23:50,177
 - Nick? - [Amy] Nick?

1077
01:23:50,522 --> 01:23:51,352
 - Nick!

1078
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:52,930
 - Daph, baby!

1079
01:23:54,401 --> 01:23:57,609
 Told you guys I had everything under control.

1080
01:24:00,616 --> 01:24:01,275
 Daphne.

1081
01:24:02,951 --> 01:24:03,861
 - Nicky.

1082
01:24:05,078 --> 01:24:06,113
 - [Both] Van!

1083
01:24:18,842 --> 01:24:20,878
 - Hello, Mr. Comstock.

1084
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:23,802

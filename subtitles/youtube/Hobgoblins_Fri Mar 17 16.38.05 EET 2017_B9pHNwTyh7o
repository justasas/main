(rock music)

2
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:37,980
- Dennis.

3
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:38,855
Dennis!

4
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:43,902
- Hey, what gives?

5
00:00:45,537 --> 00:00:47,323
- You're being paidto work around here!

6
00:00:47,664 --> 00:00:50,076
Not to sit around andblast your eardrums.

7
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:51,872
- Hey, hey, hey, take it easy.

8
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:52,869
I can do both.

9
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:55,918
(phone ringing)

10
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,792
(dial tone)- Hello?

11
00:00:58,132 --> 00:00:58,666
Hello?

12
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,886
Didn't you hearthe phone ringing?

13
00:01:06,224 --> 00:01:07,339
- No, I didn't.

14
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:10,300
- [McCreedy] They'vealready hung up!

15
00:01:10,645 --> 00:01:11,555
- Well then it couldn'thave been too important.

16
00:01:11,896 --> 00:01:14,182
- Don't you have anysense of responsibility?

17
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:16,230
That could have beena very important call.

18
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:18,354
- [Dennis] At this hour?

19
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:19,935
- In the future wouldyou just answer the phone

20
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,441
no matter what hour it is, andnot make your own decisions

21
00:01:22,782 --> 00:01:25,694
about what's importantand what isn't?

22
00:01:26,035 --> 00:01:27,445
- Yeah, yeah, right, right.

23
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:29,869
- It's time for our rounds.

24
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,641
(eerie music)

25
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,063
Did I ever tell youwhat the studio was like

26
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,810
when I first started here?

27
00:02:41,152 --> 00:02:42,232
- Yeah, more than once.

28
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,607
- Oh, it used to be one ofthe busiest lots in town.

29
00:02:45,948 --> 00:02:49,440
- It's a real thrivingmetropolis now.

30
00:02:49,786 --> 00:02:51,572
Hey wait a minute,what's this down here?

31
00:02:51,913 --> 00:02:54,871
- Oh, it's justan old film vault,

32
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,163
there's nothing down there.

33
00:02:56,501 --> 00:02:57,957
- Yeah, but why don'twe check it anyway?

34
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:00,535
- I'm telling you there'snothing down there,

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,044
and I'm not going to wastemy time checking it out.

36
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:06,170
- [Voiceover] McCreedy.

37
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:07,296
- What is it now?

38
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:08,797
- [Voiceover] I needto talk to you now.

39
00:03:09,138 --> 00:03:10,503
- Well I can't right now.

40
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:13,260
- [Voiceover] Now, I mean it.

41
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:15,262
- Finish the rounds.

42
00:03:15,603 --> 00:03:18,140
And remember what I said.

43
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:20,312
- Whatever you say, Pops.

44
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:35,203
(faint rock music in headphones)

45
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:49,425
(intense music)

46
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,151
- What took you so long?

47
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:09,649
- I made it asquickly as I could,

48
00:04:09,991 --> 00:04:11,401
I was clear across the lot.

49
00:04:11,743 --> 00:04:13,984
- You're not as youngas you used to be.

50
00:04:14,328 --> 00:04:16,284
I tried calling you atthe main gate before,

51
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:18,487
why didn't you answer the phone?

52
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,949
- I must have caughtit just as you hung up.

53
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,161
- Well let's be a littlemore efficient from now on.

54
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:26,336
How's the new boy doing?

55
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:28,164
- Fine, fine.

56
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:29,669
But I really need to get back.

57
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:32,343
- Just a minute, I wanttalk to you about these

58
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,422
beer cans I foundin the front gate.

59
00:04:37,727 --> 00:04:40,434
(ominous music)

60
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,101
- So there's nothing down here.

61
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:56,739
I wonder what they keep in here.

62
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,079
Yoohoo, Mr. McCreedy?

63
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,792
(growling)

64
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,145
Is somebody there?

65
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:12,522
(growling)

66
00:06:21,289 --> 00:06:22,529
Is somebody there?

67
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,866
(radio static)

68
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:32,755
- I'll give you areport in the morning.

69
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,233
(feedback squealing)

70
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,657
(crowd cheering)

71
00:06:59,994 --> 00:07:02,280
(rock music)

72
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:41,319
(cries out)

73
00:07:45,873 --> 00:07:48,455
(creepy music)

74
00:08:11,983 --> 00:08:13,564
(door slams shut)

75
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:30,786
(eerie music)

76
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:47,528
- Another one quit?!

77
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:51,241
What was the problem this time?

78
00:09:51,582 --> 00:09:53,493
- I'm not sure whatthe problem was, sir.

79
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:55,665
- It wasn't somethingyou said to him, was it?

80
00:09:56,003 --> 00:09:56,867
- [McCreedy] It could have been.

81
00:09:57,213 --> 00:09:59,545
- I'm holding you responsiblefor this, McCreedy.

82
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:01,873
Every time we hire anew guard he only lasts

83
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:04,504
for a couple ofweeks, then he's gone.

84
00:10:04,845 --> 00:10:07,131
How many is it now, three, four?

85
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,338
- It's three, and Ireally don't think

86
00:10:09,683 --> 00:10:11,548
you need to hire anyone else.

87
00:10:11,894 --> 00:10:13,680
I can run the post myself.

88
00:10:14,021 --> 00:10:16,012
- Look, you've beenhere for a long time.

89
00:10:16,357 --> 00:10:18,393
You know as well as Ido that we need to have

90
00:10:18,734 --> 00:10:20,565
a second guard ready sohe can fill in for you

91
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:23,019
if you can't makeit here some night.

92
00:10:23,364 --> 00:10:25,901
- But I've never missed anight since I've been here!

93
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:28,198
- You're not as young asyou used to be, we need

94
00:10:28,536 --> 00:10:29,616
to be prepared.

95
00:10:29,954 --> 00:10:31,615
Do you know that if somethingwere to happen to this studio

96
00:10:31,956 --> 00:10:36,040
while no one was on duty,our insurance is voided?

97
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:38,208
- This place has beendeserted for almost 30 years.

98
00:10:38,546 --> 00:10:40,537
- Stop making excuses.

99
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:43,338
I want you to hire a new guard,

100
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,668
and this time hire one whowill stick around for a while.

101
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:48,798
Or else I'll hire two.

102
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:55,096
- So, Kevin, is this thefirst time that you've worked

103
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:57,393
as a security guard?

104
00:10:57,731 --> 00:11:00,598
- Yes sir, but I'm a veryfast learner, and I promise

105
00:11:00,943 --> 00:11:02,683
to try extra hard.

106
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:04,734
And I really need the job.

107
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:10,237
- Well you sound verymature for your age.

108
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:13,320
You don't own one of thoseportable radios with headphones,

109
00:11:13,664 --> 00:11:14,198
do you?

110
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:16,037
- No sir.

111
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:20,208
- That's good, I thinkwe'll get along just fine.

112
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:24,205
Now, are you ready foryour first tour of the lot?

113
00:11:24,633 --> 00:11:27,625
- Oh, oh yes sir, evenprepared to take notes.

114
00:11:29,972 --> 00:11:32,008
- It's not that complicated.

115
00:11:45,821 --> 00:11:48,187
You've never been on astudio lot like this before,

116
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:49,362
have you?

117
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,689
- No sir.

118
00:11:51,035 --> 00:11:52,445
- Well, it's not thatdifficult to keep track of.

119
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:55,528
Now there isn't muchgoes on here anymore.

120
00:11:55,873 --> 00:11:57,113
- How long have youbeen working here?

121
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:59,540
- Oh, quite a while.

122
00:11:59,877 --> 00:12:01,742
About 30 years, actually.

123
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:03,668
And I've never misseda day and had to have

124
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:06,122
someone fill in for me.

125
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:08,549
- 30 years, that's amazing.

126
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:09,875
- Well, not really.

127
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:11,961
You know, timebecomes sort of a blur

128
00:12:12,306 --> 00:12:14,297
when you reach a certain age.

129
00:12:14,642 --> 00:12:16,132
Sometime I'll tell youwhat this place was like

130
00:12:16,477 --> 00:12:18,934
when it was still afunctioning studio.

131
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,637
- I'd like to hear about that.

132
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:26,396
(mysterious music)

133
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:32,655
- Now Kevin, if I toldyou that something

134
00:12:32,993 --> 00:12:35,655
was very important, you'dlisten to me, wouldn't you?

135
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:36,781
- Of course.

136
00:12:37,122 --> 00:12:38,111
- Good.

137
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:39,822
Now there is a part ofthis lot that I want you

138
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:41,623
to stay away from.

139
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,873
I don't want to have toexplain all the details to you,

140
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:48,001
I just want you to promiseto stay clear of it.

141
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:49,878
- I understand.

142
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:53,882
- Now this is the partI was telling you about.

143
00:12:58,269 --> 00:12:59,429
- What's down there?

144
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,681
- It's just a lot ofdangerous machinery.

145
00:13:02,022 --> 00:13:03,853
Now don't go in there andtake the chance of injuring

146
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:05,101
yourself, do you understand?

147
00:13:06,068 --> 00:13:06,773
- Yeah.

148
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:10,360
- Good, now I don'twant to have to

149
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:12,529
remind you a second time.

150
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,154
Just stay clear of this area.

151
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,878
- So is there anything elseI need to be made aware of?

152
00:13:28,215 --> 00:13:30,001
- There is one other thing.

153
00:13:38,726 --> 00:13:41,092
This is what I wastelling you about.

154
00:13:42,563 --> 00:13:44,895
Oh, but don't worry, I'venever had to use it.

155
00:13:45,232 --> 00:13:46,221
- Really?

156
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:48,979
- That's right, not in allthe years I've been here.

157
00:13:49,945 --> 00:13:53,028
But I would like to show youhow to use it sometime though,

158
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:56,402
you never know whenyou might need it.

159
00:13:56,744 --> 00:13:59,076
(ominous music)

160
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:28,184
- Hi.

161
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:30,686
- Not now, yourfriends are here.

162
00:14:33,614 --> 00:14:35,570
- Hey, how's it going?

163
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:40,192
- What'd you bring,some new music?

164
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:42,619
- No, I just rented avideotape that Amy and I

165
00:14:42,956 --> 00:14:43,945
were gonna watch.

166
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,371
- Well that was very nice.

167
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:47,370
- Let me see what you got.

168
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:48,951
What?

169
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:50,752
Don't you ever get any tapesfrom the adult section?

170
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,330
My boyfriend wouldnever bring me a tape

171
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:55,336
that didn't have atleast a single X rating.

172
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:56,917
- Well Kevin isn't like that.

173
00:14:57,262 --> 00:15:00,049
He would never want me to seeanything that was rated X.

174
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:01,221
Would you?

175
00:15:01,558 --> 00:15:02,798
- No, I wouldn't.

176
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:13,851
(horn beeps)

177
00:15:15,906 --> 00:15:18,238
- Oh right man, I'drecognize that horn anywhere,

178
00:15:18,575 --> 00:15:19,530
that's my Nick.

179
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:21,199
Back from two monthsof army training,

180
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:23,528
and you know what a manwants when he's been away

189
00:15:57,197 --> 00:15:57,982
- No, no.

190
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,748

192
00:16:12,421 --> 00:16:14,582

193

00:16:32,274 --> 00:16:33,889
something and knowing how to use it.

203
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:36,099
- Would it be okayif I used your phone?

204
00:16:36,445 --> 00:16:38,060

00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,989
- What else did youdo with the gun?

210
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:52,829

Yet.

215
00:17:04,598 --> 00:17:06,554

238
00:18:39,234 --> 00:18:40,519

- What's the matter, Kevin?

294
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:09,418

00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:12,541
- I've got all thetime in the world.

296
00:23:16,386 --> 00:23:20,470
- What do you do about someonewho you can never make happy?

297
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,551

308
00:23:56,718 --> 00:23:57,377
Uh-oh.

318
00:25:12,002 --> 00:25:13,458
- Get away from him.

319
00:25:15,255 --> 00:25:16,791
- Who's this, your grandson?

320
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:18,668

00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:22,960
- I said, get away from him.

322
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:26,304
- Who are you kidding?

323
00:25:26,641 --> 00:25:28,848
You don't know how to use that.

324
00:25:33,523 --> 00:25:35,605
(gunshot)

325
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:39,852
(coughing)

326
00:25:40,196 --> 00:25:41,185
- Are you okay?

327
00:25:41,531 --> 00:25:42,145
Do you want me tocall an ambulance?

328
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:43,855
- No no, I'm fine.

329
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,440
- Damn.

330
00:25:45,785 --> 00:25:46,695
- What's the matter?

331
00:25:47,037 --> 00:25:47,901
- I just wish Amycould've been here to see

332
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:49,406
what I just did.

333
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,115
- He's still on the lot.

334
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,540
- What do we do now?

335
00:25:54,878 --> 00:25:55,958
- I'm going to call the police.

336
00:25:56,296 --> 00:25:58,958
Try to locate where he is,but keep a distance from him.

337
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:00,960
Don't try to be a hero.

338
00:26:13,646 --> 00:26:16,513
(suspenseful music)

339
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:52,886
- Mr. McCreedy?

340
00:26:54,604 --> 00:26:57,892
I'm going down that hallwaywhere all the machinery is.

341
00:26:58,233 --> 00:26:59,564
I think he went down there.

342
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:02,392
I'm going in for a closer look.

343
00:27:12,705 --> 00:27:14,411
- Good God, the vault!

344
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:19,242

348
00:27:40,024 --> 00:27:42,515

(growling)

350
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,396
- We're too late!

351
00:29:03,733 --> 00:29:05,519
Kevin, why did you go in there?

352
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,771
Why didn't you listen to me?

353
00:29:27,674 --> 00:29:28,834

354
00:29:29,175 --> 00:29:31,837

00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:10,664
- I don't understand!

358
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:12,499

360
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:18,672
Those creatures,the vault, I tried.

361
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:25,683
All my work, 30 years I'vebeen trying to prevent this

362
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,434
from happening.

363
00:30:27,775 --> 00:30:29,891
- To prevent whatfrom happening?

364
00:30:30,236 --> 00:30:31,521
- Those creatures.

365
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:36,357
Why do you think I spent thelast 30 years of my life here?

366
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,158
I was keeping themfrom escaping.

367
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:43,993
I was young when Ibegan to work here,

368
00:30:44,334 --> 00:30:47,371
and the studio wasbusy and prosperous.

369
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:54,253
I'll always remember thenight that it happened.

370
00:30:54,594 --> 00:30:57,927
It was late, there washardly anyone around.

371
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,715
I didn't even knowwhat it was at first.

372
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:05,222
It was all so fast,just a flash of light

373
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,144
and then a sudden explosion.

374
00:31:07,815 --> 00:31:09,851
I stepped out tosee what it was,

375
00:31:10,193 --> 00:31:13,526
but there was no oneelse there except for me.

376
00:31:17,325 --> 00:31:19,862
It was right in themiddle of the lot.

377
00:31:20,203 --> 00:31:22,694
Had it been daytime, itprobably would have been crushed

378
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,245
in all the traffic.

379
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:29,041
I just stared atit for a long time.

380
00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:31,961
I didn't know whatto make of it.

381
00:31:32,298 --> 00:31:34,209
And then suddenly it moved.

382
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:37,713
And out from the top of thedisc came this small creature,

383
00:31:38,054 --> 00:31:39,385
a sort of hobgoblin.

384
00:31:40,515 --> 00:31:44,428
It looked around and thenit stared right at me.

385
00:31:46,187 --> 00:31:49,475
I didn't move, I justkept watching him.

386
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:53,691
Looked so friendly at first.

387
00:31:55,196 --> 00:31:57,903
If only I'd knownwhat lay ahead.

388
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:04,073
- But I still don't understand.

389
00:32:04,414 --> 00:32:08,908
- I let the creatures liveon the lot, it was my secret.

390
00:32:09,252 --> 00:32:11,334
And then I learned ofthe power they had.

391
00:32:11,671 --> 00:32:13,081
I still don't knowif they figured

392
00:32:13,423 --> 00:32:17,041
they were doing goodfor people or not.

393
00:32:17,385 --> 00:32:21,799
They slowly began todestroy everyone on the lot.

394
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,597
They would find a person,tap into his brain,

395
00:32:24,934 --> 00:32:28,176
and then create hiswildest fantasy.

396
00:32:28,521 --> 00:32:31,479
It seemed harmless at first,I mean, watching everyone

397
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:35,775
around me becoming rich orfamous, but for most people

398
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:41,314
what they really want inlife can be very dangerous.

399
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,947
In fact, the creatures woundup destroying everyone,

400
00:32:45,288 --> 00:32:47,950
everyone they camein contact with.

401
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:51,700
They're, they're, they're loosein the city now.

402
00:32:52,044 --> 00:32:53,830
- But you could warn everyone.

403
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,003
They'd listen to your story.

404
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,420
- Would they?

405
00:32:57,758 --> 00:33:00,841
No one believed me 30 years ago.

406
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,259
I went straight tothe head of the studio

407
00:33:02,597 --> 00:33:03,882
and tried to explain it to him.

408
00:33:04,223 --> 00:33:05,212
He didn't believeme, no one did.

409
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:09,346
I just watched helplesslyas people around me

410
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,678
were destroyed, one by one.

411
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:14,104
- Then what can we do?

412
00:33:16,652 --> 00:33:19,064
- I'm too old to catchup with them now,

413
00:33:19,405 --> 00:33:21,441
but you might stillhave a chance.

414
00:33:21,782 --> 00:33:25,115
There aren't very many ofthem, but they move quickly.

415
00:33:25,453 --> 00:33:28,286
Just remember, they'reattracted to bright lights,

416
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:31,330
that's how you can fight them.

417
00:33:31,667 --> 00:33:34,033
Watch everyone around you.

418
00:33:34,378 --> 00:33:36,164
When a person beginsto act strangely,

419
00:33:36,506 --> 00:33:37,916
it means that oneof the creatures

420
00:33:38,257 --> 00:33:40,623
have tapped into his mind.

421
00:33:40,968 --> 00:33:42,674
When this happens, thecreature is never far away.

422
00:33:43,012 --> 00:33:45,048
Find it and kill itbefore it's too late.

423
00:33:45,389 --> 00:33:48,426
Because when the creaturedies, the fantasy ends

424
00:33:48,768 --> 00:33:50,599
and the victim is safe.

425
00:33:50,937 --> 00:33:55,101
Now remember, they're onlyattracted to bright light.

426
00:33:55,441 --> 00:33:57,056
That's how you find them.

427
00:33:57,401 --> 00:33:59,983
But you must destroythem all before dawn

428
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:02,186
because once it'sdaylight, it's too late.

429
00:34:02,532 --> 00:34:03,521
- Okay.

430
00:34:03,866 --> 00:34:06,653
- You'll never beable to stop them.

431
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:09,280
(ominous music)

432
00:34:18,714 --> 00:34:19,874
(record scratch)

433
00:34:20,216 --> 00:34:22,332
(dance music)

434
00:34:27,223 --> 00:34:28,133
- Alright!

435
00:34:43,197 --> 00:34:45,153
(growling)

436
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:55,373
Come on Amy, wouldyou get with it?

437
00:35:00,464 --> 00:35:02,420
(growling)

438
00:35:12,393 --> 00:35:14,805
(horn beeps)

439
00:35:15,146 --> 00:35:18,183
That car horn, I'drecognize it anywhere!

440
00:35:20,526 --> 00:35:22,938
(horn beeps)

441
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:26,104
See you guys later.

442
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:28,488
Much later.

443
00:35:32,288 --> 00:35:33,243
That's weird.

444
00:35:34,624 --> 00:35:38,208
Maybe he's circlingthe block or something.

445
00:35:41,255 --> 00:35:42,870
- I brought your jacket.

446
00:35:43,215 --> 00:35:44,580
I thought you mightbe cold out here.

447
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:46,756
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

448
00:35:47,094 --> 00:35:48,083
- Where's Nick?

449
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:49,885
I thought I heardhis horn before.

450
00:35:50,222 --> 00:35:50,881
- So did I.

451
00:35:52,308 --> 00:35:54,173
- Well maybe you should waitinside until you see him.

452
00:35:54,518 --> 00:35:56,054
- He's just lookingfor a place to park,

453
00:35:56,395 --> 00:35:57,760
now would you goback in the house?

454
00:35:58,105 --> 00:35:59,936
- There's plenty of parkingin front, maybe it wasn't

455
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:01,184
his horn?

456
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:02,685
- Look, I'm positive it was.

457
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:04,312
Maybe the policejust pulled him over

458
00:36:04,654 --> 00:36:05,769
for all his warrantsor something.

459
00:36:06,113 --> 00:36:07,102
Now would you justgo back in the house?

460
00:36:07,448 --> 00:36:08,358
- Fine, I get the message.

461
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,782
- Just take thisstupid jacket with you.

462
00:36:16,791 --> 00:36:18,782
Damnit Nick, wherethe hell are you?

463
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:34,634
(growling)

464
00:36:34,975 --> 00:36:36,465
Amy, would you justgo back in the house

465
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:38,142
and leave me alone?

466
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:43,605
And would you stopbreathing all over me?

467
00:36:44,193 --> 00:36:45,057
(growls)

468
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,314
(screaming)

469
00:36:52,118 --> 00:36:54,985
- Sounds like Nickfinally got here.

470
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,332
- Get the fuck off me!

471
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,296
- She must be happy to see him.

472
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:21,226
- Take that, you little bastard!

473
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:43,449
- Honestly, couldn't Nick wait?

474
00:37:45,087 --> 00:37:47,874
(screaming)

475
00:37:49,884 --> 00:37:52,626
(growling)

476
00:38:21,415 --> 00:38:22,621
Go on, grab it!

477
00:38:23,626 --> 00:38:25,537
- It's like a new dance.

478
00:38:30,216 --> 00:38:31,877
Looks pretty kinky.

479
00:38:33,052 --> 00:38:34,417
Hey guys!

480
00:38:34,762 --> 00:38:36,093
- Nick, thank God you're here!

481
00:38:36,472 --> 00:38:38,008
Something wild came out of the woodsand attacked us!

482
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:39,464
- I know I'm here to take ya out.

483
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:41,549
- Oh it's those rabid animals!

484
00:38:47,566 --> 00:38:49,852
(screaming)

485
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,061
(growling)

486
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:21,088
I knew I'd find a use for this.

487
00:39:25,187 --> 00:39:27,473
Just open the doorand stand back.

488
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:29,225
- Oh my God, whatdo you call that?

489
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,730
- Urban renewal.

490
00:39:42,037 --> 00:39:42,822
- Wait!

491
00:39:52,131 --> 00:39:53,291
No, put that out!

492
00:39:59,722 --> 00:40:01,963
(growling)

493
00:40:06,896 --> 00:40:08,352
You guys okay?

494
00:40:08,689 --> 00:40:10,429
- Yeah, I'm just peachy.

495
00:40:10,774 --> 00:40:12,355
- I had everythingunder control.

496
00:40:12,693 --> 00:40:15,685
- Good, then you canfinish off your van.

497
00:40:29,835 --> 00:40:32,827
- I don't understand,what were those things?

498
00:40:33,172 --> 00:40:34,412
- It's a long story.

499
00:40:34,757 --> 00:40:36,293
What they do to yourbody is nothing compared

500
00:40:36,634 --> 00:40:38,090
to what they do to your mind.

501
00:40:38,427 --> 00:40:40,338
- Don't have toworry about that.

502
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,169
- You sure you're all okay?

503
00:40:42,514 --> 00:40:45,221
I mean, you don't feelanything different, do you?

504
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:47,424
- I think I wet my pants.

505
00:40:48,938 --> 00:40:50,803
Hey, I was only kidding.

506
00:40:52,274 --> 00:40:54,765
- And none of you havea desire to do anything

507
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,396
you've never done before, right?

508
00:40:57,738 --> 00:40:58,648
- I don't thinkthere's anything left

509
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,525
that we haven't done before.

510
00:41:00,866 --> 00:41:02,322
- How 'bout you, Amy?

511
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,321
- Well actually I dowanna try this new Chinese

512
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:07,119
restaurant that I heard about.

513
00:41:07,456 --> 00:41:07,990
- Kyle?

514
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:10,535
- Could I use yourtelephone again?

515
00:41:10,876 --> 00:41:12,332
I wanna call my girlfriend.

516
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,410
- We still haven't metthis mystery girl of yours,

517
00:41:14,755 --> 00:41:16,746
what kind of relationshipdo the two of you have?

518
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:20,834
- I guess you'd say it'sa fantasy relationship.

519
00:41:34,483 --> 00:41:36,940
(ominous music)

520
00:41:55,963 --> 00:41:58,124
(growling)

521
00:42:14,857 --> 00:42:17,314
(phone ringing)

522
00:42:17,651 --> 00:42:19,391
- Hi, it's me, Fantasia.

523
00:42:20,362 --> 00:42:21,818
Thanks for calling.

524
00:42:22,156 --> 00:42:24,442
I need a new house petto impress my friends.

525
00:42:24,783 --> 00:42:26,614
Now hurry beforethe zookeeper comes,

526
00:42:26,952 --> 00:42:29,614
help me hide thisiguana on my body.

527
00:42:29,955 --> 00:42:32,071
Uh, can I help you, miss?

528
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:36,500
Oh yes Mr. Beastmaster,something just crawled up my leg.

529
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:39,544
Oh, see if you can find it.

530
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:44,500
I think you'd better comeback to my office with me.

531
00:42:44,845 --> 00:42:47,507
Now wait a minute, areyou sure your office

532
00:42:47,848 --> 00:42:50,134
is in the baboon pit?

533
00:42:50,476 --> 00:42:54,435
Mister zookeeper, what doyou think you're doing?

534
00:42:54,772 --> 00:42:57,980
This isn't thechildren's petting zoo.

535
00:42:58,317 --> 00:43:02,276
I have a new house pet foryou, miss, ha ha ha ha ha.

536
00:43:03,697 --> 00:43:06,439
Oh, mister zookeeper, Icould never take a cockatoo

537
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:07,318
that size.

538
00:43:09,703 --> 00:43:11,443
(record scratch)

539
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:14,531
Now stop wasting yourmoney calling me.

540
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:17,036
I'm right outside your door.

541
00:43:18,337 --> 00:43:20,953

So I've heard.

00:45:34,139 --> 00:45:35,128

564
00:45:35,474 --> 00:45:37,135

565
00:45:37,476 --> 00:45:39,012
I've gotta go acrosstown and get Kyle.

00:45:39,353 --> 00:45:40,513

Don't make a moveor do anything.

00:45:42,356 --> 00:45:45,894
And above all, don'tfantasize about anything!

569
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:05,917
- You know, girls, I couldthink of a fantasy right now.

570
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,542
It's involving the number three.

571
00:46:33,991 --> 00:46:36,698
- Oh Fantasia, you'remy ideal woman.

572
00:46:37,035 --> 00:46:39,617
You're intelligent, you'vegot a wonderful personality,

573
00:46:39,955 --> 00:46:41,286

Will you marry me?

576
00:46:46,044 --> 00:46:49,753
- Skip the ceremony, we'regoing straight to the honeymoon.

577
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:59,255
Oh Fantasia, baby I couldwatch you all night long.

578
00:47:00,392 --> 00:47:02,132

579
00:47:02,477 --> 00:47:03,637
all night long.

580
00:47:04,104 --> 00:47:06,311
Now hurry, I know a shortcut.

581
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:45,300
Oh, don't park here.

582
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:47,890
- Why not?

583
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:51,102
- You have to park near the edge

584
00:47:51,443 --> 00:47:53,809
if you want to go all the way.

585
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:56,357
- Oh yeah, sure.

586
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:07,827
How's that?

587
00:48:09,252 --> 00:48:10,708
- Perfect.

588
00:48:11,046 --> 00:48:12,331
- That was someshortcut you knew about.

589
00:48:12,672 --> 00:48:13,502
I never knew therewas a road through

590
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,796
the children's playground.

591
00:48:17,177 --> 00:48:18,087
- There isn't.

592
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,840
(laughs)

593
00:48:21,181 --> 00:48:23,638
Well, what are you waiting for?

594
00:48:33,652 --> 00:48:36,894
- Fantasia, where are you going?

595
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:39,855
- I wanted a betterview of the city.

596
00:48:42,077 --> 00:48:44,238
You can see it all from here.

597
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,616
Now, isn't that a lovely view?

598
00:48:52,712 --> 00:48:54,077
- Oh, it sure is.

599
00:48:55,590 --> 00:48:57,501
Where are you going now?

600
00:48:59,261 --> 00:49:01,502
- Just wait a second.

601
00:49:01,847 --> 00:49:03,963
You just keep watching the view.

602
00:49:04,307 --> 00:49:08,266
Just hold tight and get readyfor the ride of your life.

603
00:49:10,105 --> 00:49:11,185
- Do it to me.

604
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:17,317
(groaning)

605
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,741
You need any help?

606
00:49:29,082 --> 00:49:30,993
- Would you get backinside and wait for me?

607
00:49:31,334 --> 00:49:32,995
This time don't move!

608
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:39,880
We're almost there.

609
00:49:40,218 --> 00:49:43,506
Just think nastythoughts while you wait.

610
00:49:45,056 --> 00:49:47,923
(suspenseful music)

611
00:50:01,281 --> 00:50:03,488
(groaning)

612
00:50:14,127 --> 00:50:16,118
(growling)

613
00:50:34,439 --> 00:50:36,145
- Do it do me, baby.

614
00:50:39,486 --> 00:50:40,771
- You damn fool!

615
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:43,945
What are you doing here?

616
00:50:44,282 --> 00:50:45,647
- I want you tomeet my girlfriend.

617
00:50:45,992 --> 00:50:46,731
Wait 'til you see her.

618
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:47,862

619
00:50:48,203 --> 00:50:48,942
Honey?

620
00:50:49,287 --> 00:50:50,026
- Kyle, there's no girl.

621
00:50:50,372 --> 00:50:51,908
She was a figmentof your imagination.

622
00:50:52,249 --> 00:50:53,955
- No she's not, she'sjust hiding somewhere.

623
00:50:54,292 --> 00:50:55,782
I told you, she's a shy girl.

624
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,832
Sweetie?

625
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,125
- Shy girl?

626
00:50:58,463 --> 00:51:00,169
That bleached blondewitch almost killed you!

627
00:51:01,883 --> 00:51:04,795
She was back there trying topush your car over the cliff!

628
00:51:05,136 --> 00:51:06,091
Hey, come on!

629
00:51:09,516 --> 00:51:11,632

630
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,056
(explosion)

631
00:51:26,533 --> 00:51:27,192
- Whoa.

632
00:51:28,743 --> 00:51:30,608
- Now do you believe me?

633
00:51:37,335 --> 00:51:40,042
(ominous music)

634
00:51:53,351 --> 00:51:56,309
I'll discuss my phonebill with you later.

635
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:57,768
Oh no.

636
00:52:00,609 --> 00:52:01,974
They're gone!

637
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:06,278

638
00:52:18,585 --> 00:52:19,995

640
00:52:29,638 --> 00:52:31,003
- Hit the creature!

641
00:52:41,399 --> 00:52:42,104
Idiot.

642
00:52:48,114 --> 00:52:51,652
The creatures brokeloose, are you guys okay?

643
00:52:51,993 --> 00:52:53,858
- We're doing just fine.

644
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:55,819
- What about Amy, where's she?

645
00:52:56,164 --> 00:52:57,745
- She was acting kinda strange.

646
00:52:58,083 --> 00:52:58,993
- [Kevin] What?

647
00:52:59,334 --> 00:53:00,323

649
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:02,288
- What?

650
00:53:02,629 --> 00:53:03,835
Why didn't you try to stop her?

651
00:53:04,172 --> 00:53:05,287
- What's the big deal?

652
00:53:05,632 --> 00:53:06,621
I've been there before.

653
00:53:06,966 --> 00:53:07,955
- You guys, don'tyou understand?

654
00:53:08,301 --> 00:53:10,166
These creatures have a power.

655
00:53:10,512 --> 00:53:12,173
They can tap into yourbrain and sense the things

656
00:53:12,514 --> 00:53:14,721
that you really wanna do.

657
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:16,173
- What's wrong with that?

658
00:53:16,518 --> 00:53:17,883
- They also try to kill you.

659
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,093
I just chased Kyle across townand pulled him out of his car

660
00:53:20,438 --> 00:53:22,850
right before it rolledover a cliff and blew up.

661
00:53:23,191 --> 00:53:24,226
- It's still burning now.

662
00:53:24,567 --> 00:53:27,183
- You see what I'm tryingto tell you guys now?

663
00:53:27,529 --> 00:53:29,144
- What could happenat that nightclub?

664
00:53:29,489 --> 00:53:30,319
- Well there's a lot of bikers

665
00:53:30,657 --> 00:53:32,648
and people fighting everywhere,and I've seen people

666
00:53:32,992 --> 00:53:34,027
dealing drugs and knife fights.

667
00:53:34,369 --> 00:53:34,983
- What?

668
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:36,485
Oh no, come on, we've gotta go.

669
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:37,576
Come on!

670
00:53:38,957 --> 00:53:39,821
- And I've seen the policearresting people there

671
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:41,656

672
00:53:42,544 --> 00:53:44,284
- Oh no, come on!

673
00:53:44,629 --> 00:53:46,870
(rock music)

674
00:54:08,695 --> 00:54:10,731
Daphne, I think yougot this all wrong.

675
00:54:11,072 --> 00:54:13,358
Amy would never cometo a place like this.

676
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:15,315
She won't even go through themall parking lot by herself.

677
00:54:15,702 --> 00:54:17,317
- Would you just listen to me.

678
00:54:17,662 --> 00:54:19,027
You guys have to have acertain kind of attitude

679
00:54:19,372 --> 00:54:20,487
when you're inthis part of town.

680
00:54:20,832 --> 00:54:22,788
You've gotta looklike you belong, okay?

681
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:24,662
- Yeah, I get it.

682
00:54:25,712 --> 00:54:27,202
- Look, would you just listento me and nothing will happen.

683
00:54:27,547 --> 00:54:29,128
Now look, I think one of usshould hold all the wallets

684
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:31,047
for safe-keeping.

685
00:54:31,384 --> 00:54:31,918
You.

686
00:54:35,346 --> 00:54:37,462
Now quiet and just be cool.

687
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:44,511

688
00:54:46,566 --> 00:54:47,351

01:12:59,658 --> 01:13:01,523
- Hey look, there's Amy!

904
01:13:05,539 --> 01:13:07,655
Amy, are you okay?

905
01:13:08,834 --> 01:13:09,994
- I'm not sure.

906
01:13:10,335 --> 01:13:12,121
Why am I dressed likea rock video slut?

907
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:14,124
- It's a long story,I'll explain later.

908
01:13:18,594 --> 01:13:19,754
- You there.

909
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:21,881
Name, rank, serial number.

910
01:13:22,222 --> 01:13:24,338
- Don't shoot me,I'm just an employee.

911
01:13:24,683 --> 01:13:27,220
I don't even bookthe talent here.

912
01:13:30,522 --> 01:13:32,183
- Sergeant, can't you stop him?

913
01:13:32,524 --> 01:13:33,434
- Why?

914
01:13:33,775 --> 01:13:34,890
This is the besttraining he's ever had.

915
01:13:35,235 --> 01:13:36,475
You could never getthis at boot camp.

916
01:13:36,820 --> 01:13:38,151
- You call that training?

917
01:13:38,488 --> 01:13:39,898
He could kill somebody.

918
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:42,071
- War isn't pretty.

919
01:13:42,409 --> 01:13:43,364
- Daphne and Nickare still inside,

920
01:13:43,702 --> 01:13:45,488
we gotta try and help 'em.

921
01:13:45,829 --> 01:13:47,035
- Wait.

922
01:13:47,372 --> 01:13:49,283
I have a specialmission for you.

923
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:50,455
- You do?

924
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:51,451
- Yes.

925
01:13:51,793 --> 01:13:55,285
Have you ever consideredjoining the USO?

926
01:13:55,631 --> 01:13:56,620
- The USO?

927
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:57,624
- Yes, think of it.

928
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,046
Entertain thetroops, doing your part

929
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:01,296
for our country.

930
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:03,377
A small but patriotic gesturethat would be appreciated

931
01:14:03,722 --> 01:14:07,214
by our boys off fightingaround the world.

932
01:14:07,559 --> 01:14:08,298
- I'll do it!

933
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:09,474
- Good!

934
01:14:09,811 --> 01:14:11,301
You can start right away.

935
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:14,309
I've got a truckload ofsoldiers out in the parking lot.

936
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:17,357
If you start now you can befinished with them by morning.

937
01:14:17,694 --> 01:14:18,228
- What?

938
01:14:18,946 --> 01:14:20,402
Nick, do something, yourSergeant's after me.

939
01:14:21,031 --> 01:14:22,396
Just shoot him!

940
01:14:22,741 --> 01:14:24,356
- One more time, babe.

941
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:26,487
Here, do it yourself.

942
01:14:26,828 --> 01:14:27,817
- Stop wasting time.

943
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:29,448
- Nick!

944
01:14:29,790 --> 01:14:31,405
- Maybe I should send Nick offto some third world country.

945
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:33,741
That'll give you allthe time that you need.

946
01:14:34,086 --> 01:14:35,371
- Let go of me!

947
01:14:35,712 --> 01:14:36,497
- Or maybe I should get Nickout of the picture altogether.

948
01:14:36,838 --> 01:14:39,671
Nick, this is yoursergeant speaking!

949
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:41,168
Save the troops!

950
01:14:41,551 --> 01:14:43,041
That's an order!

951
01:14:43,387 --> 01:14:44,968
- Nick! No, don't do it!

952
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:50,553
(explosion)

953
01:14:51,895 --> 01:14:54,181
(screaming)

954
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:12,741
- That truck of soldiersis waiting outside.

955
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:15,165
It'll be a dream come true.

956
01:15:15,502 --> 01:15:17,618
(growling)

957
01:15:20,257 --> 01:15:23,044
- My dream can cometrue right now.

958
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:29,133
(explosion)

959
01:15:31,435 --> 01:15:33,141
I got the last of 'em.

960
01:15:45,032 --> 01:15:47,614
(magical chimes)

961
01:16:06,219 --> 01:16:09,131
- Must've been arowdy crowd tonight.

962
01:16:10,098 --> 01:16:12,510
- Hey, hey, hey Miss Sincere.

963
01:16:13,977 --> 01:16:15,808
You know I really liked thatshow you were doing inside.

964
01:16:16,146 --> 01:16:18,102
- Okay scumball, the showis over, why don't you just

965
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,601
climb back under your rock?

966
01:16:20,942 --> 01:16:22,978
- Daphne, I could've done that.

967
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,059
- Oh, sorry.

968
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:29,239
- Amy, I want you to know thatI'll always be there for you.

969
01:16:29,576 --> 01:16:30,611
- Well you know, no one'sever really noticed me

970
01:16:30,952 --> 01:16:32,488
before like that.

971
01:16:32,829 --> 01:16:35,571
I mean, I've always just beenthought of as Daphne's friend.

972
01:16:35,916 --> 01:16:39,579
This is the first time somebodycame up to me like that.

973
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,080
I kinda liked it.

974
01:16:41,421 --> 01:16:43,537
- Amy I meant what I said.

975
01:16:43,882 --> 01:16:45,588
I'm gonna prove it to you.

976
01:17:10,283 --> 01:17:11,398
- Where is he?

977
01:17:19,459 --> 01:17:20,824
Mr. Comstock, I wasn'tsure if you'd still

978
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:22,375
be here this late.

979
01:17:22,712 --> 01:17:23,667
- I'm on my way out the door.

980
01:17:24,005 --> 01:17:25,370
What do you want now?

981
01:17:25,715 --> 01:17:27,171
- The creatureshave broken loose.

982
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:28,589
The same ones I triedto warn you about

983
01:17:28,927 --> 01:17:30,667
when I first got my job here.

984
01:17:31,012 --> 01:17:31,751
- Are you gonna try totell me that same story

985
01:17:32,097 --> 01:17:34,463
about the hobgoblins again?

986
01:17:34,808 --> 01:17:35,342
- Yes sir.

987
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:38,471
I'm glad you stillremember about them.

988
01:17:38,812 --> 01:17:40,677
- How could I forgetthat nonsense?

989
01:17:41,022 --> 01:17:42,432
Now get outta hereand get back to work.

990
01:17:42,774 --> 01:17:44,059
- But you don't understand.

991
01:17:44,401 --> 01:17:46,983
They broke loose tonight,they're out there

992
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:48,651
somewhere in the city!

993
01:17:48,989 --> 01:17:50,695
I already sent the otherguard out to try to find them.

994
01:17:51,032 --> 01:17:52,522
- What?

995
01:17:52,868 --> 01:17:54,904
You mean there's no one manningthe front gate right now?

996
01:17:55,245 --> 01:17:55,950
- No sir.

997
01:17:56,288 --> 01:17:57,573
- This is preposterous.

998
01:17:57,914 --> 01:17:59,575
You do know that ifsomething were to happen

999
01:17:59,916 --> 01:18:01,577
to this studio whileno one was on duty,

1000
01:18:01,918 --> 01:18:04,034
our insurance willrefuse to pay off?

1001
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:05,334
- Yes sir.

1002
01:18:05,672 --> 01:18:07,208
- Well then getback on your post.

1003
01:18:07,549 --> 01:18:08,789
- You're not listening!

1004
01:18:09,134 --> 01:18:10,544
I want to go out and find him.

1005
01:18:10,886 --> 01:18:12,251
He must need my help by now!

1006
01:18:12,596 --> 01:18:14,757
- You are not going toleave your job to go out

1007
01:18:15,098 --> 01:18:16,679
and chase some foolishness.

1008
01:18:17,017 --> 01:18:19,975
If you walk off thislot, you are fired.

1009
01:18:22,022 --> 01:18:22,932
- Well good.

1010
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:26,981
Saves me thetrouble of quitting.

1011
01:18:51,468 --> 01:18:52,674
- Mr. McCreedy?

1012
01:18:56,014 --> 01:18:56,924
- Hey there.

1013
01:19:00,852 --> 01:19:02,558
We have a score to settle.

1014
01:19:02,896 --> 01:19:05,262
(intense music)

1015
01:19:12,989 --> 01:19:16,527
- Amy, this time I'mgonna make you proud.

1016
01:19:34,302 --> 01:19:36,543
(punching)

1017
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:39,216
- Amy, I think Kevin'sproved his bravery to you,

1018
01:19:39,557 --> 01:19:41,764
would you tell him to stopbefore he kills himself?

1019
01:19:42,727 --> 01:19:45,685
- For God's sake Kevin,stop before he kills you!

1020
01:20:21,182 --> 01:20:24,515
- Sometimes you win,sometimes you lose.

1021
01:20:32,277 --> 01:20:33,562
- No!

1022
01:20:33,903 --> 01:20:35,018
(gunshot)

1023
01:20:43,246 --> 01:20:45,328
(screams)

1024
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,576
(magical chimes)

1025
01:20:54,299 --> 01:20:56,415
- I'm sorry for sendingyou out on your own.

1026
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:57,966
I should have known thecreatures would try to destroy

1027
01:20:58,303 --> 01:20:58,837
you, also.

1028
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:01,878
- Where are they going now?

1029
01:21:02,223 --> 01:21:03,713
- Back to theirhome in the vault.

1030
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:05,924
Hurry, there isn'tmuch time left.

1031
01:21:06,269 --> 01:21:07,224
- Kevin, wait.

1032
01:21:08,772 --> 01:21:11,138
(sultry music)

1033
01:21:16,696 --> 01:21:17,856
Don't take too long.

1034
01:21:18,198 --> 01:21:19,233
I'll be waiting.

1035
01:21:21,993 --> 01:21:23,028
- Let's go!

1036
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:50,222
(suspenseful music)

1037
01:21:57,904 --> 01:21:58,814
- Do you think--

1038
01:21:59,155 --> 01:21:59,769
- Shhh.

1039
01:22:07,122 --> 01:22:08,362
I was right about them.

1040
01:22:08,706 --> 01:22:10,196
They're back inside.

1041
01:22:11,668 --> 01:22:13,408
- Well maybe weshould get closer

1042
01:22:13,753 --> 01:22:15,664
and lock them back inside again.

1043
01:22:16,005 --> 01:22:18,542
- No, I've spent 30years guarding them,

1044
01:22:18,883 --> 01:22:20,965
and I was firedfrom my job tonight.

1045
01:22:21,302 --> 01:22:23,509
I won't be around hereto keep an eye on them.

1046
01:22:23,847 --> 01:22:24,927
- You were fired?

1047
01:22:26,182 --> 01:22:29,424
Well, maybe I couldguard them from now on.

1048
01:22:31,104 --> 01:22:32,969
- Oh no, I don't want youto throw your life away

1049
01:22:33,314 --> 01:22:34,645
the way I had to.

1050
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:37,478
There is a better way.

1051
01:22:41,364 --> 01:22:42,444
- Did you find them?

1052
01:22:42,782 --> 01:22:44,238
- Yeah, they're backinside the vault.

1053
01:22:44,576 --> 01:22:45,986
- What are you gonna do to them?

1054
01:22:46,327 --> 01:22:47,533
- I don't know.

1055
01:22:47,871 --> 01:22:48,906
- Kevin.

1056
01:22:49,247 --> 01:22:51,989
Did I ever tell youwhat I did in the war?

1057
01:22:52,333 --> 01:22:53,163
- No.

1058
01:22:54,419 --> 01:22:55,579
- Munitions.

1059
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,035
(beeping)

1060
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,291
(explosion)

1061
01:23:09,309 --> 01:23:11,595
Isn't it ironic that theyshould pick a movie studio

1062
01:23:11,936 --> 01:23:13,142
to land?

1063
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:17,439
Unless they figured theybelonged in a dream factory.

1064
01:23:21,321 --> 01:23:23,528
- You were my hero tonight.

1065
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:28,900
- What?

1066
01:23:29,245 --> 01:23:30,735
Are you sure?

1067
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,115
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1068
01:23:39,088 --> 01:23:40,669
- Daphne?

1069
01:23:41,007 --> 01:23:41,746
- Yeah.

1070
01:23:42,091 --> 01:23:43,251
- This is for you.

1071
01:23:45,136 --> 01:23:46,046
- Really?

1072
01:23:47,138 --> 01:23:50,630
No one's ever givenme flowers before.

1073
01:23:50,975 --> 01:23:52,260
- Oh, but there's lots ofthings I could show you

1074
01:23:52,602 --> 01:23:54,467
for the first time.

1075
01:23:54,812 --> 01:23:55,392
Nick.

1076
01:23:56,272 --> 01:23:57,512
- Nick?- [Amy] Nick?

1077
01:23:57,857 --> 01:23:58,687
- Nick!

1078
01:23:59,025 --> 01:24:00,265
- Daph, baby!

1079
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:04,944
Told you guys I hadeverything under control.

1080
01:24:07,951 --> 01:24:08,610
Daphne.

1081
01:24:10,286 --> 01:24:11,196
- Nicky.

1082
01:24:12,413 --> 01:24:13,448
- [Both] Van!

1083
01:24:26,177 --> 01:24:28,213

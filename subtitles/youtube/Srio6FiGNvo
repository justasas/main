00:00:04 --> 00:00:10
yeah

00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
yeah

5
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
yeah

6
00:00:15 --> 00:00:19
yeah

00:00:19 --> 00:00:22
yeah

8
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
yeah

00:00:24 --> 00:00:29
from the director of Animal House a
different kind of animal it was those

10
00:00:29 --> 00:00:33
words over 25 years ago that forewarned
cinema goes that the brand new movie

11
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
from director John Landis wasn&#39;t going
to be another comedy romp

12
00:00:36 --> 00:00:40
but rather the revisiting of a classic
Hollywood horror monster when an

13
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
American Werewolf came out over the
summer of nineteen eighty-one open to a

14
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
varying assortment of reactions from
both the critics and movie going public

15
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
alike but while the question as to
whether or not the film was supposed to

16
00:00:50 --> 00:00:53
be scary or funny was the focus of much
confusion

17
00:00:53 --> 00:00:57
what was absolutely certain was the John
Landis it delivered a visually visceral

18
00:00:57 --> 00:01:00
and unforgiving hora spectacle featuring
some special effects makeup

19
00:01:00 --> 00:01:03
the likes of which have never been seen
before you see anything

20
00:01:03 --> 00:01:09
sounds far away not far enough come on
Jack what are we going I don&#39;t know i&#39;ll

21
00:01:09 --> 00:01:12
tell you when we get there because haha

22
00:01:12 --> 00:01:15
you really scared me you shit head

23
00:01:15 --> 00:01:18
there&#39;s no way that we can never really
tunnel with any foam

24
00:01:18 --> 00:01:23
what&#39;s gonna happen to it and American
Werewolf was you see a really good story

25
00:01:23 --> 00:01:28
and but I&#39;d never imagined that it would
have the kind of cult following and

26
00:01:28 --> 00:01:31
become the plastic is the company right

27
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
I thought this was going to be a success

28
00:01:34 --> 00:01:38
very very definitely and because your
first impressions are something often

29
00:01:38 --> 00:01:42
turn out to be right and my first
impressions i&#39;m just reading the script

30
00:01:42 --> 00:01:43
where the 10th

31
00:01:43 --> 00:01:47
I can&#39;t wait to see this picture it was
so acclaimed when it was first released

32
00:01:47 --> 00:01:52
and everybody talked about it and raved
about it even maybe two o&#39;clock further

33
00:01:52 --> 00:01:53
over to live it

34
00:01:53 --> 00:01:57
but they&#39;re definitely number of times
where i was really questioning but what

35
00:01:57 --> 00:02:00
we were making in in the weather was
worth all the work that we put into it

36
00:02:00 --> 00:02:03
and I this is not really like a horror
film

37
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
you know in and that&#39;s what makes it
great

38
00:02:06 --> 00:02:09
I mean John we knew what he was doing
it&#39;s extraordinary the the life it&#39;s had

39
00:02:09 --> 00:02:13
that is still goes on and drawing
attention to itself

40
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
something I&#39;ve never have expected
that&#39;s the feedback I get from people

41
00:02:17 --> 00:02:23
you know yet still holds up after 25
years and it does because it&#39;s through

42
00:02:23 --> 00:02:25
it looks real

43
00:02:25 --> 00:02:28
you look real then and it still does
it&#39;s pleasing and flattering and

44
00:02:28 --> 00:02:34
terrific that people people like it its
it&#39;s got a lot to answer for

45
00:02:34 --> 00:02:40
because it was fairly radical at the
time and now it&#39;s it influenced many

46
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
other filmmakers not necessarily the
cook

47
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
yeah

48
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
yeah

49
00:02:49 --> 00:02:50
yeah

50
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
yeah

51
00:02:53 --> 00:02:57
yeah

52
00:02:57 --> 00:03:03
the story of an American Werewolf in
London tells it to American backpackers

53
00:03:03 --> 00:03:06
who are attacked on the northern English
Moore&#39;s by a werewolf

54
00:03:06 --> 00:03:09
where is one is ripped to pieces and
killed instantly the survivor doesn&#39;t

55
00:03:09 --> 00:03:12
fare up any better after he&#39;s told me
he&#39;s going to turn into the accursed

56
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
lycanthrope at the next full moon

57
00:03:14 --> 00:03:18
horror fans the world over the film is a
golf field reimagining of classic

58
00:03:18 --> 00:03:22
werewolf towels of years gone for me is
a three-year-old trying to work out to

59
00:03:22 --> 00:03:23
use a video recorder

60
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
it was the perfect introduction to the
horror genre for director John Landis

61
00:03:26 --> 00:03:29
who at the time was in high demand as a
comedy director

62
00:03:29 --> 00:03:32
it became a labor of love that would
take him over 11 years to get to the big

63
00:03:32 --> 00:03:43
screen when i was 18 i went to
Yugoslavia behind the Iron Curtain to

64
00:03:43 --> 00:03:47
work on a MGM movie called Kelly zeros I
was golfer schleper you know

65
00:03:47 --> 00:03:52
and while there I witnessed this funeral

66
00:03:52 --> 00:03:58
I was very strange and and basically I
was with a guy named Sasha who was a

67
00:03:58 --> 00:03:59
niggas love

68
00:03:59 --> 00:04:04
assistant director so sasha is taking me
on this long drive

69
00:04:04 --> 00:04:08
I think from Novi Sad 2mon and we came
two people standing around in the

70
00:04:08 --> 00:04:09
crossroads

71
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
it was gypsies and they were burying
this guy

72
00:04:12 --> 00:04:16
feet first he was wrapped in a what the
canvas cloth

73
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
they wrapped them in rows a reason
garlic was all very exotic and I said

74
00:04:19 --> 00:04:20
what is going on

75
00:04:20 --> 00:04:23
and Sasha spoke to them and he thought
it was very funny

76
00:04:23 --> 00:04:27
you really we got the giggles he really
thought it was funny him and when he

77
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
sobered up enough to explain because I&#39;m
going what&#39;s so funny

78
00:04:30 --> 00:04:35
this guy that the body had committed a
crime and I&#39;ve forgotten what it was but

79
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
it was an egregious crime rate for
murder or something and they were

80
00:04:38 --> 00:04:43
burying him this way in this very
elaborate ceremony in the crux of a

81
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
crossroad which I thought was wild

82
00:04:45 --> 00:04:49
so that his body would not get up
basically cause trouble

83
00:04:49 --> 00:04:53
so that the corpse would remain in the
ground for a thousand years we chipped

84
00:04:53 --> 00:05:00
his have buried our dead like Ben I said
really useful &amp; Sascha&#39;s is all you know

85
00:05:00 --> 00:05:04
they&#39;re gypsies present but I thought
about it because it was very profoundly

86
00:05:04 --> 00:05:08
first of all the gypsies really did look
like dress extras on the universal

87
00:05:08 --> 00:05:14
backlot you know dress like real sky is
nineteen sixty-nine I mean we put a man

88
00:05:14 --> 00:05:17
on the moon in 1969 and these people are
worried about a zombie

89
00:05:17 --> 00:05:23
so I was very taken with the idea and I
thought well that&#39;s a good idea for a

90
00:05:23 --> 00:05:29
movie is how would Sasha and I react if
he did Claus way to the surface and you

91
00:05:29 --> 00:05:33
pull himself out of the grave like peter
cushing and what do you do

92
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
what are you doing that situation
because if your rationale and fairly

93
00:05:36 --> 00:05:40
sophisticated educated person you know
it&#39;s bullshit doesn&#39;t exist

94
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
so how do you deal with something that
doesn&#39;t exist when it&#39;s standing in

95
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
front of you

96
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49
you&#39;re not real

97
00:05:49 --> 00:05:56
I don&#39;t be a putz David here i was
thinking about okay what monster vampire

98
00:05:56 --> 00:06:01
is you know zombies werewolves and
ghosts or stranded because i want two

99
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
months movie night

100
00:06:02 --> 00:06:07
I hit upon werewolves I did all this
research that basically the most number

101
00:06:07 --> 00:06:12
of real werewolves are the people who
are executed for being werewolves are in

102
00:06:12 --> 00:06:13
France and in Wales

103
00:06:13 --> 00:06:19
so I thought well I don&#39;t speak French
and at that time England had what was

104
00:06:19 --> 00:06:23
called the British quota system with the
ED plan which was a tax incentive where

105
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
you produce forgot to share of the box
office in the UK

106
00:06:26 --> 00:06:30
it was to encourage production in great
britain and it works very well but you

107
00:06:30 --> 00:06:35
had to be you had to qualify you Davis
British content certain you know

108
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
everyone had to be a bread

109
00:06:37 --> 00:06:42
up to a point this was a movie star the
directors in any case so I thought all

110
00:06:42 --> 00:06:47
good well London where gothic horror
Mary Shelley was British you know I mean

111
00:06:47 --> 00:06:48
we&#39;re all this stuff is really

112
00:06:48 --> 00:06:51
London&#39;s the place so i thought it&#39;s a
great city and then that would be a

113
00:06:51 --> 00:06:57
great place for it so i wrote it when i
was 18 i wrote the first script

114
00:06:57 --> 00:07:01
I was pretty happy with it when i
finally got people to read it they all

115
00:07:01 --> 00:07:06
went with the fucking and I always got
the same 2 comments

116
00:07:06 --> 00:07:10
this is much too scary to be funny and
this is much too funny to be scary

117
00:07:10 --> 00:07:13
never one of the other is always what
that what is this

118
00:07:13 --> 00:07:18
it&#39;s a horror film but it&#39;s funny yeah
so it&#39;s a comedy

119
00:07:18 --> 00:07:26
No hi hello hi little dog when I made my
first silly movie schlock with Rick

120
00:07:26 --> 00:07:27
Baker I discussed it with him

121
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
John playing - like promised during the
time that I was making him up jon was

122
00:07:30 --> 00:07:32
telling me the whole story of American
Werewolf he had already written

123
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
I was just really excited by what you&#39;ve
seen

124
00:07:35 --> 00:07:39
we both love the old lon chaney stuff
and especially transformations and in

125
00:07:39 --> 00:07:43
those kind of movies and he just said
you know it didn&#39;t seem right to him

126
00:07:43 --> 00:07:49
that if you&#39;re going to change into a
werewolf some other creature that you

127
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
would just sit in that corner of a chair
like lon chaney jr. and be perfectly

128
00:07:52 --> 00:07:55
still accept your each time you&#39;re
slightly different position when you do

129
00:07:55 --> 00:07:58
the lab dissolves says I want to do it
in a way i want to show the pain I

130
00:07:58 --> 00:07:59
wanted to be able to move around

131
00:07:59 --> 00:08:02
he&#39;s going to pull his clothes off and
missing the whole body change

132
00:08:02 --> 00:08:07
so figure out how to do that okay and
that would be cool

133
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
I don&#39;t quite know how to do it but it
would be really cool thing to do

134
00:08:10 --> 00:08:16
good news was that no shot was this
thirty thousand dollar independent film

135
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
that basically nobody saw

136
00:08:18 --> 00:08:22
so people aren&#39;t paying down at Johns
door to get to get him to do

137
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
because you&#39;ve seen this is gonna be my
next movie what can I tell you I mean no

138
00:08:24 --> 00:08:27
one would make it and i really liked it
the kentucky fried movie came about

139
00:08:27 --> 00:08:33
because David Zucker saw me on
television promoting flock and they said

140
00:08:33 --> 00:08:34
that&#39;s a kid who made a movie how did he
do it

141
00:08:34 --> 00:08:39
and I met them and I said well the other
script and they were like I said you

142
00:08:39 --> 00:08:43
have to have a screenplay you have to
written material to shoot and they

143
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
really didn&#39;t know what I was talking
about so i gave them that gave them

144
00:08:46 --> 00:08:50
descriptive American Werewolf in London
that&#39;s what they called Pete the form

145
00:08:50 --> 00:08:54
you know so it&#39;s around for a long as I
wrote at 69 it wasn&#39;t until after

146
00:08:54 --> 00:08:58
Kentucky Fried the animal house in the
Blues Brothers those three

147
00:08:58 --> 00:09:02
all were very profitable that I could
make a werewolf

148
00:09:02 --> 00:09:07
after animal house you know he had a lot
more power and control over the movies

149
00:09:07 --> 00:09:11
he made of what he could do and not do
and i have been the editor with him on

150
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
all those early movies

151
00:09:13 --> 00:09:18
he he asked me if I&#39;d like to produce
American world in london in London with

152
00:09:18 --> 00:09:22
him and I thought that would be great
fun and a great opportunity for me to

153
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
take out of another role

154
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
I said it was a ten-million-dollar
negative pick up

155
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
take it or leave it and they mostly left
it

156
00:09:31 --> 00:09:36
the studios are always looking for
reasons not to make movies and the edge

157
00:09:36 --> 00:09:41
easier and more different than the movie
is from its the cookie cutter that they

158
00:09:41 --> 00:09:45
see either horror films are comedies or
dramas whatever the less likely it is to

159
00:09:45 --> 00:09:46
get to get made

160
00:09:46 --> 00:09:53
but after blues brothers john peters and
peter guber polygram were running

161
00:09:53 --> 00:09:53
program

162
00:09:53 --> 00:09:58
I really like this screenplay really got
that we could you know combine the

163
00:09:58 --> 00:10:03
horror and comedy elements and to their
credit they gave us the money to go and

164
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
make it and I kind of given up on it

165
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
I figured it was never going to happen
and that&#39;s the way things will work out

166
00:10:08 --> 00:10:12
and I get a call one day from from joe
dante Mike finnell saying we have this

167
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
where we were going to do it would you
be interested in doing it

168
00:10:15 --> 00:10:16
yeah

169
00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
so this is the howling I started out
doing some designs working on it and

170
00:10:20 --> 00:10:24
thought this would be my chance to use
my transformation stuff with thought up

171
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
and I didn&#39;t really want to tell john
about it

172
00:10:27 --> 00:10:30
that&#39;s when i call them today i got the
money let&#39;s go

173
00:10:30 --> 00:10:36
he went I&#39;m doing the werewolf movie was
like what hurts you bastard he&#39;s like

174
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
yelling at me and funny because you know
what we&#39;re going to do transformation

175
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
well yeah I kind of told him someone
about how you know you you son of a

176
00:10:42 --> 00:10:47
bitch like yeah scream I mean stuff with
you what I&#39;ll do is I&#39;ll get out of it i

177
00:10:47 --> 00:10:51
had this young guy that I that was my
protégé at the time Rob protein and I

178
00:10:51 --> 00:10:55
said I can turn it over to rob and i and
i&#39;m just consult on it and then I&#39;ll do

179
00:10:55 --> 00:11:01
wear it so yes I think to this day still
doesn&#39;t hasn&#39;t forgiven me for that

180
00:11:01 --> 00:11:05
you know don&#39;t play I mean I great
confidence that he could do it is

181
00:11:05 --> 00:11:09
probably misplaced but i still have
great confidence that he could do it

182
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
remember he said well if we&#39;re going to
do this I want this is now later when i

183
00:11:12 --> 00:11:19
said i had the money i want at least six
months to mold you know take molds of

184
00:11:19 --> 00:11:23
the two leads Jack and David then so i
can work on these prosthetics and things

185
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
for at least six months before we begin
principal photography

186
00:11:26 --> 00:11:32
so that was kind of risky because i had
to hire david not in griffin dunne had

187
00:11:32 --> 00:11:35
to hire the two boys before I had the
money

188
00:11:35 --> 00:11:45
yeah

189
00:11:45 --> 00:11:48
well I like the deco i guess some things
just don&#39;t change

190
00:11:48 --> 00:11:52
here we are in the slaughtered lamb pub
AK the black swan in sorry

191
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
as you can see the wall that once played
host to the five-pointed star is no

192
00:11:55 --> 00:11:58
longer there and there&#39;s no danger of
anybody missing a dartboard that no

193
00:11:58 --> 00:12:01
longer exists with a 10 million dollar
budget now in place and creep reduction

194
00:12:01 --> 00:12:03
now well and truly underway

195
00:12:03 --> 00:12:06
it was now the task of john landis to
select the perfect cost of performers

196
00:12:06 --> 00:12:08
that would bring his extraordinary
screen place alive

197
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
well I had to have British crew I had to
have an entirely British crew

198
00:12:11 --> 00:12:16
I was already kind of stretching it
because they said that Griffin Dunne and

199
00:12:16 --> 00:12:20
David not were not movie stars which is
true that if we&#39;re not movie stars and

200
00:12:20 --> 00:12:24
for some arbitrary reason it was like
okay to hire a movie star but I don&#39;t

201
00:12:24 --> 00:12:25
know just an American

202
00:12:25 --> 00:12:29
so what I was able to convince them
because in a cast of I don&#39;t know 60

203
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
speaking parts or something

204
00:12:31 --> 00:12:36
58 of them are English curriculum they
wanted me to hire what&#39;s called North

205
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
American actors are usually Canadians

206
00:12:38 --> 00:12:45
so it&#39;s like beware the moon a John and
I went through a whole number probably

207
00:12:45 --> 00:12:52
300 people we both in New York and in
Los Angeles to find the guys to play the

208
00:12:52 --> 00:12:59
two the two boys and it was not easy to
get to get what we wanted

209
00:12:59 --> 00:13:03
so i had to find two boys who were kind
of like my friend Greg and I when we

210
00:13:03 --> 00:13:07
were fifteen sixteen that was looking
around and the dr pepper commercials

211
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
were quite big then where David would
sing and dance

212
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
he was familiar with the with the
commercials it would have been one thing

213
00:13:12 --> 00:13:16
to have to bring the you know in a
cassette with me and say I hope you get

214
00:13:16 --> 00:13:19
to see these is what&#39;s going on right
now but at the time that he met me it

215
00:13:19 --> 00:13:24
was a very you know popular campaign how
that qualified me to do the role that he

216
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
had in mind is another story

217
00:13:26 --> 00:13:29
and I liked him on screen I just thought
you know he&#39;s a likable guy

218
00:13:29 --> 00:13:33
if you can do this you obviously i can
get a performance out of them and that I

219
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
i met john just call me tomorrow

220
00:13:35 --> 00:13:40
I call in the next day he&#39;s saying some
little tune to me you know and something

221
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
to the effect that you know wouldn&#39;t I
like to be aware

222
00:13:42 --> 00:13:48
love to and you know i was just not
really sure that he was you know was he

223
00:13:48 --> 00:13:48
putting me on

224
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
and so I she said but now you need to
get right over to meet Rick Baker

225
00:13:52 --> 00:13:56
I mean this all happened in a period of
days as opposed two weeks so you have to

226
00:13:56 --> 00:14:00
come right over and meet Rick and and
have these molds on and i did in the

227
00:14:00 --> 00:14:02
first thing Rick Baker said to me once
you put your playing I said I&#39;m playing

228
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
the role of David she&#39;s I feel sorry for
you and Griffin

229
00:14:05 --> 00:14:11
I cast I i met through casting I saw two
hundred people i went and i met john and

230
00:14:11 --> 00:14:17
he was very friendly and I think he did
most of the talking and he was just

231
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
telling y&#39;all - movie and it&#39;s just
going to be the standing is so exciting

232
00:14:20 --> 00:14:26
itself so great now i don&#39;t think i&#39;ve
ever been talked to by director about

233
00:14:26 --> 00:14:31
like his vision for the movie and I was
you know a kid but he seemed very

234
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
excited about it and it sounded really
great and I wasn&#39;t getting the whole

235
00:14:34 --> 00:14:39
picture and I went home

236
00:14:39 --> 00:14:42
no no reading no nothing

237
00:14:42 --> 00:14:47
I think he asked me a few questions
about myself and I got home and I had a

238
00:14:47 --> 00:14:51
crappy little apartment not far from
here and got a phone call from my agent

239
00:14:51 --> 00:14:59
who never got me a job before saying
that I should stand by that a messenger

240
00:14:59 --> 00:15:00
was going to deliver the script

241
00:15:00 --> 00:15:04
John wanted me to rewrite away and then
call him and I did I spoke to John and

242
00:15:04 --> 00:15:08
he was like well what you want to do it
and I thought is going to audition over

243
00:15:08 --> 00:15:13
the phone and he meant do I wanted to
the movie and no audition no nothing

244
00:15:13 --> 00:15:21
and I said sure like this happens to me
all the time and he goes I got one

245
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
question for you though before you
before we do anything I got to ask you a

246
00:15:24 --> 00:15:24
question

247
00:15:24 --> 00:15:28
this is really important you have to
tell me the truth ok

248
00:15:28 --> 00:15:31
are you claustrophobic

249
00:15:31 --> 00:15:37
and ice blast question on earth i
expected to be asked us and would be

250
00:15:37 --> 00:15:44
something far more intimate and I said
no which I would have said if I was

251
00:15:44 --> 00:15:49
terrified of closed spaces but I in this
case it&#39;s true and I said no and he&#39;s a

252
00:15:49 --> 00:15:50
great you got the part

253
00:15:50 --> 00:15:55
we were thrilled when Griffin I came on
board we know we thought that with David

254
00:15:55 --> 00:16:00
not and we were just couldn&#39;t have been
could have been better than just a play

255
00:16:00 --> 00:16:04
off each other grade say knock knock
knock knock who&#39;s there

256
00:16:04 --> 00:16:09
oh Jenny I&#39;ve known for years she lived
in LA for quite a while it became very

257
00:16:09 --> 00:16:13
family with Deborah John and devil and
his 42 of the first people I met when I

258
00:16:13 --> 00:16:16
went to Los Angeles I instantly enjoyed
the two of them and so a lot of them

259
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
don&#39;t know he said he sent me the
screenplay

260
00:16:18 --> 00:16:24
when he knew he was he had the money to
go ahead and but it&#39;s sort of been

261
00:16:24 --> 00:16:29
okayed for me to play the room and I
read the scripts and I told that it was

262
00:16:29 --> 00:16:32
a really ambitious piece

263
00:16:32 --> 00:16:37
clearly the humor was there there were
some extremely well-written roles which

264
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
is lovely cousin actually just look to
see what the roles like and that was

265
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
that was great but there was this kind
of horror factor i&#39;m not very good

266
00:16:42 --> 00:16:45
really in horror movies and
understanding how they work but I knew

267
00:16:45 --> 00:16:47
if anyone could make it

268
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
i&#39;m john landis could I think if the
script of incentive by somebody else I

269
00:16:50 --> 00:16:51
might have thought twice about it

270
00:16:51 --> 00:16:55
Jenny Agutter and John Wood vine and
there&#39;s the nurse and the doctor were

271
00:16:55 --> 00:16:56
just exceptionally good

272
00:16:56 --> 00:17:02
and again it&#39;s just the tradition of the
British actors are you know there&#39;s just

273
00:17:02 --> 00:17:07
so damn good in what they do at the time
was working with the royal shakespeare

274
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
company we were doing

275
00:17:09 --> 00:17:13
nicholas nickleby which we later took to
New York was a huge success in America

276
00:17:13 --> 00:17:20
and I suppose John came to see them came
to see the show and

277
00:17:20 --> 00:17:24
I&#39;m got in touch she was making them it
was really one of the great things I&#39;ve

278
00:17:24 --> 00:17:28
seen in theatres and I was so taken with
it i tried to cast everybody in the show

279
00:17:28 --> 00:17:30
I mean like a came from it

280
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
John Wood vine came you played Ralph
Nickleby was extraordinary

281
00:17:33 --> 00:17:37
David Scofield I was a young at the time
and I was seven

282
00:17:37 --> 00:17:40
I&#39;ve got to be honest and say that I was
absolutely knocked out to get the gig

283
00:17:40 --> 00:17:45
it was a fantastic project it appear to
be very exciting and I was very happy to

284
00:17:45 --> 00:17:45
be a part of

285
00:17:45 --> 00:17:49
yeah i&#39;m a bit nervous I have to say
because it was one of my first kiss

286
00:17:49 --> 00:17:52
so it was a little nerve-racking but ten
very very exciting

287
00:17:52 --> 00:17:52
ok

288
00:17:52 --> 00:17:57
the first time we see them there in the
truckload of sheets not subtle

289
00:17:57 --> 00:18:00
get up they&#39;re dead they&#39;re dead from
the first frame

290
00:18:00 --> 00:18:05
your call yeah good principal
photography started in Wales

291
00:18:05 --> 00:18:10
we went up there first of all to do the
thing when they were working on to begin

292
00:18:10 --> 00:18:15
the film actually then walking over the
hills to to the village with the sword

293
00:18:15 --> 00:18:17
land first handset

294
00:18:17 --> 00:18:22
I felt remarkably relaxed know the lines
and understood what was needed and it

295
00:18:22 --> 00:18:23
was just about being natural

296
00:18:23 --> 00:18:29
there was a moment where Griffin had
snot coming out of his nose that he got

297
00:18:29 --> 00:18:33
the giggles and he was waiting for me to
say cut and I didn&#39;t you know you think

298
00:18:33 --> 00:18:36
to yourself they&#39;ll never use this but
let&#39;s keep going because you know

299
00:18:36 --> 00:18:39
there&#39;s a lot of preparation and you
don&#39;t want to be the one to stop in the

300
00:18:39 --> 00:18:42
middle of a take and of course that&#39;s
the one they use in which both Griffin

301
00:18:42 --> 00:18:47
and I are kind of crack each other up my
most vivid memory of it though is to be

302
00:18:47 --> 00:18:51
on these Moors and quickly between a
setup I had to use the bathroom and the

303
00:18:51 --> 00:18:55
there&#39;s nothing around except these vans
they were like little gypsy caravans

304
00:18:55 --> 00:18:59
suddenly the pickup truck each step to
the band started up and just drove off

305
00:18:59 --> 00:19:00
with me in the back

306
00:19:00 --> 00:19:03
I&#39;m bouncing around and I couldn&#39;t speak
to the guy in the pickup truck

307
00:19:03 --> 00:19:06
i think i drugged me for like 45 minutes

308
00:19:06 --> 00:19:10
it was like where Griffin go and John
you can imagine was just freaking out

309
00:19:10 --> 00:19:14
and I could not get to the guy just tell
him to stop

310
00:19:14 --> 00:19:18
think you can drive all the way back to
London and now you want to a gas station

311
00:19:18 --> 00:19:23
and I just banged on the door with what
the fuck is wrong with you what is wrong

312
00:19:23 --> 00:19:24
with you

313
00:19:24 --> 00:19:29
and he drove back to the set and again
the whole crews crazed you&#39;re ready to

314
00:19:29 --> 00:19:29
shoot

315
00:19:29 --> 00:19:34
you&#39;re right it is okay what would you
say win a little food and drink rest

316
00:19:34 --> 00:19:38
the slaughtered lamb you know it was a
very important seem to set the tone of

317
00:19:38 --> 00:19:45
the movie and the you know kind of the
evil dark quality that that pub you know

318
00:19:45 --> 00:19:49
represented but whatever happens it&#39;s
your fault right

319
00:19:49 --> 00:19:55
Jack and David had to be Outsiders in
that community and when we first see

320
00:19:55 --> 00:19:55
them

321
00:19:55 --> 00:19:59
it was very important that they almost
looked like they were astronauts on the

322
00:19:59 --> 00:20:00
surface of the boom

323
00:20:00 --> 00:20:04
so that later when they appear in the
pub they really look like astronauts

324
00:20:04 --> 00:20:08
they really look like a come from a
completely different place when people

325
00:20:08 --> 00:20:09
greet them out in the open the door

326
00:20:09 --> 00:20:12
the entire pump stops and turns around
looks at them

327
00:20:12 --> 00:20:14
hello hi

328
00:20:14 --> 00:20:17
nice to see you I remember thinking am I
gonna get away with this because it was

329
00:20:17 --> 00:20:21
so much like you know classic western
where they go in and everyone turns it

330
00:20:21 --> 00:20:24
looks music stops and the smoke in here

331
00:20:24 --> 00:20:31
look it was my first experience of
walking up to and add or extra opening

332
00:20:31 --> 00:20:34
the door and then three months later
closing the door and it completely

333
00:20:34 --> 00:20:37
different place and we had to do in two
places the exterior and wells and the

334
00:20:37 --> 00:20:41
interior and the Black Swan I believe
down and sorry

335
00:20:41 --> 00:20:49
look at that yeah what about a five
pointed star five-point star was not in

336
00:20:49 --> 00:20:52
the park but not right now so i
personally do that up on the wall at the

337
00:20:52 --> 00:20:57
correct position correct angle and down
the rest of it was just regular pub

338
00:20:57 --> 00:20:58
stuff but did

339
00:20:58 --> 00:21:02
obviously the choreography that went on
in there with the dark playing and the

340
00:21:02 --> 00:21:07
movement and the storytelling with one
anger towards a joke

341
00:21:07 --> 00:21:12
yeah daddies don&#39;t did you hear the one
about that crashing funny i was one of

342
00:21:12 --> 00:21:12
the time

343
00:21:12 --> 00:21:16
put it on the set first of all I like
characters and films telling jokes

344
00:21:16 --> 00:21:22
because you know people don&#39;t understand
about a joke it&#39;s never the joke it&#39;s

345
00:21:22 --> 00:21:24
how the joke is told brian Glover

346
00:21:24 --> 00:21:27
he was such a great character and when
he told the joke you know in that

347
00:21:27 --> 00:21:33
accident remember the olive all the
jokes out that she can laugh he gets a

348
00:21:33 --> 00:21:36
little big but hit them

349
00:21:36 --> 00:21:39
and starring long more

350
00:21:39 --> 00:21:40
you

351
00:21:40 --> 00:21:47
made me wish it wasn&#39;t a huge part but i
do remember it being my characters

352
00:21:47 --> 00:21:53
moment his you know his his time in the
picture and I knew that it was a

353
00:21:53 --> 00:21:54
significant bug

354
00:21:54 --> 00:22:00
so I had to stay completely come not to
blood

355
00:22:00 --> 00:22:03
I&#39;ve never missed that board before

356
00:22:03 --> 00:22:09
check we better go I&#39;ve been to a lot of
pubs across england and in wales in

357
00:22:09 --> 00:22:15
Ireland and and so I thought it was
extremely authentic call stay on the

358
00:22:15 --> 00:22:16
road

359
00:22:16 --> 00:22:22
keep clear of the most the only
disappointment from was the temp and the

360
00:22:22 --> 00:22:25
bar was closed while

361
00:22:25 --> 00:22:33
beware the movements while writing the
screenplay in 1969 john landis had no

362
00:22:33 --> 00:22:36
idea of how any of the gruesome set
pieces and the story we&#39;re going to be

363
00:22:36 --> 00:22:38
conceivably executed on screen

364
00:22:38 --> 00:22:41
thankfully for him it was down to the
makeup wizardry of Rick Baker to work

365
00:22:41 --> 00:22:42
out the specifics

366
00:22:42 --> 00:22:46
the werewolf transformation and the
gruesome aftermath of the move savage

367
00:22:46 --> 00:22:47
attacks

368
00:22:47 --> 00:22:57
it&#39;s a full moon anywhere the moon and
stick to the road hopes that night

369
00:22:57 --> 00:23:03
exterior Moore&#39;s is not their supposed
to be there but it&#39;s not there it&#39;s

370
00:23:03 --> 00:23:08
actually wins a great park so that was
really cold

371
00:23:08 --> 00:23:14
really I honestly shot and quite a few
different places in the wintertime New

372
00:23:14 --> 00:23:22
York Philadelphia Norway never been as
cold as out on the winter great park

373
00:23:22 --> 00:23:24
that was when we had to make it rain

374
00:23:24 --> 00:23:29
oh don&#39;t rain and it was so bitter
called the pipes froze on the rain trees

375
00:23:29 --> 00:23:34
so we had to wrap them with like hot
water but like electric blankets that

376
00:23:34 --> 00:23:35
melt the ice the make it rain

377
00:23:35 --> 00:23:41
those poor guys with water on them from
the rain free under how they survive we

378
00:23:41 --> 00:23:45
were all in every kind of here we could
get on and we&#39;re still freezing you know

379
00:23:45 --> 00:23:48
that scene where they they&#39;re walking
and for some reason Griffin start

380
00:23:48 --> 00:23:50
singing sand

381
00:23:50 --> 00:23:54
God

382
00:23:54 --> 00:23:55
yeah

383
00:23:55 --> 00:23:59
when I yelled cut they both started
screaming come back

384
00:23:59 --> 00:24:04
we all run their hair and like huge
chunks of ice frozen into their hair and

385
00:24:04 --> 00:24:09
you could go you and like crack their
parkas cause the ice from the rain just

386
00:24:09 --> 00:24:12
froze on them it was cold

387
00:24:12 --> 00:24:15
did you hear that

388
00:24:15 --> 00:24:18
I heard that the how is great

389
00:24:18 --> 00:24:21
what was it a lot of things

390
00:24:21 --> 00:24:27
the wolf sound I learned later was a
combination of a wolf and there was an

391
00:24:27 --> 00:24:28
elephant sound in there

392
00:24:28 --> 00:24:33
I think it was played backwards I can&#39;t
remember exactly what they did there

393
00:24:33 --> 00:24:37
oh shit David what is that it&#39;s a
combination of like seven or eight

394
00:24:37 --> 00:24:40
different animal howls cut up and remix

395
00:24:40 --> 00:24:43
it&#39;s circling us fuck

396
00:24:43 --> 00:24:46
take the first shot with the wolf was on
the moors the sequence nothing on the

397
00:24:46 --> 00:24:48
moors were there where the kids can
attack

398
00:24:48 --> 00:24:53
nice doggy good boy come on walk away
walk away yes here we are walking away

399
00:24:53 --> 00:24:56
we had several different heads we had
what we call a close-up head which was

400
00:24:56 --> 00:25:00
the one who had the most mechanisms in
it and we had a stunt n which was hard

401
00:25:00 --> 00:25:00
teeth in it

402
00:25:00 --> 00:25:03
soft teeth because we knew it was going
to be attacking grip it seems to be

403
00:25:03 --> 00:25:08
mauled to death and he is enthralled and
terror as one would be would be molded

404
00:25:08 --> 00:25:11
that knows they&#39;re going to die and is
helpless to stop it and it&#39;s just going

405
00:25:11 --> 00:25:14
down fighting and i just went there

406
00:25:14 --> 00:25:18
remember that I wanted it to look as
horrific as possible

407
00:25:18 --> 00:25:21
so which is one of the reasons why it&#39;s
so fast and furious

408
00:25:21 --> 00:25:28
you can&#39;t really see what&#39;s going on and
asking Griffin to scream for his life

409
00:25:28 --> 00:25:33
Griffin I could really got into it was
fighting for his late

410
00:25:33 --> 00:25:36
it&#39;s creepy when you do stuff like that
I had to go back to the track for

411
00:25:36 --> 00:25:38
something and as I was going back

412
00:25:38 --> 00:25:43
I could hear griffin dunne screaming and
it was it was just so haunting

413
00:25:43 --> 00:25:46
I mean it was it was cold it was who I
was cold I was walking back to the truck

414
00:25:46 --> 00:25:49
it was so real and it just sends shivers
up my spine

415
00:25:49 --> 00:25:56
we were in you know the Queen&#39;s backyard
and I kept picturing the green trying to

416
00:25:56 --> 00:25:57
get some sleep

417
00:25:57 --> 00:26:04
he&#39;s tearing this kid just being
savagely murdered take after take after

418
00:26:04 --> 00:26:06
take because i was really being attacked
by it

419
00:26:06 --> 00:26:09
man and a wolf mass lying on a
wheelbarrow

420
00:26:09 --> 00:26:12
I was puppeteering his head which is
weird because like two handles you can

421
00:26:12 --> 00:26:14
grab basically make them out holding in
closet you can turn the head

422
00:26:14 --> 00:26:21
so it&#39;s kind of really like you know
being nibbled by a public

423
00:26:21 --> 00:26:24
I talked to Griffin and I said you know
this I know this thing supposed to be

424
00:26:24 --> 00:26:28
killing you and you&#39;re supposed to be
fighting it but it is it was basically

425
00:26:28 --> 00:26:32
this brand new head that we just made
its kind of its foam rubber it&#39;s a

426
00:26:32 --> 00:26:35
little bit delicate so you have to be
kind of careful when I don&#39;t know how

427
00:26:35 --> 00:26:35
you go

428
00:26:35 --> 00:26:40
you don&#39;t really pet a werewolf as it&#39;s
doing your drug user out so then John

429
00:26:40 --> 00:26:42
says action and we&#39;re doing this stupid

430
00:26:42 --> 00:26:46
Jesus foxing crazy and killed you know
and first take

431
00:26:46 --> 00:26:53
he like grabs hold the war like rips the
phone face right off the skull dancing

432
00:26:53 --> 00:26:57
ok this is a good start

433
00:26:57 --> 00:27:01
it&#39;s going acting I was just so carried
away there was none too pleased about it

434
00:27:01 --> 00:27:06
and I considered putting the hard to eat
implants thing okay

435
00:27:06 --> 00:27:10
that&#39;s what he&#39;s going to play let&#39;s put
the hard to keep up with that I didn&#39;t

436
00:27:10 --> 00:27:12
put the hard too thin but when it in
johnson action

437
00:27:12 --> 00:27:15
I was just like beaten that crap out of
Griffin with his head

438
00:27:15 --> 00:27:18
you know this is like how i took my
anger out on graphing and

439
00:27:18 --> 00:27:22
just kidding this damn thing is gone and
i think it may be seen that much better

440
00:27:22 --> 00:27:27
not a little bit but it - I think you
know what you&#39;re gonna play play rock -

441
00:27:27 --> 00:27:32
I remember coming back from from london
to los angeles one time and I had a

442
00:27:32 --> 00:27:37
werewolf head and I had a bottle of
Kensington gore the British blood having

443
00:27:37 --> 00:27:39
to explain this to the people in customs

444
00:27:39 --> 00:27:44
I just say they&#39;d ask mr. posing what&#39;s
this as well that&#39;s the the head of the

445
00:27:44 --> 00:27:44
werewolf

446
00:27:44 --> 00:27:49
ok and what is this i said well that&#39;s
the that&#39;s the blood of the werewolf

447
00:27:49 --> 00:27:52
all right and then they just you know

448
00:27:52 --> 00:28:00
ok send one tack and then he had me say
something like hi I&#39;m supposed to look

449
00:28:00 --> 00:28:01
into hi Sean how are you

450
00:28:01 --> 00:28:08
something she doesn&#39;t every movie i just
would say it after just been screaming

451
00:28:08 --> 00:28:12
my lungs up you know I went with a
fucking Sean why am I talking about

452
00:28:12 --> 00:28:15
Shawn what the fuck is Sean Sean Sean
Sean

453
00:28:15 --> 00:28:18
fuck you Shawn fuck you Shawn

454
00:28:18 --> 00:28:21
are we finished

455
00:28:21 --> 00:28:32
and I remember feeling very sorry for
the bad for the actor who was playing

456
00:28:32 --> 00:28:36
the wolf with the next to like that
completely naked freezing i said i need

457
00:28:36 --> 00:28:40
an older man till I make it and it&#39;s
called paddy Ryan&#39;s first water is the

458
00:28:40 --> 00:28:40
guy did it

459
00:28:40 --> 00:28:45
and when you watch the picture you can
see the steam rising from in which was

460
00:28:45 --> 00:28:48
great for picture but it really is a 22
just how cold it was

461
00:28:48 --> 00:28:55
Devon I&#39;m dr. hatch

462
00:28:55 --> 00:29:00
he&#39;s simply the voice of sanity or film
and that&#39;s all I was aiming for was just

463
00:29:00 --> 00:29:06
a sort of clarity of the of
straightforward presentation of the a

464
00:29:06 --> 00:29:13
sensible man trying to function in the
middle of you know quite unusual events

465
00:29:13 --> 00:29:16
what happened to them police reports
that there were attacked by an escaped

466
00:29:16 --> 00:29:16
lunatic

467
00:29:16 --> 00:29:22
it starts off with a rather sevilla dr.
Hirsch firmly putting the nurses in

468
00:29:22 --> 00:29:22
their place

469
00:29:22 --> 00:29:25
although i don&#39;t see that it&#39;s any
concern of yours next part no sir

470
00:29:25 --> 00:29:33
and evolves into this much much closer
and mom intimate relationship you&#39;ve

471
00:29:33 --> 00:29:34
never had bad dreams before

472
00:29:34 --> 00:29:37
sure is a kid but never so real never
some weird

473
00:29:37 --> 00:29:40
the inexplicable would be explained with
it&#39;s another dream sequence

474
00:29:40 --> 00:29:46
kind of crazy wild dreams in life that
was I having and in the forest and they

475
00:29:46 --> 00:29:49
get smoke machines you know guys are
running through the forest smoking up

476
00:29:49 --> 00:29:49
the whole place

477
00:29:49 --> 00:29:52
so it was very eerie that just to be
there and I&#39;m film it certainly captured

478
00:29:52 --> 00:29:56
if i remember right you were shooting at
turn Berlin beaches in hartford here

479
00:29:56 --> 00:29:59
just at the back of pinewood studios

480
00:29:59 --> 00:30:03
John didn&#39;t want the ground disturbed at
all so it&#39;s basically given a a

481
00:30:03 --> 00:30:07
direction in which to travel and to just
run for it what I had to do is just make

482
00:30:07 --> 00:30:11
sure that I didn&#39;t trip on any on any
tweaks or load so i went along because

483
00:30:11 --> 00:30:15
it was quite tricky is something I&#39;ve
never done before because it was a new

484
00:30:15 --> 00:30:16
piece of equipment

485
00:30:16 --> 00:30:21
remember I wanted a strange feeling

486
00:30:21 --> 00:30:25
approaching the bed you know the reveal
of David and his opera makeup it&#39;s

487
00:30:25 --> 00:30:29
another one of those makeups that took
all day to do and wearing glass lenses

488
00:30:29 --> 00:30:33
and offer like went through your seconds
three seconds of film but it&#39;s effective

489
00:30:33 --> 00:30:37
and nobody really cares it took six
hours to do

490
00:30:37 --> 00:30:43
John said you know in the script there&#39;s
a scene where these things and just said

491
00:30:43 --> 00:30:44
. see demons

492
00:30:44 --> 00:30:47
ok what&#39;s a Nazi demons I don&#39;t know
sometimes I cannot sing like a demon

493
00:30:47 --> 00:30:50
well you try to think of the most
horrific nightmares you can what&#39;s the

494
00:30:50 --> 00:30:53
most terrible that it&#39;s losing loved
ones

495
00:30:53 --> 00:30:57
I&#39;ll place tonight David is not married
and have children so it would be his

496
00:30:57 --> 00:31:02
parents and family received them
completely decimated by the this unknown

497
00:31:02 --> 00:31:05
his demons

498
00:31:05 --> 00:31:08
I just started making him at first when
I did was the one that&#39;s in that double

499
00:31:08 --> 00:31:11
dream sequence with it and not see a
helmet that stabs journey in the dream

500
00:31:11 --> 00:31:17
and i just figured i&#39;d make this kind of
demonic dead kind of werewolf like thing

501
00:31:17 --> 00:31:23
with not see how I think the second one
was the one that&#39;s got to kinda like

502
00:31:23 --> 00:31:23
that

503
00:31:23 --> 00:31:26
yeah it got it to a point where
everything was there in the hand that

504
00:31:26 --> 00:31:31
happened over to Tom master to finish
once i did was the as a bald not see

505
00:31:31 --> 00:31:37
diamond really sort of very squarish
face and it was it was fun really going

506
00:31:37 --> 00:31:41
into a lot of the detail figuring out
the teeth and and how that was going to

507
00:31:41 --> 00:31:44
look there was another one that we did
that was more distant again like a

508
00:31:44 --> 00:31:47
werewolf wasn&#39;t a dead we&#39;re all kind of
one that Sean mackerel finished blocked

509
00:31:47 --> 00:31:52
out the other one that was left was one
Steve Johnson did and I was kind of

510
00:31:52 --> 00:31:54
frankly running out of ideas at the
moment and a lot of stuff to finish this

511
00:31:54 --> 00:31:54
okay

512
00:31:54 --> 00:31:57
do you want to do one and he like took
the ball and ran with it needed that one

513
00:31:57 --> 00:32:00
which kind of like almost like a mohawk
and they you know I was kind of hoping

514
00:32:00 --> 00:32:02
to do makeup for those guys because a
little concerned about I&#39;m just being

515
00:32:02 --> 00:32:05
there basically like Halloween masters
over to have masks and and Johnson no

516
00:32:05 --> 00:32:07
Matt it&#39;s gonna be fine i know how I&#39;m
gonna show you this is really they

517
00:32:07 --> 00:32:10
really don&#39;t have to do much of anything
and and they just need to be scary

518
00:32:10 --> 00:32:11
looking

519
00:32:11 --> 00:32:14
I think there&#39;s more worried about a
sleeping

520
00:32:14 --> 00:32:17
next thing in this next clip and I
remember just hearing that muffled voice

521
00:32:17 --> 00:32:17
inside

522
00:32:17 --> 00:32:22
no Clark see you very well who no no no
that&#39;s that&#39;s good to hear you know it&#39;s

523
00:32:22 --> 00:32:26
john put you up to that you have this
appliance and you don&#39;t want it to go

524
00:32:26 --> 00:32:30
off prematurely is it&#39;s going to be a
couple more hours of back in the makeup

525
00:32:30 --> 00:32:35
chair so you do anything not to please
no more makeup chair and in the end you

526
00:32:35 --> 00:32:39
get every good one it&#39;s open and it&#39;s
going it&#39;s horrible and it yeah

527
00:32:39 --> 00:32:42
got it

528
00:32:42 --> 00:32:45
it&#39;s not a dream when you&#39;re shooting it
thanks same thing

529
00:32:45 --> 00:32:48
it&#39;s for real hello given up hope

530
00:32:48 --> 00:32:51
I&#39;ve just had a nightmare the concept of
the dream within the dream i took

531
00:32:51 --> 00:32:55
directly from a blood well film called
discreet charm of the bourgeoisie i

532
00:32:55 --> 00:32:57
turned it around and made it into a
scare

533
00:32:57 --> 00:33:04
Jenny&#39;s did this thing that really
shocked me at the time she falls to the

534
00:33:04 --> 00:33:09
floor and David screams and then you cut
back to him repeatedly plunging this

535
00:33:09 --> 00:33:12
knife in and chen he did this thing
every time that I came out our bodies of

536
00:33:12 --> 00:33:13
a jerk bags of life

537
00:33:13 --> 00:33:19
oh yeah Jamie holy shit it&#39;s one of my
favorite times to to watch with an

538
00:33:19 --> 00:33:23
audience with it when the film was in
the theaters to watch what would happen

539
00:33:23 --> 00:33:26
in the audience reaction people in
relation jumping out of their seats

540
00:33:26 --> 00:33:31
I&#39;ll have a piece of toast when it gets
very glory I just didn&#39;t look I thought

541
00:33:31 --> 00:33:32
you&#39;d be glad to see me

542
00:33:32 --> 00:33:35
Oh God leather you&#39;re hurting my
feelings

543
00:33:35 --> 00:33:38
got that one should have to be sitting
next to a river done in the morning

544
00:33:38 --> 00:33:40
first thing before you had your
breakfast when he&#39;s having that gossipy

545
00:33:40 --> 00:33:43
makeup input on Griffin was quite
freaked out

546
00:33:43 --> 00:33:47
the first day that Rick Baker put the
makeup on him you could see it and

547
00:33:47 --> 00:33:50
putting these pieces on with several
different pieces and kind of thinking

548
00:33:50 --> 00:33:53
more and more in the chair and ski more
and more depressed and it&#39;s like

549
00:33:53 --> 00:33:55
expander Griffin

550
00:33:55 --> 00:33:58
nothing you don&#39;t go no really something
wrong with the matter and finally said

551
00:33:58 --> 00:33:58
you know

552
00:33:58 --> 00:34:02
look look at it they were putting it on
and the first was all white and then

553
00:34:02 --> 00:34:08
this little vain thing in it and they
started to apply makeup tonight and I

554
00:34:08 --> 00:34:12
saw it was going to look like it&#39;s going
to be gruesome

555
00:34:12 --> 00:34:16
it&#39;s going to be really really gross
quite an unsettling experience to the

556
00:34:16 --> 00:34:19
truth I it when i became for finally
depressed because you&#39;ve got a very

557
00:34:19 --> 00:34:21
strong sense of what you would look like
if you were dead

558
00:34:21 --> 00:34:25
my mother was was was ill at the time
and I remember thinking my mother can&#39;t

559
00:34:25 --> 00:34:26
see this

560
00:34:26 --> 00:34:30
so this little freaked her out you look
pretty disgusting in real life so people

561
00:34:30 --> 00:34:34
were like avoiding him who i still
remember the first time I saw this I oh

562
00:34:34 --> 00:34:35
my god

563
00:34:35 --> 00:34:40
a little like my throat&#39;s been toward an
antibiotic doesn&#39;t make big movie break

564
00:34:40 --> 00:34:41
and always going to want to look at me

565
00:34:41 --> 00:34:46
you know hunted did you read the script
yeah good doesn&#39;t it say your throats

566
00:34:46 --> 00:34:50
torn out and have your faces toward on
ya see how but somehow I didn&#39;t think it

567
00:34:50 --> 00:34:51
was gonna look like this

568
00:34:51 --> 00:34:53
you know it&#39;s think he wasn&#39;t a happy
camper at that moment you know I

569
00:34:53 --> 00:34:56
remember sitting forward pole right off
to John and saying I think you need to

570
00:34:56 --> 00:34:57
talk grades because he&#39;s done

571
00:34:57 --> 00:35:00
we are pleased in the moment he was he
was pretty shocked and me and it really

572
00:35:00 --> 00:35:04
took me and John Wilder to comment down
and convince them that we do what we

573
00:35:04 --> 00:35:07
were doing but you know he finally got
got used to it he was a real trouper

574
00:35:07 --> 00:35:07
about

575
00:35:07 --> 00:35:10
once he got over is a natural reaction I
realize I don&#39;t look so hot

576
00:35:10 --> 00:35:15
David initial tests that they didn&#39;t
Griffin I had blood all over dirt and

577
00:35:15 --> 00:35:15
stuff

578
00:35:15 --> 00:35:18
that&#39;s where one thing where John did
have something to say but and he wanted

579
00:35:18 --> 00:35:21
him to be perfectly clean when he shows
up in the hospital first time other than

580
00:35:21 --> 00:35:25
the woods wanted it to be you who wanted
to make sure that it was Griffin there

581
00:35:25 --> 00:35:28
yeah we just hoped you could be captured
on film because it looks so great and it

582
00:35:28 --> 00:35:31
was you know glistening and they were in
their painting it to look fresh

583
00:35:31 --> 00:35:36
it was so realistic with the the flesh
and that little piece of flesh hanging

584
00:35:36 --> 00:35:40
everybody cut talks about the little you
know dangly part that&#39;s all that was

585
00:35:40 --> 00:35:44
really hard for it wasn&#39;t me
intentionally planted to do that it was

586
00:35:44 --> 00:35:47
a little piece they put on there and
because it was wet and weight of the

587
00:35:47 --> 00:35:48
water on it

588
00:35:48 --> 00:35:51
talk that nothing was moving turned out
to be as well as fun things that happens

589
00:35:51 --> 00:35:56
that stage 1 stage 2 is a makeup and
many more appliances to try to make it

590
00:35:56 --> 00:36:00
look a little more gone to the little
more rotten and it was kind of greenish

591
00:36:00 --> 00:36:01
color

592
00:36:01 --> 00:36:04
what are you doing here I wanted to see
you

593
00:36:04 --> 00:36:12
hi David put that down it was pretty
sick as far as some appliances go but i

594
00:36:12 --> 00:36:15
really wanted and not get some depth you
know I wanted to do you want to really

595
00:36:15 --> 00:36:19
see that the thyroid cartilage and stuff
here and he was basically all covered

596
00:36:19 --> 00:36:22
with appliances and Emily you&#39;ve got to
take your own life

597
00:36:22 --> 00:36:27
I remembered that I had to get up at
four in the morning as opposed to five

598
00:36:27 --> 00:36:32
I could appreciate it uh and I can
appreciate how exciting it was for

599
00:36:32 --> 00:36:35
everyone else putting it on but to be
the guy sitting in the chair from for

600
00:36:35 --> 00:36:37
the morning for six seven hours

601
00:36:37 --> 00:36:40
you know that the throw that were off
pretty quick you know I just sit there

602
00:36:40 --> 00:36:45
patiently try not to go out of my mind
I&#39;m not having a nice time here as a

603
00:36:45 --> 00:36:52
Pidgey guy who just wanted to pull it
off then it was on you know it&#39;s glue to

604
00:36:52 --> 00:36:56
glue it to your face the heat it would
construct it was like being eaten alive

605
00:36:56 --> 00:36:57
by ants

606
00:36:57 --> 00:37:04
tomorrow night&#39;s the full moon you&#39;re
going to change you&#39;ll be kind know I

607
00:37:04 --> 00:37:05
know

608
00:37:05 --> 00:37:10
a monster is behind this closed or hear
that one of the pinnacle moments in the

609
00:37:10 --> 00:37:13
film takes place that in which david
kessler turns into the four-legged home

610
00:37:13 --> 00:37:16
from help now for Rick Baker it was
without a doubt the biggest test of his

611
00:37:16 --> 00:37:16
career

612
00:37:16 --> 00:37:19
- realistically show the transformation
from a young man into a werewolf

613
00:37:19 --> 00:37:22
while at the same time using bright
harsh fluorescent lighting and

614
00:37:22 --> 00:37:25
special-effects sequence which to this
day remains the most impressive in

615
00:37:25 --> 00:37:28
cinema history the transformation that
recognized discussed for years

616
00:37:28 --> 00:37:33
finally I i wanted it bright light I
wanted no no cutaways even said to me

617
00:37:33 --> 00:37:38
make me storyboards I hate making
storyboards but we did for the werewolf

618
00:37:38 --> 00:37:44
stuff you know we really discussed it a
long time and then he realized it

619
00:37:44 --> 00:37:49
John definitely had input in the study
and werewolf and he also was good about

620
00:37:49 --> 00:37:51
you know you&#39;re the guy you&#39;re the
you&#39;re the artist that does this stuff

621
00:37:51 --> 00:37:55
you do it to a certain amount of time to
make this stuff and all this and it was

622
00:37:55 --> 00:37:59
like time to ship stuff to England and
we weren&#39;t totally ready so we had a

623
00:37:59 --> 00:38:01
workshop in England which was in
Richmond

624
00:38:01 --> 00:38:04
they&#39;re tricking them and it was this
old abandoned schoolhouse where we

625
00:38:04 --> 00:38:08
finish most of the change our heads were
finished their we punch in here to

626
00:38:08 --> 00:38:11
change your head and in enrichment
finish in these parts and John smart

627
00:38:11 --> 00:38:14
exciting you know that make us take a
while so we can&#39;t do a lot in a day so

628
00:38:14 --> 00:38:18
he figured the transformation would be
like a post-production thing

629
00:38:18 --> 00:38:23
it took us a week to shoot it shoot one
maybe two shots a day with David Norton

630
00:38:23 --> 00:38:28
in a makeup preparation for maybe four
or five hours six days of shooting 10

631
00:38:28 --> 00:38:31
hours a day in five a.m. call and come
out in the afternoon

632
00:38:31 --> 00:38:33
it was a long week

633
00:38:33 --> 00:38:36
I always thought if your body is going
to go through such a huge change its

634
00:38:36 --> 00:38:36
gonna hurt

635
00:38:36 --> 00:38:42
I wanted paying for David was gonna get
this close off this is I&#39;m burning up

636
00:38:42 --> 00:38:46
for whatever doesn&#39;t stand there you
rightly Rome and you know first thing

637
00:38:46 --> 00:38:49
that happens is at hand and that brings
his hand up and had a really simple

638
00:38:49 --> 00:38:50
mechanism in it

639
00:38:50 --> 00:38:55
basically if you have a strange with it
the plunger out in a plastic to going to

640
00:38:55 --> 00:38:56
another syringe with a plunger in

641
00:38:56 --> 00:38:59
can you push the plunger in on this
syringe that plunger goes out real basic

642
00:38:59 --> 00:39:00
pneumatic Ram

643
00:39:00 --> 00:39:04
it&#39;s basically this plastic piece with
you know for syringes in it

644
00:39:04 --> 00:39:10
push this plunger in the hand would
stretch out here

645
00:39:10 --> 00:39:13
me

646
00:39:13 --> 00:39:16
come around to the other side it&#39;s one
that we weren&#39;t we sculpted stretched

647
00:39:16 --> 00:39:19
out and got the beginnings of a pad and
the fingers kind of &lt;operand&gt; seven

648
00:39:19 --> 00:39:23
&lt;/operand&gt; marbles position the sturgeon
is on the floor holding this rod

649
00:39:23 --> 00:39:26
the hand was part of David&#39;s real arm is
down and try to align it so it looks

650
00:39:26 --> 00:39:31
like that was his hand sticking out with
that elbow is out of frame David is not

651
00:39:31 --> 00:39:33
even have chest areas and Harry at all

652
00:39:33 --> 00:39:36
the first thing we shot with David was
him with is the most amount of hair

653
00:39:36 --> 00:39:41
glued onto his body and I said to John
more practical for us to shoot at first

654
00:39:41 --> 00:39:45
and then trim the hair and enjoyed this
and trim the hair and shoot this you

655
00:39:45 --> 00:39:47
know pull some hair off and trim it and
then you have this one so that&#39;s kind of

656
00:39:47 --> 00:39:50
what we did so we didn&#39;t shoot
necessarily in sequence when statements

657
00:39:50 --> 00:39:55
change your hands stretches out who had
a makeup that match that so it wasn&#39;t an

658
00:39:55 --> 00:40:00
appliance and I know that kind of ended
here was with David&#39;s real thumb but his

659
00:40:00 --> 00:40:03
his fingers were inside the palm because
upon stretched out and they were like

660
00:40:03 --> 00:40:07
sculpted fingers and remember this day
when we were putting this makeup on in

661
00:40:07 --> 00:40:11
Finley remember David sufficient ships
with you stupid hands on that he

662
00:40:11 --> 00:40:18
couldn&#39;t do anything with our pastor
david sweet with syringes in at the

663
00:40:18 --> 00:40:23
stretched out some of the most startling
effect with the easiest to do like the

664
00:40:23 --> 00:40:24
hair growing out of the flesh

665
00:40:24 --> 00:40:27
did you tell you how you did that just
as flat piece of this spoon on your

666
00:40:27 --> 00:40:31
thing that hair punch through and you
just don&#39;t always hair then he pulled it

667
00:40:31 --> 00:40:35
backwards so that you just screamed it
backwards and all their came back with a

668
00:40:35 --> 00:40:38
really simple stop

669
00:40:38 --> 00:40:41
I remember the rule doing that one
particular along the change it back

670
00:40:41 --> 00:40:45
I&#39;m and we were doing that for much of
the day it was all pneumatic with

671
00:40:45 --> 00:40:49
plunges and we were blowing air through
tubes to get them to to the effect it

672
00:40:49 --> 00:40:52
was clearly set up some parts of his
bodies were obscured by pieces of

673
00:40:52 --> 00:40:55
furniture and things which was made it
easier for us to be able to students

674
00:40:55 --> 00:40:59
individual parts and I have to make some
body any like those other lands on the

675
00:40:59 --> 00:41:02
ground that&#39;s the big a stretched-out
body huh

676
00:41:02 --> 00:41:08
that was you know David in in a hole in
the set in the floor was another day

677
00:41:08 --> 00:41:13
where I&#39;m actually in the floor of of
the set and couldn&#39;t get out for you for

678
00:41:13 --> 00:41:17
hours or so I go I don&#39;t know that you
can you do this to an actor

679
00:41:17 --> 00:41:20
this set was built off the throw by
about 4 feet

680
00:41:20 --> 00:41:25
we came to that height has been up to my
work for publications to work underneath

681
00:41:25 --> 00:41:30
and manipulate the animatronics David
with you lying back with his arms and

682
00:41:30 --> 00:41:34
head sticking out a whole and the rest
of his total fake body that Tom master

683
00:41:34 --> 00:41:35
sculptor I thought was really cool

684
00:41:35 --> 00:41:39
my father&#39;s a as orthopedic surgeon so
I&#39;ve always been interested in anatomy

685
00:41:39 --> 00:41:43
and really enjoyed you know figuring out
how to make the veins

686
00:41:43 --> 00:41:47
you know on the surface sort of show up
one spot and dive down below the surface

687
00:41:47 --> 00:41:48
then show up again

688
00:41:48 --> 00:41:52
not super monster and style but try to
make it realistic in a way it had a

689
00:41:52 --> 00:41:56
couple rods sticking out that the ankles
and we can move the feet with i

690
00:41:56 --> 00:42:00
remembers telling is never really happy
with how they were looking remember

691
00:42:00 --> 00:42:06
after you decided we had it we got David
out a whole remember looking at the body

692
00:42:06 --> 00:42:12
by itself without arms or head
convulsing exactly the way I wanted it

693
00:42:12 --> 00:42:12
to do

694
00:42:12 --> 00:42:14
this is what we should have got away but
you know what do you do when you&#39;re

695
00:42:14 --> 00:42:14
doing it now

696
00:42:14 --> 00:42:17
we end up and say what are you talking
about you your your property in exactly

697
00:42:17 --> 00:42:18
the way it should be

698
00:42:18 --> 00:42:20
we&#39;re just trying to pull it fucking
rods hours you know when they&#39;re just

699
00:42:20 --> 00:42:23
bringing his rise out of think this is
doing exactly what I want to take it

700
00:42:23 --> 00:42:24
that&#39;s that then we

701
00:42:24 --> 00:42:27
David had a and appliance on that looks
like the change your head number one

702
00:42:27 --> 00:42:30
parent or hair around his neck and stuff
I mean these appliances

703
00:42:30 --> 00:42:33
there are pieces that throughout that
would be applied to your forehead and

704
00:42:33 --> 00:42:37
nose and then they blend it you know and
make it up and then add hair

705
00:42:37 --> 00:42:38
individually strands of it

706
00:42:38 --> 00:42:40
David was from really a lot of fun to
work with he was no problem you know and

707
00:42:40 --> 00:42:41
he had had a hard part

708
00:42:41 --> 00:42:45
and he had a lot more to deal with the
makeups and with a long make up time

709
00:42:45 --> 00:42:47
when we put him in the hole in the
ground for the transformation thing I

710
00:42:47 --> 00:42:51
remember that being said like 10 hours
of us goofing around and we could move

711
00:42:51 --> 00:42:54
but he was great through the whole
process he never really bitched and

712
00:42:54 --> 00:42:57
moaned about it and you know i&#39;m sure it
was a grueling experience for you

713
00:42:57 --> 00:43:03
purposely John what did they had to
change the last didn&#39;t want to have to

714
00:43:03 --> 00:43:05
change very much because he wanted to
the transformation did you know

715
00:43:05 --> 00:43:08
basically kind of comes climax with the
head change all the changing parts are

716
00:43:08 --> 00:43:11
made out of the urethane that this
company called spooky smooth on made

717
00:43:11 --> 00:43:16
that was a new product at the time and
had like a B and C component they be in

718
00:43:16 --> 00:43:19
the base material and then he being the
the catalyst in the sea was a

719
00:43:19 --> 00:43:24
plasticizer so you can plasticize this
to make it more stretching so we did

720
00:43:24 --> 00:43:26
some tests we didn&#39;t like double the
amount of things that you can do so we

721
00:43:26 --> 00:43:27
had this really stretchy rubber

722
00:43:27 --> 00:43:29
I also thought it would be something
that would probably last night was

723
00:43:29 --> 00:43:32
really wrong the plasticizer continue to
work on the urethane until just turned

724
00:43:32 --> 00:43:36
into snot and we also found out
plasticizer is hacked in kind of plastic

725
00:43:36 --> 00:43:40
that it was around and we found this
water extended resident was weird thing

726
00:43:40 --> 00:43:45
I don&#39;t know how he found it but it was
a different kind of resin and ended up

727
00:43:45 --> 00:43:46
working so that&#39;s what we made it

728
00:43:46 --> 00:43:50
this move the mechanism took a life cast
that they&#39;ve been on and then Rick

729
00:43:50 --> 00:43:52
sculpted from there so he did the
sculpture

730
00:43:52 --> 00:43:57
did the mold I want to be the mall we
pour it out a third certain thickness

731
00:43:57 --> 00:44:02
and we have to put this which is the
poor that the skin goes over and at that

732
00:44:02 --> 00:44:07
point basically just cut all the pieces
out with the mechanic time and and just

733
00:44:07 --> 00:44:11
keep working it until it&#39;s exactly the
right place to give the effect of

734
00:44:11 --> 00:44:11
looking for

735
00:44:11 --> 00:44:13
I was worried about making eyes that
look real enough

736
00:44:13 --> 00:44:18
and getting the I mechanism to work in
his head that was going to be stretching

737
00:44:18 --> 00:44:21
and moving and we purposely close the
eyes and the change is the eyes are

738
00:44:21 --> 00:44:24
screening up in like pain because I just
knew it was going to be a problem to

739
00:44:24 --> 00:44:27
make the eyes look right and we took a
light cast of David not and make an

740
00:44:27 --> 00:44:28
expression of pained expression

741
00:44:28 --> 00:44:31
I&#39;m gonna use the clay press out of that
cast and then sculpt the nose a little

742
00:44:31 --> 00:44:31
bit more

743
00:44:31 --> 00:44:33
I&#39;m like it&#39;s starting to change is
changing enough so it wasn&#39;t just human

744
00:44:33 --> 00:44:33
David

745
00:44:33 --> 00:44:35
he was just a face gasps and i sculpted
the rest of the head and the shoulders

746
00:44:35 --> 00:44:39
to make first change i had and then I
did another one which was the second

747
00:44:39 --> 00:44:42
stage change your hands on the evidence
and it&#39;s asymmetrical one side is more

748
00:44:42 --> 00:44:46
human one side the more wolf like my
thinking was it could start cheating on

749
00:44:46 --> 00:44:50
the human side it would turn and then to
get more out of the changeover head but

750
00:44:50 --> 00:44:56
we found out as we were shooting it when
we turn the head in faster and turn them

751
00:44:56 --> 00:44:58
into more movement that was you actually
didn&#39;t see the stretching out of the

752
00:44:58 --> 00:45:01
face which was the kind of big payoff
and cool piece

753
00:45:01 --> 00:45:05
so so we ended up not using it out that
way

754
00:45:05 --> 00:45:09
turn it up just went straight profile of
a suspected shaking we spent all this

755
00:45:09 --> 00:45:14
time making these changes our heads and
it really took very little time to shoot

756
00:45:14 --> 00:45:18
at John with a action and we pull a
lever that stretch the face out and push

757
00:45:18 --> 00:45:22
to plan your husband and you turn the
head or whatever we did shake it a

758
00:45:22 --> 00:45:22
little bit

759
00:45:22 --> 00:45:25
the cut that&#39;s it before we work this
for months

760
00:45:25 --> 00:45:27
you know it&#39;s like we do a couple tanks
and that&#39;s the end of it doesn&#39;t do

761
00:45:27 --> 00:45:28
anything else

762
00:45:28 --> 00:45:33
no really well we&#39;ve gotta go yeah it&#39;s
disappointing you know it&#39;s like we

763
00:45:33 --> 00:45:35
spent all this time and we shoot in a
couple minutes

764
00:45:35 --> 00:45:38
suspiciously the room gets darker for
some reason it&#39;s mainly because he

765
00:45:38 --> 00:45:41
didn&#39;t want to go all the way to the
hairy creature but we wanted something

766
00:45:41 --> 00:45:44
there so that very last thing that you
see the transformation was something

767
00:45:44 --> 00:45:47
that we just built on the last minute
was mostly time history

768
00:45:47 --> 00:45:52
we had a an additional casting of the
body for the transformation scene so we

769
00:45:52 --> 00:45:57
use that folded it up into the Crouch
position and then just fabricated some

770
00:45:57 --> 00:46:03
foam arms and shoulders and I think
there was a head was another casting

771
00:46:03 --> 00:46:05
from the original wolf mold

772
00:46:05 --> 00:46:10
he took that and carved it down shrunk
it down a little bit so it would wasn&#39;t

773
00:46:10 --> 00:46:12
quite as wasn&#39;t meant to be as big as
the final werewolf

774
00:46:12 --> 00:46:15
it was also sort of cut and paste poly
foam and then I put you know

775
00:46:15 --> 00:46:19
latex over the surface of it and laid
hair on the body and that was set up

776
00:46:19 --> 00:46:21
we know it&#39;s a rod puppet that we work
from underneath that&#39;s the

777
00:46:21 --> 00:46:25
transformation in and fortunately you
know this stuff was all kind of new and

778
00:46:25 --> 00:46:29
it&#39;s in its infancy and I had a crew of
basically any experience kids and I

779
00:46:29 --> 00:46:30
wasn&#39;t all that experience myself

780
00:46:30 --> 00:46:33
Rick was really hands-on and you know I
was basically I i do it

781
00:46:33 --> 00:46:36
it&#39;s a move it an inch to the left eye I
go back in

782
00:46:36 --> 00:46:39
we would an inch to the left show it to
him to move it quarter inch to the right

783
00:46:39 --> 00:46:43
now let it go do that and I just doing
it until it was exactly what we wanted

784
00:46:43 --> 00:46:47
he was very generous with his knowledge
and his time his manner was excellent I

785
00:46:47 --> 00:46:51
mean he never seemed to get hassled
about anything in the makeup room

786
00:46:51 --> 00:46:55
just get on with the job full
concentration spirits high

787
00:46:55 --> 00:47:00
it was brilliant and very modest relate
to know just got onto these job and made

788
00:47:00 --> 00:47:03
it happen it we just stood there and
watched it happen and it is amazing and

789
00:47:03 --> 00:47:04
we also do is magic

790
00:47:04 --> 00:47:07
it&#39;s definitely the biggest thing i dint
to the point the transformation takes

791
00:47:07 --> 00:47:09
place in this brightly lit room which I
wasn&#39;t too pleased about it&#39;s nice to

792
00:47:09 --> 00:47:12
have shadows and movie lighting to kind
of hide things a little bit

793
00:47:12 --> 00:47:16
it&#39;s totally outrageous for me to ask
him to have it done a bright light

794
00:47:16 --> 00:47:21
that&#39;s the most unforgiving in the fact
that that is playing this pin it wasn&#39;t

795
00:47:21 --> 00:47:26
scored piece where the music is helping
as it&#39;s like explain blue moon in the

796
00:47:26 --> 00:47:27
background

797
00:47:27 --> 00:47:32
there&#39;s very little score in in American
Werewolf home I was it was a great

798
00:47:32 --> 00:47:34
friend and get a lot of movies for us

799
00:47:34 --> 00:47:38
he wrote a beautiful score a lovely
scored that we recorded in the church in

800
00:47:38 --> 00:47:42
London he wanted desperately to write
the music for the metamorphosis and I

801
00:47:42 --> 00:47:45
said well now i know im using Sam
Cooke&#39;s blue

802
00:47:45 --> 00:47:52
we used the song blue moon three times
and the third time was in the main title

803
00:47:52 --> 00:47:54
and it was never intended to be used
there

804
00:47:54 --> 00:47:57
that was supposed to be moonshadow by
cat stevens i love the song but if you

805
00:47:57 --> 00:47:58
listen to it

806
00:47:58 --> 00:48:02
it&#39;s sort of like the area but he&#39;s
talking about dismemberment quite a

807
00:48:02 --> 00:48:06
grizzly song were horrified to find out
that cat stevens felt that we couldn&#39;t

808
00:48:06 --> 00:48:11
use his music that way you decided where
one&#39;s for real or something in and

809
00:48:11 --> 00:48:13
didn&#39;t want to help us music used in
anything

810
00:48:13 --> 00:48:17
Bob Dylan had the same problem for
different religious reasons but also

811
00:48:17 --> 00:48:21
religious reasons for not letting us use
his his version of blue moon

812
00:48:21 --> 00:48:27
it was very ethereal bob dylan&#39;s version
I liked a lot and at that moment in time

813
00:48:27 --> 00:48:32
bob was born again and I couldn&#39;t buy it
for an r-rated film one of my favorite

814
00:48:32 --> 00:48:36
ones of the blue moon is the the sam
cooke version

815
00:48:36 --> 00:48:39
yeah

816
00:48:39 --> 00:48:44
you would think that the transformation
sequence would be horrific and really

817
00:48:44 --> 00:48:46
very very scary in

818
00:48:46 --> 00:48:49
in fact it is very sad and painful

819
00:48:49 --> 00:48:55
I did not call you mean that was like oh
boy this is is this great doesn&#39;t it

820
00:48:55 --> 00:49:01
just continued back about that songs
that a better not kind of that at the

821
00:49:01 --> 00:49:06
sand track behind the suddenly appear
and I think they helped tremendously to

822
00:49:06 --> 00:49:10
create this kind of anarchic and
unconventional

823
00:49:10 --> 00:49:14
I&#39;m view of the story we were 10

824
00:49:14 --> 00:49:18
it&#39;s really tricky to do it and people
do it all the time and it&#39;s usually not

825
00:49:18 --> 00:49:22
very good and they&#39;re just trying to
force in songs to sell albums in in this

826
00:49:22 --> 00:49:26
case I thought we did okay in terms of
of using the pop songs to drive the

827
00:49:26 --> 00:49:26
story

828
00:49:26 --> 00:49:29
well it makes it sort of a time capsule
I can&#39;t hear some of those songs without

829
00:49:29 --> 00:49:32
thinking

830
00:49:32 --> 00:49:32
yeah

831
00:49:32 --> 00:49:44
that&#39;s 150 days on carry on with the
actors who played the sort of upper

832
00:49:44 --> 00:49:49
class twit girl Brenda she was freezing
cold and no matter what we did she was

833
00:49:49 --> 00:49:53
shivering so they&#39;re murder is actually
cut short and night that we did the

834
00:49:53 --> 00:49:57
filming in Hampstead Heath was very very
very cold and I was so cold I couldn&#39;t

835
00:49:57 --> 00:50:03
stop shivering so it take off to take of
me hearing the sound of this kind of

836
00:50:03 --> 00:50:05
thing jumping at me

837
00:50:05 --> 00:50:13
did you hear something just now no I
think after about 20 or 30 takes we had

838
00:50:13 --> 00:50:17
to abandon except couldn&#39;t stop shaking
for

839
00:50:17 --> 00:50:20
before the end they took the short

840
00:50:20 --> 00:50:25
I&#39;d seen the film many years ago called
raw meat about this guy living in the

841
00:50:25 --> 00:50:29
subways and I just remember thinking
what a wonderfully creepy place the

842
00:50:29 --> 00:50:30
subway

843
00:50:30 --> 00:50:36
I just thought this is a good place for
murder it I&#39;m so one-footed getting my

844
00:50:36 --> 00:50:38
mom and I got it

845
00:50:38 --> 00:50:42
I have lost a lot of weight and feel
very weak of course the last thing you

846
00:50:42 --> 00:50:44
want to do you feel that is do what we
did

847
00:50:44 --> 00:50:47
don&#39;t Tom core tube station

848
00:50:47 --> 00:50:52
come on that front door might by four
o&#39;clock in the morning we also do

849
00:50:52 --> 00:50:55
disappear but I think there&#39;s something
wrong with a steady camera mode so we

850
00:50:55 --> 00:50:58
couldn&#39;t get everything else the
pin-sharp so we doing on the water takes

851
00:50:58 --> 00:51:03
and radio static cameras following me
and for you to die i&#39;m going to show you

852
00:51:03 --> 00:51:05
that this is not the least bit amusing

853
00:51:05 --> 00:51:11
it was unusual to actually understanding
steady can and i had a bracket made

854
00:51:11 --> 00:51:15
whilst working on a previous film and i
was able to to drop the camera down to

855
00:51:15 --> 00:51:20
about 34 to battleground which no gave
the lovely effective the the wolf&#39;s

856
00:51:20 --> 00:51:24
point of view report

857
00:51:24 --> 00:51:28
John are free to do a running shot with
Mike and the normal thing

858
00:51:28 --> 00:51:33
no dave was to ask my to just cut their
speed down because when the camera is

859
00:51:33 --> 00:51:34
traveling with them

860
00:51:34 --> 00:51:37
it looks fast enough as it is but John
didn&#39;t want that

861
00:51:37 --> 00:51:42
and so I had to do this flat out I said
when he falls on those escalator I

862
00:51:42 --> 00:51:43
wanted to really hurt

863
00:51:43 --> 00:51:46
Carter you are right

864
00:51:46 --> 00:51:49
he was fine but it&#39;s it&#39;s a that&#39;s a
good start

865
00:51:49 --> 00:51:56
shot last thing you know you can come to
our staircase and John is saying i want

866
00:51:56 --> 00:51:58
to see death in your face

867
00:51:58 --> 00:51:59
yeah

868
00:51:59 --> 00:52:01
yeah

869
00:52:01 --> 00:52:03
yeah

870
00:52:03 --> 00:52:07
yeah

871
00:52:07 --> 00:52:10
shoot in the the Royals ooh

872
00:52:10 --> 00:52:16
fortunately John had some connections to
a member of parliament and i was able to

873
00:52:16 --> 00:52:19
get to the to the authorities

874
00:52:19 --> 00:52:24
it took me a couple of days to convince
them that you know we would shoot before

875
00:52:24 --> 00:52:27
with a naked man in the zoo

876
00:52:27 --> 00:52:34
thank you he would shoot before any
parents would bring young children there

877
00:52:34 --> 00:52:43
they were interesting the Wolves because
they were wolves

878
00:52:43 --> 00:52:46
what makes you nervous about what any
wild animal makes there&#39;s a lot of

879
00:52:46 --> 00:52:51
wolves is you think they&#39;re big dogs but
they&#39;re not they can turn around and go

880
00:52:51 --> 00:52:51
home

881
00:52:51 --> 00:52:59
it&#39;s incredible how quickly climbs out
of that but if you read the script it

882
00:52:59 --> 00:53:00
doesn&#39;t look like a big deal

883
00:53:00 --> 00:53:05
hey wakes up at the zoo it was one of
those things that you just you know stay

884
00:53:05 --> 00:53:08
in character and every time it gets
awkward is when they cut and now you&#39;re

885
00:53:08 --> 00:53:10
just a naked guy standing on the street
corner

886
00:53:10 --> 00:53:17
excuse me that was so funny because
again this was a woman who didn&#39;t know

887
00:53:17 --> 00:53:21
what was you know going to be done see
there&#39;s going to be a man coming out

888
00:53:21 --> 00:53:25
from around this bush and he&#39;s just
going to say something to you so you

889
00:53:25 --> 00:53:29
just star started when it comes out that
was literally the direction that she was

890
00:53:29 --> 00:53:32
given I remember talking to her after
what she said I didn&#39;t look down

891
00:53:32 --> 00:53:35
and johns or even have a joke and he
asked me to follow it

892
00:53:35 --> 00:53:41
take apart the picture and the first I
said now you can do you know I contact

893
00:53:41 --> 00:53:44
and stop lot of weather we&#39;ve been
having lately

894
00:53:44 --> 00:53:48
so obviously men at the bus stop when I
like to look around and discuss what was

895
00:53:48 --> 00:53:51
that was doing that all the electrician
who stood in a line

896
00:53:51 --> 00:53:55
the moon they pulled their trousers down
so we&#39;re trying to make me laugh

897
00:53:55 --> 00:54:02
jun so it must take about four or five
six shots to be able to get that that

898
00:54:02 --> 00:54:06
take that it was fun and I&#39;ve got two
credits on the film that that was my

899
00:54:06 --> 00:54:07
reward

900
00:54:07 --> 00:54:10
when we shot in the actually in the city
of london

901
00:54:10 --> 00:54:13
we really didn&#39;t have too many problems
in terms of that

902
00:54:13 --> 00:54:16
well there was official procedure which
was it is down to the Bobby on the beat

903
00:54:16 --> 00:54:21
sure I killed those people last night
you could say this off and you&#39;re fucked

904
00:54:21 --> 00:54:25
all right here to move along right
because I done such extensive urban

905
00:54:25 --> 00:54:28
shooting in chicago on the Blues
Brothers

906
00:54:28 --> 00:54:33
I had to metropolitan police at Scotland
Yard speak to the Chicago cops

907
00:54:33 --> 00:54:37
John was great had said it he&#39;s a great
salesman you could send anything and he

908
00:54:37 --> 00:54:39
could sell this is something I&#39;ve been
shooting the Blues Brothers you going to

909
00:54:39 --> 00:54:40
come and see its own and it Oh

910
00:54:40 --> 00:54:43
Warner Brothers leicester square I can
you take it anytime you&#39;ll see what we

911
00:54:43 --> 00:54:47
did there and what&#39;s great about John is
he knows what he wants and you don&#39;t go

912
00:54:47 --> 00:54:50
through a lot of the BS that you do with
a lot of other directors he gives you

913
00:54:50 --> 00:54:52
the freedom it gives you guidance

914
00:54:52 --> 00:54:56
you know he he answers the questions and
and and made some fun stuff

915
00:54:56 --> 00:54:59
Landis is terrific to work with an
active first one he has an absolute

916
00:54:59 --> 00:55:03
knowledge of activity really enjoys them
and he likes getting things out of the

917
00:55:03 --> 00:55:04
month he knows what you&#39;re doing

918
00:55:04 --> 00:55:07
so that you do you feel very safe but
when he added things together

919
00:55:07 --> 00:55:10
he&#39;s not gonna leave you with egg on
your face because he&#39;s getting is going

920
00:55:10 --> 00:55:11
to look for the best things

921
00:55:11 --> 00:55:17
he also he never allows moments to die
on sir he&#39;s permanently up talking

922
00:55:17 --> 00:55:20
joking you know talk about what&#39;s going
on talking about things is doing just

923
00:55:20 --> 00:55:21
making jokes

924
00:55:21 --> 00:55:26
he was the first real director I work
with you know I do not talk actors and

925
00:55:26 --> 00:55:29
hang out with us after shooting and
might become a director sent tonight and

926
00:55:29 --> 00:55:30
I think John a lot

927
00:55:30 --> 00:55:36
he&#39;s very he&#39;s very direct and when he
eats something he just says it all out

928
00:55:36 --> 00:55:40
terrible terrible terrible and just and
you don&#39;t have any you don&#39;t take

929
00:55:40 --> 00:55:44
offense very animated very enthusiastic
in a lot of fun

930
00:55:44 --> 00:55:47
now I mean at my smile every time it&#39;s
to say his name

931
00:55:47 --> 00:55:52
it&#39;s interesting the only change in the
screenplay from nineteen sixty nine to

932
00:55:52 --> 00:55:54
nineteen eighty one was in the arrow
cinema

933
00:55:54 --> 00:55:59
when I wrote the script was cartoon
cinema and there was the same thing only

934
00:55:59 --> 00:56:03
it was cutting to cartoon violence like
a road runner cartoon is you know

935
00:56:03 --> 00:56:03
something

936
00:56:03 --> 00:56:10
and when I came back in 81 to scout the
arrow cinemas suddenly become as you

937
00:56:10 --> 00:56:12
know a porno cinema

938
00:56:12 --> 00:56:19
how much is it that I thought what do i
do what do i do so we&#39;ve made our own

939
00:56:19 --> 00:56:20
little porno

940
00:56:20 --> 00:56:24
the first thing we shot when we were at
Wickham studios was this port of

941
00:56:24 --> 00:56:24
seagulls

942
00:56:24 --> 00:56:27
we have never worked with any of these
people in the British crew

943
00:56:27 --> 00:56:30
Joyce hurley David training but painter

944
00:56:30 --> 00:56:35
so the first thing we&#39;re doing is this
porno so I think we shot two days to do

945
00:56:35 --> 00:56:40
the porno and click the crew was sort of
like huh

946
00:56:40 --> 00:56:44
hey what is this movie I said what about
script for it then they&#39;re gonna say

947
00:56:44 --> 00:56:44
anything

948
00:56:44 --> 00:56:47
what are you joy do you promise never to
do this kind of thing again

949
00:56:47 --> 00:56:50
I&#39;m gonna promise you any such thing not
sure yet wait up

950
00:56:50 --> 00:56:56
never seen you before in my life I&#39;m
sorry I had a model agent and they sent

951
00:56:56 --> 00:57:00
me for an audition and I want to meet
John , and watch out to go

952
00:57:00 --> 00:57:03
I think my been took them off somewhere
the film studios

953
00:57:03 --> 00:57:07
this is one long that anything very nice
and and i was at really surprised I got

954
00:57:07 --> 00:57:09
the job he did explain it really well
just saying you know we make these

955
00:57:09 --> 00:57:13
horror movie and it&#39;s very funny and
it&#39;s very horrific and then there&#39;s one

956
00:57:13 --> 00:57:17
scene in it which is you know a porno
movie that we&#39;re filming especially to

957
00:57:17 --> 00:57:19
add that comet element

958
00:57:19 --> 00:57:22
she&#39;s Christ

959
00:57:22 --> 00:57:28
that whole scene in there i like that
the soundtrack is this orgasmic woman&#39;s

960
00:57:28 --> 00:57:32
hit the loo z is a-coming very well I
mean I it&#39;s a very odd i like it

961
00:57:32 --> 00:57:36
we shown that about three weeks before
principal photography began and you&#39;ve

962
00:57:36 --> 00:57:43
got these two formulas and they built
the sets and put flats all around to

963
00:57:43 --> 00:57:47
stop on lookers freeload crystal the
studio&#39;s you can&#39;t look everybody out

964
00:57:47 --> 00:57:51
and just the camera Korean people and it
really was here soon as the day went by

965
00:57:51 --> 00:57:55
you can see how is appearing in the
slats big looking through flying on it

966
00:57:55 --> 00:57:59
and the one funny thing i do remember
that the end they did a little funny bit

967
00:57:59 --> 00:58:02
too camera can work out what was
happening but John and he&#39;s put screen

968
00:58:02 --> 00:58:06
up in front and he SAT and was saying is
the first thing you&#39;d ever written and

969
00:58:06 --> 00:58:09
he says very funny very horrific and
then the screen comes down you know and

970
00:58:09 --> 00:58:12
obviously we&#39;re all in the back wall for
us on the bed jumping up and down your

971
00:58:12 --> 00:58:16
pants up and down again this is just one
of the other areas where I think the

972
00:58:16 --> 00:58:21
crew was like all right we&#39;ll just have
to put up with these idiot Americans and

973
00:58:21 --> 00:58:24
get through this because they&#39;re paying
us

974
00:58:24 --> 00:58:28
I jack hi David

975
00:58:28 --> 00:58:31
I talked to Griffin it&#39;s like that some
other bad news for you didn&#39;t mean

976
00:58:31 --> 00:58:34
nothing like when the sequence and
important theater

977
00:58:34 --> 00:58:37
it&#39;s gonna be a part of it is not gonna
be you he looks like a lot

978
00:58:37 --> 00:58:40
feels like a third is part i was quite
threatened by the damn puppet

979
00:58:40 --> 00:58:46
I never be quite genuinely upset kind of
hurt i think that he wanted to do it but

980
00:58:46 --> 00:58:51
you know you can&#39;t tear off people&#39;s
faces you could build on the skull but

981
00:58:51 --> 00:58:53
it&#39;s hard to tear off if it&#39;s a real
earth

982
00:58:53 --> 00:58:56
we didn&#39;t think full mask to look like
the skeletal puppet

983
00:58:56 --> 00:58:59
you know we thought it would work for
far away you look pretty good actually

984
00:58:59 --> 00:59:02
but it&#39;s just a bulkier and no makeup
and had a process and I wanted to do

985
00:59:02 --> 00:59:05
something where we took away and i
started with a life cast of griffin and

986
00:59:05 --> 00:59:09
basically first mean what i thought
would be Griffin school based on on that

987
00:59:09 --> 00:59:13
life cast and then made a piece from the
face that look was the remaining flesh

988
00:59:13 --> 00:59:16
which is just lost in applying to win
over it and think just a poly phone

989
00:59:16 --> 00:59:19
neckpiece and went on their part of poly
foam body

990
00:59:19 --> 00:59:22
you look awful thank you to operate that
puppet

991
00:59:22 --> 00:59:25
there was a cutaway out of the floor
with a partition of the cinema seats

992
00:59:25 --> 00:59:29
Griffin Dunne was operating the jaw
these guys are you know were very

993
00:59:29 --> 00:59:32
gracious letting me have the controls
and and it was very helpful i&#39;ll be

994
00:59:32 --> 00:59:39
looking at a monitor to see how I would
look and it was the very unique

995
00:59:39 --> 00:59:45
experience to be an actor playing that
part controlling the way I spoke it was

996
00:59:45 --> 00:59:48
a I thought totally fair trade up

997
00:59:48 --> 00:59:51
I want you to meet some people David
Kessler

998
00:59:51 --> 00:59:56

was a long three very fighting breast is

999
00:59:56 --> 00:59:58
on the point of beer crates

1000
00:59:58 --> 01:00:02
because I was next to the pods so i
could mention in his seat

1001
01:00:02 --> 01:00:06
I was standing over to the side was
sitting I&#39;m John wanted me to be a very

01:00:18 --> 01:00:23
David this is Harry berman and his
fiance

1006
01:00:23 --> 01:00:26
Judith browns hello hello

1007
01:00:26 --> 01:00:30
they kept pouring more and more and more
blood over me and they came a point

1008
01:00:30 --> 01:00:35
where i actually didn&#39;t want any more
blood being able to live in my face but

1009
01:00:35 --> 01:00:39
still look it was was wonderful to see
yourself change

1010
01:00:39 --> 01:00:42
we have more blood there and I never
knew before trying to count i think

1011
01:00:42 --> 01:00:43
drugs i said more

1012
01:00:43 --> 01:00:46
that was his mantra more blood

1013
01:00:46 --> 01:00:49
they do remember putting very carefully
putting blood i&#39;m trying to make sure

1014
01:00:49 --> 01:00:53
that I think it in their eyes and things
and in Landis just go now you&#39;re giving

1015
01:00:53 --> 01:00:55
the blood and just like dumping it on
your head and speaking up when the

1016
01:00:55 --> 01:00:56
makeup products that was John

1017
01:00:56 --> 01:00:57
she&#39;s porn

1018
01:00:57 --> 01:01:02
it was on time nobody&#39;s own you just
pour it all over your eyes everywhere

1019
01:01:02 --> 01:01:03
but it&#39;s kind of what would be here

1020
01:01:03 --> 01:01:09
a gun we did have a terrific time when
we were covered in blood and we were

1021
01:01:09 --> 01:01:13
covered in scabs and we were having our
lunch and we&#39;ve been asked if we&#39;d sit

1022
01:01:13 --> 01:01:17
to one side because people being put off
by the fact that we were covered in

1023
01:01:17 --> 01:01:22
blood and scabs and that&#39;s we&#39;re eating
our lunch bits of our faces were falling

1024
01:01:22 --> 01:01:27
off into our meals and we were having to
pick the bits out and because he thought

1025
01:01:27 --> 01:01:29
it was so funny we just laughed our way
through

1026
01:01:29 --> 01:01:33
where is it could really horrible you
must take your own life

1027
01:01:33 --> 01:01:37
that&#39;s easy for you to say you&#39;re you&#39;re
already dead no David Hardy and I and

1028
01:01:37 --> 01:01:39
everyone you murder I&#39;m not dead

1029
01:01:39 --> 01:01:45
the undead the undead come back to bitch
and moan about being a dad and try to

1030
01:01:45 --> 01:01:46
convince him to kill himself

1031
01:01:46 --> 01:01:50
I could hang myself no no if you did it
wrong can be painful

1032
01:01:50 --> 01:01:56
you choked to death so what let him joke
i like how the bombs are so pissed off

1033
01:01:56 --> 01:01:58
their vindictive

1034
01:01:58 --> 01:02:02
Jack feels the need to defend them do
you mind the man&#39;s a friend of mine I

1035
01:02:02 --> 01:02:06
brought him here so that you can
convince him to kill himself but you

1036
01:02:06 --> 01:02:08
don&#39;t have to be so hurtful about it

1037
01:02:08 --> 01:02:09
it&#39;s

1038
01:02:09 --> 01:02:17
and I always envisioned it to be for
Lake want to be this great big beast

1039
01:02:17 --> 01:02:20
I wanted to be by penn and I was
actually hoping for something a little

1040
01:02:20 --> 01:02:21
more on the man site as well

1041
01:02:21 --> 01:02:23
I always thought it was kind of
interesting that kind of combination of

1042
01:02:23 --> 01:02:27
animal in person but Johnson 04 leg and
hound from hell

1043
01:02:27 --> 01:02:32
I like talking always says never to
mention exciting don&#39;t really want to

1044
01:02:32 --> 01:02:35
see the funny thing is for a couple
seconds and that&#39;s one reason I mean

1045
01:02:35 --> 01:02:38
that he sculpted with an extreme kind of
expression to begin with

1046
01:02:38 --> 01:02:44
hi who was worried that if we rely
totally on the mechanism to make the

1047
01:02:44 --> 01:02:48
expression that they would use apart
when it isn&#39;t really competing in

1048
01:02:48 --> 01:02:50
expression you know I will shoot
something but they should know that

1049
01:02:50 --> 01:02:53
cutting before we&#39;re after when it was
you know so I thought if it&#39;s only going

1050
01:02:53 --> 01:02:54
to be this long you know

1051
01:02:54 --> 01:02:58
let&#39;s make it look scary no matter even
if you&#39;re not pulling any cables are

1052
01:02:58 --> 01:02:59
going to have been

1053
01:02:59 --> 01:03:03
I think Rick based on this dog and two
dogs and time in a German Shepherd a

1054
01:03:03 --> 01:03:08
white german shepherd and key Salander
occasion is your constant which was

1055
01:03:08 --> 01:03:13
harrier dog kind of almost wolf like you
know a lot of times I look in the mirror

1056
01:03:13 --> 01:03:17
now make faces and kind of like working
sculptures and it kind of looks like me

1057
01:03:17 --> 01:03:21
and my dog has ever spoken is like okay
he&#39;s good he&#39;s kinda like a wall school

1058
01:03:21 --> 01:03:25
it&#39;s got four legs and this big mane of
hair which has been the wolf kind of had

1059
01:03:25 --> 01:03:31
and see that was very much based on my
dog Bosco get a an impression of the

1060
01:03:31 --> 01:03:33
size of the creature on the phone

1061
01:03:33 --> 01:03:35
nothing the only time you see it up
close against not the government base

1062
01:03:35 --> 01:03:39
but it cuts the detectives and what the
hashtag on its own party

1063
01:03:39 --> 01:03:43
also the head

1064
01:03:43 --> 01:03:46
Rick tell you about that frankly wasn&#39;t
all that exciting yeah

1065
01:03:46 --> 01:03:48
in Johnson I&#39;m never going to see him
you can see balance I&#39;ve directed

1066
01:03:48 --> 01:03:53
several movies down in the UK and only
once that i have a communication problem

1067
01:03:53 --> 01:03:59
i took the head and I said okay the next
shot just get a little Dutch on the hood

1068
01:03:59 --> 01:04:04
of the car this car right here and we&#39;ll
throw the head it&#39;ll bounce off and the

1069
01:04:04 --> 01:04:13
whole crews looking at me like this and
I&#39;m like I want you to take the head and

1070
01:04:13 --> 01:04:15
bounce it off the hood of the car and
we&#39;ll get a shot like

1071
01:04:15 --> 01:04:19
and finally I said look they took the
head and I walked over night

1072
01:04:19 --> 01:04:23
I put it on the hood of the car and
always like a light bulb went off the

1073
01:04:23 --> 01:04:24
hallway of the bonnet

1074
01:04:24 --> 01:04:28
you mean the bonnet oh ok why didn&#39;t you
say so

1075
01:04:28 --> 01:04:34
to actually make it look like there&#39;s a
real wolf running through Piccadilly

1076
01:04:34 --> 01:04:35
Circus

1077
01:04:35 --> 01:04:40
you know we try to dog in a werewolf
suit look kinda clunky and finally

1078
01:04:40 --> 01:04:44
regular came up with this kind of thing
that we could sort of move around to

1079
01:04:44 --> 01:04:49
remember one night not sleeping in
getting up and actually thinking about

1080
01:04:49 --> 01:04:52
how we used to this wheel barrel racing
when you&#39;re a kid where somebody would

1081
01:04:52 --> 01:04:55
hold your feet and you just walk in your
hands you know what we can do something

1082
01:04:55 --> 01:04:58
kind of like that and mix with fake back
legs

1083
01:04:58 --> 01:05:02
maybe that would work that&#39;s kind of
what we did I talk to the dog has

1084
01:05:02 --> 01:05:03
awakened dummy data

1085
01:05:03 --> 01:05:08
this board is basically the plank with a
little hinge in and wear the waist is

1086
01:05:08 --> 01:05:10
put somebody on and you kind of walk

1087
01:05:10 --> 01:05:12
one of the guys that was my crew this
guy Kevin Brennan who he made the wool

1088
01:05:12 --> 01:05:15
suit to fit him and we were in England
we we had decided to make it like a tag

1089
01:05:15 --> 01:05:18
team thing and got this other guy

1090
01:05:18 --> 01:05:22
Brendan Hughes something we found that
was Kevin sighs to play the ball was in

1091
01:05:22 --> 01:05:27
a slump man it was he is a trained
dancer who had this really strong torso

1092
01:05:27 --> 01:05:32
so you could hold himself in theirs are
awkward angle and just be with his legs

1093
01:05:32 --> 01:05:35
sticking out the end of the night as for
the morning it was clever

1094
01:05:35 --> 01:05:38
I became enamored of Rick&#39;s work so i
showed it too much i still think when i

1095
01:05:38 --> 01:05:42
see the movie you see it too much the
wolf but my favorite shot of the wolf in

1096
01:05:42 --> 01:05:45
the picture is the guy in this in the
tubes when he collapses on the escalator

1097
01:05:45 --> 01:05:49
it looks down and the wolf enters like
that at the bottom of the escalator and

1098
01:05:49 --> 01:05:52
that&#39;s my favorite chocolates it looks
so fucking big

1099
01:05:52 --> 01:05:56
what is that together and you don&#39;t
really see it but you see it

1100
01:05:56 --> 01:05:59
I like that

1101
01:05:59 --> 01:06:04
John was laughs would say things like
well of course you know the the most

1102
01:06:04 --> 01:06:10
gross moment is created because a bus
tries to avoid a dark but strip

1103
01:06:10 --> 01:06:17
it&#39;s very very very difficult to get
them

1104
01:06:17 --> 01:06:21
the authorities in London to allow us to
to shoot in Piccadilly Circus but Joyce

1105
01:06:21 --> 01:06:25
Hurley was the one who said i think we
can make this work and then she did that

1106
01:06:25 --> 01:06:32
was the big problem because even are set
on Saturday night Oh early Sunday

1107
01:06:32 --> 01:06:36
morning there&#39;s still traffic going
around there and we had a lot of we had

1108
01:06:36 --> 01:06:38
to talk to the police

1109
01:06:38 --> 01:06:41
we had a meeting i remember about 74 at
night when after shooting with the chief

1110
01:06:41 --> 01:06:43
through the questioner that the two
please

1111
01:06:43 --> 01:06:47
and in Piccadilly Circus we&#39;ve got we
got this fantastic sequence with the bus

1112
01:06:47 --> 01:06:50
and turning around and keep coming
everywhere and this wolf coming out and

1113
01:06:50 --> 01:06:55
creating mayhem and a piece of the room
you need and how you gonna do that said

1114
01:06:55 --> 01:06:56
well ask him

1115
01:06:56 --> 01:06:59
well what we&#39;ll do is we&#39;ll have we have
starting in each of these streets about

1116
01:06:59 --> 01:07:04
seven streets is it coming to begin a
circus and in waiting cars and then we

1117
01:07:04 --> 01:07:09
will have extras in this on the on the
pavements to keep back the public and we

1118
01:07:09 --> 01:07:10
have 57

1119
01:07:10 --> 01:07:16
but having cameras young 788 camera yes
I thought eight cameras all over the

1120
01:07:16 --> 01:07:20
place when the bus up on the buildings
in the speed everywhere and then when

1121
01:07:20 --> 01:07:21
you give us the nod

1122
01:07:21 --> 01:07:27
we all say stand by and then when we say
action all the vehicles will provide out

1123
01:07:27 --> 01:07:32
into the streets so that no public cars
vehicles can get past will come out the

1124
01:07:32 --> 01:07:36
bustle to return somebody will fall out
there because smashed everywhere and

1125
01:07:36 --> 01:07:40
then we&#39;ll say cut will come out and
they&#39;ll sweep up all the class we have

1126
01:07:40 --> 01:07:44
all the broken vehicles and the place to
be clear and public will be through in

1127
01:07:44 --> 01:07:45
manhattan in seconds

1128
01:07:45 --> 01:07:49
we had the opportunity to rise for two
weeks which we had to

1129
01:07:49 --> 01:07:53
we were going to shoot in Piccadilly now
the police have not let anybody shoot in

1130
01:07:53 --> 01:07:55
Piccadilly for something like 15 years

1131
01:07:55 --> 01:07:58
we did two nights this saturday night
into sunday in the Sunday into Monday

1132
01:07:58 --> 01:08:04
and we were told that we have to be
finished by six o&#39;clock amending morning

1133
01:08:04 --> 01:08:07
so we have to go in there one hundred
percent totally prepared like we

1134
01:08:07 --> 01:08:08
rehearsed as best we could

1135
01:08:08 --> 01:08:12
then we got a guy who all day because in
is one of the best engineers and carp

1136
01:08:12 --> 01:08:17
prep people in the bit in the world and
he had his wrecking crews their part of

1137
01:08:17 --> 01:08:20
every size street and I think something
like two minutes 30 seconds of San

1138
01:08:20 --> 01:08:25
action having the road swept and clean
and ready for the public transport the

1139
01:08:25 --> 01:08:29
bus had to do is 180 degree spin and I
never did the spins in rehearsals for

1140
01:08:29 --> 01:08:33
the past does not spin the pictures they
don&#39;t you do that for you or a shitty

1141
01:08:33 --> 01:08:35
about compartment a hole in the bottom
of a bus

1142
01:08:35 --> 01:08:38
we won&#39;t even do what you like with it
you can do it would take me two days as

1143
01:08:38 --> 01:08:42
a fantastic and he took one of our area
around inverted it basically put 10 inch

1144
01:08:42 --> 01:08:48
fought with rubber wheels under it and
the president but no lifted the inside

1145
01:08:48 --> 01:08:52
wheel about three-quarter inch off the
ground and went once i&#39;m going to the

1146
01:08:52 --> 01:08:56
spins and I had wheels got a 90 degrees
and I could do 360 degree spins at all

1147
01:08:56 --> 01:09:06
day long Billy said to me you cleared
that passed away quicker than we clear

1148
01:09:06 --> 01:09:11
accidents which helped his father
feather in our cap because it wasn&#39;t

1149
01:09:11 --> 01:09:15
just a big crash with the bus and I&#39;m
involved like 15 20 vehicles

1150
01:09:15 --> 01:09:19
it was that we had to do it get it off
the street in two minutes

1151
01:09:19 --> 01:09:23
you know do it again so this is what
legs still he did great

1152
01:09:23 --> 01:09:28
we built the reproduction of the corner
of things shafts very Piccadilly street

1153
01:09:28 --> 01:09:29
to the theaters on

1154
01:09:29 --> 01:09:33
but only like a story and a half high
that were reproduced done down at the

1155
01:09:33 --> 01:09:39
airport was next and for all the airport
and weybridge yeah and built the whole

1156
01:09:39 --> 01:09:39
street

1157
01:09:39 --> 01:09:43
no jump from he had a great idea that I
was thinking how we couldn&#39;t match are

1158
01:09:43 --> 01:09:45
set to the real place exactly it

1159
01:09:45 --> 01:09:49
let&#39;s said no no we should match the
real place to our set which meant the

1160
01:09:49 --> 01:09:51
dressing and that was quite brilliant

1161
01:09:51 --> 01:09:55
so it was identical because we just
brought our stuff and put it there one

1162
01:09:55 --> 01:09:59
does but the bureau desean&#39;s where I go
crashing through the window

1163
01:09:59 --> 01:10:05
well John was a stunt man and i was very
good because i had worked with some of

1164
01:10:05 --> 01:10:09
the stunt guys before they said why
don&#39;t you doing is that John so I said

1165
01:10:09 --> 01:10:12
okay I&#39;ll do it start I&#39;ll presented
when I do anything hard so i said i&#39;ll

1166
01:10:12 --> 01:10:13
go through the window

1167
01:10:13 --> 01:10:16
I hate it and have it into the wind a
pretty nice time could have done it very

1168
01:10:16 --> 01:10:17
fantastic

1169
01:10:17 --> 01:10:21
I did it that the balsa wood didn&#39;t
break

1170
01:10:21 --> 01:10:24
I hit this thing it like didn&#39;t think I
was supposed to go right through it

1171
01:10:24 --> 01:10:28
through the glass or the crew held up in
my half and he&#39;ll get mad to have taken

1172
01:10:28 --> 01:10:30
over here upset

1173
01:10:30 --> 01:10:34
he said I wasn&#39;t at the head of people
and that good is convinced that one of

1174
01:10:34 --> 01:10:37
them would sabotage to thank you bastard

1175
01:10:37 --> 01:10:46
actually worked incredibly well and was
complicated because we just didn&#39;t have

1176
01:10:46 --> 01:10:51
enough time at the relocation sister
have said there&#39;s a disturbance and

1177
01:10:51 --> 01:10:53
Piccadilly Circus involving some sort of
Mad Dog

1178
01:10:53 --> 01:10:59
David a tremendous amount of the success
of the film is is Jenni and John would

1179
01:10:59 --> 01:11:03
find because they when they believe it
you believe it

1180
01:11:03 --> 01:11:11
she brings a tremendous integrity and
sincerity

1181
01:11:11 --> 01:11:16
so at the end I mean it&#39;s kind of hard
to tell this is Harry puppet that you

1182
01:11:16 --> 01:11:19
you love it

1183
01:11:19 --> 01:11:22
David over if you

1184
01:11:22 --> 01:11:26
I was slightly puzzled by what exactly
was doing it because of course is one

1185
01:11:26 --> 01:11:28
thing if you&#39;re talking to a wolf
another bad things because i have a

1186
01:11:28 --> 01:11:31
reality through the whole thing of of
having a boyfriend who just happen to be

1187
01:11:31 --> 01:11:34
a werewolf but if it worked as a
character but suddenly I&#39;m faced with

1188
01:11:34 --> 01:11:38
this idea of a person you&#39;re talking to
a wolf down an alleyway and John&#39;s it

1189
01:11:38 --> 01:11:45
now it&#39;s David you see dude and then
David they&#39;re going to carry you

1190
01:11:45 --> 01:11:49
and of course when you see the piece
edited together there&#39;s you know looking

1191
01:11:49 --> 01:11:56
down there very earnestly and then
there&#39;s a shot to this wolf but and i go

1192
01:11:56 --> 01:12:01
i love you pretty little bits of course
is very funny

1193
01:12:01 --> 01:12:10
she pulled it off I thought she was
really moving I love you take it

1194
01:12:10 --> 01:12:12
yeah

1195
01:12:12 --> 01:12:19
yeah

1196
01:12:19 --> 01:12:24
we have a lot of problems with the
sensors there was a lot more concern

1197
01:12:24 --> 01:12:25
about the nudity

1198
01:12:25 --> 01:12:29
then then the violence and was kind of
surprising guys

1199
01:12:29 --> 01:12:33
hey that David making love to the gym it
races with there are some nudity issues

1200
01:12:33 --> 01:12:37
in the work there is the issue of the
sequence of the bombs

1201
01:12:37 --> 01:12:42
yeah I was there that&#39;s not a question

1202
01:12:42 --> 01:12:46
there&#39;s a scene is shot that&#39;s part of
that sequence where the wolf bites down

1203
01:12:46 --> 01:12:48
on one of the bombs and pulls them out
of the shot

1204
01:12:48 --> 01:12:53
merry myself cock and then his body
comes back in missing like torn like

1205
01:12:53 --> 01:12:59
here is pretty is very violent very
shocking and in my first two previous in

1206
01:12:59 --> 01:13:00
New York and Chicago

1207
01:13:00 --> 01:13:07
the audience was so stunned by it that
they started talking to the next five

1208
01:13:07 --> 01:13:08
minutes

1209
01:13:08 --> 01:13:11
holy shit did you see that what you know
after a big scare

1210
01:13:11 --> 01:13:14
so like immediate I thought

1211
01:13:14 --> 01:13:18
she&#39;s missing all these exposition so I
just cut the scene which is too bad

1212
01:13:18 --> 01:13:21
because you know good from I probably
should&#39;ve left

1213
01:13:21 --> 01:13:25
I think there was another one - it was
it was something to do with the Griffins

1214
01:13:25 --> 01:13:26
face

1215
01:13:26 --> 01:13:30
Jack you know he&#39;s eating a piece of
toast so I had at that one . piece fell

1216
01:13:30 --> 01:13:35
like it like it went right through him
and fell on you pushed it off but the

1217
01:13:35 --> 01:13:38
rating board thought that was too much i
don&#39;t know why i&#39;m surprised that that

1218
01:13:38 --> 01:13:45
that would be something that they would
they would object to blood yes no or yes

1219
01:13:45 --> 01:13:48
and toast falling through an open
through and I don&#39;t know it must be a

1220
01:13:48 --> 01:13:48
new categories

1221
01:13:48 --> 01:13:51
John Peterson Peter Guber came to the
cutting room to see the finished film

1222
01:13:51 --> 01:13:56
and they were quite taken aback by the
gore and very upset

1223
01:13:56 --> 01:14:01
ranting really like i said ok ok give me
notes there&#39;s a lot of keep going back

1224
01:14:01 --> 01:14:05
and forth the bottom while so I&#39;m going
to give us a week to 10 days to address

1225
01:14:05 --> 01:14:09
these notes and then come back so they
went away that came back in 10 days we

1226
01:14:09 --> 01:14:12
showed the exact same movie

1227
01:14:12 --> 01:14:14
good movie

1228
01:14:14 --> 01:14:19
uh-huh and they liked it if anything I
thought it would be more graphic but

1229
01:14:19 --> 01:14:22
when you think about it it&#39;s really that
not that much on screen violence they

1230
01:14:22 --> 01:14:26
really thought I&#39;d made all the changes
to do a damn thing I wanted people like

1231
01:14:26 --> 01:14:32
this grandfather was really interesting
and a lot of people were very very put

1232
01:14:32 --> 01:14:36
off by it and really didn&#39;t think it was
very good and when they saw the movie

1233
01:14:36 --> 01:14:40
they said my god you&#39;ve completely
rewritten

1234
01:14:40 --> 01:14:43
it&#39;s totally different and it wasn&#39;t

1235
01:14:43 --> 01:14:47
if you look at the script and will
follow that hear the dialogue

1236
01:14:47 --> 01:14:51
it&#39;s identical Jack David you&#39;re not
having a good time all right

1237
01:14:51 --> 01:14:55
oh I don&#39;t know I mean look around isn&#39;t
this a fun place

1238
01:14:55 --> 01:15:00
well I like it here before it&#39;s official
release on almost the twenty-first 1981

1239
01:15:00 --> 01:15:02
the film was subjected to to test
screenings

1240
01:15:02 --> 01:15:06
this will determine whether or not a
routing john landis audience ready for

1241
01:15:06 --> 01:15:10
the shock and horror they clearly were
not expecting to Chicago first this

1242
01:15:10 --> 01:15:15
theater in Chicago they had put on the
marquee the new comedy from the director

1243
01:15:15 --> 01:15:16
of Animal House

1244
01:15:16 --> 01:15:22
so place is packed and they&#39;re really
loving the movie until Jack is murdered

1245
01:15:22 --> 01:15:28
and then I&#39;d say all forty five percent
of the people got up and left and then

1246
01:15:28 --> 01:15:33
after i&#39;ll never forget were like oh my
god

1247
01:15:33 --> 01:15:36
we literally ended up like a hundred
people out a thousand people

1248
01:15:36 --> 01:15:40
so the next night in syosset Long Island
which for many years is the largest

1249
01:15:40 --> 01:15:41
grossing theater

1250
01:15:41 --> 01:15:47
the country was all kids on a Saturday
night and I went out before the movie

1251
01:15:47 --> 01:15:47
started this

1252
01:15:47 --> 01:15:54
hello I&#39;m John Landis on the director of
this movie I have to warn you i said

1253
01:15:54 --> 01:15:57
this movies full of nudity and violence

1254
01:15:57 --> 01:16:01
the whole audience with ya I said that&#39;s
a horror film

1255
01:16:01 --> 01:16:07
yeah so they loved the movie and I think
the difference was expectations when I

1256
01:16:07 --> 01:16:09
went to see the film the very first time

1257
01:16:09 --> 01:16:13
land is actually insisted we all went
you know Griffin and David myself we all

1258
01:16:13 --> 01:16:19
went not to the premier uptown in a
person about that went downtown to 30c

1259
01:16:19 --> 01:16:20
cinema

1260
01:16:20 --> 01:16:23
what was that

1261
01:16:23 --> 01:16:27
I&#39;ll check on the house and Johnson no
no this is the place to place this week

1262
01:16:27 --> 01:16:30
after you have to see it with the proper
audience a real questions and he just

1263
01:16:30 --> 01:16:33
knew that people were going to react and
of course I took my young daughters

1264
01:16:33 --> 01:16:40
along and they both buried their heads
in my lap you know that at the first

1265
01:16:40 --> 01:16:42
sign of danger

1266
01:16:42 --> 01:16:48
I was absolutely not bowled over i
thought was really good and and it was

1267
01:16:48 --> 01:16:51
everybody was we thought think we worked
on a really good movie that nasty put on

1268
01:16:51 --> 01:16:56
a good movie we saw the film we saw with
the boys to westwood don&#39;t even remember

1269
01:16:56 --> 01:16:59
anything about the movie i was just
basically waiting for the transformation

1270
01:16:59 --> 01:17:04
and when the transformation happened
everybody clapped in the theater using

1271
01:17:04 --> 01:17:05
ok

1272
01:17:05 --> 01:17:09
yeah it&#39;s pretty cool vietnam like we
did it we made this thing in people

1273
01:17:09 --> 01:17:13
cheer I guess there had been a Wulfen &amp;
Howlin a couple of other wearable the

1274
01:17:13 --> 01:17:17
movies before that I must have been 20
years since they had done anything like

1275
01:17:17 --> 01:17:17
that

1276
01:17:17 --> 01:17:20
and of course the year we come out
there&#39;s two other werewolf movies which

1277
01:17:20 --> 01:17:21
kind of took the edge office a bit

1278
01:17:21 --> 01:17:25
no one really appreciated it either at
the time i remember vividly the reviews

1279
01:17:25 --> 01:17:28
were were quite negative

1280
01:17:28 --> 01:17:32
it didn&#39;t get all bad reviews but didn&#39;t
get very good reviews in general

1281
01:17:32 --> 01:17:37
John never got particularly good reviews
on any of the movies he did was a critic

1282
01:17:37 --> 01:17:43
for the New York Times the woman and she
wrote a pretty unflattering review of an

1283
01:17:43 --> 01:17:47
american werewolf in london in which she
prays Jenny&#39;s performance at griffin and

1284
01:17:47 --> 01:17:49
David and Rick Baker&#39;s working she made
a nice sense

1285
01:17:49 --> 01:17:55
and then she said the picture almost
works despite the ham-fisted screenplay

1286
01:17:55 --> 01:18:01
and direction by john landis so John
Belushi calls me up from New York

1287
01:18:01 --> 01:18:04
do you see the new york times yeah

1288
01:18:04 --> 01:18:09
did you fuck her just remember that
actually put critics in a bad mood that

1289
01:18:09 --> 01:18:13
you know why doesn&#39;t john landis decide
what he wants to make a horror movie or

1290
01:18:13 --> 01:18:14
a comedy you can&#39;t do both

1291
01:18:14 --> 01:18:20
I&#39;ll be serious would you John likes and
nose horror films and he&#39;s a funny guy

1292
01:18:20 --> 01:18:23
is a good sense of humor yeah it&#39;s
understood that that was there

1293
01:18:23 --> 01:18:26
the genius that what was unique and
special about the movie

1294
01:18:26 --> 01:18:29
it&#39;s not just a horror movie the comedy
was very funny

1295
01:18:29 --> 01:18:34
yes I naked of life commenced on my
belly and the blend seem to be just

1296
01:18:34 --> 01:18:37
right but i&#39;m sure that it was held by
that

1297
01:18:37 --> 01:18:45
buy them the reality of the characters
and the multi you actually like them and

1298
01:18:45 --> 01:18:46
you actually can about them

1299
01:18:46 --> 01:18:51
the audience had to believe that they
could be Jack and David that that could

1300
01:18:51 --> 01:18:51
be them

1301
01:18:51 --> 01:18:57
everyone relates to the feeling of being
strangers in a strange land and being in

1302
01:18:57 --> 01:19:02
the wrong place and camaraderie and it&#39;s
a very straightforward story

1303
01:19:02 --> 01:19:05
Shakespeare would say the plays the
thing

1304
01:19:05 --> 01:19:12
and the fact is John put together a
tremendous gripping interesting page

1305
01:19:12 --> 01:19:18
time story that was rooted in character

1306
01:19:18 --> 01:19:22
it says speaks to people i mean most
people are used to you know wars with

1307
01:19:22 --> 01:19:27
mists and you know lon chaney was just a
middle-aged guy

1308
01:19:27 --> 01:19:31
the wolf suit you know this was these
were kids

1309
01:19:31 --> 01:19:34
look at me here I sitting in a porno
theater in Piccadilly Circus talking to

1310
01:19:34 --> 01:19:40
a corpse as long as you believe that
that Griffin does character is is dead

1311
01:19:40 --> 01:19:45
and he&#39;s come back to warn his friend
the supernatural

1312
01:19:45 --> 01:19:48
the power of darkness it&#39;s all true

1313
01:19:48 --> 01:19:51
there&#39;s nothing else that you have to
suspend belief about

1314
01:19:51 --> 01:19:56
I understand all right you&#39;re one of the
undead and I&#39;m a werewolf and the makeup

1315
01:19:56 --> 01:19:57
holds up you know

1316
01:19:57 --> 01:20:01
credit to Rick again he got the
accolades and my wife quite rightly I

1317
01:20:01 --> 01:20:05
was very shocked at the whole Academy
Award thing for one there was wasn&#39;t

1318
01:20:05 --> 01:20:09
ever a real category for makeup ,
nominated couldn&#39;t even believe that you

1319
01:20:09 --> 01:20:12
know to actually get an Oscar and be up
there and have some you have been

1320
01:20:12 --> 01:20:14
surprised and came hundred give you this
morning

1321
01:20:14 --> 01:20:17
it&#39;s like it&#39;s pretty cool America was
probably the movie that I&#39;m going to be

1322
01:20:17 --> 01:20:18
remembered for more than anything else

1323
01:20:18 --> 01:20:21
I I meet people a lot who said you know
I became a makeup artist because of that

1324
01:20:21 --> 01:20:25
movie and they were so impressed with
Rick&#39;s work

1325
01:20:25 --> 01:20:28
it was just innovative is but i&#39;m
breaking is in this is a benchmark

1326
01:20:28 --> 01:20:34
since then of movies to attain to and
very few can equal it let alone better

1327
01:20:34 --> 01:20:38
it&#39;s not a stylized film is not made to
be an eighties film is a film with

1328
01:20:38 --> 01:20:40
reference to the past

1329
01:20:40 --> 01:20:44
drawing on on mattresses knowledge of
other films are watching a junior

1330
01:20:44 --> 01:20:46
universal studios maintain that&#39;s the
mark of a wolf&#39;s lair

1331
01:20:46 --> 01:20:51
it&#39;s just a very good story very well
time werewolf is an artist vision from

1332
01:20:51 --> 01:20:51
start to finish

1333
01:20:51 --> 01:20:58
you know why use an insane crazy hyper
active guy but it&#39;s his vision and

1334
01:20:58 --> 01:21:01
that&#39;s what made it American Werewolf
you know and and that&#39;s why I think it&#39;s

1335
01:21:01 --> 01:21:05
unique and I think that&#39;s why it still
holds up like a lot of movies it

1336
01:21:05 --> 01:21:09
I don&#39;t know why but it&#39;s it&#39;s crapped
on and then years later it&#39;s like the

1337
01:21:09 --> 01:21:10
classic

1338
01:21:10 --> 01:21:13
so I have a happy people like it

1339
01:21:13 --> 01:21:20
after 25 years the extraordinary legacy
of American Werewolf in London lives on

1340
01:21:20 --> 01:21:23
thanks to john landis the horror genre
is a little bit funny it&#39;s a little bit

1341
01:21:23 --> 01:21:26
goriya and Hollywood is forever trying
to outdo Rick Baker in the special

1342
01:21:26 --> 01:21:28
effects Department but to no avail

1343
01:21:28 --> 01:21:31
fans worldwide still import that make an
American man is doing their balloons and

1344
01:21:31 --> 01:21:33
that talking to a corpse actually is
boring

1345
01:21:33 --> 01:21:36
so whether you&#39;re traipsing across the
northern English Moore&#39;s or walking

1346
01:21:36 --> 01:21:37
through the streets of London

1347
01:21:37 --> 01:21:41
wherever you are tonight beware

1348
01:21:41 --> 01:21:48
yeah

1349
01:21:48 --> 01:21:57

1350
01:21:57 --> 01:22:00

a miracle in plastic surgery don&#39;t you
think America

yes plastic surgery m she&#39;s turning
Japanese I really think so

216
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08
the results are due not only to modern
surgical technique but also to an

217
00:13:08 --> 00:13:13
ancient tibetan process defined as the
hypnotic process of total recall it

218
00:13:13 --> 00:13:17
differs from the usual hypnosis in that
it allows us to operate with the

219
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
complete surrender of the subconscious
universe obtain their patients

220
00:13:20 --> 00:13:26

00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
make a demonstration of hypnosis of
total recall

224
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
no this experiment requires the outlay
of a great deal of energy

225
00:13:38 --> 00:13:41

actually it&#39;s my fault I didn&#39;t hear you

229
00:13:48 --> 00:13:50
say the young lady is not an ideal
subject for this sort of thing

willpower I&#39;m afraid he would take too

231
00:13:53 --> 00:13:53
long

232
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
I found that out the hard way however we
have mr shikou with whom i have already

233
00:13:56 --> 00:14:00
conducted experiments of the same type
and it would simplify things it miss

it was in mr. Shue cos bag she said you
know him

352
00:21:21 --> 00:21:25
it&#39;s ward Jones he was planning to marry
her then I showed up I met him when he

353
00:21:25 --> 00:21:27
took my course and hypnosis

354
00:21:27 --> 00:21:31
the one I gave in Japan a very capable
chap thinks he&#39;s a chicken star jones

355
00:21:31 --> 00:21:32
killed this morning

356
00:21:32 --> 00:21:36
what&#39;s been killed by the same people
who tried to kidnap a sugar rush rivalry

357
00:21:36 --> 00:21:37
she&#39;s back in our hands

358
00:21:37 --> 00:21:40
what had important information he was
the seller&#39;s unfortunately was killed

359
00:21:40 --> 00:21:43
before he got it to us actually ward
asked us to protect your she could

360
00:21:43 --> 00:21:46
because he&#39;d given her some secret
information and he was afraid she might

361
00:21:46 --> 00:21:47
be in danger

362
00:21:47 --> 00:21:51
now she denies this absence of barnaby
jones rapper and I&#39;m inclined to think

363
00:21:51 --> 00:21:54
she&#39;s telling the truth but we can&#39;t
find any explanation of these museums

364
00:21:54 --> 00:21:58

happened was just isn&#39;t a special yogi

365
00:21:58 --> 00:22:02
technique quite complicated but very
effective briefly it&#39;s very possible to

366
00:22:02 --> 00:22:06
communicating and eating in job new
state of hypnosis of total recall the

367
00:22:06 --> 00:22:09
subject himself doesn&#39;t know he knows
but he would be able to repeat verbatim

368
00:22:09 --> 00:22:11
if he was again hypnotized to the same
extent

369
00:22:11 --> 00:22:14

Sean&#39;s acting talent is discovered in an
early age and leads to a long and

544
00:32:52 --> 00:32:55
lucrative film career while Neil&#39;s
talent for selling light bulbs over the

545
00:32:55 --> 00:32:59
phone is discovered leading to a long
life of menial jobs and aimless drifted

546
00:32:59 --> 00:33:04
well up here is when Sean gets his first
million-dollar royalty check for the

547
00:33:04 --> 00:33:09
james bond series while Neil gets his
first $65 unemployment check after being

554
00:33:25 --> 00:33:30
deliver to him because of bounced checks
here sean is quoted as saying during the

555
00:33:30 --> 00:33:33
making of the man who would be king i

00:24:17 --> 00:24:20
there are certain advantages to being
bored Richard for instance

363
00:24:20 --> 00:24:25
all men are often considered to be more
trustworthy less threatening the primal

364
00:24:25 --> 00:24:29
power that a full head of hair bestows
on a man brings a certain pressure to

365
00:24:29 --> 00:24:34
perform and some men realize that they
prefer to remain out of the limelight

366
00:24:34 --> 00:24:37

you know at first it was difficult when
we arrived on this planet with a tiny

479
00:33:06 --> 00:33:11
starving organisms and then we
discovered that your brains are the only

480
00:33:11 --> 00:33:14
food on which we can thrive

481
00:33:14 --> 00:33:17
the question was one of access

482
00:33:17 --> 00:33:20
we seem to have found the answer

I&#39;ve spent the last 10 years of my life
developing a method to transplant an

548
00:37:45 --> 00:37:50
entire I know it&#39;s never been done or
even tried but I do think it could work

549
00:37:50 --> 00:37:53
unfortunately i&#39;m pretty much alone in
that opinion

550
00:37:53 --> 00:37:58
let&#39;s say I&#39;m skeptical could play

551
00:37:58 --> 00:38:01
yeah if it works

552
00:38:01 --> 00:38:07
what if it done and if the iodized we&#39;ll
just have to remove it

donor I oh I oh I know that sounds a bit

555
00:38:18 --> 00:38:21

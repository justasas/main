00:00:00 --> 00:00:02
&lt;i&gt;I once heard a man say that, in Africa,&lt;/i&gt;

3
00:00:02 --> 00:00:05
&lt;i&gt;the sun is like a furnace
that either melts you...&lt;/i&gt;

4
00:00:05 --> 00:00:06
&lt;i&gt;or forges you.&lt;/i&gt;

5
00:00:06 --> 00:00:07
Everything...

6
00:00:07 --> 00:00:08
that is underneath this earth

7
00:00:08 --> 00:00:11
belongs to all our people.

8
00:00:11 --> 00:00:12
Does not belong to the Belgians.

9
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
Does not belong to the Americans.

10
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
Does not belong to you, &lt;i&gt;mon Frère&lt;/i&gt;.

11
00:00:16 --> 00:00:17
That&#39;s one way to look at it.

12
00:00:17 --> 00:00:18
Here&#39;s another.

13
00:00:18 --> 00:00:22
The Congo is a provider of over half of...

14
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
more than half of the world&#39;s copper

15
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
and cobalt to the USA and the USSR.

16
00:00:27 --> 00:00:28
Both of these minerals essential...

17
00:00:28 --> 00:00:32
Both of these minerals necessary to
the superpowers&#39; weapons-guidance systems.

18
00:00:32 --> 00:00:33
We should not stand idly...

19
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
No. We cannot stand idly by...

20
00:00:36 --> 00:00:39
while General Tshombe
colludes with the mining companies

21
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
to control the province of Katanga.

22
00:00:41 --> 00:00:43
And with the assassination
of Prime Minister Lumumba,

23
00:00:43 --> 00:00:47
we now have a moral imperative
to send in more peacekeepers.

24
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
The United Nations,
in deference to the Congo&#39;s wishes,

25
00:00:50 --> 00:00:51
has asked that, once again,

26
00:00:51 --> 00:00:53
these peacekeepers come from Ireland.

27
00:00:53 --> 00:00:56
Apart from serving as head
of the United Nations&#39; Congo Division,

28
00:00:56 --> 00:00:57
I&#39;m an Irishman myself.

29
00:00:57 --> 00:01:00
Therefore, I am very proud
that we&#39;ve been asked to serve.

30
00:01:00 --> 00:01:02
You see Caesar, he knew.

31
00:01:02 --> 00:01:03
I&#39;ll be the first to go.

32
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
- Are you lads in the Congo mission?
- We are, yeah.

33
00:01:06 --> 00:01:06
Sit down.

34
00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
- Do you want a drink?
- Yeah, Guinness.

35
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
P? Four, please.

36
00:01:10 --> 00:01:11
Everyone else was cracking.

37
00:01:11 --> 00:01:15
That&#39;s why you get 200,000 people
surrendering to 60,000.

38
00:01:15 --> 00:01:16
That&#39;s the difference.

39
00:01:16 --> 00:01:17
Now, the thing is,

40
00:01:17 --> 00:01:19
politicians,
they don&#39;t understand tactics.

41
00:01:19 --> 00:01:21
And soldiers,
they don&#39;t understand strategy.

42
00:01:21 --> 00:01:23
But Caesar, he understood both.

43
00:01:23 --> 00:01:24
Julius Caesar in the corner.

44
00:01:24 --> 00:01:26
He&#39;s read it all.
He knows every battle ever fought.

45
00:01:26 --> 00:01:29
- Does he know about the real thing?
- None of us do.

46
00:01:29 --> 00:01:30
Remember who&#39;s in charge.

47
00:01:30 --> 00:01:31
He&#39;s your commanding officer.

48
00:01:31 --> 00:01:32
Yes, sir.

49
00:01:32 --> 00:01:33
You could have said something.

50
00:01:33 --> 00:01:34
You&#39;re a fucking idiot!

51
00:01:34 --> 00:01:35
Commandant.

52
00:01:35 --> 00:01:36
Sure only my wife calls me that.

53
00:01:36 --> 00:01:37
One for my friend, please.

54
00:01:37 --> 00:01:40
- Are you looking forward to it?
- Looking forward to the challenge.

55
00:01:40 --> 00:01:43
- The men are looking forward to it, too.
- And I hope they&#39;re ready for it.

56
00:01:43 --> 00:01:44
What do you think?

57
00:01:44 --> 00:01:45
Will we see any action?

58
00:01:45 --> 00:01:48
Who knows? I don&#39;t think any of us
have a clue what&#39;s going on out there.

59
00:01:48 --> 00:01:49
Your dinner&#39;s in the dog.

60
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
I was being delightful and witty company.

61
00:01:51 --> 00:01:52
Ah, that&#39;s a nice change for you.

62
00:01:52 --> 00:01:53
A lesser man
might take that the wrong way.

63
00:01:53 --> 00:01:54
Might he?

64
00:01:54 --> 00:01:55
Well, I would only be guessing.

65
00:01:55 --> 00:01:56
I love this song.

66
00:01:56 --> 00:01:57
Come here. Come here.

67
00:01:57 --> 00:01:58
- Can we dance to this?
- No.

68
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01

69
00:02:01 --> 00:02:05

00:02:05 --> 00:02:06
That&#39;ll be them.

&lt;i&gt;In the Katanga region.&lt;/i&gt;

80
00:02:22 --> 00:02:23
Yes, General. I understand.

81
00:02:23 --> 00:02:24

00:02:24 --> 00:02:25

102
00:03:00 --> 00:03:01

103
00:03:01 --> 00:03:02
I can&#39;t watch.

104
00:03:02 --> 00:03:03
This won&#39;t hurt.

105
00:03:03 --> 00:03:04
Hi.

106
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
My fiancée is a nurse.
She said this will be all right.

107
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
Fuck.

108
00:03:08 --> 00:03:09
Is that it?

109
00:03:09 --> 00:03:10
You know I&#39;m shipping off to war, yeah?

110
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
I might die without knowing the love
of a good Irish woman.

116
00:03:18 --> 00:03:19

117
00:03:19 --> 00:03:20
I&#39;ll be all right.

118
00:03:20 --> 00:03:21
Do you have your coat now?

119
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
Ma, we&#39;re going to the feckin&#39; equator.

120
00:03:23 --> 00:03:25
Better watch your feckin&#39; language
in Africa!

121
00:03:25 --> 00:03:26
So, you are on your way.

122
00:03:26 --> 00:03:27
Yeah.

123
00:03:27 --> 00:03:28
Your mother will miss you.

124
00:03:28 --> 00:03:29
Dad?

125
00:03:29 --> 00:03:30
Yeah?

126
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
I had a dream I&#39;m going to die over there.

127
00:03:32 --> 00:03:33
There&#39;s no chance of that.

128
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36
Your mother will pray for you.
You know she&#39;s got a direct line to God.

129
00:03:36 --> 00:03:37
&lt;i&gt;Company!&lt;/i&gt;

130
00:03:37 --> 00:03:38
&lt;i&gt;Attention!&lt;/i&gt;

131
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
The UN was established
to ensure that the nations of the world

132
00:03:41 --> 00:03:42
would never again engage

133
00:03:42 --> 00:03:43
in another world war.

134
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
We are the second wave of Irish soldiers

135
00:03:45 --> 00:03:46
to be sent into the Congo.

136
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
So far, it has cost nine Irish lives.

137
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
So this is where it gets serious

138
00:03:51 --> 00:03:52
for every single one of us.

139
00:03:52 --> 00:03:53
Nobody has shot at you,

140
00:03:53 --> 00:03:54
tried to kill you before.

141
00:03:54 --> 00:03:55
You are war virgins.

142
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
The UN has given us this great honor,

143
00:03:57 --> 00:03:58
to serve as peacekeepers.

144
00:03:58 --> 00:03:59
And we are proud to accept.

145
00:03:59 --> 00:04:00
We are a country

146
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
that has never owned or tried to conquer

147
00:04:03 --> 00:04:04
another sovereign nation.

148
00:04:04 --> 00:04:05
As a neutral country,

149
00:04:05 --> 00:04:07
Ireland has chosen
to never be the aggressor.

150
00:04:07 --> 00:04:08
That&#39;s why they have asked for us.

151
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
And if anybody thinks
we&#39;re to be taken lightly...

152
00:04:10 --> 00:04:11
we&#39;ll show them

153
00:04:11 --> 00:04:13
that they are very sadly mistaken.

154
00:04:13 --> 00:04:14
Am I right, soldiers?

155
00:04:14 --> 00:04:15
Yes, sir!

156
00:04:15 --> 00:04:16
Carry on, Company Sergeant.

157
00:04:16 --> 00:04:17
Yes, sir.

158
00:04:17 --> 00:04:18
&lt;i&gt;Company!&lt;/i&gt;

159
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
&lt;i&gt;Left turn!&lt;/i&gt;

160
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
&lt;i&gt;Quick march!&lt;/i&gt;

161
00:04:22 --> 00:04:23
Hey. Hey.

162
00:04:23 --> 00:04:24
Hey, yes, hey.

163
00:04:24 --> 00:04:28
We welcome the forces
of the United Nations here with open arms

164
00:04:28 --> 00:04:29
but with some confusion.

165
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
We don&#39;t know why you are here
in Africa...

166
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
as we are quite capable
of looking after ourselves.

167
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
However, we will be thoughtful hosts.

168
00:04:35 --> 00:04:36
Unless you come here to start trouble,

169
00:04:36 --> 00:04:37
in which case

170
00:04:37 --> 00:04:38
you will force us to tutor you

171
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
on how things are done here in the Congo.

172
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
- General Tshombe!
- Gentlemen, that&#39;s it. We&#39;re done.

173
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
&lt;i&gt;I had a call from Khrushchev earlier.&lt;/i&gt;

174
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
He reminded me
of the UN&#39;s refusal to send in troops

175
00:04:47 --> 00:04:48
when Lumumba asked me to.

176
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
It&#39;s amazing how good an atheist is
in inflicting guilt.

177
00:04:51 --> 00:04:53
Meanwhile,
they&#39;re building a wall in Berlin.

178
00:04:53 --> 00:04:54
I know.

179
00:04:54 --> 00:04:55
Kennedy called.

180
00:04:55 --> 00:04:57
What did the Sun King of Camelot
have to say?

181
00:04:57 --> 00:05:00
We can&#39;t do anything
in Berlin, Vietnam or Cuba,

182
00:05:00 --> 00:05:01
but we can defuse the Congo.

183
00:05:01 --> 00:05:02
And I want you to go.

184
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
Put an end to General Tshombe&#39;s antics.

185
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
- Send him a message.
- Excuse me?

186
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
I want you to be our man on the ground.

187
00:05:08 --> 00:05:09
But this thing, this...

188
00:05:09 --> 00:05:10
could lead to another world war.

189
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
Yes, and everybody sees that.

190
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
So the man who stops it

191
00:05:14 --> 00:05:15
will get a lot of credit.

192
00:05:15 --> 00:05:16
We&#39;ll make up a plan.

193
00:05:16 --> 00:05:17
What kind of plan?

194
00:05:17 --> 00:05:18
One with a lot of moving parts

195
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
that requires a man astute
and hard-headed enough to pull it off.

196
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
We each have our part to play in history.

197
00:05:23 --> 00:05:25
Yours is happening right now, Conor.

198
00:05:25 --> 00:05:26
I believe I can...

199
00:05:26 --> 00:05:27
accomplish the mission, sir.

200
00:05:27 --> 00:05:28
Good, Conor.

201
00:05:28 --> 00:05:29
Good.

202
00:05:29 --> 00:05:30
&lt;i&gt;The United Nations&lt;/i&gt;

203
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
&lt;i&gt;are going to send
more peacekeeping troops,&lt;/i&gt;

204
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
&lt;i&gt;so I need your assistance,
General De Gaulle.&lt;/i&gt;

205
00:05:36 --> 00:05:37
&lt;i&gt;And what will you give in return?&lt;/i&gt;

206
00:05:37 --> 00:05:42
&lt;i&gt;It&#39;s in all our interests that the mining
companies continue their operations.&lt;/i&gt;

207
00:05:42 --> 00:05:43
&lt;i&gt;My old rival&lt;/i&gt;

208
00:05:43 --> 00:05:46
&lt;i&gt;would have nationalized
everything you own.&lt;/i&gt;

209
00:05:46 --> 00:05:48
&lt;i&gt;If I lose power, it might still happen.&lt;/i&gt;

210
00:05:48 --> 00:05:50
&lt;i&gt;Your American friends wouldn&#39;t like that.&lt;/i&gt;

211
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
&lt;i&gt;Okay, I will send you
1,000 of our best former legionnaires.&lt;/i&gt;

212
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
&lt;i&gt;The mining companies
will hire them as security officers,&lt;/i&gt;

213
00:05:55 --> 00:05:56
&lt;i&gt;but you will give the orders.&lt;/i&gt;

214
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
&lt;i&gt;Katanga thanks you for that.&lt;/i&gt;

215
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
&lt;i&gt;Tell Katanga it&#39;s a pleasure.&lt;/i&gt;

216
00:05:59 --> 00:06:00
All right, lads. Everybody out.

217
00:06:00 --> 00:06:02
Boys, you&#39;re supposed
to rehydrate. It will be fine.

218
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
Lads.

219
00:06:03 --> 00:06:04
Picture.

220
00:06:04 --> 00:06:05
Cheese!

221
00:06:05 --> 00:06:06
You&#39;re gorgeous.

222
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
Calling it a compound is a joke.

223
00:06:08 --> 00:06:11
We&#39;ve got exposure on three approaches.
Overlooked from the south.

224
00:06:11 --> 00:06:12
And there&#39;s a road splitting it in two.

225
00:06:12 --> 00:06:13
We&#39;re wide open.

226
00:06:13 --> 00:06:14
Okay.

227
00:06:14 --> 00:06:15
Do we have shovels?

228
00:06:15 --> 00:06:16
We do.

229
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
Have the men up for drill at 0600.

230
00:06:18 --> 00:06:19
Yes, sir.

231
00:06:19 --> 00:06:20
Dr O&#39;Brien, how was your flight?

232
00:06:20 --> 00:06:21
Very pleasant, thank you, General.

233
00:06:21 --> 00:06:22
We have a lot to talk about.

234
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
We do. May I introduce General Raja?

235
00:06:24 --> 00:06:26
- Welcome to the Congo, sir.
- Good to meet you.

236
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
&lt;i&gt;Tshombe has crossed the line.
We need to stop him.&lt;/i&gt;

237
00:06:28 --> 00:06:29
We&#39;re beyond the point of no return.

238
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
You are therefore authorized to implement
Operation Morthor immediately.

239
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
I have decided
we should take aggressive action

240
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
to reclaim key buildings held by Tshombe.

241
00:06:36 --> 00:06:37
There&#39;s a time for talking,

242
00:06:37 --> 00:06:38
a time for being tough.

243
00:06:38 --> 00:06:39
This is the latter.

244
00:06:39 --> 00:06:40
Your soldiers have the distinction

245
00:06:40 --> 00:06:42
of being the only troops
with any real military experience.

246
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
The others will be looking to them
to set an example.

247
00:06:44 --> 00:06:45
Show them how decisive you can be.

248
00:06:45 --> 00:06:46
This place is amazing.

249
00:06:46 --> 00:06:47
This is some job.

250
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
Yahoo!

251
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
Wakey-wakey!
Rise and shine, boys! Whoo!

252
00:06:52 --> 00:06:53
Up and at &#39;em! Come on!

253
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
Get off, Cooley, will ya?

254
00:06:54 --> 00:06:55
Keep digging.

255
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
Fuck! Fuck! Jesus! Oh, Christ!

256
00:06:57 --> 00:06:58
What? What?

257
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
It&#39;s a fucking snake!

258
00:07:00 --> 00:07:01
Snake!

259
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
These ones aren&#39;t poisonous.
Did you not read the info packs?

260
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
With all due respect, boss,
are you sure they&#39;re not poisonous?

261
00:07:05 --> 00:07:06
- Get out.
- Look out!

262
00:07:06 --> 00:07:07
Out, you fuckers!

263
00:07:07 --> 00:07:08
St Patrick himself.

264
00:07:08 --> 00:07:09
Back to it.

265
00:07:09 --> 00:07:10
Weapons are state of the art.

266
00:07:10 --> 00:07:11
For World War II, anyway.

267
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
These things... plastic.

268
00:07:13 --> 00:07:14
Useless.

269
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
COMS says we have food provisions,
enough for two days.

270
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
The men have their own rations, but mostly
biscuits you wouldn&#39;t feed to your dog.

271
00:07:20 --> 00:07:21
Time to hunt and gather.

272
00:07:21 --> 00:07:22
Let&#39;s go.

273
00:07:22 --> 00:07:23
Yes, sir.

274
00:07:23 --> 00:07:24
How can I help you?

275
00:07:24 --> 00:07:26
I&#39;ll take as much
as that truck outside can carry.

276
00:07:26 --> 00:07:27
Yes, sir.

277
00:07:27 --> 00:07:28
Where&#39;s the best bar in town?

278
00:07:28 --> 00:07:29
At the end of the street.

279
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
I don&#39;t think you will find
any of the bars here to your liking.

280
00:07:31 --> 00:07:32
Why is that?

281
00:07:32 --> 00:07:33
I don&#39;t mean to be rude,

282
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
but you do know
that you&#39;re not welcome here, don&#39;t you?

283
00:07:35 --> 00:07:36
I&#39;ll take one of these.

284
00:07:36 --> 00:07:38
The people around here
are not particularly happy

285
00:07:38 --> 00:07:39
with how things are working out.

286
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
They didn&#39;t like Lumumba taking over.

287
00:07:41 --> 00:07:42
But he was elected by the people.

288
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
Who didn&#39;t put a lot of thought
into what would happen to the mines

289
00:07:45 --> 00:07:46
when he took over.

290
00:07:46 --> 00:07:47
Nationalizing the minerals,

291
00:07:47 --> 00:07:48
throwing out the mining companies.

292
00:07:48 --> 00:07:49
What did he expect to happen?

293
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
I don&#39;t suppose
he expected to be assassinated.

294
00:07:51 --> 00:07:52
I love this country,

295
00:07:52 --> 00:07:53
but you don&#39;t tell the companies

296
00:07:53 --> 00:07:54
that have been making money here
for decades

297
00:07:54 --> 00:07:55
that they&#39;re suddenly out of business.

298
00:07:55 --> 00:07:56
I didn&#39;t tell them anything, madame,
but...

299
00:07:56 --> 00:07:57
sorry that we&#39;re not welcome here.

300
00:07:57 --> 00:07:58
Thank you for your time.

301
00:07:58 --> 00:07:59
Let&#39;s get a drink.

302
00:07:59 --> 00:08:00
Three beers.

303
00:08:00 --> 00:08:01
Won&#39;t you have a real drink?

304
00:08:01 --> 00:08:02
What would that be?

305
00:08:02 --> 00:08:03
French cognac.

306
00:08:03 --> 00:08:04
Perhaps you&#39;ll have one with me?

307
00:08:04 --> 00:08:05
Why are you here, Commandant?

308
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
To protect the locals
from a man who stole power

309
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
from the legitimately elected
prime minister.

310
00:08:09 --> 00:08:10
Why are you here?

311
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
To protect the interest of the mines.

312
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
Plus Paris is freezing this time of year.

313
00:08:14 --> 00:08:15
To Paris.

314
00:08:15 --> 00:08:16
To Paris.

315
00:08:16 --> 00:08:19
These people you&#39;re here to protect...

316
00:08:19 --> 00:08:20
are you sure they want you?

317
00:08:20 --> 00:08:21
I have my doubts.

318
00:08:21 --> 00:08:22
But I also have my orders.

319
00:08:22 --> 00:08:23
You follow all orders?

320
00:08:23 --> 00:08:24
I&#39;m a soldier.

321
00:08:24 --> 00:08:25
That&#39;s how it&#39;s done.

322
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
I looked up the Irish army
to see how many wars they have been in.

323
00:08:28 --> 00:08:29
You know what I found?

324
00:08:29 --> 00:08:30
None.

325
00:08:30 --> 00:08:31
And as for you, Commandant...

326
00:08:31 --> 00:08:32
you have never been in battle.

327
00:08:32 --> 00:08:33
I&#39;m not sure about that.

328
00:08:33 --> 00:08:34
I&#39;ve been married for ten years.

329
00:08:34 --> 00:08:35
Do you have a plan?

330
00:08:35 --> 00:08:36
Just to pray there&#39;s no need for us.

331
00:08:36 --> 00:08:38
Because no plan
survives contact with the enemy.

332
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
That&#39;s a Rommel saying.

333
00:08:39 --> 00:08:40
I never liked Rommel.

334
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
Not many Frenchmen like German tacticians.

335
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
It only took them two weeks
to take over your entire country.

336
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
You work your men too hard, I think.

337
00:08:46 --> 00:08:47
All of this digging.

338
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
Nobody else felt the need to dig trenches.

339
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
Thank you, Commandant, for your visit.

340
00:08:51 --> 00:08:52
Thank you for the drinks.

341
00:08:52 --> 00:08:53
His mercs look good.

342
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
I&#39;m not sure why he&#39;d have such good mercs
here in the middle of nowhere.

343
00:08:56 --> 00:08:57
Finish and get back to the compound.

344
00:08:57 --> 00:08:58
Are you worried, sir?

345
00:08:58 --> 00:08:59
I&#39;m worried about a lot of things.

346
00:08:59 --> 00:09:00
I need a house with a working phone.

347
00:09:00 --> 00:09:01
There&#39;s a big house beyond the compound.

348
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
&lt;i&gt;Things are hotting up in Africa.&lt;/i&gt;

349
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
&lt;i&gt;Civil war is raging
in the new Republic of the Congo.&lt;/i&gt;

350
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
&lt;i&gt;But United Nations peacekeeping troops&lt;/i&gt;

351
00:09:07 --> 00:09:08
&lt;i&gt;show they mean business.&lt;/i&gt;

352
00:09:08 --> 00:09:09
&lt;i&gt;Here they are&lt;/i&gt;

353
00:09:09 --> 00:09:12
&lt;i&gt;moving in on rebel-held
government buildings in Elisabethville...&lt;/i&gt;

354
00:09:12 --> 00:09:14
&lt;i&gt;capital of the province of Katanga.&lt;/i&gt;

355
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
&lt;i&gt;The world waits
to see what General Tshombe will do next.&lt;/i&gt;

356
00:09:17 --> 00:09:18
Madame.

357
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
Would it be possible to use your phone
to place a call to Ireland?

358
00:09:21 --> 00:09:22
I&#39;ll pay, of course.

359
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
I&#39;m afraid my phone
is not for military use.

360
00:09:24 --> 00:09:25
It&#39;s a personal call.

361
00:09:25 --> 00:09:26
I need to speak to my family.

362
00:09:26 --> 00:09:27
Of course.

363
00:09:27 --> 00:09:29
Everybody&#39;s been talking about you.

364
00:09:29 --> 00:09:30
It&#39;s been on the news.

365
00:09:30 --> 00:09:31
&lt;i&gt;We&#39;re so proud of you.&lt;/i&gt;

366
00:09:31 --> 00:09:32
I&#39;m very happy to hear that.

367
00:09:32 --> 00:09:33
How are you?

368
00:09:33 --> 00:09:34
&lt;i&gt;I&#39;m well.&lt;/i&gt;

369
00:09:34 --> 00:09:35
It&#39;s hard to know what&#39;s going on here.

370
00:09:35 --> 00:09:36
&lt;i&gt;There are a lot of unknowns.&lt;/i&gt;

371
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
Don&#39;t worry, love. You&#39;ll figure it out.

372
00:09:38 --> 00:09:39
&lt;i&gt;You always do.&lt;/i&gt;

373
00:09:39 --> 00:09:40
You&#39;re right.

374
00:09:40 --> 00:09:41
I must go.

375
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
&lt;i&gt;I love you.&lt;/i&gt;

376
00:09:42 --> 00:09:43
&lt;i&gt;I love you, too.&lt;/i&gt;

377
00:09:43 --> 00:09:44
&lt;i&gt;Goodbye.&lt;/i&gt;

378
00:09:44 --> 00:09:45
How is your family?

379
00:09:45 --> 00:09:46
All fine.

380
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
I&#39;m glad to hear that.

381
00:09:47 --> 00:09:48
Do you have any?

382
00:09:48 --> 00:09:49
I have two daughters.

383
00:09:49 --> 00:09:50
But I&#39;m a widow.

384
00:09:50 --> 00:09:51
This place killed my husband.

385
00:09:51 --> 00:09:52
Radiation.

386
00:09:52 --> 00:09:55
The two bombs that America used
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

387
00:09:55 --> 00:09:56
came from the mines here in Jadotville.

388
00:09:56 --> 00:09:57
Uranium.

389
00:09:57 --> 00:09:58
The largest seam in the world.

390
00:09:58 --> 00:09:59
That explains a lot.

391
00:09:59 --> 00:10:00
Nice to meet you.

392
00:10:00 --> 00:10:01
And you.

393
00:10:01 --> 00:10:02
Take the jeep to Elisabethville

394
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
and tell McEntee in person
there&#39;s a strong force of mercs here.

395
00:10:04 --> 00:10:07
Tell him to find out how many we&#39;re
dealing with and send reinforcements.

396
00:10:07 --> 00:10:08
Be nice about it.

397
00:10:08 --> 00:10:10
Sir. Reporting from A Company.

398
00:10:10 --> 00:10:11
Commandant Quinlan.

399
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
Thank you, Sergeant. Take a seat.

400
00:10:13 --> 00:10:14
Yes, sir.

401
00:10:14 --> 00:10:15
Sergeant.

402
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
So your commandant&#39;s
getting nervous, is he?

403
00:10:17 --> 00:10:18
Sir, he believes that, strategically,

404
00:10:18 --> 00:10:20
Jadotville is very important
to General Tshombe,

405
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
and it&#39;s certainly more isolated
than any other UN compound.

406
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
Might it be fair to say
that Commandant Quinlan is overreacting?

407
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
Well, sir. The presence of mercenaries
would suggest that a plan is underway.

408
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
A small number of mercenaries
hired as security by the mines.

409
00:10:29 --> 00:10:31
They would never dare attack
a United Nations company.

410
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
This will all be over
before your commandant gets a suntan.

411
00:10:33 --> 00:10:34
I&#39;ll go and tell him that right now, sir.

412
00:10:34 --> 00:10:35
Thank you, Sergeant.

413
00:10:35 --> 00:10:36
As you were, Sergeant.

414
00:10:36 --> 00:10:37
Well, look at all of you.

415
00:10:37 --> 00:10:38
Oh-ho!

416
00:10:38 --> 00:10:39
Fuck.

417
00:10:39 --> 00:10:40
There&#39;s this girl at chapel.

418
00:10:40 --> 00:10:41
Mary Brannigan.

419
00:10:41 --> 00:10:43
I swear, she was built on springs.

420
00:10:43 --> 00:10:44
You should see her at Communion.

421
00:10:44 --> 00:10:45
Taking the Holy Ghost

422
00:10:45 --> 00:10:46
between those sturdy lips.

423
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
Oh, Jesus, it&#39;s amazing!

424
00:10:49 --> 00:10:50
Cooley, that&#39;s a sin.

425
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
It&#39;s all right,
we&#39;re going to Mass tomorrow.

426
00:10:52 --> 00:10:54
Yeah, this is worse than
my mother making me go.

427
00:10:54 --> 00:10:55
Reidy...

428
00:10:55 --> 00:10:56
what&#39;s your mother like?

429
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
She&#39;s nice, yeah. Loves a good Mass.

430
00:10:58 --> 00:10:59
I mean what does she look like?

431
00:10:59 --> 00:11:00
Oh. Uh...

432
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
Oh, blonde hair, blue eyes.

433
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
Oh, no! Fuck off, Cooley!

434
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
&lt;i&gt;To the escalating civil war in the Congo.&lt;/i&gt;

435
00:11:07 --> 00:11:08
&lt;i&gt;UN peacekeeping troops&lt;/i&gt;

436
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
&lt;i&gt;are deployed into the Katanga region.&lt;/i&gt;

437
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
&lt;i&gt;With heavy fighting
in the city of Elisabethville,&lt;/i&gt;

438
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
&lt;i&gt;the thoughts and prayers of a proud nation&lt;/i&gt;

439
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
&lt;i&gt;are with our soldiers
serving the UN in the Congo.&lt;/i&gt;

440
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
Do you think O&#39;Brien
believes his own bullshit?

441
00:11:19 --> 00:11:20
One hundred percent, boss.

442
00:11:20 --> 00:11:21
What?

443
00:11:21 --> 00:11:22
Operation Morthor, sir.

444
00:11:22 --> 00:11:23
Something went very wrong.

445
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
- Sir.
- What happened?

446
00:11:25 --> 00:11:29
A security detail opened fire.
Return fire eliminated the troops.

447
00:11:29 --> 00:11:32
Then they barricaded themselves inside.
We couldn&#39;t afford a siege, so...

448
00:11:32 --> 00:11:33
So what?

449
00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
We finished them with grenades through
the windows and eliminated the enemy.

450
00:11:36 --> 00:11:39
- Used grenades on unarmed civilians?
- We didn&#39;t know they were unarmed.

451
00:11:39 --> 00:11:42
- What about ones climbing out of windows?
- They might have been armed.

452
00:11:42 --> 00:11:44
- So you killed innocent people?
- Yes, sir.

453
00:11:44 --> 00:11:45
Fuck!

454
00:11:45 --> 00:11:46
Fuck.

455
00:11:46 --> 00:11:47
This didn&#39;t happen.

456
00:11:47 --> 00:11:48
No mention of this in UN dispatches.

457
00:11:48 --> 00:11:49
We didn&#39;t just murder
30 men and women at work

458
00:11:49 --> 00:11:51
because the troops
lost the run of themselves.

459
00:11:51 --> 00:11:52
Is that clear?

460
00:11:52 --> 00:11:53
Yes, sir.

461
00:11:53 --> 00:11:54
They have just taken Radio Katanga

462
00:11:54 --> 00:11:56
and the government buildings
in Elisabethville.

463
00:11:56 --> 00:11:57
We need to retaliate.

464
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
Well, since you&#39;re paying our wages.

465
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02

Get to the trenches! Man your positions!

Move, move!

484
00:12:33 --> 00:12:33
Go! Go!

485
00:12:33 --> 00:12:34
You four, to me! Come on, move!

486
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
Weapons ready!
Check your ammo!

487
00:12:36 --> 00:12:37
Fire!

488
00:12:37 --> 00:12:38
I want fire superiority!

489
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
- Corporal, get the Bren up front, now!
- Mortar men, man your posts!

490
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
- Open fire!
- Hold down the left flank!

491
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
Sniper! Catch me up.

492
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
Fuckers came out of nowhere
and started shooting!

493
00:12:48 --> 00:12:49
You&#39;re caught up, boss.

494
00:12:49 --> 00:12:50
Move, move, move!

495
00:12:50 --> 00:12:51
Man your trenches!

496
00:12:51 --> 00:12:52
Sir.

497
00:12:52 --> 00:12:53
They&#39;ll approach from high ground,
south.

498
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55
Get ten of our best out there
to refuse the flank.

499
00:12:55 --> 00:12:56
The south flank? Sure, sir?

500
00:12:56 --> 00:12:57
Yes. Now, go!

501
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
Yes, sir. Sniper, on me.

502
00:12:59 --> 00:13:01
Reidy, follow me! Now!

503
00:13:01 --> 00:13:02
Go now!

504
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
Let me look at you.
Get the Bren back up! Let me look!

505
00:13:04 --> 00:13:05
It&#39;s a scratch. You&#39;ll be fine.

506
00:13:05 --> 00:13:06
You&#39;ll be fine. You&#39;ll be fine.

507
00:13:06 --> 00:13:07
You&#39;re fine, all right?

508
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
- I&#39;m fine.
- Get back up. Get back up.

509
00:13:09 --> 00:13:10
Charlie Alpha Juliet to Control.

510
00:13:10 --> 00:13:11
Sir!

511
00:13:11 --> 00:13:12
Charlie Alpha Juliet to Control.

512
00:13:12 --> 00:13:13
We&#39;re under heavy attack.

513
00:13:13 --> 00:13:16
Send very strong reinforcements
immediately. Very urgent.

514
00:13:16 --> 00:13:17
&lt;i&gt;Operation Morthor&lt;/i&gt;

515
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
&lt;i&gt;has led to the suspension
of the Katangan government.&lt;/i&gt;

516
00:13:19 --> 00:13:20
&lt;i&gt;We seized Katanga radio station&lt;/i&gt;

517
00:13:20 --> 00:13:22
&lt;i&gt;and all communications
at 0400 hours today.&lt;/i&gt;

518
00:13:22 --> 00:13:25
You attacked the enemy
without telling troops in the field?

519
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
&lt;i&gt;The operation
has been completed successfully.&lt;/i&gt;

520
00:13:27 --> 00:13:28
If the operation was a success...

521
00:13:28 --> 00:13:29
then why are they shooting at us?

522
00:13:29 --> 00:13:30
Fuck!

523
00:13:30 --> 00:13:31
Sniper.

524
00:13:31 --> 00:13:32
Go up to the trench now.

525
00:13:32 --> 00:13:33
Give us some cover. Go on.

526
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
The rest of you, follow him. Go, go, go.

527
00:13:35 --> 00:13:36
Sir, there&#39;s nobody here.

528
00:13:36 --> 00:13:37
Because they&#39;re only coming from the east.

529
00:13:37 --> 00:13:39
Right, three of you stay here.

530
00:13:39 --> 00:13:40
The rest of you, pull back on me.

531
00:13:40 --> 00:13:41
Let&#39;s go.

532
00:13:41 --> 00:13:42
As we were.

533
00:13:42 --> 00:13:43
They are wide open!

534
00:13:43 --> 00:13:44
Use cover.

535
00:13:44 --> 00:13:45
Pair off.

536
00:13:45 --> 00:13:46
Fuck!

537
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
Reidy!

538
00:13:47 --> 00:13:48
Magazine!

539
00:13:48 --> 00:13:50
Quinlan doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s doing.

540
00:13:50 --> 00:13:51
He&#39;s gonna get us killed!

541
00:13:51 --> 00:13:52
I hope to fuck you&#39;re wrong!

542
00:13:52 --> 00:13:53
I&#39;m going back for Reidy.

543
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
- Am I dying?
- No, you&#39;ll be grand.

544
00:13:56 --> 00:13:57
Start her up!

545
00:13:57 --> 00:13:58
Bring her forward! Go!

546
00:13:58 --> 00:13:59
Cover that mad bastard!

547
00:13:59 --> 00:14:00
Faulques!

548
00:14:00 --> 00:14:01
Faulques, come on!

549
00:14:01 --> 00:14:02
Cease fire!

550
00:14:02 --> 00:14:03
Cease fire!

551
00:14:03 --> 00:14:04
Cease fire!

552
00:14:04 --> 00:14:07
- Hegarty, check positions.
- Send runners, one per trench.

553
00:14:07 --> 00:14:07
Yes, sir.

554
00:14:07 --> 00:14:08
Get me Battalion HQ.

555
00:14:08 --> 00:14:09
Sir.

556
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
General McEntee&#39;s staff
said he&#39;s unavailable.

557
00:14:11 --> 00:14:12
Did you tell him we got attacked?

558
00:14:12 --> 00:14:14
Yes. They said,
&quot;God bless and hold tight.&quot;

559
00:14:14 --> 00:14:15
&quot;God bless&quot;?
What&#39;s that supposed to mean?

560
00:14:15 --> 00:14:18
Um... I suppose he means,
&quot;May God&#39;s blessings be upon us,&quot; sir.

561
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
Start a radio log. From now on,
everything that&#39;s said goes on record.

562
00:14:21 --> 00:14:22
Yes, sir.

563
00:14:22 --> 00:14:23
I&#39;ll run position one.

564
00:14:23 --> 00:14:24
North flank.

565
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
Company Sergeant, you run position two.

566
00:14:27 --> 00:14:28
East flank.

567
00:14:28 --> 00:14:29
Hegarty.

568
00:14:29 --> 00:14:30
Position three, south flank.

569
00:14:30 --> 00:14:32
We were told the enemy were unprepared.

570
00:14:32 --> 00:14:33
We were misinformed.

571
00:14:33 --> 00:14:34
They got lucky,

572
00:14:34 --> 00:14:35
but that only happens once.

573
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
Remember,
none of these men have seen battle.

574
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
On our next engagement, we will
overrun them with 20 times their forces.

575
00:14:40 --> 00:14:41
Where are we in logistics?

576
00:14:41 --> 00:14:42
FNs to the best marksmen.

577
00:14:42 --> 00:14:43
Gustafs to the officers and the NCOs.

578
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
Each platoon splits the Brens and Vickers.
Donnelly is on the mortars.

579
00:14:46 --> 00:14:47
But, sir...

580
00:14:47 --> 00:14:48
they never sent us the heavy 81s.

581
00:14:48 --> 00:14:50
We&#39;ll finish this in one all-out victory.

582
00:14:50 --> 00:14:51
All right? So let&#39;s go!

583
00:14:51 --> 00:14:52
Let&#39;s go!

584
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
The real problem&#39;s the ammo.
We&#39;ve only 13,000 rounds.

585
00:14:54 --> 00:14:55
It&#39;s not gonna last long.

586
00:14:55 --> 00:14:56
Sir, I&#39;ve got General McEntee.

587
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
General, request an immediate update.

588
00:14:58 --> 00:14:59
Report your situation, Commandant.

589
00:14:59 --> 00:15:00
Company A, Jadotville

590
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
has been under mortar
and machine-gun fire.

591
00:15:02 --> 00:15:03
Expect a heavy attack any moment.

592
00:15:03 --> 00:15:04
I sent a man. I told you this was coming.

593
00:15:04 --> 00:15:05
Watch yourself, Commandant.

594
00:15:05 --> 00:15:06
&lt;i&gt;General...&lt;/i&gt;

595
00:15:06 --> 00:15:07
I&#39;m in a bad situation here

596
00:15:07 --> 00:15:08
and I need your help.

597
00:15:08 --> 00:15:09
From the dead they left,

598
00:15:09 --> 00:15:11
I&#39;d say
we&#39;re looking at a force of about 1,500.

599
00:15:11 --> 00:15:13
&lt;i&gt;I need you to send reinforcements
right now.&lt;/i&gt;

600
00:15:13 --> 00:15:14
Send as many as you can.

601
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
There&#39;s a negative exercise outcome
if we don&#39;t get them.

602
00:15:16 --> 00:15:17
Is that him?

603
00:15:17 --> 00:15:18
Mm.

604
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
Commandant,
this is Dr Conor Cruise O&#39;Brien.

605
00:15:20 --> 00:15:21
I urge you to stop panicking.

606
00:15:21 --> 00:15:22
&lt;i&gt;Panicking?&lt;/i&gt;

607
00:15:22 --> 00:15:25
&lt;i&gt;With respect, sir, are you aware
of the realities on the ground?&lt;/i&gt;

608
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
I assure you I&#39;m very well aware of them.

609
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
These are the final death gasps
of Tshombe&#39;s government.

610
00:15:29 --> 00:15:30
I&#39;m not sure he knows that.

611
00:15:30 --> 00:15:32
Hold your position.
Allow our plan to play out.

612
00:15:32 --> 00:15:33
&lt;i&gt;The plan is two days old&lt;/i&gt;

613
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
and didn&#39;t include Tshombe&#39;s mercs.

614
00:15:35 --> 00:15:36
What went wrong with your plan, sir?

615
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
Sounds like you&#39;re looking for an excuse,
Commandant.

616
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
We each have our part to play in history.

617
00:15:40 --> 00:15:41
Yours is happening right now.

618
00:15:41 --> 00:15:42
Rely on us to make sure it all works out.

619
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
Sir, I don&#39;t understand
what you just said to me,

620
00:15:44 --> 00:15:47
and in tactical terms
I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re doing.

621
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
I have 150 boys here
and we need reinforcements.

622
00:15:49 --> 00:15:50
No, you listen to me, Quinlan.

623
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
There are larger things at play
than you can possibly imagine.

624
00:15:52 --> 00:15:54
I don&#39;t give a damn
about the larger things!

625
00:15:54 --> 00:15:55
We&#39;re a company under siege

626
00:15:55 --> 00:15:56
and we require your assistance!

627
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
Discuss the details with General McEntee.

628
00:15:58 --> 00:15:59
Jesus Christ!

629
00:15:59 --> 00:16:01
&lt;i&gt;General,
does he have a clue what he&#39;s doing?&lt;/i&gt;

630
00:16:01 --> 00:16:04
All our troops in the field
are on Operation Morthor, Commandant.

631
00:16:04 --> 00:16:05
We don&#39;t have any reinforcements.

632
00:16:05 --> 00:16:06
Exactly.

633
00:16:06 --> 00:16:08
&lt;i&gt;Nobody thought this was a possibility,
did they?&lt;/i&gt;

634
00:16:08 --> 00:16:09
When do our men come back in?

635
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
&lt;i&gt;A heavy-weapons battalion&#39;s
expected here within 12 hours.&lt;/i&gt;

636
00:16:11 --> 00:16:12
They&#39;ll be sent out to you immediately.

637
00:16:12 --> 00:16:13
Thank you, sir.

638
00:16:13 --> 00:16:14
One more thing.

639
00:16:14 --> 00:16:15
We could do with some whiskey.

640
00:16:15 --> 00:16:16
I&#39;ll see what I can do.

641
00:16:16 --> 00:16:17
Follow me.

642
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
What exactly did he mean
by &quot;negative exercise outcome&quot;?

643
00:16:19 --> 00:16:22
It means that without reinforcements...
we&#39;re fucked.

644
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
&lt;i&gt;The aggressive action
of the United Nations&lt;/i&gt;

645
00:16:24 --> 00:16:26
&lt;i&gt;in Elisabethville is unacceptable.&lt;/i&gt;

646
00:16:26 --> 00:16:28
&lt;i&gt;It is unfortunate for my beloved country&lt;/i&gt;

647
00:16:28 --> 00:16:30
&lt;i&gt;that the United Nations peacekeepers&lt;/i&gt;

648
00:16:30 --> 00:16:31
&lt;i&gt;have now become aggressors.&lt;/i&gt;

649
00:16:31 --> 00:16:33
&lt;i&gt;Or, should I say, peace enforcers.&lt;/i&gt;

650
00:16:33 --> 00:16:34
Desmond!

651
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
&lt;i&gt;The international community
needs to realize&lt;/i&gt;

652
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
&lt;i&gt;that this type of imperialist intervention&lt;/i&gt;

653
00:16:38 --> 00:16:39
&lt;i&gt;is nothing new.&lt;/i&gt;

654
00:16:39 --> 00:16:40
&lt;i&gt;But we, Katanga...&lt;/i&gt;

655
00:16:40 --> 00:16:41
Sir.

656
00:16:41 --> 00:16:43
I want a private meeting with Tshombe.

657
00:16:43 --> 00:16:44
Somewhere neutral.

658
00:16:44 --> 00:16:45
Just the two of us.

659
00:16:45 --> 00:16:47
They&#39;re coming! Get ready for it!

660
00:16:47 --> 00:16:48
Into your trenches!

661
00:16:48 --> 00:16:49
Pick your targets!

662
00:16:49 --> 00:16:50
Get ready!

663
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
Cover up and pick a target!

664
00:16:52 --> 00:16:53
Stand to!

665
00:16:53 --> 00:16:55
Cooley, you are snatching the trigger!

666
00:16:55 --> 00:16:56
Slow down!

667
00:16:56 --> 00:16:58
Breathe, squeeze, kill!

668
00:16:58 --> 00:16:59
Breathe again!

669
00:16:59 --> 00:17:01
Good man, Cooley! Keep it up!

670
00:17:01 --> 00:17:02
Over here!

671
00:17:02 --> 00:17:02
Sniper!

672
00:17:02 --> 00:17:04
- Boss?
- Can you hit the schoolhouse?

673
00:17:04 --> 00:17:05
Yeah.

674
00:17:05 --> 00:17:06
Bren in a single shot.

675
00:17:06 --> 00:17:07
I need the Bren!

676
00:17:07 --> 00:17:08
Go on!

677
00:17:08 --> 00:17:09
The man in the white suit.

678
00:17:09 --> 00:17:10
Do you have his heart?

679
00:17:10 --> 00:17:11
Yeah, boss.

680
00:17:11 --> 00:17:12
Take it.

681
00:17:12 --> 00:17:13
Do you think he was important?

682
00:17:13 --> 00:17:16
If he was... we won&#39;t
have to wait too long to find out.

683
00:17:16 --> 00:17:17
Hey!

684
00:17:17 --> 00:17:18
Retreat! Retreat!

685
00:17:18 --> 00:17:19
Pick your targets!

686
00:17:19 --> 00:17:20
Cease fire!

687
00:17:20 --> 00:17:21
Hold your fire!

688
00:17:21 --> 00:17:22
Cease fire!

689
00:17:22 --> 00:17:23
Cease fire!

690
00:17:23 --> 00:17:24
Cease fire!

691
00:17:24 --> 00:17:25
Cease fire!

692
00:17:25 --> 00:17:27
We&#39;ve got to clear
that whole area.

693
00:17:27 --> 00:17:28
Cover me.

694
00:17:28 --> 00:17:29
Commandant Quinlan.

695
00:17:29 --> 00:17:31
You&#39;re a good drinker,
but not such a good soldier.

696
00:17:31 --> 00:17:32
And I believe I can be of help to you.

697
00:17:32 --> 00:17:34
That&#39;s nice of you.
How do you aim to do that?

698
00:17:34 --> 00:17:35
By making you see sense.

699
00:17:35 --> 00:17:36
You do realize that you are outnumbered

700
00:17:36 --> 00:17:37
by a factor of 20?

701
00:17:37 --> 00:17:38
I see a lot of dead men here.

702
00:17:38 --> 00:17:39
None of them are mine.

703
00:17:39 --> 00:17:41
Yet you must see
that your position is untenable.

704
00:17:41 --> 00:17:44
The only way to survive this
is to let the politicians sort it out.

705
00:17:44 --> 00:17:46
We were attacked without provocation.

706
00:17:46 --> 00:17:47
We responded.

707
00:17:47 --> 00:17:48
We will continue to respond

708
00:17:48 --> 00:17:49
if you continue to attack.

709
00:17:49 --> 00:17:50
I&#39;m afraid I have orders to follow.

710
00:17:50 --> 00:17:51
I require your surrender.

711
00:17:51 --> 00:17:53
You&#39;re not formally recognized
to accept surrenders.

712
00:17:53 --> 00:17:54
But I am.

713
00:17:54 --> 00:17:55
I&#39;ll accept yours.

714
00:17:55 --> 00:17:56
That&#39;s not an option.

715
00:17:56 --> 00:17:58
Nevertheless,
we would like a cease fire...

716
00:17:58 --> 00:18:01
to send in ambulances
and remove the dead and wounded.

717
00:18:01 --> 00:18:02
Tell your men we have a cease fire.

718
00:18:02 --> 00:18:03
Use that flag as a range marker.

719
00:18:03 --> 00:18:05
Joyce, get the Vickers ready.
Set up a position in the chapel.

720
00:18:05 --> 00:18:06
Yes, sir.

721
00:18:06 --> 00:18:07
Murphy!

722
00:18:07 --> 00:18:08
Hold your fire.

723
00:18:08 --> 00:18:09
Boss! Boss!

724
00:18:09 --> 00:18:10
It&#39;s a trap!

725
00:18:10 --> 00:18:11
Move!

726
00:18:11 --> 00:18:12
Open fire!

727
00:18:12 --> 00:18:13
Get the mortars ready!

728
00:18:13 --> 00:18:14
Donnelly!

729
00:18:14 --> 00:18:15
Take those fuckers out!

730
00:18:15 --> 00:18:16
I&#39;m on it!

731
00:18:16 --> 00:18:17
Get down!

732
00:18:17 --> 00:18:18
Incoming!

733
00:18:18 --> 00:18:19
Sergeant!

734
00:18:19 --> 00:18:20
Sergeant!

735
00:18:20 --> 00:18:21
Cover fire!

736
00:18:21 --> 00:18:23
Hegarty, get in the trench!

737
00:18:23 --> 00:18:24
Come here! Come here!

738
00:18:24 --> 00:18:25
Come on.

739
00:18:25 --> 00:18:26
Grab hold of my belt and don&#39;t let go.

740
00:18:26 --> 00:18:28
I can&#39;t see! I can&#39;t see!

741
00:18:28 --> 00:18:29
I&#39;m blind! They hit my head!

742
00:18:29 --> 00:18:30
You&#39;re fine. You&#39;re fine.

743
00:18:30 --> 00:18:32
We&#39;re going for the trench, all right?

744
00:18:32 --> 00:18:33
Don&#39;t drop me.

745
00:18:33 --> 00:18:35
Yeah, boy. Fuck, okay, come on.

746
00:18:35 --> 00:18:36
We have to move.

747
00:18:36 --> 00:18:37
Go!

748
00:18:37 --> 00:18:38
Go! Go! Go!

749
00:18:38 --> 00:18:39
X-ray four.

750
00:18:39 --> 00:18:41
Two thousand two hundred yards.

751
00:18:41 --> 00:18:42
Fire one!

752
00:18:42 --> 00:18:44
Dud. Timer blew.

753
00:18:44 --> 00:18:45
Bag it.

754
00:18:45 --> 00:18:46
Fire two!

755
00:18:46 --> 00:18:48
Right in the red ring!

756
00:18:48 --> 00:18:50
That&#39;s their mortars going off.

757
00:18:50 --> 00:18:51
Pick your targets!

758
00:18:51 --> 00:18:52
Retreat!

759
00:18:52 --> 00:18:53
Cease fire!

760
00:18:53 --> 00:18:54
Cease fire!

761
00:18:54 --> 00:18:55
You acquitted yourself well out there.

762
00:18:55 --> 00:18:56
What?

763
00:18:56 --> 00:18:57
Nothing.

764
00:18:57 --> 00:18:58
It was something.

765
00:18:58 --> 00:18:59
I felt scared.

766
00:18:59 --> 00:19:01
- It&#39;s only natural.
- No, that&#39;s not it.

767
00:19:01 --> 00:19:02
I was scared.

768
00:19:02 --> 00:19:03
But then... I liked it.

769
00:19:03 --> 00:19:04
The killing.

770
00:19:04 --> 00:19:05
It&#39;s what you&#39;re trained to do.

771
00:19:05 --> 00:19:06
You didn&#39;t like it.

772
00:19:06 --> 00:19:08
Each man reacts differently
to killing another man.

773
00:19:08 --> 00:19:09
None of us have done this before.

774
00:19:09 --> 00:19:10
Talk to me in a few days.

775
00:19:10 --> 00:19:11
Oh, you think we&#39;ll last that long?

776
00:19:11 --> 00:19:12
How many dead at Radio Katanga?

777
00:19:12 --> 00:19:13
Thirty, sir.

778
00:19:13 --> 00:19:17
This will negate a vast reserve
of goodwill towards the organization

779
00:19:17 --> 00:19:20
and show that we cannot behave any better
than any single country.

780
00:19:20 --> 00:19:21
Sir, these things happen in war.

781
00:19:21 --> 00:19:22
Not in my war.

782
00:19:22 --> 00:19:24
What was O&#39;Brien&#39;s role in all of this?

783
00:19:24 --> 00:19:25
He&#39;s a smart man, sir,

784
00:19:25 --> 00:19:28
but he&#39;s an academic
who thinks that everything stands still

785
00:19:28 --> 00:19:29
while he thinks about what to do.

786
00:19:29 --> 00:19:30
We are a new thing.

787
00:19:30 --> 00:19:32
Sometimes new things stumble.

788
00:19:32 --> 00:19:33
But we pick ourselves up...

789
00:19:33 --> 00:19:35
instead of pretending
that we didn&#39;t fall.

790
00:19:35 --> 00:19:38
So we&#39;re going to say that,
in our first military intervention,

791
00:19:38 --> 00:19:39
we got it all wrong?

792
00:19:39 --> 00:19:40
We acknowledge the action...

793
00:19:40 --> 00:19:41
but we distance ourselves.

794
00:19:41 --> 00:19:42
It&#39;s our plan, our forces.

795
00:19:42 --> 00:19:43
How do we distance ourselves?

796
00:19:43 --> 00:19:44
By applying blame.

797
00:19:44 --> 00:19:45
Dr O&#39;Brien.

798
00:19:45 --> 00:19:46
General Tshombe.

799
00:19:46 --> 00:19:48
I would say, &quot;Welcome to my country.

800
00:19:48 --> 00:19:49
Make yourself at home,&quot;

801
00:19:49 --> 00:19:50
but it appears you already have.

802
00:19:50 --> 00:19:51
Well, there are those

803
00:19:51 --> 00:19:53
who might say you&#39;re a little premature

804
00:19:53 --> 00:19:55
in taking command of who you welcome.

805
00:19:55 --> 00:19:57
Would you rather my predecessor
was still in charge?

806
00:19:57 --> 00:19:59
The only people he welcomed
were the communists.

807
00:19:59 --> 00:20:01
Or perhaps
you would rather we send all our cobalt,

808
00:20:01 --> 00:20:03
copper and uranium to the USSR?

809
00:20:03 --> 00:20:04
Of course not, General.

810
00:20:04 --> 00:20:07
It&#39;s just you haven&#39;t been elected
to the office you claim to hold.

811
00:20:07 --> 00:20:09
I am merely saying that Katanga,

812
00:20:09 --> 00:20:10
my province,

813
00:20:10 --> 00:20:11
is no longer part of the Congo...

814
00:20:11 --> 00:20:12
and I am its president.

815
00:20:12 --> 00:20:14
Yes, well, that&#39;s a little like Texas

816
00:20:14 --> 00:20:16
saying it&#39;s no longer part of the USA,

817
00:20:16 --> 00:20:18
that its oil
gives it the power to do that.

818
00:20:18 --> 00:20:19
Factually, that would be correct.

819
00:20:19 --> 00:20:20
They were part of Mexico.

820
00:20:20 --> 00:20:22
America land-grabbed Texas.

821
00:20:22 --> 00:20:24
Sir, I would like to see
an end to the conflict

822
00:20:24 --> 00:20:26
between the United Nations
and those loyal to you in Katanga.

823
00:20:26 --> 00:20:30
Then recognize Katanga&#39;s
legitimate government and president

824
00:20:30 --> 00:20:32
in a United Nations resolution.

825
00:20:32 --> 00:20:34
That&#39;s... simply not being realistic.

826
00:20:34 --> 00:20:36
Do you think we did not hear the rumors

827
00:20:36 --> 00:20:38
about the Radio Katanga massacre?

828
00:20:38 --> 00:20:39
Rumors? Well...

829
00:20:39 --> 00:20:41
- They&#39;re inaccurate.
- I don&#39;t think so.

830
00:20:41 --> 00:20:43
I think the United Nations,

831
00:20:43 --> 00:20:46
this paragon of virtue and fairness...

832
00:20:46 --> 00:20:48
executed my loyalists.

833
00:20:48 --> 00:20:49
Hm?

834
00:20:49 --> 00:20:51
Sir, I&#39;m sure we can find a way

835
00:20:51 --> 00:20:53
to draw ourselves back from the brink.

836
00:20:53 --> 00:20:57
Then recognize Katanga&#39;s
legitimate government and president

837
00:20:57 --> 00:20:59
in a United Nations resolution.

838
00:20:59 --> 00:21:00
That&#39;s simply not going to happen.

839
00:21:00 --> 00:21:02
Then enough of this, Dr O&#39;Brien.

840
00:21:02 --> 00:21:04
The United Nations went from peacekeeping

841
00:21:04 --> 00:21:05
to peace enforcement.

842
00:21:05 --> 00:21:06
And your mission has failed.

843
00:21:06 --> 00:21:08
Did you forget about your fellow Irishmen

844
00:21:08 --> 00:21:09
left out in the field?

845
00:21:09 --> 00:21:10
What do you mean?

846
00:21:10 --> 00:21:11
Because I didn&#39;t.

847
00:21:11 --> 00:21:12
I didn&#39;t forget about them at all.

848
00:21:12 --> 00:21:15
My boys are giving everything they&#39;ve got,
but there&#39;s just not enough of us.

849
00:21:15 --> 00:21:18
I give you my word, you&#39;ll have
reinforcements with you tomorrow.

850
00:21:18 --> 00:21:20
We&#39;ll hold out
until our last bullet&#39;s spent.

851
00:21:20 --> 00:21:21
We could do with that whiskey.

852
00:21:21 --> 00:21:22
They&#39;re going after the ammo hut!

853
00:21:22 --> 00:21:23
Go, move!

854
00:21:23 --> 00:21:24
Get this out of here! Go!

855
00:21:24 --> 00:21:25
- Go!
- Run!

856
00:21:25 --> 00:21:26
Grab this one.

857
00:21:26 --> 00:21:27
That will be blowing up all night.

858
00:21:27 --> 00:21:28
We&#39;d better get our reinforcements
tomorrow.

859
00:21:28 --> 00:21:29
We&#39;d fucking better.

860
00:21:29 --> 00:21:30
&lt;i&gt;Mr Secretary General,&lt;/i&gt;

861
00:21:30 --> 00:21:32
in view of your failure
to prevent civil war in the Congo,

862
00:21:32 --> 00:21:34
President Kennedy
has personally told me to insist

863
00:21:34 --> 00:21:36
that the United States play a larger part

864
00:21:36 --> 00:21:39
in your mishandled military adventure.

865
00:21:39 --> 00:21:40
Please tell President Kennedy

866
00:21:40 --> 00:21:41
that I appreciate the offer.

867
00:21:41 --> 00:21:44
You are aware
that if you had responded sooner

868
00:21:44 --> 00:21:47
to Prime Minister Lumumba&#39;s
request for UN intervention,

869
00:21:47 --> 00:21:49
we would not be where we are today.

870
00:21:49 --> 00:21:51
We might well have arrived here
by other means.

871
00:21:51 --> 00:21:53
Has General Tshombe
even accepted a cease fire yet?

872
00:21:53 --> 00:21:55
He has not. That&#39;s my first priority.

873
00:21:55 --> 00:21:56
Thank you, gentlemen.

874
00:21:56 --> 00:21:57
- Sir?
- Call Tshombe directly.

875
00:21:57 --> 00:21:59
Tell him that the Secretary General
of the United Nations

876
00:21:59 --> 00:22:00
is flying to meet with him in the Congo.

877
00:22:00 --> 00:22:01
See if that gets his attention.

878
00:22:01 --> 00:22:02
Would you like to say a few words?

879
00:22:02 --> 00:22:03
They poisoned the water.

880
00:22:03 --> 00:22:05
Take what you can from the barrels.
It&#39;s all we have. Do it now.

881
00:22:05 --> 00:22:06
- Cooley, get more buckets.
- Yes, sir.

882
00:22:06 --> 00:22:08
Radio! That&#39;ll be our reinforcements.

883
00:22:08 --> 00:22:09
What are you hearing?

884
00:22:09 --> 00:22:11
Nothing of ours, if that&#39;s what you mean.

885
00:22:11 --> 00:22:12
Let&#39;s go!

886
00:22:12 --> 00:22:13
Is that my reinforcements I hear?

887
00:22:13 --> 00:22:15
Kane&#39;s platoon are at the bridge.

888
00:22:15 --> 00:22:17
Thirty men?
What happened to the battalion?

889
00:22:17 --> 00:22:18
&lt;i&gt;It&#39;s all we could get.&lt;/i&gt;

890
00:22:18 --> 00:22:19
&lt;i&gt;They&#39;re under heavy bombardment.&lt;/i&gt;

891
00:22:19 --> 00:22:20
&lt;i&gt;They may have to pull back.&lt;/i&gt;

892
00:22:20 --> 00:22:21
Our only hope is that you reach us!

893
00:22:21 --> 00:22:22
&lt;i&gt;I&#39;ll try to get through to them.&lt;/i&gt;

894
00:22:22 --> 00:22:24
We&#39;re facing bigger numbers
than we were advised!

895
00:22:24 --> 00:22:25
&lt;i&gt;We have to pull out!&lt;/i&gt;

896
00:22:25 --> 00:22:26
&lt;i&gt;Pull back! Pull back!&lt;/i&gt;

897
00:22:26 --> 00:22:27
Sir. McEntee.

898
00:22:27 --> 00:22:28
Back to your positions.

899
00:22:28 --> 00:22:31
- Quinlan.
&lt;i&gt;- They can&#39;t break through, Pat.&lt;/i&gt;

900
00:22:31 --> 00:22:33
The Gends have shored up
with the big guns.

901
00:22:33 --> 00:22:34
Don&#39;t we have a load of big guns, Sean?

902
00:22:34 --> 00:22:37
Don&#39;t the United-fucking-Nations
have a load of big guns?

903
00:22:37 --> 00:22:38
&lt;i&gt;Not that we can get to you.&lt;/i&gt;

904
00:22:38 --> 00:22:39
Get ready!

905
00:22:39 --> 00:22:40
You&#39;re hanging us out to dry.

906
00:22:40 --> 00:22:41
Tell me you&#39;re not.

907
00:22:41 --> 00:22:45
They&#39;re splitting
into platoons! Target their heavy guns!

908
00:22:45 --> 00:22:46
Open fire!

909
00:22:46 --> 00:22:49
Tell me what I&#39;m supposed to do, General.

910
00:22:49 --> 00:22:50
&lt;i&gt;General!&lt;/i&gt;

911
00:22:50 --> 00:22:51
Carry out your orders, Commandant.

912
00:22:51 --> 00:22:52
Hold your ground.

913
00:22:52 --> 00:22:53
Defend Jadotville.

914
00:22:53 --> 00:22:55
With what? A firm tone?

915
00:22:55 --> 00:22:56
Ammo!

916
00:22:56 --> 00:22:57
We need more ammo over here!

917
00:22:57 --> 00:22:58
Make it last!

918
00:22:58 --> 00:23:01
I&#39;m going to start charging you
for every fucking bullet that misses!

919
00:23:01 --> 00:23:02
Stick to your positions!

920
00:23:02 --> 00:23:03
Last magazine!

921
00:23:03 --> 00:23:05
Go and find out where our fucking ammo is!

922
00:23:05 --> 00:23:06
I have to round up more ammo!

923
00:23:06 --> 00:23:09
Fucking... little bastards!

924
00:23:09 --> 00:23:10
Get off! Get off!

925
00:23:10 --> 00:23:11
Hold fire!

926
00:23:11 --> 00:23:12
We didn&#39;t do that.

927
00:23:12 --> 00:23:13
Incoming!

928
00:23:13 --> 00:23:14
Cooley!

929
00:23:14 --> 00:23:15
Find his head!

930
00:23:15 --> 00:23:16
There he is!

931
00:23:16 --> 00:23:17
Get him some air.

932
00:23:17 --> 00:23:18
We&#39;re running out of supplies.

933
00:23:18 --> 00:23:20
Some of these lads won&#39;t last much longer.

934
00:23:20 --> 00:23:21
Any dead?

935
00:23:21 --> 00:23:22
Not yet.

936
00:23:22 --> 00:23:23
Medic!

937
00:23:23 --> 00:23:25
Eyes on the south flank!

938
00:23:25 --> 00:23:26
Let&#39;s get him inside.

939
00:23:26 --> 00:23:27
And we&#39;re out of morphine.

940
00:23:27 --> 00:23:28
Oh, fuck.

941
00:23:28 --> 00:23:29
What&#39;s it like, getting shot?

942
00:23:29 --> 00:23:30
I wouldn&#39;t recommend it.

943
00:23:30 --> 00:23:31
Dr O&#39;Brien,

944
00:23:31 --> 00:23:33
&lt;i&gt;you have made a very bad thing much worse.&lt;/i&gt;

945
00:23:33 --> 00:23:35
Sir, I made my decisions
based on conditions in the field.

946
00:23:35 --> 00:23:37
&lt;i&gt;Your decisions have led to more bloodshed.&lt;/i&gt;

947
00:23:37 --> 00:23:40
Sir, Operation Morthor
has still been successful in the main.

948
00:23:40 --> 00:23:43
But you allowed a massacre
at the radio station.

949
00:23:43 --> 00:23:44
You expect me to defend that?

950
00:23:44 --> 00:23:46
What am I to do
if a commander chooses to go in hard?

951
00:23:46 --> 00:23:47
You&#39;re the man on the ground.

952
00:23:47 --> 00:23:48
Not every square inch of it, sir.

953
00:23:48 --> 00:23:50
General Tshombe
was willing to negotiate before this.

954
00:23:50 --> 00:23:51
Now he&#39;s broken all relations.

955
00:23:51 --> 00:23:55
And I am told there is an Irish company
stuck in the middle of nowhere under siege

956
00:23:55 --> 00:23:57
&lt;i&gt;as a result
of your Radio Katanga disaster.&lt;/i&gt;

957
00:23:57 --> 00:24:01
Dag... you more than anyone understand
I couldn&#39;t control every circumstance.

958
00:24:01 --> 00:24:02
&lt;i&gt;You&#39;re attached to it, Conor.&lt;/i&gt;

959
00:24:02 --> 00:24:03
Best leave you unattached to me.

960
00:24:03 --> 00:24:05
&lt;i&gt;It&#39;s about protecting the organization.&lt;/i&gt;

961
00:24:05 --> 00:24:06
Secretary General,

962
00:24:06 --> 00:24:08
&lt;i&gt;I believe I made the correct decisions.&lt;/i&gt;

963
00:24:08 --> 00:24:09
If you disagree, when you&#39;re here...

964
00:24:09 --> 00:24:10
I&#39;ll tender my resignation.

965
00:24:10 --> 00:24:12
I&#39;m quite sure you think you&#39;re right,
Conor.

966
00:24:12 --> 00:24:14
But facts on the ground says different.

967
00:24:14 --> 00:24:16
And I will have to accept
that resignation.

968
00:24:16 --> 00:24:17
&lt;i&gt;Unidentified aircraft.&lt;/i&gt;

969
00:24:17 --> 00:24:18
Hello?

970
00:24:18 --> 00:24:19
Get out.

971
00:24:19 --> 00:24:21
- Conor, this is a highly volatile...
- Get out!

972
00:24:21 --> 00:24:22
Sir, the crow is incoming.

973
00:24:22 --> 00:24:23
Get that gun up!

974
00:24:23 --> 00:24:24
Sergeant!

975
00:24:24 --> 00:24:25
Help me flip it.

976
00:24:25 --> 00:24:26
Corporal Donnelly!

977
00:24:26 --> 00:24:27
Bring your sections!

978
00:24:27 --> 00:24:28
One, two, three!

979
00:24:28 --> 00:24:29
To your stations!

980
00:24:29 --> 00:24:30
I need directions immediately.

981
00:24:30 --> 00:24:32
&lt;i&gt;Your message
will be conveyed to Dr O&#39;Brien.&lt;/i&gt;

982
00:24:32 --> 00:24:33
What&#39;s he doing that&#39;s so important?

983
00:24:33 --> 00:24:35
Does he have any other
United Nations units under siege?

984
00:24:35 --> 00:24:37
&lt;i&gt;Your message
will be conveyed to Dr O&#39;Brien.&lt;/i&gt;

985
00:24:37 --> 00:24:38
Fuck!

986
00:24:38 --> 00:24:41
- We&#39;re gonna have to leave them out there.
- We&#39;re not abandoning them.

987
00:24:41 --> 00:24:44
If we engage a battle for air-superiority,
it could lead to full-out war.

988
00:24:44 --> 00:24:47
Sure you&#39;re not trying
to reinforce a failed operation?

989
00:24:47 --> 00:24:49
Look, we cannot be held responsible
for the radio station.

990
00:24:49 --> 00:24:52
Quinlan&#39;s company was a mistake on
a chess board, leaving a pawn vulnerable.

991
00:24:52 --> 00:24:54
You don&#39;t sacrifice a queen
to save a pawn.

992
00:24:54 --> 00:24:55
What?

993
00:24:55 --> 00:24:58
&quot;UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld&#39;s
plane went down.&quot;

994
00:24:58 --> 00:24:59
&quot;There are no reports of survivors.&quot;

995
00:24:59 --> 00:25:00
Oh, my God.

996
00:25:00 --> 00:25:01
&lt;i&gt;The tragic death&lt;/i&gt;

997
00:25:01 --> 00:25:03
&lt;i&gt;of the Secretary General
of the United Nations&lt;/i&gt;

998
00:25:03 --> 00:25:04
&lt;i&gt;on his way to the Congo.&lt;/i&gt;

999
00:25:04 --> 00:25:06
&lt;i&gt;Everything now teeters in the balance,&lt;/i&gt;

1000
00:25:06 --> 00:25:08
&lt;i&gt;which has increased the stakes
for the United States&lt;/i&gt;

1001
00:25:08 --> 00:25:09
&lt;i&gt;and the Soviet Republic.&lt;/i&gt;

1002
00:25:09 --> 00:25:10
&lt;i&gt;In Washington,&lt;/i&gt;

1003
00:25:10 --> 00:25:12
&lt;i&gt;President Kennedy voices his tribute.&lt;/i&gt;

1004
00:25:12 --> 00:25:15
&lt;i&gt;Dag Hammarskjöld&#39;s cause
of dedication to the cause of peace,&lt;/i&gt;

1005
00:25:15 --> 00:25:18
&lt;i&gt;his willingness
to accept all responsibility...&lt;/i&gt;

1006
00:25:18 --> 00:25:20
&lt;i&gt;in trying to strengthen
the United Nations&lt;/i&gt;

1007
00:25:20 --> 00:25:22
&lt;i&gt;and make it a more effective instrument&lt;/i&gt;

1008
00:25:22 --> 00:25:26
&lt;i&gt;for the aspirations of the hundreds
of millions of people around the globe&lt;/i&gt;

1009
00:25:26 --> 00:25:27
&lt;i&gt;who desire to live out their lives.&lt;/i&gt;

1010
00:25:27 --> 00:25:28
&lt;i&gt;Those efforts of his are well known.&lt;/i&gt;

1011
00:25:28 --> 00:25:30
&lt;i&gt;It is tragic and ironical&lt;/i&gt;

1012
00:25:30 --> 00:25:32
&lt;i&gt;that his death came&lt;/i&gt;

1013
00:25:32 --> 00:25:33
&lt;i&gt;during a mission he was undertaking...&lt;/i&gt;

1014
00:25:33 --> 00:25:35
&lt;i&gt;in order to bring about cease fire&lt;/i&gt;

1015
00:25:35 --> 00:25:36
&lt;i&gt;in Katanga.&lt;/i&gt;

1016
00:25:36 --> 00:25:37
Let&#39;s see what everybody does now.

1017
00:25:37 --> 00:25:38
&lt;i&gt;Recognizing...&lt;/i&gt;

1018
00:25:38 --> 00:25:39
Come on.

1019
00:25:39 --> 00:25:40
Turn around.

1020
00:25:40 --> 00:25:42
You&#39;ll be all right, Reidy.
We&#39;ll see you at home.

1021
00:25:42 --> 00:25:44
Clear! We need to go now!

1022
00:25:44 --> 00:25:45
Get out of there! Get out!

1023
00:25:45 --> 00:25:46
- Get them!
- Don&#39;t let it get near us!

1024
00:25:46 --> 00:25:47
Get them pilots out!

1025
00:25:47 --> 00:25:48
What the fuck do we do now?

1026
00:25:48 --> 00:25:49
The mission now is to keep men alive.

1027
00:25:49 --> 00:25:51
Charlie Alpha Juliet to Control.

1028
00:25:51 --> 00:25:52
No response.

1029
00:25:52 --> 00:25:54
Sir, the radio&#39;s working,
they&#39;re just not answering.

1030
00:25:54 --> 00:25:55
Try it again.

1031
00:25:55 --> 00:25:57
I require an immediate decision
on our last request.

1032
00:25:57 --> 00:25:59
This is Charlie Alpha Juliet

1033
00:25:59 --> 00:26:00
awaiting further instructions.

1034
00:26:00 --> 00:26:02
This is Company A, Jadotville calling.

1035
00:26:02 --> 00:26:04
I require immediate contact
with anybody there.

1036
00:26:04 --> 00:26:05
They can hear us, boss.

1037
00:26:05 --> 00:26:07
If they were gonna help,
they would have by now.

1038
00:26:07 --> 00:26:08
Sir!

1039
00:26:08 --> 00:26:09
You need to see this!

1040
00:26:09 --> 00:26:10
You come with me!

1041
00:26:10 --> 00:26:11
Control your positions, lads!

1042
00:26:11 --> 00:26:12
If they get close enough, we&#39;re fucked.

1043
00:26:12 --> 00:26:13
Gather up all the shells.

1044
00:26:13 --> 00:26:13
Now.

1045
00:26:13 --> 00:26:14
Sniper!

1046
00:26:14 --> 00:26:15
Vickers on the roof!

1047
00:26:15 --> 00:26:16
Yes, sir!

1048
00:26:16 --> 00:26:17
Man your trench until they get close.

1049
00:26:17 --> 00:26:19
Donnelly, take explosives into the chapel
and outer houses.

1050
00:26:19 --> 00:26:21
- Yes, sir.
- Stack them against south-facing walls.

1051
00:26:21 --> 00:26:22
Joyce, grab those boxes!

1052
00:26:22 --> 00:26:22
Yes, sir!

1053
00:26:22 --> 00:26:23
Grab that box! Grab that box!

1054
00:26:23 --> 00:26:24
Sniper, cover the north flank.

1055
00:26:24 --> 00:26:25
Let&#39;s go!

1056
00:26:25 --> 00:26:27
Every shell you find,
put it in the box.

1057
00:26:27 --> 00:26:28
Get ready for it!

1058
00:26:28 --> 00:26:29
Get ready!

1059
00:26:29 --> 00:26:31
Stick to the plan and wait for my signal!

1060
00:26:31 --> 00:26:32
- Joyce, with me.
- Yes, sir.

1061
00:26:32 --> 00:26:33
Get those mortars out of there.

1062
00:26:33 --> 00:26:34
Keep moving!

1063
00:26:34 --> 00:26:35
Get ready for it!

1064
00:26:35 --> 00:26:36
They&#39;re almost there!

1065
00:26:36 --> 00:26:37
Open fire!

1066
00:26:37 --> 00:26:40
O&#39;Driscoll&#39;s trench, fall back!

1067
00:26:40 --> 00:26:42
Wait for it. Wait for it.

1068
00:26:42 --> 00:26:43
Fall back!

1069
00:26:43 --> 00:26:44
Hold.

1070
00:26:44 --> 00:26:45
Hold. Wait for it.

1071
00:26:45 --> 00:26:46
Flank&#39;s down!

1072
00:26:46 --> 00:26:47
Now!

1073
00:26:47 --> 00:26:48
Get back in your trenches!

1074
00:26:48 --> 00:26:49
Man your trenches!

1075
00:26:49 --> 00:26:50
Grab the guns!

1076
00:26:50 --> 00:26:51
They&#39;re coming!

1077
00:26:51 --> 00:26:52
They&#39;re coming from the east as well!

1078
00:26:52 --> 00:26:53
Boys on the left flank!

1079
00:26:53 --> 00:26:54
We need more men over here!

1080
00:26:54 --> 00:26:56
Williams, with me.
You, too, now!

1081
00:26:56 --> 00:26:57
Yes, sir.

1082
00:26:57 --> 00:26:58
Man the north flank!

1083
00:26:58 --> 00:26:59
Fuck!

1084
00:26:59 --> 00:27:00
This is the spot!

1085
00:27:00 --> 00:27:01
Fuck it. I&#39;m out.

1086
00:27:01 --> 00:27:04
Platoon, fall back!

1087
00:27:04 --> 00:27:05
Fall back!

1088
00:27:05 --> 00:27:06
Go! Go!

1089
00:27:06 --> 00:27:07
Incoming!

1090
00:27:07 --> 00:27:08
Gorman!

1091
00:27:08 --> 00:27:09
Get the fuck out of that trench!

1092
00:27:09 --> 00:27:10
Are you all right?

1093
00:27:10 --> 00:27:11
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1094
00:27:11 --> 00:27:12
Run!

1095
00:27:12 --> 00:27:13
Fucking run!

1096
00:27:13 --> 00:27:14
Ammo&#39;s out, sir!

1097
00:27:14 --> 00:27:15
Fuck! I&#39;m dry clicking.

1098
00:27:15 --> 00:27:16
I&#39;m done, gents!

1099
00:27:16 --> 00:27:17
Hold!

1100
00:27:17 --> 00:27:18
Quinlan!

1101
00:27:18 --> 00:27:19
Let&#39;s finish this!

1102
00:27:19 --> 00:27:20
Are we done now?

1103
00:27:20 --> 00:27:21
We&#39;ve used every bullet twice.

1104
00:27:21 --> 00:27:22
What do we do now?

1105
00:27:22 --> 00:27:23
I want your honest answer.

1106
00:27:23 --> 00:27:24
Should we surrender?

1107
00:27:24 --> 00:27:25
- No.
- No.

1108
00:27:25 --> 00:27:26
No.

1109
00:27:26 --> 00:27:27
No, boss.

1110
00:27:27 --> 00:27:28
- No, boss.
- No way.

1111
00:27:28 --> 00:27:29
Well said.

1112
00:27:29 --> 00:27:31
Good job
I&#39;m the one making the decisions.

1113
00:27:31 --> 00:27:32
It&#39;s over.

1114
00:27:32 --> 00:27:35
&lt;i&gt;As General Tshombe
continued to play games with the UN...&lt;/i&gt;

1115
00:27:35 --> 00:27:36
&lt;i&gt;we sat in jail,&lt;/i&gt;

1116
00:27:36 --> 00:27:38
&lt;i&gt;under sentence of death, and waited.&lt;/i&gt;

1117
00:27:38 --> 00:27:41
&lt;i&gt;Finally, about a month later,&lt;/i&gt;

1118
00:27:41 --> 00:27:42
&lt;i&gt;word came that we were to be sent home.&lt;/i&gt;

1119
00:27:42 --> 00:27:43
Right, come on. Let&#39;s go.

1120
00:27:43 --> 00:27:44
I wanna get out of this tip.

1121
00:27:44 --> 00:27:45
Come on. Hurry up.

1122
00:27:45 --> 00:27:46
Come on.

1123
00:27:46 --> 00:27:48
&lt;i&gt;We were too relieved
to care what deal had been done,&lt;/i&gt;

1124
00:27:48 --> 00:27:50
&lt;i&gt;and traveled back
knowing that we&#39;d held our own ground...&lt;/i&gt;

1125
00:27:50 --> 00:27:52
&lt;i&gt;and done Ireland and the UN proud.&lt;/i&gt;

1126
00:27:52 --> 00:27:53
Commandant Quinlan.

1127
00:27:53 --> 00:27:54
Welcome back.

1128
00:27:54 --> 00:27:55
It&#39;s a poor reception, I know.

1129
00:27:55 --> 00:27:56
I&#39;m putting them all up for medals.

1130
00:27:56 --> 00:27:58
For a virgin army... hell, for any army...

1131
00:27:58 --> 00:27:59
They were magnificent.

1132
00:27:59 --> 00:28:00
It&#39;s not the right time.

1133
00:28:00 --> 00:28:01
What do you mean?

1134
00:28:01 --> 00:28:03
There&#39;s not going to be
any mention of this.

1135
00:28:03 --> 00:28:04
It&#39;s a complicated situation,

1136
00:28:04 --> 00:28:06
and frankly,
you&#39;ve made it more complicated.

1137
00:28:06 --> 00:28:07
How?

1138
00:28:07 --> 00:28:08
By surrendering.

1139
00:28:08 --> 00:28:09
You made us look bad.

1140
00:28:09 --> 00:28:11
Look, it&#39;s not just me, you understand.

1141
00:28:11 --> 00:28:13
The whole United Nations has been judged.

1142
00:28:13 --> 00:28:16
If we treat your men like heroes,
then we damage the institution.

1143
00:28:16 --> 00:28:17
Is this coming from you or O&#39;Brien?

1144
00:28:17 --> 00:28:18
That&#39;s an impertinent question.

1145
00:28:18 --> 00:28:19
Lads.

1146
00:28:19 --> 00:28:20
What kind of a soldier are you?

1147
00:28:20 --> 00:28:21
We can make it a lot worse.

1148
00:28:21 --> 00:28:23
There&#39;s talk of a court martial
for cowardice.

1149
00:28:23 --> 00:28:24
Do it.

1150
00:28:24 --> 00:28:25
I don&#39;t care.

1151
00:28:25 --> 00:28:26
Not just for you.

1152
00:28:26 --> 00:28:27
For them.

1153
00:28:27 --> 00:28:28
You can have him court-martialed for that.

1154
00:28:28 --> 00:28:30
No, it would only kick up too much dust.

1155
00:28:30 --> 00:28:31
Anyway...

1156
00:28:31 --> 00:28:32
I think he owed me that one.

1157
00:28:32 --> 00:28:33
I was right to do it.

1158
00:28:33 --> 00:28:34
If I hadn&#39;t,
the world would be at war now.

1159
00:28:34 --> 00:28:36
Well, he doesn&#39;t understand
how the world works.

1160
00:28:36 --> 00:28:37
Carry on, lads.

1161
00:28:37 --> 00:28:39

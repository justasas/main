3
00:00:02 --> 00:00:05


4
00:00:05 --> 00:00:07
Recently there have been many rumors about a certain band

5
00:00:07 --> 00:00:09
Queen, rumors saying that the rozejdziemy.Jak you think?

6
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
&#39;Noooo!&#39; They say here!

7
00:00:12 --> 00:00:17
So forget about those rumors. Stay together until he died, I&#39;m sure!

8
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
INTRO TO: &quot;One Vision&quot;

9
00:00:19 --> 00:00:20
Hey!

10
00:00:20 --> 00:00:24
Really it was not that much sex. . . There was so much drugs.

11
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
Now, you would not be able togo to do.

12
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
One man

13
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
One goal

14
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
One mission. . .

15
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
At that moment, in a sense władaliśmy world.

16
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
Where is the modesty? There is no such distributions.

17
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
One solution. . .

18
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
In many cases, the press was against them.

19
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
Yeah, they are God. . .

20
00:00:41 --> 00:00:43
England does not believe that we are cool.

21
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
But I do not want it to some asshole critic told me.

22
00:00:46 --> 00:00:49
You might as well paint a target on your head and shout &quot;Shoot me.&quot;

23
00:00:49 --> 00:00:53
I think as you are at the top you have only to fall down.

24
00:00:53 --> 00:00:56
Sun City - I would prefer never to hear about this place!

25
00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
I&#39;m gonna tell you there&#39;s no black and no white. . .

26
00:00:59 --> 00:01:04
When the band is under pressure you will eventually shift, separation, quarrel.

27
00:01:04 --> 00:01:06
One vision worldwide. . .

28
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
We were at a turning point. We could be forced to break.

29
00:01:09 --> 00:01:13
At the beginning of criticism was constructive, then it became personal. It is obvious.

30
00:01:13 --> 00:01:15
There is a hidden jealousy.

31
00:01:15 --> 00:01:21
Everyone is waiting to see if my album will be better than the last Queen album.

32
00:01:21 --> 00:01:23
Freddie came up with the gay scene as

33
00:01:23 --> 00:01:26
David Attenborough doing programs about wild animals.

34
00:01:26 --> 00:01:30
I want it to shove as much life and play the best will be possible.

35
00:01:30 --> 00:01:33
&#39;London - Imperial College of Science and Technology,

36
00:01:33 --> 00:01:36
&#39;Place of meeting space scientists from 50 countries,

37
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
&#39;Specialists who will help to develop equipment that

38
00:01:38 --> 00:01:41
take mankind into a new era of space exploration. &#39;

39
00:01:41 --> 00:01:44
Brian May on guitar.

40
00:01:44 --> 00:01:49
I studied physics as a student in front of a BA, but astonomia was always my plot.

41
00:01:49 --> 00:01:53
So I did a doctorate in astronomy.

42
00:01:53 --> 00:01:57
When we were in school, me and my friends had a band called 1984.

43
00:01:57 --> 00:02:00
When I went to university, I and our singer Tim Staffell,

44
00:02:00 --> 00:02:04
we decided to start a group called &quot;Smile&quot;.

45
00:02:04 --> 00:02:07
We Meddows-Roger Taylor on drums.

46
00:02:07 --> 00:02:10
There was a plaque on the announcement, where przypinało messages for musicians

47
00:02:10 --> 00:02:14
So I hung ad &quot;we are looking for a drummer.&quot;

48
00:02:14 --> 00:02:18
&quot;We need a Ginger Baker / Mitch Mitchell - this kind of drummer.&quot;

49
00:02:18 --> 00:02:23
I booked a small jazz club and Roger bring your own drums and I&#39;m a guitar.

50
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
It was the first time we played together.

51
00:02:26 --> 00:02:28
When she was done

52
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
She hung them up. . .

53
00:02:30 --> 00:02:35
Something was on top of things. We thought, &quot;There&#39;s a unique sound.&quot;

54
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
Goodbye, April Lady. . .

55
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
I think we had the same kind of music in their heads.

56
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
Goodbye, April Lady

57
00:02:45 --> 00:02:49
You&#39;ve done a lot for the folks in this town. . .

58
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
Freddie Mercury- vocals.

59
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
Freddie had a colonial origin.

60
00:02:55 --> 00:03:00
He was born in Zanzibar and went to boarding school in India.

61
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
I first met Freddie in Ealing Art School in 1968.

62
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
There was a piano

63
00:03:06 --> 00:03:09
and Freddie showed his flamboyant style in playing the piano.

64
00:03:09 --> 00:03:12
It was similar to Mozart&#39;s very impressive but unique.

65
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
I&#39;ve never heard anyone so he played the piano.

66
00:03:15 --> 00:03:20
The first time I sang I knew that the voice used to visit many places.

67
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
The minute you walked in the joint

68
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
I could see you were a man of distinction

69
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
A real big spender

70
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
Good-looking, so refined

71
00:03:29 --> 00:03:32
Say, would not you like to know what&#39;s going on in my mind. . . ?

72
00:03:32 --> 00:03:36
I followed the development of Smile. We were friends. I went to their concerts.

73
00:03:36 --> 00:03:38
Freddie was waiting backstage, literally, and gave them

74
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
advice as to what we should have done.

75
00:03:40 --> 00:03:44
He said: &quot;You are great but you should do this and that...&quot;

76
00:03:44 --> 00:03:48
What did you see in what Brian and Rogers did with &quot;Smile&quot;? Nothing!

77
00:03:48 --> 00:03:53
I think it was somewhere in the back of an idea to work with us.

78
00:03:53 --> 00:03:58
Freddie told everyone that will ever pop star but we did not take it seriously.

79
00:03:58 --> 00:04:04
One night I was sitting there. When I entered buried his head in his hands, he looked downcast.

80
00:04:04 --> 00:04:08
I said, &quot;What about you?&quot; And he: &quot;I&#39;m not a pop star ...&quot;

81
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
Very slowly he stood up and said:

82
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
&quot;I.. .legendą!&quot;

83
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
Hey, big spender

84
00:04:16 --> 00:04:20
Spend a little time with me. . .

85
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
We had a lot of good numbers played in universities, pubs

86
00:04:24 --> 00:04:28
and clubs all over the country but nowhere really have not come.

87
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
Smile recorded a single that did not change anything,

88
00:04:31 --> 00:04:35
then Tim, our singer, he got an offer from a band called Humpy Bong.

89
00:04:35 --> 00:04:37
So Tim agreed.

90
00:04:37 --> 00:04:41
And here Freddie us had. He said: &quot;Stop, you can not give up. I want to sing.&quot;

91
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
So we decided to risk another.

92
00:04:43 --> 00:04:46
And that was when, in a way I thought about the name Queen.

93
00:04:46 --> 00:04:50
Why is the Queen? I do not know. As at that time it was outrageous.

94
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
So here we have the main stage.

95
00:04:52 --> 00:04:55
In 1973, it was here that Queen played.

96
00:04:55 --> 00:04:59
It really is the first correct promoted concert we made

97
00:04:59 --> 00:05:04
and the first review written by Rosemary horid about what was on the plate.

98
00:05:04 --> 00:05:10
From the outset, Freddie was absolutely amazing technically.

99
00:05:10 --> 00:05:14
He presented differently. I was a music journalist for a long time.

100
00:05:14 --> 00:05:20
Freddie, even if he had the ability to work with the audience and they ate out of his hand.

101
00:05:20 --> 00:05:25
He could turn his hand to do so and then got up and the audience.

102
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
I have sinned, dear Father

103
00:05:27 --> 00:05:28
Father, I have sinned

104
00:05:28 --> 00:05:31
Try and help me, Father

105
00:05:31 --> 00:05:34
Will not you let me in?

106
00:05:34 --> 00:05:35
Liar!

107
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
Oh, nobody. . .

108
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
at this point the first time I thought, &quot;Something

109
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
We are going on here and people know what we mean. &quot;

110
00:05:43 --> 00:05:47
When I arrived, there was &quot;denim rock movement&quot;.

111
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
with such groups as the &quot;Status Quo&quot; and &quot;Uriah Heep&quot;.

112
00:05:50 --> 00:05:56
I think that the Queen was an amazing breath of fresh air in rock music.

113
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
They had ganialne songs.

114
00:05:58 --> 00:06:02
Freddie Mercury was absolutely charismatic leader.

115
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
Liar. . .

116
00:06:03 --> 00:06:08
Brian May was a great guitarist and Roger Taylor was phenomenal drummer.

117
00:06:08 --> 00:06:11
I had this guy that played the bass.

118
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
We have spent many years searching for a bassist

119
00:06:13 --> 00:06:16
Finding the right man was very difficult.

120
00:06:16 --> 00:06:16
Then we found John.

121
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
John Deacon on bass.

122
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
When I showed up at the beginning of an outsider.

123
00:06:22 --> 00:06:26
A couple of years it took me ingrowth in group

124
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
and a feeling like home.

125
00:06:28 --> 00:06:32
Before we reported to music publishing, we signed up to the Trident Productions

126
00:06:32 --> 00:06:37
run by brothers Sheffield, who had a studio in the heart of Soho.

127
00:06:37 --> 00:06:41
When we recorded the first album, we were students ending the appropriate steps.

128
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
We had to do it at any time that was available

129
00:06:44 --> 00:06:47
because the studio was booked almost all the time.

130
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
Sometimes we had to come at two o&#39;clock in the morning

131
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
and sometimes we are finishing at 6 o&#39;clock in the morning, always in

132
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
those odd hours which nobody wanted.

133
00:06:53 --> 00:06:58
You know, you can sometimes be seen working girls for their lace curtains,

134
00:06:58 --> 00:07:02
So when miksowaliśmy, had a small dose of entertainment.

135
00:07:02 --> 00:07:07
The album came out and all the publicity like silent. Nothing really big is not filed.

136
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
When you are doing your first album, you walk around the store

137
00:07:09 --> 00:07:12
music and you think: &quot;We are in music stores!&quot;

138
00:07:12 --> 00:07:18
You enter and you ask, &quot;Do you have a new albym Queen?&quot; And they: &quot;What?&quot;.

139
00:07:18 --> 00:07:22
As for the Queen II, I could not believe how much work we put in it.

140
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
We felt that we create our own sound.

141
00:07:25 --> 00:07:28
We were the pioneers of tracks with multiple paths.

142
00:07:28 --> 00:07:30
It gives you a huge palette of possibilities.

143
00:07:30 --> 00:07:35
You could create choral singing while only 3 of us sang.

144
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
Voice from behind. . .

145
00:07:37 --> 00:07:41
Weszliśmu really deep in production and poszybowaliśmy the summit.

146
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
There is a track: March Of The Black Queen.

147
00:07:44 --> 00:07:48
I&#39;ll be a bad boy, I&#39;ll be your bad boy

148
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
I&#39;ll do the march of the Black Queen. . .

149
00:07:51 --> 00:07:57
It is very long. There are about 11 other sections, the entire complex is still mixed.

150
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
I mean, that record was literally transparent.

151
00:07:59 --> 00:08:03
Track 16 approx. 5cm tape, the coating was almost completely worn out.

152
00:08:03 --> 00:08:07
So many times I questioned that the album was practically transparent.

153
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
Walking true to style

154
00:08:09 --> 00:08:15
She&#39;s vulgar abuse and vile fi-fo the Black Queen tattoos all her pies. . .

155
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
So it was almost exclusively from &quot;Queen II&quot; and &quot;Seven Seas Of Rhye&quot;

156
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
Then came the breakthrough.

157
00:08:20 --> 00:08:26
We realized that the easiest way to make a hit record a single,

158
00:08:26 --> 00:08:29
which is good musically.

159
00:08:29 --> 00:08:34
The key to this was to be pulling on their list of &quot;Top Of The Pops&quot;

160
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
when Bowie dropped and which completely wyniosłło this single.

161
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
The first time he did a great impression

162
00:08:41 --> 00:08:43
because the BBC held then strike.

163
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
Fear me, you lords and lady preachers. . .

164
00:08:46 --> 00:08:49
So it was recorded in a studio weather.

165
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
I command your very souls, you Unbelievers

166
00:08:52 --> 00:08:55
Bring before me what is mine, The Seven Seas of Rhye. . .

167
00:08:55 --> 00:08:59
It was a lot of fun to be on &quot;Top Of The Pops&quot; because it all just happened.

168
00:08:59 --> 00:09:04
Did you feel like you&#39;re part of the public consciousness.

169
00:09:04 --> 00:09:08
I will destroy any man who dares to abuse my trust. . .

170
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
&quot;Top Of The Pops&quot; was hopeless.

171
00:09:10 --> 00:09:14
It was pointless poniważ no one really played.

172
00:09:14 --> 00:09:18
There were about 75 teenagers sitting in the studio

173
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
and a bunch of aging disc jockey&#39;ów who you are predicting.

174
00:09:21 --> 00:09:26
Mr. People there, beautiful dancing girls. It was fun.

175
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
The BBC had plastic sticks and when you hit them,

176
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
you could hear the &quot;duh&quot; so it did not seem at all sound.

177
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
I do not think you need to add more.

178
00:09:34 --> 00:09:38
We had mixed feelings about Top Of The Pops because it was not at all cool,

179
00:09:38 --> 00:09:42
but it was a great catapult for record sales, so what can you say?

180
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
This had a huge effect. Our recordings have gone straight to the top.

181
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
It&#39;s obvious, the effect was enormous.

182
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
Storm the master marathon I&#39;ll fly through

183
00:09:50 --> 00:09:54
By flash and thunder fire and I&#39;ll survive I&#39;ll survive, I&#39;ll survive

184
00:09:54 --> 00:10:00
Then I&#39;ll defy the laws of nature and come out ali-and-ive Then I&#39;ll get you. . .

185
00:10:00 --> 00:10:05
So it was with &quot;Seven Seas Of Rhye&quot;, but it is a universal truth that most of the group falls apart

186
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
by quarrels about writing songs, and not other things.

187
00:10:08 --> 00:10:10
Your songs are your children.

188
00:10:10 --> 00:10:16
The writer of the song is the only one who sees the song of the same idea in his head

189
00:10:16 --> 00:10:21
up to the final production, through each and every sound mix ...

190
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
Most of the time I have a clear picture of what I want to achieve.

191
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
I have this image of ... let&#39;s say, a part of Roger

192
00:10:27 --> 00:10:31
and what to do Brian ... of course, that there are quarrels.

193
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
Probably we never talked about that

194
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
&quot;The Seven Seas Of Rhye&quot; was the idea of ​​Freddie.

195
00:10:35 --> 00:10:40
He was such a cool idea to throw in a lot on the piano in the middle

196
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
so we worked on it together, but as I came to this,

197
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
the album had come out Freddie said: &quot;I wrote it.&quot;

198
00:10:46 --> 00:10:50
For we, &quot;OK.&quot; It did not seem to us that this has any meaning.

199
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
Freddie said, &quot;I wrote the words, and it was my idea, so this is my song.&quot;

200
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
It was such an unwritten law that the person who created the

201
00:10:57 --> 00:11:00
the song received her all the profits

202
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
and money for writing songs.

203
00:11:02 --> 00:11:06
Much, much later we realized this fact.

204
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
Here I Stand Here I Stand

205
00:11:09 --> 00:11:11
Look around, around

206
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
Around, around, around. . .

207
00:11:13 --> 00:11:16
We were very happy because we were able to experience

208
00:11:16 --> 00:11:18
the opening concert of the band Mott The Hoople.

209
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
Now I&#39;m here now I&#39;m here. . .

210
00:11:20 --> 00:11:24
We took them on a tour of the UK was just perfect.

211
00:11:24 --> 00:11:27
Now I&#39;m there now I&#39;m there. . .

212
00:11:27 --> 00:11:32
Then the guests from Mott asked, &quot;Would you like to do the same in America?&quot;

213
00:11:32 --> 00:11:35
Just a new man

214
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37
Yes, you made me live again. . .

215
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
After a few concerts, I started to feel strange.

216
00:11:40 --> 00:11:45
Something was wrong. I did not know whether it was my head and body, but it felt strange.

217
00:11:45 --> 00:11:50
I woke up in the morning in Boston, where he was to be the finale of the tour. . .

218
00:11:50 --> 00:11:56
I woke up and I was yellow. The doctor said, &quot;You have jaundice. You need to go home.&quot;

219
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
I was surprised that we were able to perform at all

220
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
go through the queue at JFK Airport in New York.

221
00:12:01 --> 00:12:03
The poor man barely able to stay on his feet.

222
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
They took me to the plane holding on their shoulders.

223
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
We were devastated, the route has been previously

224
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
completed, and this was our first shows in the United States.

225
00:12:09 --> 00:12:12
But just we entered the studio without him.

226
00:12:12 --> 00:12:15
It was a long road to health.

227
00:12:15 --> 00:12:20
It is to him dobierało and I saw Freddie loses strength, thinking all the time

228
00:12:20 --> 00:12:24
&quot;I can not pull themselves together,&quot; I started to really worry about him.

229
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
She keeps her Moet et Chandon

230
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
In her pretty cabinet

231
00:12:29 --> 00:12:33
&quot;Let them eat cake &#39;she says just like Marie Antoinette. . .

232
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
And the Queen and Queen II were totally rock slabs

233
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
and knew it was only a matter of time when

234
00:12:38 --> 00:12:40
bring clean melodic lines for tracks and just

235
00:12:40 --> 00:12:42
&quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; was a breakthrough album.

236
00:12:42 --> 00:12:46
And &quot;Killer Queen&quot; where the vocal Mercur&#39;ego was probably better than ever.

237
00:12:46 --> 00:12:50
She&#39;s a killer queen Gunpowder, gelatine

238
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
Dynamite with a laser beam

239
00:12:52 --> 00:12:55
Guaranteed to blow your mind Any time. . .

240
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
I remember that I had a gentle distance to &quot;Killer Queen.&quot;

241
00:12:58 --> 00:13:02
I thought, &quot;Is not sold up to something that is very light?&quot;

242
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
But every piece of this song is perfect.

243
00:13:04 --> 00:13:07
It has many of the small elements that are

244
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
niepowtarzalne- such as the sound of cymbals.

245
00:13:09 --> 00:13:13
In conversation she spoke just like a baroness

246
00:13:13 --> 00:13:17
Met a man from China Went down to Geisha Minah

247
00:13:17 --> 00:13:21
Then again incidentally if you&#39;re that way inclined. . .

248
00:13:21 --> 00:13:27
&quot;Killer Queen&quot; has always been exceptional. It is very sophisticated and typical for Freddie.

249
00:13:27 --> 00:13:33
Along with issuing albums and new songs we ducked into new areas.

250
00:13:33 --> 00:13:37
Dynamite with a laser beam Guaranteed to blow your mind. . .

251
00:13:37 --> 00:13:41
I like to write different songs. We do not like to repeat.

252
00:13:41 --> 00:13:46
It was like a Noel Coward. . . You know, this element in itself.

253
00:13:46 --> 00:13:52
When you read the text and think, &quot;What is amazing!&quot; Because they were so clever.

254
00:13:52 --> 00:13:56
Drop of a hat she&#39;s as willing as Playful as a pussycat

255
00:13:56 --> 00:14:00
Then momentarily out of action Temporarily out of gas

256
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
It is absolutely drive you wild

257
00:14:04 --> 00:14:07
She&#39;s all out to get you

258
00:14:07 --> 00:14:09
She&#39;s a killer queen

259
00:14:09 --> 00:14:13
Gunpowder, gelatine Dynamite with a laser beam

260
00:14:13 --> 00:14:16
Guaranteed to blow your mind Any time

261
00:14:16 --> 00:14:20
Oh, recommended at the price Insatiable an appetite

262
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
Wanna try?

263
00:14:22 --> 00:14:24
You wanna try. . .

264
00:14:24 --> 00:14:28
We played a lot of big tours in Japan, America.

265
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
We were at the headlines, prospered us

266
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
We sold many records but we have not seen the money.

267
00:14:34 --> 00:14:39
We decided to work with production companies instead of publishing houses.

268
00:14:39 --> 00:14:44
The agreement was that we recorded the album, and production company, sold his publishing house.

269
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
It was probably the worst thing you could do.

270
00:14:46 --> 00:14:52
This meant that they do not get any money from what they were doing.

271
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
The point at which it became aware himself

272
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
it&#39;s with the song &quot;Death On Two Legs&quot;.

273
00:14:56 --> 00:14:58
You suck my blood like a leech

274
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
You break the law and you breach

275
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
Screw my brain till it hurts

276
00:15:02 --> 00:15:06
You&#39;ve taken all my money

277
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
And you want more. . .

278
00:15:08 --> 00:15:13
Often, when I went to interview I bought a couple of bottles of wine

279
00:15:13 --> 00:15:15
with his own money because they did not have any.

280
00:15:15 --> 00:15:18
We did not expect instant riches. We did not receive anything!

281
00:15:18 --> 00:15:21
Roger broke the stick when it hit quite hard in the OPC.

282
00:15:21 --> 00:15:25
Manager said: &quot;Do not break more sticks.&quot; We had no money at all.

283
00:15:25 --> 00:15:31
One of the managers bought a Rolls-Royce and thought &quot;Moment! Something is wrong here.&quot;

284
00:15:31 --> 00:15:32
It&#39;s very conducive to Freddie so in the end he said,

285
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
&quot;I do not have any music I create. I can not.&quot;

286
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
Long story short, we went to John Reid

287
00:15:36 --> 00:15:39
which was a very capable manager of Elton.

288
00:15:39 --> 00:15:41
I remember saying, &quot;Go away

289
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
&quot;And produce a best album I date advice. I&#39;ll take care of business matters.&quot;

290
00:15:44 --> 00:15:47
He united us great friendship with John.

291
00:15:47 --> 00:15:51
Just as we were combative and keen to work. We were not afraid of him.

292
00:15:51 --> 00:15:54
It was the first night when I went to dinner with Freddie.

293
00:15:54 --> 00:15:57
I said, &quot;I would say, just like the guys, I

294
00:15:57 --> 00:16:00
wiesz- hope that I&#39;m gay, and it&#39;s no problem. &quot;

295
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
Then he put down his knife and fork and said, &quot;So am I!&quot;

296
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
When I first met Freddie did not fit into the group

297
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
as it grappled with the problems of their sexuality.

298
00:16:09 --> 00:16:14
A came from a very traditional zoroastriańskiego environment.

299
00:16:14 --> 00:16:19
and I think that her influence was then the most important.

300
00:16:19 --> 00:16:22
I remember how I entered the studio to record &quot;A Night

301
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
At The Opera &quot;and I felt that I was on the edge.

302
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
Not only that, we were poor, we still had a long.

303
00:16:27 --> 00:16:32
All of the sounds, lights, and others who have worked with us were not paid,

304
00:16:32 --> 00:16:34
so we were in a really critical time.

305
00:16:34 --> 00:16:37
We could be forced to solve a band album if that did not work out.

306
00:16:37 --> 00:16:40
And it was a very expensive album.

307
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
Even now I wonder how we did some of these things.

308
00:16:43 --> 00:16:47
There was so much desire. We wanted to show so much.

309
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
All this is contained in the album so we had a lot of various songs.

310
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
Bohemian Rhapsody was virtually three songs that

311
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
I wanted to create so just joined them into one.

312
00:16:56 --> 00:17:01
The largest amount of work on this song was made at Ealing College.

313
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
Freddie had many parts of songs that combined together

314
00:17:04 --> 00:17:06
and one of them, referred to the &quot;The Cowboy Song&quot;

315
00:17:06 --> 00:17:09
which was: &quot;Mom, I just killed a man.&quot;

316
00:17:09 --> 00:17:11
Mom

317
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
Just killed a man. . .

318
00:17:13 --> 00:17:17
The first thing I heard was Freddie playing &quot;Mama, just killed a man...&quot;

319
00:17:17 --> 00:17:22
&quot;What do you think?&quot; &quot;I love it. It is absolutely brilliant.&quot; Not knowing what will happen next.

320
00:17:22 --> 00:17:25
To this end we had to work in 6 studies.

321
00:17:25 --> 00:17:30
By this they used all these studies we did not know what was coming.

322
00:17:30 --> 00:17:35
Parts of the guitar and recorded in one instance. Vocals in another.

323
00:17:35 --> 00:17:36
Galileo

324
00:17:36 --> 00:17:37
Galileo

325
00:17:37 --> 00:17:39
Galileo Figaro. . .

326
00:17:39 --> 00:17:43
Freddie turning it on and said: &quot;I still have a few Galileos.&quot;

327
00:17:43 --> 00:17:45
We went pokolei from these studies and listened to fragments.

328
00:17:45 --> 00:17:49
Thunderbolt and lightning Very, very frightening me

329
00:17:49 --> 00:17:52
Lightning, very, very frightening, very, very frightening me. . .

330
00:17:52 --> 00:17:56
Only Fred was in sowjej head and connect it together with our parties.

331
00:17:56 --> 00:17:58
I thought, &quot;I&#39;ll do as I podobai.&quot;

332
00:17:58 --> 00:18:01
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me. . .

333
00:18:01 --> 00:18:06
Do as much as possible multi-layered harmony. You know, go straight to the top.

334
00:18:06 --> 00:18:10
Then I was very amused and said: &quot;I bet you do not give advice.&quot;

335
00:18:10 --> 00:18:13
He&#39;s just a poor boy from a poor family

336
00:18:13 --> 00:18:16
Spare him his life from this monstrosity. . .

337
00:18:16 --> 00:18:19
But the publishing house came to us herds and said:

338
00:18:19 --> 00:18:21
&quot;It is too long. Nobody will be playing.&quot;

339
00:18:21 --> 00:18:24
I played it all the time Elton John

340
00:18:24 --> 00:18:28
and he said, &quot;Are you crazy? It will never appear on the radio.&quot;

341
00:18:28 --> 00:18:30
I said, &quot;Either appears in full or not at all.&quot;

342
00:18:30 --> 00:18:34
At the critical moment, the young man-Kenny Everett, appeared

343
00:18:34 --> 00:18:38
and I stole a copy and released it on their own radio.

344
00:18:38 --> 00:18:43
Kenny played it 14 times over the weekend and of course it was a hit.

345
00:18:43 --> 00:18:47
I followed what for me was the first music video.

346
00:18:47 --> 00:18:50
We will not let you go Let him go! Bismillah!

347
00:18:50 --> 00:18:53
We will not let you go Let him go! Bismillah. . .

348
00:18:53 --> 00:18:56
I&#39;ve never seen anything like the rest like everyone else.

349
00:18:56 --> 00:18:58
Video Queen moved to a higher level

350
00:18:58 --> 00:19:01
where actually able to set new horizons.

351
00:19:01 --> 00:19:04
Mamma mia, mamma mia Mamma mia, llet me go. . .

352
00:19:04 --> 00:19:09
&quot;Night At The Opera&quot; was a breakthrough album, which described them as a great power.

353
00:19:09 --> 00:19:12
It gave you a background in which you could do something big like. Concert in Hyde Park.

354
00:19:12 --> 00:19:16
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye

355
00:19:16 --> 00:19:21
So you think you can love me and leave me to die. . .

356
00:19:21 --> 00:19:25
It was Richard Branson. &quot;We thought we could play in Hyde Park.&quot;

357
00:19:25 --> 00:19:28
Thank you very much. Good evening everyone.

358
00:19:28 --> 00:19:31
Welcome to our pikiniku.

359
00:19:31 --> 00:19:34
I remember that I thought: &quot;Oops!&quot; Rozkochaliśmy in a world

360
00:19:34 --> 00:19:37
but England does not mean we&#39;re cool.

361
00:19:37 --> 00:19:43
It all went beyond dreams. I returned home a hero.

362
00:19:43 --> 00:19:47
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ahhh. . .

363
00:19:47 --> 00:19:52
It was a thrilling experience to have such contact with the audience in their own city.

364
00:19:52 --> 00:19:57
When I came to do &quot;Day At The Races&quot; we thought, &quot;Let&#39;s do what we do.&quot;

365
00:19:57 --> 00:20:02
Hidden component in the &quot;Day At The Races&quot; is the feeling of freedom we had

366
00:20:02 --> 00:20:08
I escaped from the old situation we had money, we had no debt.

367
00:20:08 --> 00:20:12
There we had to fight for survival enjoyed freedom.

368
00:20:12 --> 00:20:14
Ca-a-an

369
00:20:14 --> 00:20:17
Anybody. . .

370
00:20:17 --> 00:20:20
It was as if we were still created &quot;A Night At The Opera.&quot;

371
00:20:20 --> 00:20:22
We loved it. We enjoyed it.

372
00:20:22 --> 00:20:26
Somebody is a lo-o-ove. . .

373
00:20:26 --> 00:20:32
Freddie came up short input style white Gospelu, if you put it that way.

374
00:20:32 --> 00:20:33
Ooh

375
00:20:33 --> 00:20:35
Each morning I get up. . .

376
00:20:35 --> 00:20:37
Really zgraliśmy in the &quot;Somebody To Love&quot;.

377
00:20:37 --> 00:20:41
Take a look at yourself to take a look in the mirror and cry. . .

378
00:20:41 --> 00:20:45
For Freddie inspiration for &quot;Somebody To Love&quot; was Aretha Franklin.

379
00:20:45 --> 00:20:47
Boundlessly loved Aretha&#39;ę.

380
00:20:47 --> 00:20:49
He wanted to be Aretha&#39;ą Franklin!

381
00:20:49 --> 00:20:52
Somebody! Somebody! Ooh, somebody! Somebody!

382
00:20:52 --> 00:20:56
Can anybody find me somebody to love. . . ?

383
00:20:56 --> 00:20:59
From our point of widzenia- OK, Bohemian Rhapsody, a big hit,

384
00:20:59 --> 00:21:03
but the song of &quot;Somebody To Love&quot; is in my opinion better

385
00:21:03 --> 00:21:05
with regard to speech.

386
00:21:05 --> 00:21:07
I work till I ache in my bones

387
00:21:07 --> 00:21:10
At the end At the end of the day

388
00:21:10 --> 00:21:13
I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own

389
00:21:13 --> 00:21:16
I get down on my knees and I start to pray

390
00:21:16 --> 00:21:19
Till the tears run down from my eyes

391
00:21:19 --> 00:21:22
Lord, somebody! Somebody! Ooh, somebody

392
00:21:22 --> 00:21:25
Can anybody find me. . .

393
00:21:25 --> 00:21:30
We used the studio to the limit, as if painting a picture on large canvases.

394
00:21:30 --> 00:21:33
Find me somebody to love

395
00:21:33 --> 00:21:36
Find me somebody to love. . .

396
00:21:36 --> 00:21:40
We had a gift. We had three great voices which united.

397
00:21:40 --> 00:21:42
Find me somebody to love. . .

398
00:21:42 --> 00:21:46
Freddie had a crystal-clear, crisp vocals.

399
00:21:46 --> 00:21:50
Find me somebody to love, find me somebody to love. . .

400
00:21:50 --> 00:21:53
Naturally, I had a strong, high voice.

401
00:21:53 --> 00:21:56
He had tons of dog whistle-very high voice.

402
00:21:56 --> 00:21:58
Find me somebody to love. . .

403
00:21:58 --> 00:22:00
And I had a very warm sound.

404
00:22:00 --> 00:22:02
Somebody! Somebody! Somebody! Somebody!

405
00:22:02 --> 00:22:06
Somebody! Find me. . . Somebody find me somebody to love

406
00:22:06 --> 00:22:09
Can anybody find me. . .

407
00:22:09 --> 00:22:13
Combine these three together and you have something that sounds similar to Panavision.

408
00:22:13 --> 00:22:14
Find me

409
00:22:14 --> 00:22:15
Somebody

410
00:22:15 --> 00:22:17
To-oo love

411
00:22:17 --> 00:22:19
Find me. . .

412
00:22:19 --> 00:22:22
To keep their attention you have to tempt them.

413
00:22:22 --> 00:22:25
In the style of &quot;You can take a break. Have a cup of coffee, eat cake.&quot;

414
00:22:25 --> 00:22:29
When you are in a good mood, grab them and make another 50 million overdubs!

415
00:22:29 --> 00:22:33
Anybody find me somebody to love Somebody to love. . .

416
00:22:33 --> 00:22:36
We called a sausage factory

417
00:22:36 --> 00:22:39
because we were in this so good that we were able to firing.

418
00:22:39 --> 00:22:41
&quot;Day At The Races&quot;

419
00:22:41 --> 00:22:46
as an introduction to the &quot;Night At The Opera&quot; was the obvious ... it introduced a strong note.

420
00:22:46 --> 00:22:49
Those who wanted to have something on Queen could say

421
00:22:49 --> 00:22:51
&quot;It&#39;s not as good as the last record.&quot;

422
00:22:51 --> 00:22:53
Repeatedly press was against them.

423
00:22:53 --> 00:22:56
It is possible that if you become famous too fast,

424
00:22:56 --> 00:23:02
the press is outraged that they did not made you and therefore want to break you.

425
00:23:02 --> 00:23:05
Oh, take my breath away. . .

426
00:23:05 --> 00:23:09
Shortly after I became the manager.

427
00:23:09 --> 00:23:12
I told them one of the most important The principal

428
00:23:12 --> 00:23:15
do not talk to the press without clearing it with me.

429
00:23:15 --> 00:23:19
Opening yourself up to a lot of real to you so they wind up.

430
00:23:19 --> 00:23:23
Once I went lined up with Freddie to The White Elephant on Curzon Street.

431
00:23:23 --> 00:23:28
He hinted: &quot;I did an interview today with David WIGGI with Express.&quot;

432
00:23:28 --> 00:23:33
I said, &quot;I told you! Do not talk to the press without consulting with me.&quot; And he: &quot;Oh, never mind.&quot;

433
00:23:33 --> 00:23:38
I said, &quot;Well, screw you! If you do not acknowledge my rules do not work together.&quot;

434
00:23:38 --> 00:23:40
I got up, I went out and left him alone.

435
00:23:40 --> 00:23:45
I returned home, turn on the TV and the next moment,

436
00:23:45 --> 00:23:47
brick through the window falls.

437
00:23:47 --> 00:23:52
I looked out the window and there was Freddie, hands on hips,

438
00:23:52 --> 00:23:55
&quot;Never leave me alone in the restaurant ...&quot;

439
00:23:55 --> 00:23:57
I said, &quot;You&#39;d better go up&quot;

440
00:23:57 --> 00:23:59
Queen hardly aroused awe

441
00:23:59 --> 00:24:03
at critics in the 70s, when they produced the most hits.

442
00:24:03 --> 00:24:07
And then in the late &#39;70s came the punk,

443
00:24:07 --> 00:24:11
which meant that the standard rock groups were passe.

444
00:24:11 --> 00:24:13
God save the Queen

445
00:24:13 --> 00:24:15
We mean it, man

446
00:24:15 --> 00:24:17
We love our Queen. . .

447
00:24:17 --> 00:24:22
Punk was opposition to the Queen, presented a completely different points of view.

448
00:24:22 --> 00:24:26
It was anarchy on one side and the monarchy on the other side.

449
00:24:26 --> 00:24:30
NME was the most important champion of punk.

450
00:24:30 --> 00:24:33
Musical icons that time

451
00:24:33 --> 00:24:36
were they smack.

452
00:24:36 --> 00:24:40
I thought we should do an interview with Freddie Mercury.

453
00:24:40 --> 00:24:45
I was invited to a house on the property Knightsbridge John Reid

454
00:24:45 --> 00:24:48
I look, and there&#39;s Freddie sitting there on the patio.

455
00:24:48 --> 00:24:51
The house was very sumptuous, I must admit.

456
00:24:51 --> 00:24:54
Here we did an interview with NME

457
00:24:54 --> 00:24:57
and you know, we were very nice to this guy.

458
00:24:57 --> 00:24:59
I had a butler, we gave him lunch.

459
00:24:59 --> 00:25:01
There was valet, there was a bodyguard.

460
00:25:01 --> 00:25:06
Probably there were other people with a whisk made of feathers.

461
00:25:06 --> 00:25:08
Then the story moves on Freddie.

462
00:25:08 --> 00:25:14
Freddie Mercury when he rolled up around the new wave of punk,

463
00:25:14 --> 00:25:21
He focused on ballet.

464
00:25:21 --> 00:25:25
I just felt that there is something in our ballet repertoire.

465
00:25:25 --> 00:25:27
One of the things that he told me was,

466
00:25:27 --> 00:25:31
that his life&#39;s mission is to bring ballet to the masses.

467
00:25:31 --> 00:25:35
When he came out the new issue of NME, Freddie was furious.

468
00:25:35 --> 00:25:37
They called him &quot;a jerk&quot;.

469
00:25:37 --> 00:25:38
Sam would be mad.

470
00:25:38 --> 00:25:42
I think we realized that talking to the press is nonsense.

471
00:25:42 --> 00:25:46
You might as well paint a target on your head and shout &quot;Shoot me.&quot;

472
00:25:46 --> 00:25:48
We all had ups and downs and some restrictions

473
00:25:48 --> 00:25:50
because we know that there are things that than you manage to do

474
00:25:50 --> 00:25:53
but I do not want some asshole critic told me.

475
00:25:53 --> 00:25:55
I love the pose.

476
00:25:55 --> 00:25:57
This press release.

477
00:25:57 --> 00:26:00
We met &quot;The Sex Pistols&quot; in Wessex Studios.

478
00:26:00 --> 00:26:02
And hmm ... I think it was fascinating.

479
00:26:02 --> 00:26:06
Imagine all the elite point under one roof.

480
00:26:06 --> 00:26:09
He came Sid. Sid was a moron ... I mean, really was an idiot.

481
00:26:09 --> 00:26:11
Sid spoke first: &quot;You&#39;re the Freddie Mercury

482
00:26:11 --> 00:26:13
- It you move closer ballet to the masses, right? &quot;

483
00:26:13 --> 00:26:17
I call him &quot;Simon Ferocious (cruel),&quot; did not like him.

484
00:26:17 --> 00:26:19
I said, &quot;Well, what are you gonna do?&quot;

485
00:26:19 --> 00:26:23
I asked him whether he ever saw in the mirror

486
00:26:23 --> 00:26:27
that day because he had such odd mazy on the jacket.

487
00:26:27 --> 00:26:29
Wkurzał him the fact that I could say so.

488
00:26:29 --> 00:26:32
So we left ... I think we survived this test.

489
00:26:32 --> 00:26:36
Well, you&#39;re just 17 All you wanna do is disappear. . .

490
00:26:36 --> 00:26:39
I thought that when we entered in the &quot;News Of The World&quot;

491
00:26:39 --> 00:26:41
we could not turn into a punk band,

492
00:26:41 --> 00:26:44
but we wanted to make it a little easier.

493
00:26:44 --> 00:26:49
We thought that maybe this grandiose form is not very suitable for those times

494
00:26:49 --> 00:26:52
So, to get fit we decided to create something more straightforward.

495
00:26:52 --> 00:26:57
We had his audience, we were confident that they will be there for us

496
00:26:57 --> 00:27:00
and they will not require us to be something totally new for them.

497
00:27:00 --> 00:27:02
Make a revolution?

498
00:27:02 --> 00:27:07
The audience Queen was very open so you never felt constrained.

499
00:27:07 --> 00:27:12
&quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;We Are The Champions&quot; have a very short history.

500
00:27:12 --> 00:27:15
I remember the story as Bingley Hall.

501
00:27:15 --> 00:27:19
We played in the great hall in the Midlands, which was full.

502
00:27:19 --> 00:27:24
All the performances that you love, everything is warm and wet with sweat, we all jump.

503
00:27:24 --> 00:27:26
I sang all the time.

504
00:27:26 --> 00:27:30
She&#39;s a killer queen Gunpowder, gelatine

505
00:27:30 --> 00:27:34
Dynamite with a laser beam Guaranteed to blow your mind. . .

506
00:27:34 --> 00:27:36
In those days it was brand new.

507
00:27:36 --> 00:27:39
There was a concert in which the audience sang rock songs.

508
00:27:39 --> 00:27:42
But on this special occasion, they did not want to stop.

509
00:27:42 --> 00:27:46
And when he descended from the stage to sing to us, &quot;You&#39;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;.

510
00:27:46 --> 00:27:50
I went to bed thinking, &#39;What can the audience? &quot;

511
00:27:50 --> 00:27:55
They are all there or packed. They stomp their feet, clap and sing.

512
00:27:55 --> 00:27:58
So I got up and I had the &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; in my head.

513
00:27:58 --> 00:28:02
We went to Wessex with these ideas.

514
00:28:02 --> 00:28:08
Around lay some planks and thought, &quot;How does that sound?&quot;

515
00:28:08 --> 00:28:14
We recorded it several times to sound the crowd stomping and clapping people,

516
00:28:14 --> 00:28:16
great jumble of people.

517
00:28:16 --> 00:28:19
We will, we will rock you. . .

518
00:28:19 --> 00:28:22
We will, we will rock you. . .

519
00:28:22 --> 00:28:28
I came up with &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and Freddie &quot;We Are The Champions&quot;. He thought very similar.

520
00:28:28 --> 00:28:31
It is mainly a question of participation.

521
00:28:31 --> 00:28:35
I was very calm and I tried to think as a group.

522
00:28:35 --> 00:28:38
I&#39;ve paid my dues

523
00:28:38 --> 00:28:40
Time after time. . .

524
00:28:40 --> 00:28:43
We had no idea that it will become a global sports anthem.

525
00:28:43 --> 00:28:45
Both of them have become - Rock You and Champions.

526
00:28:45 --> 00:28:48
In football or any sport where you have competing teams.

527
00:28:48 --> 00:28:52
Both can sing We Are The Champions, but the performances of rock is only one team.

528
00:28:52 --> 00:28:55
I&#39;ve had my share of sand kicked in my face

529
00:28:55 --> 00:28:57
But I&#39;ve come through. . .

530
00:28:57 --> 00:29:00
This can be perceived as something for the elite.

531
00:29:00 --> 00:29:05
We are the champions, my friends. . .

532
00:29:05 --> 00:29:08
But it is &quot;WE&quot; Community &quot;WE&quot;.

533
00:29:08 --> 00:29:11
But if I were you, before you see, the call that sound ...

534
00:29:11 --> 00:29:13
Call that the sound of real drums.

535
00:29:13 --> 00:29:16
Definitely this is a song about the great, unifying force.

536
00:29:16 --> 00:29:19
We are the champions

537
00:29:19 --> 00:29:22
No time for losers

538
00:29:22 --> 00:29:26
Cos we are the champions. . .

539
00:29:26 --> 00:29:31
Here we have 4 vocal tracks, one for guitar solo, and here is the last bit of solo.

540
00:29:31 --> 00:29:34
We listened to them. It was jednyny way we can do it.

541
00:29:34 --> 00:29:37
Fred was very audacious. It was about the Queen being champion

542
00:29:37 --> 00:29:40
the arrogance with which we were known.

543
00:29:40 --> 00:29:43
We are the champions

544
00:29:43 --> 00:29:46
We are the champions

545
00:29:46 --> 00:29:49
No time for losers

546
00:29:49 --> 00:29:53
Cos we are the champions.

547
00:29:53 --> 00:29:58
Only the Queen could come up with the title &quot;We Are The Champions&quot;. Where is the modesty?

548
00:29:58 --> 00:30:01
Well, there is no such distributions. No modesty, anyway.

549
00:30:01 --> 00:30:05
Nobody cared about how we treated the British press.

550
00:30:05 --> 00:30:07
We had nothing to lose, you know?

551
00:30:07 --> 00:30:10
It&#39;s just a song, is not it? Piss them!

552
00:30:10 --> 00:30:14
Then we did an album, we did music videos, we had a tour of America.

553
00:30:14 --> 00:30:16
One two!

554
00:30:16 --> 00:30:19
It was like watching the Grail rock scene.

555
00:30:19 --> 00:30:22
America meant for us more and more,

556
00:30:22 --> 00:30:25
and when you feel successful in America, you go the whole hog.

557
00:30:25 --> 00:30:28
We looked at what was happening in America.

558
00:30:28 --> 00:30:32
The music was dominated by the relaxed East Coast

559
00:30:32 --> 00:30:35
the type of rock prezentowny by The Eagles, Steely Dan and Fleetwood Mac.

560
00:30:35 --> 00:30:38
and certain Queen wpasowywało not in this form.

561
00:30:38 --> 00:30:42
They were bigger, the more the sophisticated, extravagant than this

562
00:30:42 --> 00:30:44
which appeared in the US at that time.

563
00:30:44 --> 00:30:46
I really do not know what to do with them.

564
00:30:46 --> 00:30:48
Why did you name your band &quot;Queen&quot;

565
00:30:48 --> 00:30:50
since you are 4 guys?

566
00:30:50 --> 00:30:52
It was a mystery.

567
00:30:52 --> 00:30:54
We were together in one car,

568
00:30:54 --> 00:30:59
then together in a limousine, then two in a limo

569
00:30:59 --> 00:31:01
and two in the other, then each separately.

570
00:31:01 --> 00:31:04
This was due to the fact that growing our surroundings

571
00:31:04 --> 00:31:07
it was not about that one did not want to talk with the other.

572
00:31:07 --> 00:31:09
We remained very close to each other,

573
00:31:09 --> 00:31:11
znikaliśmy not in our changing rooms.

574
00:31:11 --> 00:31:15
We found a great room where we could get together to prepare

575
00:31:15 --> 00:31:21
and fool around together. There was a very collegial atmosphere.

576
00:31:21 --> 00:31:23
Guys, it&#39;s called a miracle!

577
00:31:23 --> 00:31:25
I lost my shoe!

578
00:31:25 --> 00:31:27
Oh, if I owe someone something?

579
00:31:27 --> 00:31:29
Dave! do, do, do!

580
00:31:29 --> 00:31:32
I was on the show Queen and I&#39;ve never seen

581
00:31:32 --> 00:31:35
so many luggage, crew and lights.

582
00:31:35 --> 00:31:37
I said, &quot;This is not rock&#39;n&#39;roll, this is the show.

583
00:31:37 --> 00:31:39
&quot;This is the production. This is Broadway.&quot;

584
00:31:39 --> 00:31:44
The participation of the audience was a representation of something very special.

585
00:31:44 --> 00:31:46
I think it has put a little distance between us

586
00:31:46 --> 00:31:50
because it was a great event for two.

587
00:31:50 --> 00:31:53
It was the coronation of Freddie Mercury in this city.

588
00:31:53 --> 00:31:58
We will, we will rock you tonight

589
00:31:58 --> 00:32:01
We will, we will rock you

590
00:32:01 --> 00:32:04
Buddy you&#39;re a young man, hard man, shouting in the street

591
00:32:04 --> 00:32:06
Gonna take on the world someday

592
00:32:06 --> 00:32:09
Mud on your face, big disgrace

593
00:32:09 --> 00:32:12
Waving your banner all over the place

594
00:32:12 --> 00:32:16
We will, we will rock you. . .

595
00:32:16 --> 00:32:18
Always it surprised us that it took so much time

596
00:32:18 --> 00:32:19
success in the United States.

597
00:32:19 --> 00:32:24
It sounds like it happened fast, but not so było- lasted approx. 8 years.

598
00:32:24 --> 00:32:25
Hard we are working on it.

599
00:32:25 --> 00:32:28
I never thought, &quot;We did it!&quot; because it was not.

600
00:32:28 --> 00:32:32
This is, um, a composition of Mercury

601
00:32:32 --> 00:32:33
the &quot;Night At The Opera&quot;

602
00:32:33 --> 00:32:36
This is something about which we recently asked a few people.

603
00:32:36 --> 00:32:39
This is for them. It is: &quot;Love Of My Life&quot;.

604
00:32:39 --> 00:32:43
The route to the USA 1977 was a sell-off. Between,

605
00:32:43 --> 00:32:46
We played two nights at Madison Square Gardens

606
00:32:46 --> 00:32:50
in New York, which is in some way an epoch-making event for the artist.

607
00:32:50 --> 00:32:51
It was a turning point for me.

608
00:32:51 --> 00:32:54
It was obviously a mystical place, a big deal was to play there.

609
00:32:54 --> 00:32:58
And for my parents ... For my dad mostly.

610
00:32:58 --> 00:33:01
My dad was against doing me a rock star.

611
00:33:01 --> 00:33:04
This is important because he helped me to build a guitar.

612
00:33:04 --> 00:33:09
If not for my dad ślęczący on this &quot;home&quot; guitar,

613
00:33:09 --> 00:33:11
probably never I would have found in this place.

614
00:33:11 --> 00:33:14
He really felt that he give up his education.

615
00:33:14 --> 00:33:18
I had high education. So sudden wstąpnienie a rock band

616
00:33:18 --> 00:33:23
probably no future for him was unacceptable.

617
00:33:23 --> 00:33:27
He was literally in tears, he felt that I throw all his life.

618
00:33:27 --> 00:33:32
You do not know what it Means to me. . .

619
00:33:32 --> 00:33:35
Well, but we played at Madison Square Garden, and I said,

620
00:33:35 --> 00:33:38
&quot;See Dad, it&#39;s very important for us to play in America,

621
00:33:38 --> 00:33:42
&quot;This is New York, this is the first time we play in such a place. ARRIVES.&quot;

622
00:33:42 --> 00:33:44
I said, &quot;Dad even recommend the Concorde&quot;

623
00:33:44 --> 00:33:49
You know, it was my dad and my mom. So I came to the concert

624
00:33:49 --> 00:33:53
and I remember to this day, this feeling in the feet

625
00:33:53 --> 00:33:56
that does not really touch the ground, so much electricity was in this place.

626
00:33:56 --> 00:33:59
You do not know what it Means to me. . .

627
00:33:59 --> 00:34:03
Then we thought, &quot;Wow, it really was something&quot;

628
00:34:03 --> 00:34:04
I went to see my dad

629
00:34:04 --> 00:34:10
and he said, &quot;OK.&quot; He said, &quot;OK, now I understand.&quot;

630
00:34:10 --> 00:34:11
Oooh.

631
00:34:11 --> 00:34:13
Thank you, Madison Square Garden.

632
00:34:13 --> 00:34:15
What happened when you went back to London?

633
00:34:15 --> 00:34:18
You are one of the few bands that have not left the UK.

634
00:34:18 --> 00:34:21
In a way, we are a group of English so we will always live there.

635
00:34:21 --> 00:34:24
In London in particular. Always we recorded in England.

636
00:34:24 --> 00:34:29
What does not change the fact that the tax office takes a lot of our money!

637
00:34:29 --> 00:34:31
Then we paid 83%

638
00:34:31 --> 00:34:34
and more, if you have money in the bank,

639
00:34:34 --> 00:34:37
it&#39;s still another 15%, which gives a 98% tax.

640
00:34:37 --> 00:34:41
So we decided that the next album will record in the &quot;Jazz&quot; in France.

641
00:34:41 --> 00:34:43
And so we did. In the tiny village of Great Bear,

642
00:34:43 --> 00:34:46
we started recording this album.

643
00:34:46 --> 00:34:49
Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle

644
00:34:49 --> 00:34:53
I want to ride my bicycle, bicycle, bicycle. . .

645
00:34:53 --> 00:34:58
Found there colors have been drawn to this album.

646
00:34:58 --> 00:34:59
I want to ride my bike. . .

647
00:34:59 --> 00:35:03
We sat ourselves and suddenly the &quot;Tour de France&quot; has traveled before our noses

648
00:35:03 --> 00:35:05
Freddie is inspired to write the &quot;Bicycle...&quot;

649
00:35:05 --> 00:35:08
and for some strange reason it inspired me to write &quot;Fat Bottomed Girls&quot;.

650
00:35:08 --> 00:35:11
Of course, possible that still other things.

651
00:35:11 --> 00:35:13
Unfortunately, we were not there on the recordings.

652
00:35:13 --> 00:35:15
It seemed like a funny idea.

653
00:35:15 --> 00:35:19
We were very disappointed that none of us could be in the video.

654
00:35:19 --> 00:35:23
Since we expelled to England, we could not see!

655
00:35:23 --> 00:35:26
I do not think you&#39;d be able to do today?

656
00:35:26 --> 00:35:29
Yeah, I do not think that today we could do it again.

657
00:35:29 --> 00:35:31
When the time came, we released the album &quot;Jazz&quot;

658
00:35:31 --> 00:35:34
We planned a big party in New Orleans.

659
00:35:34 --> 00:35:38
Oh, you gonna take me home tonight. . .

660
00:35:38 --> 00:35:42
It was the so-called opening of the album,

661
00:35:42 --> 00:35:44
there were lots of girls,

662
00:35:44 --> 00:35:48
was a band from New Orleans, it was the adoption of the highest quality.

663
00:35:48 --> 00:35:53
Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin &#39;world go round. . .

664
00:35:53 --> 00:35:56
With New Orleans united us spiritual bond.

665
00:35:56 --> 00:35:58
Came many of our friends.

666
00:35:58 --> 00:36:00
It was great fun.

667
00:36:00 --> 00:36:02
When I opened the door to my apartment,

668
00:36:02 --> 00:36:05
on the bed lay a whole box of Dom Perignon.

669
00:36:05 --> 00:36:07
?? And it was downhill from there ??.

670
00:36:07 --> 00:36:10
Heap big woman, you made a bad boy out of me. . .

671
00:36:10 --> 00:36:12
I remember that I felt nienajlepiej next day.

672
00:36:12 --> 00:36:20
There were various performances. There was this guy not very tall,

673
00:36:20 --> 00:36:22
who was lying under the meat.

674
00:36:22 --> 00:36:26
When he was asked what he was doing, he replied, &quot;I lie under the meat.&quot;

675
00:36:26 --> 00:36:31
He was covered with slices of meat and, um,

676
00:36:31 --> 00:36:37
chopped liver, and things like that. He was not seen.

677
00:36:37 --> 00:36:40
So when people came to the table

678
00:36:40 --> 00:36:43
and they reached for the meat,

679
00:36:43 --> 00:36:45
It was moving in a way.

680
00:36:45 --> 00:36:47
And it was his art!

681
00:36:47 --> 00:36:53
Tonight, I&#39;m gonna have myself a real good time

682
00:36:53 --> 00:36:55
I feel ali-ii-ive. . .

683
00:36:55 --> 00:36:58
It was not pretense, we actually lived the life of a rock band.

684
00:36:58 --> 00:37:00
Something like living on the edge.

685
00:37:00 --> 00:37:04
Turning inside out, yeah

686
00:37:04 --> 00:37:09
Floating around in ecstasy

687
00:37:09 --> 00:37:12
So do not stop me now. . .

688
00:37:12 --> 00:37:15
&quot;Do not Stop Me Now&quot; is a completely different story.

689
00:37:15 --> 00:37:18
It has become one of the most famous songs of Queen.

690
00:37:18 --> 00:37:21
I&#39;m a shooting star leaping through the sky like a tiger

691
00:37:21 --> 00:37:24
Defying the laws of gravity

692
00:37:24 --> 00:37:28
I&#39;m a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva

693
00:37:28 --> 00:37:33
I&#39;m gonna go, go, go, there&#39;s no stopping me

694
00:37:33 --> 00:37:35
I&#39;m burning through the sky, yeah. . .

695
00:37:35 --> 00:37:37
It&#39;s a song about unrestrained joy.

696
00:37:37 --> 00:37:38
. .Mr Fahrenheit

697
00:37:38 --> 00:37:40
I&#39;m traveling at the speed of light

698
00:37:40 --> 00:37:42
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you. . .

699
00:37:42 --> 00:37:44
Once quoted to me, I said that I do not like this song.

700
00:37:44 --> 00:37:48
I like it but I have about him mixed feelings

701
00:37:48 --> 00:37:51
so that in some way represents our separation.

702
00:37:51 --> 00:37:52
It was really the world Freddie

703
00:37:52 --> 00:37:55
by reflection of what is actually passed.

704
00:37:55 --> 00:37:57
Freddie entered the gay scene of New York

705
00:37:57 --> 00:38:00
David Attenborough doing films about wild animals.

706
00:38:00 --> 00:38:04
It was to show his attitude of &quot;Hey-hey!&quot;.

707
00:38:04 --> 00:38:06
It was a place called The Anvil,

708
00:38:06 --> 00:38:10
which invented a new way of using human organs!

709
00:38:10 --> 00:38:10
Never it did not surprised.

710
00:38:10 --> 00:38:13
He always wanted to participate in everything,

711
00:38:13 --> 00:38:15
it is as if he was pracownimiem social assistance.

712
00:38:15 --> 00:38:17
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you. . .

713
00:38:17 --> 00:38:20
It seems to me that I want everything to shove the maximum number of lives

714
00:38:20 --> 00:38:25
and fun, and the occasion yourself to have fun.

715
00:38:25 --> 00:38:29
If you want to have a good time, just give me a call

716
00:38:29 --> 00:38:31
Do not stop me now Cos I&#39;m having a good time.

717
00:38:31 --> 00:38:33
Do not stop me now Yes, I&#39;m having a good time

718
00:38:33 --> 00:38:37
I do not wanna stop at all

719
00:38:37 --> 00:38:39
The album &quot;Jazz&quot; was not a total failure,

720
00:38:39 --> 00:38:41
he got to the place 6th on the list.

721
00:38:41 --> 00:38:45
But &#39;Do not Stop Me Now&#39; is a big hit in England today,

722
00:38:45 --> 00:38:47
in America he lasted only 80s.

723
00:38:47 --> 00:38:50
Review of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was very unpleasant.

724
00:38:50 --> 00:38:54
and it showed that the Queen is not respected.

725
00:38:54 --> 00:38:56
We were intrigued by the title.

726
00:38:56 --> 00:38:59
Why rock band named their album &quot;Jazz&quot;?

727
00:38:59 --> 00:39:01
There were a couple of good songs,

728
00:39:01 --> 00:39:03
but there were also some weaker.

729
00:39:03 --> 00:39:05
It is possible that the Queen was seen

730
00:39:05 --> 00:39:09
as an Indian dish that cool down in the fridge.

731
00:39:09 --> 00:39:12
What will happen in &#39;79 for the Queen?

732
00:39:12 --> 00:39:15
We&#39;re going to do more recordings and more concerts.

733
00:39:15 --> 00:39:18
It&#39;s hard to say, it was a tough year.

734
00:39:18 --> 00:39:21
We have heard that there is a great studio called Musicland

735
00:39:21 --> 00:39:25
in Munich and we have heard that there is a great engineer Mack.

736
00:39:25 --> 00:39:28
I had the idea to

737
00:39:28 --> 00:39:31
fall into the studio without any ideas or with few

738
00:39:31 --> 00:39:34
and just do a song with shreds.

739
00:39:34 --> 00:39:36
&quot;What have you got?&quot; &quot;Well, I got it.&quot;

740
00:39:36 --> 00:39:38
This thing called love. . .

741
00:39:38 --> 00:39:45
The first was the &quot;Crazy Little Thing&quot;. Fred wrote the song in the bath within approx. 10 minutes.

742
00:39:45 --> 00:39:49
Then he said, &quot;Tell them that I come and I have to immediately go into the studio.&quot;

743
00:39:49 --> 00:39:51
Like a baby In the cradlle ALLLL night. . .

744
00:39:51 --> 00:39:54
It took place very quickly, it took little time

745
00:39:54 --> 00:39:58
and we released it, and the best was:

746
00:39:58 --> 00:40:02
&quot;Quick! Let&#39;s finish this before the coming of Brian otherwise come down to us here any longer!&quot;

747
00:40:02 --> 00:40:05
There goes my baby

748
00:40:05 --> 00:40:08
She knows how to rock and roll

749
00:40:08 --> 00:40:10
She drives me crazy

750
00:40:10 --> 00:40:11
She gives me hot and cold fever

751
00:40:11 --> 00:40:12
She leaves me in a cold, cold sweat. . .

752
00:40:12 --> 00:40:15
It was the number 1 everywhere in America.

753
00:40:15 --> 00:40:17
Billboard, Cashbox and Record World, I think so.

754
00:40:17 --> 00:40:18
Still we recorded,

755
00:40:18 --> 00:40:20
even not released a good album,

756
00:40:20 --> 00:40:23
and once strolling around Munich, someone came and said,

757
00:40:23 --> 00:40:26
&quot;It goes to No. 1 in the USA.&quot; For we &quot;jeee! More drinks!&quot;

758
00:40:26 --> 00:40:30
So &quot;Crazy Little Thing ...&quot; totally floored the American list.

759
00:40:30 --> 00:40:33
But it was not easy then to keep up.

760
00:40:33 --> 00:40:36
&quot;Play The Game&quot; remained outside the Top 40 in the US.

761
00:40:36 --> 00:40:39
But the next single, was quite different.

762
00:40:39 --> 00:40:42
The thing I really liked the Queen was that they were 4 individuals,

763
00:40:42 --> 00:40:46
which created new songs and new texts,

764
00:40:46 --> 00:40:50
including bassist John Deacon.

765
00:40:50 --> 00:40:53
I always wanted to do something that will be more disco,

766
00:40:53 --> 00:40:54
which in those days was very shoddy.

767
00:40:54 --> 00:40:57
That is to say, funk did not exist then in the dictionaries.

768
00:40:57 --> 00:41:02
John strongly pushed us toward funk.

769
00:41:02 --> 00:41:04
John forced Roger to play

770
00:41:04 --> 00:41:07
drums wrapped with tape, which Roger really did not like.

771
00:41:07 --> 00:41:09
Roger hated these drums on an empty sound.

772
00:41:09 --> 00:41:12
I did not want to create dance music. It was not my job.

773
00:41:12 --> 00:41:16
Another one bites the dust. . .

774
00:41:16 --> 00:41:20
Freddie came into it very deeply, Freddie would sing it while would not bleed.

775
00:41:20 --> 00:41:24
because he was so stubborn that it sounded like John wanted ...

776
00:41:24 --> 00:41:29
I do not know how you want to call it but it sounds more like music than black and white.

777
00:41:29 --> 00:41:32
How do you think I&#39;m going to get along without you when you&#39;re gone?

778
00:41:32 --> 00:41:36
You took me for everything that I had and kicked me out of my home

779
00:41:36 --> 00:41:40
Are you happy? Are you satisfied? How long can you stand the heat?

780
00:41:40 --> 00:41:44
Out of the doorway the bullets whistle to the sound of the beat. . .

781
00:41:44 --> 00:41:48
Michael came in for a few performances to the Forum in LA.

782
00:41:48 --> 00:41:50
He loved Freddie. He kept saying:

783
00:41:50 --> 00:41:55
&quot;You have to let that song.&quot; I was not particularly impressed,

784
00:41:55 --> 00:41:58
So I said, &quot;You&#39;re kidding, it will never be a single.&quot;

785
00:41:58 --> 00:41:59
Another one bites the dust. . .

786
00:41:59 --> 00:42:01
&quot;Another One Bites The Dust&quot; was never considered to be a single.

787
00:42:01 --> 00:42:02
I barely made it an album!

788
00:42:02 --> 00:42:07
It went to the radio to people who did not even know this band.

789
00:42:07 --> 00:42:08
Ah, take it!

790
00:42:08 --> 00:42:12
Oddly enough, the recording came to be known by the black audience.

791
00:42:12 --> 00:42:15
One station in New York is picked up,

792
00:42:15 --> 00:42:17
We are thinking that we are a black band,

793
00:42:17 --> 00:42:21
and I played so many times that it became a hit.

794
00:42:21 --> 00:42:23
It was number 1 for 9 different lists.

795
00:42:23 --> 00:42:25
Even the lists country! It&#39;s ridiculous.

796
00:42:25 --> 00:42:27
This thing has sold 3 million.

797
00:42:27 --> 00:42:30
She was on the Hot 100 for 31 weeks.

798
00:42:30 --> 00:42:32
When competition boxing opponent fell on the boards,

799
00:42:32 --> 00:42:34
You heard &quot;Another One Bites The Dust&quot;.

800
00:42:34 --> 00:42:36
It became the anthem of triumph.

801
00:42:36 --> 00:42:38
I still think it&#39;s the greatest song I released.

802
00:42:38 --> 00:42:40
Another one bites the dust, yeah!

803
00:42:40 --> 00:42:43
People bemoaned his fingers - &quot;You are bad!&quot;

804
00:42:43 --> 00:42:46
&quot;What does it mean?&quot; &quot;It means that you are good!&quot;

805
00:42:46 --> 00:42:47
Another one bites the dust

806
00:42:47 --> 00:42:51
Hey, gonna get you too, another one bites the dust. . .

807
00:42:51 --> 00:42:53
If you report the success in America you have achieved everything.

808
00:42:53 --> 00:42:55
Then we have become the largest group in the world.

809
00:42:55 --> 00:42:57
This is a very fleeting moment because as soon as someone comes

810
00:42:57 --> 00:43:01
and claims the title. But then, in a sense władaliśmy world.

811
00:43:01 --> 00:43:04
Quotations sales show that people wanted Queen

812
00:43:04 --> 00:43:05
even if the press does not want to.

813
00:43:05 --> 00:43:07
Now, looking at it, I would say that the Queen was never in fashion.

814
00:43:07 --> 00:43:08
I do not think we were ever fashionable group.

815
00:43:08 --> 00:43:09
Maybe it was our advantage,

816
00:43:09 --> 00:43:12
do not we have a fad.

817
00:43:12 --> 00:43:15
Just as we have become a popular It is common for some of the nose!

818
00:43:15 --> 00:43:18
www.NapiProjekt.pl - a new quality of subtitling. Subtitles have been specially tailored to your version of the movie.

819
00:43:18 --> 00:43:19
Fred, how do you feel playing and singing

820
00:43:19 --> 00:43:21
in front of 200,000 people? You have not done!

821
00:43:21 --> 00:43:24
Each song were able to steal retracted.

822
00:43:24 --> 00:43:27
I really like the Queen but do not want to die living in a quartet.

823
00:43:27 --> 00:43:30
The band was on the verge of collapse.

824
00:43:30 --> 00:43:32
I think he had an idea that was not so hopeless.

825
00:43:32 --> 00:43:35
He said: &quot;I&#39;ll come back and finish this,&quot; and never returned.

826
00:43:35 --> 00:43:37
It was our last chance.

827
00:43:37 --> 00:43:41
Because it seems to me that when you&#39;re on top you can just fall down.

828
00:43:41 --> 00:43:44
Not only wanted to conquer America, we wanted the whole world, you know?

829
00:43:44 --> 00:43:46
South America is something I always thought.

830
00:43:46 --> 00:43:51
We heard rumors that we were ... the biggest event that took place in Argentina

831
00:43:51 --> 00:43:54
and Brazil so there were requests us to come.

832
00:43:54 --> 00:43:57
They said: &quot;You can play on our stadiums.&quot;

833
00:43:57 --> 00:43:58
We answered: &#39;kidding me. &quot;

834
00:43:58 --> 00:44:01
Argentina remained then under the dictatorship,

835
00:44:01 --> 00:44:04
so we had to negotiate with the general, who said:

836
00:44:04 --> 00:44:07
&quot;How can I allow 50,000 young people find themselves on stadaionie?&quot;

837
00:44:07 --> 00:44:08
&quot;When I can not control them?&quot;

838
00:44:08 --> 00:44:11
&quot;What if someone suddenly shouts &#39;Viva Peron&#39;

839
00:44:11 --> 00:44:14
&quot;During the concert and riots erupt?&quot;

840
00:44:14 --> 00:44:17
So I tried to explain to him that this is not

841
00:44:17 --> 00:44:21
fight gladiators in Rome, it would be a panacea for the people,

842
00:44:21 --> 00:44:23
never before they did not have,

843
00:44:23 --> 00:44:25
This will be an unusual experience for them.

844
00:44:25 --> 00:44:27
So did we all prepare

845
00:44:27 --> 00:44:30
God only knows how many jumbo jet&#39;ów motored our luggage.

846
00:44:30 --> 00:44:32
When we arrived in Buenos Aires, while unpacking

847
00:44:32 --> 00:44:35
we saw all the boxes used missiles, then we thought:

848
00:44:35 --> 00:44:37
&quot;Well, actually we are in a completely different world.&quot;

849
00:44:37 --> 00:44:41
We were looking bodyguard for Freddie. He came one guy

850
00:44:41 --> 00:44:45
and its main recommendation was to kill 212 people.

851
00:44:45 --> 00:44:47
During the trip we were very frightened.

852
00:44:47 --> 00:44:50
We drove the highway, all the way against the current,

853
00:44:50 --> 00:44:55
and in front of us rode the big jeeps with soldiers brandishing guns

854
00:44:55 --> 00:44:59
so that car approaching from the opposite sliding down the side.

855
00:44:59 --> 00:45:01
When stuck in traffic, one of the policemen

856
00:45:01 --> 00:45:02
exited his head through the roof

857
00:45:02 --> 00:45:05
and I started shooting in the air after it to make the journey.

858
00:45:05 --> 00:45:07
The hair bristled on his head.

859
00:45:07 --> 00:45:08
Hello, amigos.

860
00:45:08 --> 00:45:11
Fred how you feel playing and singing in front of 200, 000 people?

861
00:45:11 --> 00:45:13
You have not done!

862
00:45:13 --> 00:45:16
I remember that first night nervous.

863
00:45:16 --> 00:45:20
On the first floor was located approx. 80, 000. We were in what can be called the shelter

864
00:45:20 --> 00:45:22
Normally there probably occupy the players during the match.

865
00:45:22 --> 00:45:24
All the windows were broken. I remember thinking:

866
00:45:24 --> 00:45:28
This is ... You had to have the guts to go out there.

867
00:45:28 --> 00:45:29
Hello, Sao Paulo!

868
00:45:29 --> 00:45:31
Get your party gown

869
00:45:31 --> 00:45:32
Get your pigtail down

870
00:45:32 --> 00:45:33
Get your heart beating, baby

871
00:45:33 --> 00:45:34
Get your timing right

872
00:45:34 --> 00:45:36
I got my act all tight

873
00:45:36 --> 00:45:39
It&#39;s gotta be tonight My little school babe

874
00:45:39 --> 00:45:40
Your momma says you do not

875
00:45:40 --> 00:45:42
Your daddy says you will not And I&#39;m boiling up inside. . .

876
00:45:42 --> 00:45:44
They knew all the songs. These people do not speak English

877
00:45:44 --> 00:45:46
but able to sing all the songs of Queen

878
00:45:46 --> 00:45:49
so it&#39;s obviously very devoted fans - went crazy at a concert.

879
00:45:49 --> 00:45:52
Tie your mother down Tie your mother down

880
00:45:52 --> 00:45:54
Lock your daddy out of doors I do not need him nosing around

881
00:45:54 --> 00:45:57
Tie your mother down Tie your mother down

882
00:45:57 --> 00:46:01
Give me all your love tonight

883
00:46:01 --> 00:46:03
Tonight. . .

884
00:46:03 --> 00:46:04
This required a big ego

885
00:46:04 --> 00:46:07
and a willingness

886
00:46:07 --> 00:46:09
being in the limelight, being the center of attention.

887
00:46:09 --> 00:46:12
A Freddie directly flourished on the big arenas.

888
00:46:12 --> 00:46:13
Let&#39;s do it in the tempo.

889
00:46:13 --> 00:46:15
When we finished in Argentina and Brazil,

890
00:46:15 --> 00:46:17
We decided to go back to the studio

891
00:46:17 --> 00:46:20
They, of course, bought a studio in Montreux.

892
00:46:20 --> 00:46:25
Mountain Studios was in the casino near the lake in Montreux.

893
00:46:25 --> 00:46:28
When I first arrived it was the best studio in Europe.

894
00:46:28 --> 00:46:31
We were in the studio in Montreux and David Bowie lived nearby.

895
00:46:31 --> 00:46:33
I think if we left something to eat or drink

896
00:46:33 --> 00:46:35
and finally we ended up in the studio

897
00:46:35 --> 00:46:36
the earnest desire to create something.

898
00:46:36 --> 00:46:38
Bored so only after przeskakiwaliśmy

899
00:46:38 --> 00:46:40
trackach and suddenly thought:

900
00:46:40 --> 00:46:43
&quot;Why not look at what comes out when we write the spur of the moment?&quot;

901
00:46:43 --> 00:46:47
And this pressure that His Majesty David is next

902
00:46:47 --> 00:46:51
So nobody wanted to go out on a clam without ideas.

903
00:46:51 --> 00:46:53
Deacy came up with this riff - dun dun dun dun dun de de.

904
00:46:53 --> 00:46:55
He played it over and over again, without interruption.

905
00:46:55 --> 00:46:58
We went for pizza and forgot about it.

906
00:46:58 --> 00:47:02
Completely fell out of his head! When we came back to myself that przypomiałem.

907
00:47:02 --> 00:47:05
Of course we always played together, and now we

908
00:47:05 --> 00:47:08
this new guy who can still something invented and invented.

909
00:47:08 --> 00:47:10
Until David came up to add clapping and snapping

910
00:47:10 --> 00:47:12
and just created this song.

911
00:47:12 --> 00:47:13
David was then very keen on the job.

912
00:47:13 --> 00:47:15
I think he had an idea in his head

913
00:47:15 --> 00:47:18
This is usually a very difficult process and in the end someone has to remove the side

914
00:47:18 --> 00:47:20
and this time I was removed but it is not like me.

915
00:47:20 --> 00:47:24
Pressure pushing down on me

916
00:47:24 --> 00:47:25
Pressing down on you

917
00:47:25 --> 00:47:27
No man ask for

918
00:47:27 --> 00:47:28
under pressure

919
00:47:28 --> 00:47:31
That burns a building down

920
00:47:31 --> 00:47:33
Splits a family in two

921
00:47:33 --> 00:47:34
Puts people on streets. . .

922
00:47:34 --> 00:47:36
As for the vocals it is such that one is somewhere closed

923
00:47:36 --> 00:47:38
and I can not hear what the other one sings

924
00:47:38 --> 00:47:40
They can sing everything that they come to mind.

925
00:47:40 --> 00:47:41
It never rains but it pours

926
00:47:41 --> 00:47:43
Um ba-ba bey. . .

927
00:47:43 --> 00:47:47
Fred did his bum-didder-dup and bits-and-pieces (?)

928
00:47:47 --> 00:47:49
I saw the corner of my eye,

929
00:47:49 --> 00:47:52
that David pulls his head to listen.

930
00:47:52 --> 00:47:55
When Fred came out, David sat down and Freddie was impressed

931
00:47:55 --> 00:47:57
as he began to mix and match what was previously recorded.

932
00:47:57 --> 00:47:58
. .This World is about

933
00:47:58 --> 00:48:01
Watching some good friends screaming let me out

934
00:48:01 --> 00:48:04
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high, high

935
00:48:04 --> 00:48:08
Pressure on people People on streets. . .

936
00:48:08 --> 00:48:10
Fred asked, &quot;What are you doing with this?&quot;

937
00:48:10 --> 00:48:14
He replied, &quot;It seems as easy as you stand at the door and listen to what you&#39;re doing.&quot;

938
00:48:14 --> 00:48:17
A Freddie turned around and, &quot;What the hell?&quot;

939
00:48:17 --> 00:48:22
Cos love&#39;s dry an old fashioned word

940
00:48:22 --> 00:48:25
And love dares you

941
00:48:25 --> 00:48:31
To care for the people on the edge of the night

942
00:48:31 --> 00:48:34
And love dares you

943
00:48:34 --> 00:48:36
That change our way of

944
00:48:36 --> 00:48:39
Caring about ourselves

945
00:48:39 --> 00:48:42
This is our last dance. . .

946
00:48:42 --> 00:48:45
The result is very good but it seems to me that it was a difficult experience,

947
00:48:45 --> 00:48:48
because everyone walks in the other direction.

948
00:48:48 --> 00:48:49
Under pressure. . .

949
00:48:49 --> 00:48:52
Under Pressure, David Bowie, the band, I,

950
00:48:52 --> 00:48:55
I do not think it right common.

951
00:48:55 --> 00:48:56
Pressure.

952
00:48:56 --> 00:48:58
Too bad all in all ...

953
00:48:58 --> 00:49:02
I think it was great, we could have done a lot of great things.

954
00:49:02 --> 00:49:06
Well here we place a total change of life for all of us.

955
00:49:06 --> 00:49:09
We returned to Munich to make a new album

956
00:49:09 --> 00:49:12
and it really seems to me that it all started then spoil.

957
00:49:12 --> 00:49:14
In fact, it is a very gloomy place.

958
00:49:14 --> 00:49:19
This is a studio in the basement of the tower of the hotel.

959
00:49:19 --> 00:49:19
It is quite depressing.

960
00:49:19 --> 00:49:24
Many people here committing suicide by jumping from the top

961
00:49:24 --> 00:49:26
this very building. It is for this known.

962
00:49:26 --> 00:49:29
We did not know about it before I had arrived so we bounced a little.

963
00:49:29 --> 00:49:32
Then we were very drobiazowi when it comes to recording

964
00:49:32 --> 00:49:33
So we sat there for months.

965
00:49:33 --> 00:49:36
After olbrzmim success of &quot;Another One Bites The Dust&quot;

966
00:49:36 --> 00:49:40
the idea was that we would do something more dance.

967
00:49:40 --> 00:49:41
It was not my idea.

968
00:49:41 --> 00:49:43
Mainly ambient Freddie

969
00:49:43 --> 00:49:46
not to mention such names as Paul Prenter, for example,

970
00:49:46 --> 00:49:50
hated guitars and the fact that Brian was old-fashioned.

971
00:49:50 --> 00:49:53
Paul Prenter was personal assistant to Freddie.

972
00:49:53 --> 00:49:56
He had on him a very bad influence,

973
00:49:56 --> 00:49:58
particularly with regard to the band.

974
00:49:58 --> 00:50:00
He wanted us sounded

975
00:50:00 --> 00:50:02
as the music played on gay clubs.

976
00:50:02 --> 00:50:03
And I do not want to.

977
00:50:03 --> 00:50:04
Back chat back chat

978
00:50:04 --> 00:50:06
Criticizing all you see

979
00:50:06 --> 00:50:07
Back chat back chat

980
00:50:07 --> 00:50:09
Analysing what I say. . .

981
00:50:09 --> 00:50:11
This resulted in the emergence of many tensions

982
00:50:11 --> 00:50:14
among four people on so hard characters.

983
00:50:14 --> 00:50:18
Everyone had their say and the criticism was constructive but then it became personal.

984
00:50:18 --> 00:50:20
It is obvious!

985
00:50:20 --> 00:50:23
It was an emotional roller coaster.

986
00:50:23 --> 00:50:26
I think less and less time spent in the studio.

987
00:50:26 --> 00:50:29
You get up at 3 o&#39;clock in the morning, you eat breakfast,

988
00:50:29 --> 00:50:32
some are working, you eat dinner

989
00:50:32 --> 00:50:36
Then one of the guys starts to mix drinks. . .

990
00:50:36 --> 00:50:38
and then other things. . .ahem, the sections.

991
00:50:38 --> 00:50:39
Give me. . .

992
00:50:39 --> 00:50:41
I&#39;m not saying that cocaine and other drugs

993
00:50:41 --> 00:50:44
or promiscuous women had something to do with it.

994
00:50:44 --> 00:50:45
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge! (Wink, withholding elbow)

995
00:50:45 --> 00:50:48
Body, body

996
00:50:48 --> 00:50:52
Give me your body. . .

997
00:50:52 --> 00:50:55
At the end it was a very grueling.

998
00:50:55 --> 00:50:58
Do not talk, do not talk, do not talk

999
00:50:58 --> 00:50:59
Baby, do not talk. . .

1000
00:50:59 --> 00:51:02
I do not know if I can say ... Yes, I think I can say it.

1001
00:51:02 --> 00:51:06
All wpędziliśmy a great emotional troubles in Munich

1002
00:51:06 --> 00:51:11
and Freddie was no exception, had deep problems which could not cope

1003
00:51:11 --> 00:51:13
and most of the time was miserable.

1004
00:51:13 --> 00:51:17
Give me your body. . .

1005
00:51:17 --> 00:51:21
He was dragged into the places that probably were not the best for him.

1006
00:51:21 --> 00:51:22
I think we all felt

1007
00:51:22 --> 00:51:25
and we knew that it is in danger.

1008
00:51:25 --> 00:51:28
Give me, yeah

1009
00:51:28 --> 00:51:31
Your body. . .

1010
00:51:31 --> 00:51:33
Definitely I have seen the transformation of Freddie ...

1011
00:51:33 --> 00:51:34
Do not talk. . .

1012
00:51:34 --> 00:51:37
. .in club Heaven in 1983.

1013
00:51:37 --> 00:51:39
I told him, &quot;Have you changed behavior

1014
00:51:39 --> 00:51:42
&#39;Due to the&#39; new disease &#39;?&#39;, Which had not yet have a name.

1015
00:51:42 --> 00:51:45
And he theatrical shrug said:

1016
00:51:45 --> 00:51:50
&quot;The sun, my attitude is &#39;bang it&#39;, I do everything with everyone.&quot;

1017
00:51:50 --> 00:51:53
If someone created a list of the king of rock&#39;n&#39;roll,

1018
00:51:53 --> 00:51:54
Queen would be at the top.

1019
00:51:54 --> 00:51:56
Now the Queen is back on the road

1020
00:51:56 --> 00:51:58
and possibly facing the biggest challenge so far.

1021
00:51:58 --> 00:52:03
You must know that recently developed some new sound ...

1022
00:52:03 --> 00:52:06
... And if something comes out, we&#39;re going to create some new songs

1023
00:52:06 --> 00:52:09
style black funk, or whatever you call there.

1024
00:52:09 --> 00:52:11
Boards do not sell now as ever

1025
00:52:11 --> 00:52:12
What all very uncertain.

1026
00:52:12 --> 00:52:14
I do not like everything we do.

1027
00:52:14 --> 00:52:16
I like many things that we do, but not all.

1028
00:52:16 --> 00:52:19
It depends on all four of us,

1029
00:52:19 --> 00:52:22
the music we listen to each of us and what everyone writes songs.

1030
00:52:22 --> 00:52:25
So it is possible that overlook such songs that you happen to be not like.

1031
00:52:25 --> 00:52:26
I could mention a few!

1032
00:52:26 --> 00:52:29
Well, &quot;Hot Space&quot; for the Queen was really a disaster.

1033
00:52:29 --> 00:52:32
Do not fit the more hardcore fans of Queen,

1034
00:52:32 --> 00:52:35
who appeared in concert with the banner &quot;disco sucks&quot;.

1035
00:52:35 --> 00:52:39
It&#39;s just a stupid album, and people are so excited. It means...

1036
00:52:39 --> 00:52:41
The band ...

1037
00:52:41 --> 00:52:43
She was really on the verge of collapse.

1038
00:52:43 --> 00:52:46
I think we had a couple of meetings about obgadania few issues

1039
00:52:46 --> 00:52:47
where in fact we were together etc, etc.

1040
00:52:47 --> 00:52:50
What do you do when you&#39;re a member of the internationally renowned

1041
00:52:50 --> 00:52:52
rock band but want to blow away the pair of creativity

1042
00:52:52 --> 00:52:54
which does not fit &#39;image of the band?

1043
00:52:54 --> 00:52:56
Our next guest, who will answer to this question is Roger Taylor.

1044
00:52:56 --> 00:53:00
I just recently he released some of that steam and recorded his second solo album,

1045
00:53:00 --> 00:53:01
Strange Frontier. Let&#39;s see.

1046
00:53:01 --> 00:53:04
Sometimes I feel like a man on fire

1047
00:53:04 --> 00:53:06
Sometimes I feel like a man possessed

1048
00:53:06 --> 00:53:10
Sometimes I wanna burn down this crazy town. . .

1049
00:53:10 --> 00:53:11
I think we decided that we need a break.

1050
00:53:11 --> 00:53:15
Queen boosted us toward the world but also limited us

1051
00:53:15 --> 00:53:19
into a small space. We worked only with each other but not with other great musicians.

1052
00:53:19 --> 00:53:22
I landed in LA and when I got up in the morning

1053
00:53:22 --> 00:53:25
podzwoniłem after a couple of buddies and asked: &quot;Why not do something together?&quot;

1054
00:53:25 --> 00:53:27
And it led to the &quot;Star Fleet Project&quot;.

1055
00:53:27 --> 00:53:29
Star fleet, star fleet

1056
00:53:29 --> 00:53:32
Star fleet, star fleet. . .

1057
00:53:32 --> 00:53:34
In a sense, we were all ready, no doubt.

1058
00:53:34 --> 00:53:36
We took care of their own affairs,

1059
00:53:36 --> 00:53:39
it allowed us to freshen up a little bit so we were ready to go back to the studio.

1060
00:53:39 --> 00:53:42
This is a difficult time for us, before us a very difficult test

1061
00:53:42 --> 00:53:47
We are in this business for 12 years and it is hard to continue.

1062
00:53:47 --> 00:53:48
&quot;The Works&quot; was our next album.

1063
00:53:48 --> 00:53:50
We thought that we want to be somewhere where it&#39;s nice and warm

1064
00:53:50 --> 00:53:52
and not in glacial Munich.

1065
00:53:52 --> 00:53:55
So I went to LA really made sense.

1066
00:53:55 --> 00:53:57
I think &quot;The Works&quot; actually came back on old tracks.

1067
00:53:57 --> 00:53:59
There skomplikowane music connection.

1068
00:53:59 --> 00:54:02
They had one room in the studio, they had three or four.

1069
00:54:02 --> 00:54:05
Studio B, Studio C, D Studio, Studio E.

1070
00:54:05 --> 00:54:06
But it was good

1071
00:54:06 --> 00:54:08
I allowed anyone to create their own songs.

1072
00:54:08 --> 00:54:10
In the early years it was mainly Brian and Freddie

1073
00:54:10 --> 00:54:12
who wrote most of the songs

1074
00:54:12 --> 00:54:14
but for the last five years

1075
00:54:14 --> 00:54:17
Roger and I started to turn more and more.

1076
00:54:17 --> 00:54:20
I thought that the secret weapon is John Deacon

1077
00:54:20 --> 00:54:22
always he fell into ideas on wielkiech hits.

1078
00:54:22 --> 00:54:24
He had the song &quot;I Want To Break Free&quot;

1079
00:54:24 --> 00:54:27
and it was practically finished off the big hole in the middle.

1080
00:54:27 --> 00:54:31
That is to say, John did not want to guitar solos, so he asked Fred Mandela,

1081
00:54:31 --> 00:54:33
keybordzisty genius to something poimprowizował

1082
00:54:33 --> 00:54:36
with the main melody and Fred did it brilliantly.

1083
00:54:36 --> 00:54:39
You know, like all of their songs cried &quot;no sytezatorów&quot;

1084
00:54:39 --> 00:54:41
and then I showed up, and like a gull

1085
00:54:41 --> 00:54:43
I added synthesizers to everything.

1086
00:54:43 --> 00:54:46
I was not very happy but I gave them a blessing,

1087
00:54:46 --> 00:54:47
that was the deal.

1088
00:54:47 --> 00:54:49
Differences in writing the words have changed.

1089
00:54:49 --> 00:54:52
I think that over time ...

1090
00:54:52 --> 00:54:54
in writing, we were completely equal.

1091
00:54:54 --> 00:54:58
Roger came up with something like &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot; and it was perfect.

1092
00:54:58 --> 00:55:02
In one Sunday evening my son Felix came to me, was then very young

1093
00:55:02 --> 00:55:05
and simply he began: &quot;Ah, radio, caca&quot;

1094
00:55:05 --> 00:55:06
because it is in the middle of french.

1095
00:55:06 --> 00:55:09
I thought all in all it&#39;s even cool.

1096
00:55:09 --> 00:55:11
So poskladalem whole melody

1097
00:55:11 --> 00:55:13
and I showed Freddie, whom I liked.

1098
00:55:13 --> 00:55:15
He took it to another room, where Fred and I have worked on

1099
00:55:15 --> 00:55:16
the syntezacją speech.

1100
00:55:16 --> 00:55:18
All we hear is

1101
00:55:18 --> 00:55:19
Radio ga ga

1102
00:55:19 --> 00:55:21
Radio goo goo

1103
00:55:21 --> 00:55:22
Radio ga ga. . .

1104
00:55:22 --> 00:55:25
If you listen to it a few times you hear &quot;radio caca.&quot;

1105
00:55:25 --> 00:55:26
Radio ga ga

1106
00:55:26 --> 00:55:28
Radio ga ga. . .

1107
00:55:28 --> 00:55:30
Radio Ga Ga Queen brought back.

1108
00:55:30 --> 00:55:32
Radio. . .

1109
00:55:32 --> 00:55:33
It came out of the rock.

1110
00:55:33 --> 00:55:35
Radio Ga Ga merged the best elements

1111
00:55:35 --> 00:55:36
&#39;70 from &#39;80.

1112
00:55:36 --> 00:55:38
And it was the power of the Queen of The Works.

1113
00:55:38 --> 00:55:41
It was a very significant hit, although did not get even

1114
00:55:41 --> 00:55:43
to the Top 10 in America.

1115
00:55:43 --> 00:55:46
But it was played many times, and the clip made a great impression.

1116
00:55:46 --> 00:55:47
Let&#39;s hope you never

1117
00:55:47 --> 00:55:49
Leave, old friend

1118
00:55:49 --> 00:55:50
Like all good things

1119
00:55:50 --> 00:55:52
On you depend on

1120
00:55:52 --> 00:55:54
So stick around

1121
00:55:54 --> 00:55:56
Cos in might miss you. . .

1122
00:55:56 --> 00:55:59
We had a crushing viedo, in which we put a lot of work.

1123
00:55:59 --> 00:56:00
You had your time

1124
00:56:00 --> 00:56:01
You had the power

1125
00:56:01 --> 00:56:03
You&#39;ve yet to have. . .

1126
00:56:03 --> 00:56:05
Everything seemed to go well then.

1127
00:56:05 --> 00:56:09
I felt a little differently. I felt modern and it seemed fresh.

1128
00:56:09 --> 00:56:13
All we hear is radio ga ga

1129
00:56:13 --> 00:56:14
Radio goo goo

1130
00:56:14 --> 00:56:16
Radio ga ga. . .

1131
00:56:16 --> 00:56:20
Suddenly everyone wanted to participate

1132
00:56:20 --> 00:56:22
the whole situation with Radio Ga Ga.

1133
00:56:22 --> 00:56:26
In general, it was claimed that sounds good on the radio,

1134
00:56:26 --> 00:56:27
or listened to on the turntables.

1135
00:56:27 --> 00:56:29
But really it was a union.

1136
00:56:29 --> 00:56:32
All we hear is radio ga ga

1137
00:56:32 --> 00:56:33
Radio goo goo

1138
00:56:33 --> 00:56:34
Radio ga ga. . .

1139
00:56:34 --> 00:56:36
Freddie said, &quot;What we do is like the Olympics.

1140
00:56:36 --> 00:56:38
&quot;All people who believe in you and stand behind you

1141
00:56:38 --> 00:56:39
&quot;And we all do the same thing.

1142
00:56:39 --> 00:56:42
&quot;This is the Olympics.&quot; He said, &quot;This is what we do.&quot;

1143
00:56:42 --> 00:56:46
Radio ga ga Radio ga ga. . .

1144
00:56:46 --> 00:56:50
Suddenly grown a generation of MTV and music videos have become the most important.

1145
00:56:50 --> 00:56:53
The most entertaining clip was &quot;I Want To Break Free&quot;

1146
00:56:53 --> 00:56:54
I just laughed.

1147
00:56:54 --> 00:56:56
I waited for it to get poprzebierać. I guess like everyone else?

1148
00:56:56 --> 00:56:59
Everybody jumped in their dresses faster thread of anything.

1149
00:56:59 --> 00:57:03
It was mainly the idea I said &quot;Okay, let&#39;s do it&quot;

1150
00:57:03 --> 00:57:05
I want to break free

1151
00:57:05 --> 00:57:08
I want to break free

1152
00:57:08 --> 00:57:11
I want to break free from your lies. . .

1153
00:57:11 --> 00:57:15
It&#39;s a great video was a great reference to &quot;Coronation Street&quot;.

1154
00:57:15 --> 00:57:17
I&#39;ve got to break free. . .

1155
00:57:17 --> 00:57:20
Americans do not understand. It looked like we just wanted poprzebierać.

1156
00:57:20 --> 00:57:24
It was unthinkable for most Americans.

1157
00:57:24 --> 00:57:26
I&#39;ve got to break free. . .

1158
00:57:26 --> 00:57:28
It was a very British thing. Sometimes humor can not be

1159
00:57:28 --> 00:57:30
translate. I&#39;m from Canada, so I understand.

1160
00:57:30 --> 00:57:32
It was just a different type of humor

1161
00:57:32 --> 00:57:34
and I do not think that he came to the MTV generation.

1162
00:57:34 --> 00:57:37
I remember that for a time the video was banned.

1163
00:57:37 --> 00:57:39
MTV quickly and willingly everything cenzurowało.

1164
00:57:39 --> 00:57:41
If you thought that Mary Whitehouse was bad,

1165
00:57:41 --> 00:57:44
you should see some of the guys on MTV

1166
00:57:44 --> 00:57:45
in the very beginning of the &#39;80s.

1167
00:57:45 --> 00:57:47
Well, MTV was very parochial.

1168
00:57:47 --> 00:57:50
It was Whitesnake, Whitesnake more bloody,

1169
00:57:50 --> 00:57:52
and then some Whitesnake.

1170
00:57:52 --> 00:57:55
I guess they decided that the guys in dresses

1171
00:57:55 --> 00:57:59
They are not enough for them rock, so I guess that&#39;s why there were releasing the video.

1172
00:57:59 --> 00:58:02
Most Americans were outraged by my and Freddie,

1173
00:58:02 --> 00:58:03
favorite features of this video.

1174
00:58:03 --> 00:58:05
Freddie said: &quot;I love these small steps your...

1175
00:58:05 --> 00:58:06
But life still goes on. . .

1176
00:58:06 --> 00:58:08
... Which you do by going from one room to another.

1177
00:58:08 --> 00:58:11
And he said, &quot;I&#39;m so glad you noticed. It&#39;s my favorite moment.&quot;

1178
00:58:11 --> 00:58:14
. .without you by my side

1179
00:58:14 --> 00:58:17
I do not want to live alone

1180
00:58:17 --> 00:58:19
Hey, God knows

1181
00:58:19 --> 00:58:20
I&#39;ve got to make it. . .

1182
00:58:20 --> 00:58:25
Funny is that we have become the world but lost America.

1183
00:58:25 --> 00:58:27
I really never gained it back there.

1184
00:58:27 --> 00:58:30
I&#39;ve got to break free.

1185
00:58:30 --> 00:58:32
Freddie did not want to go on the route to America

1186
00:58:32 --> 00:58:34
unless they let it hit,

1187
00:58:34 --> 00:58:36
and, of course, one pulls the other

1188
00:58:36 --> 00:58:39
because the less you perform in America, the more you lose it.

1189
00:58:39 --> 00:58:43
It&#39;s sad and a shame because there are so many hits,

1190
00:58:43 --> 00:58:46
worldwide hits but not in the US, and there will never come back.

1191
00:58:46 --> 00:58:48
Show at Sun City never anyone not improved &#39;image,

1192
00:58:48 --> 00:58:50
and sometimes even hurt.

1193
00:58:50 --> 00:58:55
Sun City was a complex of international standards in South Africa

1194
00:58:55 --> 00:58:57
the rock environment, there was a belief,

1195
00:58:57 --> 00:59:00
that if you go to South Africa, you support apartheid.

1196
00:59:00 --> 00:59:03
Very nice to be here- in South Africa

1197
00:59:03 --> 00:59:05
I want to just have fun.

1198
00:59:05 --> 00:59:07
Anything you want to say to your fans?

1199
00:59:07 --> 00:59:11
Yeah, I hope that you are excited because we are.

1200
00:59:11 --> 00:59:13
Controversy around Sun City. . .

1201
00:59:13 --> 00:59:15
Fucking Sun City - I would have never heard about this place.

1202
00:59:15 --> 00:59:17
The most important reason for which the Queen rode there

1203
00:59:17 --> 00:59:19
It was a big pile of money that has been offered.

1204
00:59:19 --> 00:59:21
It was a big deal about our trip,

1205
00:59:21 --> 00:59:24
style - &quot;You can not play in Sun City because it&#39;s a sign

1206
00:59:24 --> 00:59:26
&quot;That you support apartheid.&quot;

1207
00:59:26 --> 00:59:28
Well, it&#39;s simply not true.

1208
00:59:28 --> 00:59:30
If you confess belief that you do not play in the country

1209
00:59:30 --> 00:59:32
whose policies do not accept,

1210
00:59:32 --> 00:59:34
you will be few places where you can play.

1211
00:59:34 --> 00:59:36
Did you know that you have so many fans in South Africa?

1212
00:59:36 --> 00:59:38
Well, I think we realized that we are popular here,

1213
00:59:38 --> 00:59:41
but we did not think that on such a scale.

1214
00:59:41 --> 00:59:45
Jim every now and then come to us and asked if we were playing for a mixed audience.

1215
00:59:45 --> 00:59:47
We said that we will not play for segregated.

1216
00:59:47 --> 00:59:51
So it was not a public apartheid

1217
00:59:51 --> 00:59:53
but most people was white.

1218
00:59:53 --> 00:59:55
You&#39;re going to the concert? Definitely.

1219
00:59:55 --> 00:59:57
What you heard? Słyszaliśmy it&#39;s a great show.

1220
00:59:57 --> 01:00:00
What do you expect after the concert? Something fantastic.

1221
01:00:00 --> 01:00:02
We&#39;ve heard it&#39;s the best show in the world.

1222
01:00:02 --> 01:00:05
The band then supported the school for the deaf in Bophutswanie

1223
01:00:05 --> 01:00:07
therefore, very we engaged in it.

1224
01:00:07 --> 01:00:11
Most people do not read the small leaflet. they see only the headlines.

1225
01:00:11 --> 01:00:15
If it is written, &quot;You are doing a great money playing in the country of apartheid&quot;

1226
01:00:15 --> 01:00:17
it looks like you supported apartheid. It really did not help them.

1227
01:00:17 --> 01:00:21
Until his death I will say that we played according to our conscience

1228
01:00:21 --> 01:00:24
according to our conscience, without regard for what is happening.

1229
01:00:24 --> 01:00:25
Hmm. . . We went there to play music,

1230
01:00:25 --> 01:00:27
the same as in wszytskich other things.

1231
01:00:27 --> 01:00:31
We received so much shit for it. But we went with good intentions.

1232
01:00:31 --> 01:00:33
But that balance, I think it was a mistake to go there.

1233
01:00:33 --> 01:00:36
Whenever the band under pressure

1234
01:00:36 --> 01:00:40
there must be a departure, separation, conflict.

1235
01:00:40 --> 01:00:44
Sometimes I feel I&#39;m going to break down and cry

1236
01:00:44 --> 01:00:46
Nowhere to go Nothing to do with my time

1237
01:00:46 --> 01:00:48
I get lonely

1238
01:00:48 --> 01:00:50
So lonely

1239
01:00:50 --> 01:00:51
Living on my own. . .

1240
01:00:51 --> 01:00:54
I really like the Queen, but do not want to end life in a quartet.

1241
01:00:54 --> 01:00:57
I am 37 years old, I want to do something else,

1242
01:00:57 --> 01:01:00
otherwise I become so old that it remains only wheelchair.

1243
01:01:00 --> 01:01:03
There was a lot of tension when Freddie released his first solo album,

1244
01:01:03 --> 01:01:05
mainly because it went further

1245
01:01:05 --> 01:01:08
It has advanced than most of the albums Queen.

1246
01:01:08 --> 01:01:10
Got to be some good times ahead

1247
01:01:10 --> 01:01:12
Sometimes I feel nobody gives me no warning. . .

1248
01:01:12 --> 01:01:13
There is a concealed envy -

1249
01:01:13 --> 01:01:15
everyone is waiting for it to see if my album

1250
01:01:15 --> 01:01:17
It will have better than the albums Queen.

1251
01:01:17 --> 01:01:18
It&#39;s not easy

1252
01:01:18 --> 01:01:20
Living on my own. . .

1253
01:01:20 --> 01:01:22
Sometimes it is good to get out of the group

1254
01:01:22 --> 01:01:25
It took so long that in the end meant decay.

1255
01:01:25 --> 01:01:29
In fact, he thought that &quot;Living On My Own&quot; (To live his life)

1256
01:01:29 --> 01:01:34
I am, because then lived in Munich for over a year.

1257
01:01:34 --> 01:01:37
Got to be some good times ahead. . .

1258
01:01:37 --> 01:01:38
When Freddie was alone in Munich,

1259
01:01:38 --> 01:01:42
or immersed in the environment, gay,

1260
01:01:42 --> 01:01:47
or when you need some decent advice, he calls us.

1261
01:01:47 --> 01:01:51
Very often he stayed with us.

1262
01:01:51 --> 01:01:53
A lot of time spent with children.

1263
01:01:53 --> 01:01:56
It was probably a matter of the family.

1264
01:01:56 --> 01:02:00
He often said that those were the best moments of his life.

1265
01:02:00 --> 01:02:02
With all the songs that are included in the album,

1266
01:02:02 --> 01:02:06
which one is your most personal?

1267
01:02:06 --> 01:02:08
Hm, I do not know, the one that sells best.

1268
01:02:08 --> 01:02:11
Freddie really meet the terms of creativity,

1269
01:02:11 --> 01:02:14
but it was not so good jeślli in terms of experience,

1270
01:02:14 --> 01:02:18
hm ... how to say, in economics.

1271
01:02:18 --> 01:02:23
The album &quot;The Mr Bad Guy&quot; was a disaster when it comes to sales.

1272
01:02:23 --> 01:02:25
With arguments strength flowed Queen.

1273
01:02:25 --> 01:02:28
It&#39;s just that you have to fight for their position.

1274
01:02:28 --> 01:02:30
It was necessary to exactly match the song.

1275
01:02:30 --> 01:02:35
Freddie worked alone in Munich with an orchestra and Mack,

1276
01:02:35 --> 01:02:38
There was no one who could accommodate him.

1277
01:02:38 --> 01:02:41
So tomorrow the world pop festival,

1278
01:02:41 --> 01:02:42
as mówiliśmu, Live Aid,

1279
01:02:42 --> 01:02:46
connect with each other the best moments of rock on both sides of the Atlantic,

1280
01:02:46 --> 01:02:50
and it&#39;s all free to raise money for the starving in Africa.

1281
01:02:50 --> 01:02:54
Looking back, there was a moment that the Queen was considered

1282
01:02:54 --> 01:02:56
for the group on the status of historical events.

1283
01:02:56 --> 01:02:59
Radio Ga Ga was the only big hit in 4 years.

1284
01:02:59 --> 01:03:01
They were then hot spot,

1285
01:03:01 --> 01:03:04
and they were not too fruitful artistically.

1286
01:03:04 --> 01:03:07
We had the feeling that maybe this is the time.

1287
01:03:07 --> 01:03:12
But Geldof told them to regroup and present.

1288
01:03:12 --> 01:03:15
The question was whether Freddie will want to do this? He was not too eager.

1289
01:03:15 --> 01:03:17
Freddie was very reticent about doing anything,

1290
01:03:17 --> 01:03:18
but once he came Bob

1291
01:03:18 --> 01:03:20
at a time when we talked about Live Aid, and said,

1292
01:03:20 --> 01:03:23
&quot;I talked to Freddiem- do it.&quot; And in total, I believed him.

1293
01:03:23 --> 01:03:25
It is really meeting the most elite rock world,

1294
01:03:25 --> 01:03:28
and longer trials could be seen monarchs rock&#39;n&#39;roll.

1295
01:03:28 --> 01:03:33
Attempts were very intense and were held in the Shaw Theatre on Euston Road.

1296
01:03:33 --> 01:03:36
Here we stand and here we fall

1297
01:03:36 --> 01:03:39
History will not care at all

1298
01:03:39 --> 01:03:42
Make the bed, light the light. . .

1299
01:03:42 --> 01:03:46
Queen approached it more responsibly than any of the groups present there.

1300
01:03:46 --> 01:03:49
You do not waste no time at all

1301
01:03:49 --> 01:03:51
Do not hear the bell but you answer the call. . .

1302
01:03:51 --> 01:03:54
I went to buy one of those white, plastic clocks

1303
01:03:54 --> 01:03:59
we can see how much time we have left.

1304
01:03:59 --> 01:04:03
Each artist had a 18-minute window on the play,

1305
01:04:03 --> 01:04:06
on our side of the stage they were placed traffic lights.

1306
01:04:06 --> 01:04:10
We were warned that after 16 minutes of light changed from green to orange

1307
01:04:10 --> 01:04:13
and that &quot;you will not see the red light as the energy decreases.&quot;

1308
01:04:13 --> 01:04:15
So you do it quickly and play something they know.

1309
01:04:15 --> 01:04:17
Only after 16 hours Live Aid

1310
01:04:17 --> 01:04:19
please welcome Status Quo!

1311
01:04:19 --> 01:04:24
Here we are and here we are and here we go. . .

1312
01:04:24 --> 01:04:26
That day, the energy was remarkable.

1313
01:04:26 --> 01:04:29
Rockin &#39;all over the world. . .

1314
01:04:29 --> 01:04:32
Honestly very we excited we.

1315
01:04:32 --> 01:04:34
Not necessarily the audience because they saw

1316
01:04:34 --> 01:04:38
posters Live Aid which were the announcement.

1317
01:04:38 --> 01:04:44
Before the performance limits were set PA (sound pressure)

1318
01:04:44 --> 01:04:47
but when the Queen took to the stage Trip their soundman,

1319
01:04:47 --> 01:04:48
He switched limits so that the Queen could sound louder.

1320
01:04:48 --> 01:04:51
From the outset, she came on stage like a true champion.

1321
01:04:51 --> 01:04:53
Freddie performing there objected to recommendations

1322
01:04:53 --> 01:04:55
doctor about their problems with the throat.

1323
01:04:55 --> 01:05:00
But there came out and gave the best performance I saw TV.

1324
01:05:00 --> 01:05:03
You do not waste no time at all

1325
01:05:03 --> 01:05:06
Do not hear the bell but you answer the call

1326
01:05:06 --> 01:05:09
Comes to you as to us all, yeah!

1327
01:05:09 --> 01:05:11
And it&#39;s time for the hammer to fall. . .

1328
01:05:11 --> 01:05:16
Ballet BBC cameraman was surprisingly intelligent.

1329
01:05:16 --> 01:05:20
Every night, every day

1330
01:05:20 --> 01:05:22
A little piece of you is falling away

1331
01:05:22 --> 01:05:25
Lift your face the western way. . .

1332
01:05:25 --> 01:05:29
And it is as if all those artists backstage heard whistling.

1333
01:05:29 --> 01:05:31
Almost hear the whispering,

1334
01:05:31 --> 01:05:33
&quot;They stole our performance.&quot;

1335
01:05:33 --> 01:05:36
I&#39;ve paid my dues

1336
01:05:36 --> 01:05:41
Time after time

1337
01:05:41 --> 01:05:42
I did my sentence

1338
01:05:42 --> 01:05:44
But committed no crime

1339
01:05:44 --> 01:05:48
And bad mistakes

1340
01:05:48 --> 01:05:50
I&#39;ve made a few

1341
01:05:50 --> 01:05:54
I&#39;ve had my share of sand kicked in my face

1342
01:05:54 --> 01:05:57
But I&#39;ve come through

1343
01:05:57 --> 01:06:02
We are the champions, my friend. . .

1344
01:06:02 --> 01:06:07
I doubt anyone who was there had goosebumps

1345
01:06:07 --> 01:06:09
at the sight of this ocean of people.

1346
01:06:09 --> 01:06:11
We are the champions

1347
01:06:11 --> 01:06:13
We are the champions. . .

1348
01:06:13 --> 01:06:19
I remember that I looked ahead and saw how the whole place just goes crazy

1349
01:06:19 --> 01:06:20
I thought, &quot;Oh, well we&#39;re doing.&quot;

1350
01:06:20 --> 01:06:22
. .the champions

1351
01:06:22 --> 01:06:27
We are the champions, my friend

1352
01:06:27 --> 01:06:31
And we&#39;ll keep on fighting till the end. . .

1353
01:06:31 --> 01:06:34
We had an advantage, we played earlier in the stadiums.

1354
01:06:34 --> 01:06:38
Freddie learned the power of this amazing

1355
01:06:38 --> 01:06:40
involve all. On the great football stadium,

1356
01:06:40 --> 01:06:42
we were able to elicit any impression that it is united with us.

1357
01:06:42 --> 01:06:47
We are the champions. . .

1358
01:06:47 --> 01:06:51
. .of the world.

1359
01:06:51 --> 01:06:53
People say, &quot;I Was that awaken your career?&quot;

1360
01:06:53 --> 01:06:54
Well, I do not think it was

1361
01:06:54 --> 01:06:56
but of course everyone had it in the back of the head.

1362
01:06:56 --> 01:06:59
We met with a great reaction of the crowd, even at Wembley

1363
01:06:59 --> 01:07:01
even on the part of viewers through TV.

1364
01:07:01 --> 01:07:05
So actually greatly raised us confidence siebie- as a group.

1365
01:07:05 --> 01:07:07
In the face of victory at Live Aid

1366
01:07:07 --> 01:07:10
group breathed fresh air.

1367
01:07:10 --> 01:07:12
It was a poke in the arm so we went back to the studio.

1368
01:07:12 --> 01:07:15
We returned to Munich but knowing what might await us,

1369
01:07:15 --> 01:07:18
we tried to spend as much time in the studio as much as possible.

1370
01:07:18 --> 01:07:19
Ta-dah!

1371
01:07:19 --> 01:07:22
Hey! One man, one goal

1372
01:07:22 --> 01:07:25
One mission, one heart. . .

1373
01:07:25 --> 01:07:28
I had a line that was something like the last one,

1374
01:07:28 --> 01:07:31
the famous speech of Martin Luther King.

1375
01:07:31 --> 01:07:34
It does not fit. It fits.

1376
01:07:34 --> 01:07:38
One goddamn decision. Reall decision.

1377
01:07:38 --> 01:07:39
No, it will not fit.

1378
01:07:39 --> 01:07:40
It was &quot;one&quot; is and &quot;they&quot; that.

1379
01:07:40 --> 01:07:44
Make one decision. One true religion.

1380
01:07:44 --> 01:07:47
One man, one goal, one true religion

1381
01:07:47 --> 01:07:52
They dump, they turd Two tits, John Deacon

1382
01:07:52 --> 01:07:54
Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh

1383
01:07:54 --> 01:07:56
Give me one vision. . .

1384
01:07:56 --> 01:07:59
&quot;The Magic Tour&quot; was the biggest tour in which we participated.

1385
01:07:59 --> 01:08:01
No wrong, no right

1386
01:08:01 --> 01:08:04
I&#39;m gonna tell you there&#39;s no black and no white. . .

1387
01:08:04 --> 01:08:06
We planned the whole route in stadiums.

1388
01:08:06 --> 01:08:08
All we need is one world, one vision. . .

1389
01:08:08 --> 01:08:10
The great performances throughout Europe, and indeed

1390
01:08:10 --> 01:08:13
great party. We went to another level.

1391
01:08:13 --> 01:08:16
I guess we were then in the place where we always wanted to be.

1392
01:08:16 --> 01:08:20
I had a dream when I was young

1393
01:08:20 --> 01:08:22
A dream, sweet illusion. . .

1394
01:08:22 --> 01:08:26
This tour included cities such as Budapest and this in itself is something great.

1395
01:08:26 --> 01:08:30
Budapest was the first concert on the other side of the Iron Curtain.

1396
01:08:30 --> 01:08:32
People arrived from all over Eastern Europe.

1397
01:08:32 --> 01:08:35
Look what they&#39;ve done to my dream. . .

1398
01:08:35 --> 01:08:38
It was a great tour because it was over two nights at Wembley.

1399
01:08:38 --> 01:08:40
Hello, my beautiful. It is happening.

1400
01:08:40 --> 01:08:44
Give me your hands Give me your hearts. . .

1401
01:08:44 --> 01:08:46
Wembley we have done one show Extra

1402
01:08:46 --> 01:08:49
because the tickets sold out so quickly, so we included in this concert at Knebworth.

1403
01:08:49 --> 01:08:52
One voice, one hope One real decision

1404
01:08:52 --> 01:08:55
Gimme one light One llight Gimme one hope One hope

1405
01:08:55 --> 01:08:58
Just gimme ah One man, one man

1406
01:08:58 --> 01:09:00
One bar one night One day hey hey

1407
01:09:00 --> 01:09:02
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme fried chicken.

1408
01:09:02 --> 01:09:04
These were the last concerts with Freddie,

1409
01:09:04 --> 01:09:06
and I remember that it was simply perfect.

1410
01:09:06 --> 01:09:09
I received certain moods Freddie

1411
01:09:09 --> 01:09:13
he felt that unless the council can not do this anymore.

1412
01:09:13 --> 01:09:17
I know that the time will come that I will not be able to jump around the stage

1413
01:09:17 --> 01:09:20
I&#39;ll fool of myself. The time is coming, that in the end you have to finish.

1414
01:09:20 --> 01:09:23
I think he realized that is not of the best.

1415
01:09:23 --> 01:09:27
Freddie told me that he had HIV, even before the boys said.

1416
01:09:27 --> 01:09:29
He put me in a very uncomfortable position

1417
01:09:29 --> 01:09:32
because he said he did not want me to gave the band.

1418
01:09:32 --> 01:09:35
So I, group manager knowing something

1419
01:09:35 --> 01:09:39
extremely important for the band, I could not tell you guys that.

1420
01:09:39 --> 01:09:44
Every drop of rain That falls in Sahara Desert says it all

1421
01:09:44 --> 01:09:45
It&#39;s a miracle

1422
01:09:45 --> 01:09:48
All God&#39;s creations great and small

1423
01:09:48 --> 01:09:50
The Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal

1424
01:09:50 --> 01:09:52
That&#39;s a miracle

1425
01:09:52 --> 01:09:55
Test-tube babies being born

1426
01:09:55 --> 01:09:57
Mothers, fathers, dead and gone

1427
01:09:57 --> 01:09:59
It&#39;s a miracle. . .

1428
01:09:59 --> 01:10:01
There were rumors, and it was obvious that he is suffering,

1429
01:10:01 --> 01:10:04
and we did not know what was going on, rumors, rumors, rumors ...

1430
01:10:04 --> 01:10:06
So at some point, he sat down with us and said:

1431
01:10:06 --> 01:10:08
&quot;You probably know what I want to tell you.

1432
01:10:08 --> 01:10:11
&quot;You know what I suffer. You know what I have a problem

1433
01:10:11 --> 01:10:14
I do not want to talk about it more. I just want to make

1434
01:10:14 --> 01:10:17
hell until I die. So ... let&#39;s leave it behind us.

1435
01:10:17 --> 01:10:19
It was our best moments in the studio.

1436
01:10:19 --> 01:10:22
We have decided that all the songs that we write will be our

1437
01:10:22 --> 01:10:26
joint work, so a little relaxed ...

1438
01:10:26 --> 01:10:27
She joined us positive energy.

1439
01:10:27 --> 01:10:29
Without a doubt, become even closer.

1440
01:10:29 --> 01:10:31
Sharing the merits was a big breakthrough.

1441
01:10:31 --> 01:10:33
Something magical happened, I think so.

1442
01:10:33 --> 01:10:36
There&#39;s even a song &quot;The Miracle&quot;

1443
01:10:36 --> 01:10:39
which seems to me to be the best work of Freddie.

1444
01:10:39 --> 01:10:40
The one thing The one thing

1445
01:10:40 --> 01:10:42
We&#39;re all waiting for

1446
01:10:42 --> 01:10:44
Is peace on earth Peace on earth

1447
01:10:44 --> 01:10:46
And an end to war An end to war. . .

1448
01:10:46 --> 01:10:50
&#39;I love this song. He is optimistic about the world &#39;

1449
01:10:50 --> 01:10:53
and wonders what it found.

1450
01:10:53 --> 01:10:55
The more it is amazing when you think

1451
01:10:55 --> 01:10:58
about what happened to him and what was forecast.

1452
01:10:58 --> 01:11:02
That time will come One day you&#39;ll see

1453
01:11:02 --> 01:11:07
When we can all be friends

1454
01:11:07 --> 01:11:11
That time will come One day you&#39;ll see

1455
01:11:11 --> 01:11:13
When we can all. . .

1456
01:11:13 --> 01:11:17
Special prize for extraordinary contribution to the British music

1457
01:11:17 --> 01:11:20
It goes to John Deacon, Brian May, Freddie Mercury,

1458
01:11:20 --> 01:11:22
and Roger Taylor - Queen.

1459
01:11:22 --> 01:11:24
The first sign that something is wrong

1460
01:11:24 --> 01:11:26
It was that Freddie seemed to be getting thinner.

1461
01:11:26 --> 01:11:28
I called John to come to see what and how.

1462
01:11:28 --> 01:11:31
I said, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with Freddie?&quot; But I said no.

1463
01:11:31 --> 01:11:33
Most storms me, photography

1464
01:11:33 --> 01:11:36
Freddie in The Sun, it seems to me that coming out then straight from the doctor.

1465
01:11:36 --> 01:11:40
It was a great full-page image and the inscription: &quot;Is he dying?&quot;

1466
01:11:40 --> 01:11:43
I thought, &quot;You fucking idiots.&quot;

1467
01:11:43 --> 01:11:44
Scandal

1468
01:11:44 --> 01:11:45
Scandal. . .

1469
01:11:45 --> 01:11:48
All of hiding, and we avoided talking about it.

1470
01:11:48 --> 01:11:49
Scandal. . .

1471
01:11:49 --> 01:11:50
I think that lied.

1472
01:11:50 --> 01:11:51
That&#39;s why we wanted to protect him.

1473
01:11:51 --> 01:11:52
Scandal. . .

1474
01:11:52 --> 01:11:55
Never anybody did not say anything. &quot;Is Fred is sick?&quot;

1475
01:11:55 --> 01:11:57
&quot;Absolutely not. Yesterday I was at the gym.

1476
01:11:57 --> 01:11:59
&quot;Fuck you,&quot; you know. &quot;It&#39;s not your business.&quot;

1477
01:11:59 --> 01:12:02
All we had to build a wall around it.

1478
01:12:02 --> 01:12:05
Because then the disease was fatal judgment.

1479
01:12:05 --> 01:12:10
Today the headlines Tomorrow hard times

1480
01:12:10 --> 01:12:14
And no-one ever really knows The truth from the lies. . .

1481
01:12:14 --> 01:12:15
His house was surrounded by ...

1482
01:12:15 --> 01:12:17
I do not know ... a few hundreds.

1483
01:12:17 --> 01:12:19
Just like vultures.

1484
01:12:19 --> 01:12:24
Deeper and deeper inside. . .

1485
01:12:24 --> 01:12:25
It was shocking.

1486
01:12:25 --> 01:12:27
Filming even shopping in the trunk.

1487
01:12:27 --> 01:12:28
Scandal. . .

1488
01:12:28 --> 01:12:31
&quot;Are there any medications?&quot; You know, terribly shocking.

1489
01:12:31 --> 01:12:32
Working in London became difficult.

1490
01:12:32 --> 01:12:34
so terribly interested in it.

1491
01:12:34 --> 01:12:36
People they put a camera through the windows to the toilet,

1492
01:12:36 --> 01:12:37
as soon as the rumors came to light.

1493
01:12:37 --> 01:12:39
So Montreal was definitely quieter

1494
01:12:39 --> 01:12:41
a place to work so we did a lot of things there.

1495
01:12:41 --> 01:12:44
Freddie felt far safer there because people did not care.

1496
01:12:44 --> 01:12:47
You know. They were not so nosy.

1497
01:12:47 --> 01:12:49
At this point, we could not play live

1498
01:12:49 --> 01:12:52
but generally everything was the same.

1499
01:12:52 --> 01:12:56
I&#39;m going slightly mad

1500
01:12:56 --> 01:13:00
I&#39;m going slightly mad. . .

1501
01:13:00 --> 01:13:02
He was determined to work until the last moment.

1502
01:13:02 --> 01:13:05
I was surprised that he managed to do &quot;Going Slightly Mad&quot;.

1503
01:13:05 --> 01:13:06
It finally happened. . .

1504
01:13:06 --> 01:13:08
Which I think is very good clip,

1505
01:13:08 --> 01:13:10
with a large dose of humor.

1506
01:13:10 --> 01:13:14
I&#39;m slightly mad!

1507
01:13:14 --> 01:13:16
Freddie was in a much better mood

1508
01:13:16 --> 01:13:17
than generally thought.

1509
01:13:17 --> 01:13:19
Do you want to take it? Not me...

1510
01:13:19 --> 01:13:21
Oh! What he is doing?

1511
01:13:21 --> 01:13:22
Roger, what did you do?

1512
01:13:22 --> 01:13:24
It was very close to us moments.

1513
01:13:24 --> 01:13:25
Do it this way. Waaa!

1514
01:13:25 --> 01:13:26
Freddie has found some inner peace and so

1515
01:13:26 --> 01:13:28
never really słyszałm to complain.

1516
01:13:28 --> 01:13:30
I remember when we left the city

1517
01:13:30 --> 01:13:32
and he had a terrible problem with his legs.

1518
01:13:32 --> 01:13:36
Freddie saw that glimpse and said, &quot;Oh, Brian, you want to see?&quot;

1519
01:13:36 --> 01:13:38
He showed me and think. . .

1520
01:13:38 --> 01:13:39
He saw my reaction and said,

1521
01:13:39 --> 01:13:41
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I did not want you to do that.&quot;

1522
01:13:41 --> 01:13:45
I never heard him speak: &quot;It is terrible. My life sucks.

1523
01:13:45 --> 01:13:47
&quot;I&#39;m dying.&quot; Never, never, never.

1524
01:13:47 --> 01:13:49
He was terribly strong person.

1525
01:13:49 --> 01:13:53
The more Freddie was sick the more he wanted to record,

1526
01:13:53 --> 01:13:57
that he had something to take care of, you know - that was what the morning to get up.

1527
01:13:57 --> 01:13:59
I did everything that was in its power.

1528
01:13:59 --> 01:14:02
So it was a period of very intensive work.

1529
01:14:02 --> 01:14:05
Freddie was getting weaker by this terrible disease

1530
01:14:05 --> 01:14:07
So many times it was hard work

1531
01:14:07 --> 01:14:10
but he drank a couple of glasses of vodka and I was ready

1532
01:14:10 --> 01:14:13
to sit at the console and microphone.

1533
01:14:13 --> 01:14:14
Camera! Playback!

1534
01:14:14 --> 01:14:17
Sometimes I get this feeling

1535
01:14:17 --> 01:14:19
I was back in the old days

1536
01:14:19 --> 01:14:20
Long ago. . .

1537
01:14:20 --> 01:14:23
&#39;You can hear his voice becomes weaker.&#39;

1538
01:14:23 --> 01:14:26
Things seemed so pefrect You know. . .

1539
01:14:26 --> 01:14:30
&#39;I think you can say that it is the voice of the patient.&#39;

1540
01:14:30 --> 01:14:32
Nevertheless, the holding lines.

1541
01:14:32 --> 01:14:34
The sun was always shining

1542
01:14:34 --> 01:14:35
We just lived for fun

1543
01:14:35 --> 01:14:36
Sometimes. . .

1544
01:14:36 --> 01:14:39
&#39;Roger began writing &quot;These Are The Days Of Our Lives&quot; about their children&#39;

1545
01:14:39 --> 01:14:41
about how life goes on.

1546
01:14:41 --> 01:14:46
But of course, if it had a different meaning.

1547
01:14:46 --> 01:14:52
Those were the days of our lives. . .

1548
01:14:52 --> 01:14:54
&#39;He looked very ill. It was a little scary &#39;

1549
01:14:54 --> 01:14:56
and ... I think it was very brave of him.

1550
01:14:56 --> 01:14:57
And in total, why not?

1551
01:14:57 --> 01:15:00
&#39;He spent hours doing makeup, improving appearance,

1552
01:15:00 --> 01:15:01
&#39;To make it look good.&#39;

1553
01:15:01 --> 01:15:05
Those days are all gone now but

1554
01:15:05 --> 01:15:06
One thing is true. . .

1555
01:15:06 --> 01:15:08
Too much to move.

1556
01:15:08 --> 01:15:10
I just wanted to see. . . I do not know. . .

1557
01:15:10 --> 01:15:12
I still love you. . .

1558
01:15:12 --> 01:15:14
I just want to see. . . It does not look. . .

1559
01:15:14 --> 01:15:15
It does not look. . .

1560
01:15:15 --> 01:15:16
I think it should be narrowed.

1561
01:15:16 --> 01:15:19
You know what I mean? I want to find a little more shape. A little bit.

1562
01:15:19 --> 01:15:21
&#39;Yes. Now I like it. &#39;

1563
01:15:21 --> 01:15:25
Those days are all gone now, but

1564
01:15:25 --> 01:15:29
One thing&#39;s still true

1565
01:15:29 --> 01:15:30
When I look. . .

1566
01:15:30 --> 01:15:33
&#39;Actually, Freddie said goodbye in this song.&#39;

1567
01:15:33 --> 01:15:35
I still love you. . .

1568
01:15:35 --> 01:15:37
I still love you.

1569
01:15:37 --> 01:15:40
&quot;Innuendo&quot; when he came out, it was number one

1570
01:15:40 --> 01:15:43
and two weeks later came here to Montreal.

1571
01:15:43 --> 01:15:46
They began to make more music.

1572
01:15:46 --> 01:15:49
Freddie then said, &quot;Be me something. I know I do not have much time.

1573
01:15:49 --> 01:15:51
&quot;All the time I write something. Give me if you can.

1574
01:15:51 --> 01:15:54
&quot;I will sing, apot you can do with it what you want,

1575
01:15:54 --> 01:15:55
&quot;You know, finish it.&quot;

1576
01:15:55 --> 01:15:58
So I wrote on pieces of paper the words &quot;Mother Love&quot;.

1577
01:15:58 --> 01:16:01
When he did he knew he was dying

1578
01:16:01 --> 01:16:04
realized that, as it finished its gone.

1579
01:16:04 --> 01:16:07
He said: &quot;I will sing it now,

1580
01:16:07 --> 01:16:10
&quot;I can not wait for them to make it burn normally

1581
01:16:10 --> 01:16:12
&quot;We will record it drumboxie.

1582
01:16:12 --> 01:16:15
&quot;Give me the drubox... They will complete it.&quot;

1583
01:16:15 --> 01:16:19
I do not want to make no waves

1584
01:16:19 --> 01:16:22
You can give me all the love. . .

1585
01:16:22 --> 01:16:25
Every time when I gave him another line, he sang it,

1586
01:16:25 --> 01:16:26
He sang again and again.

1587
01:16:26 --> 01:16:28
So we had three shots each line and that was enough.

1588
01:16:28 --> 01:16:32
I long for peace before I die. . .

1589
01:16:32 --> 01:16:35
&quot;Mother Love&quot; was the last. There is a unique,

1590
01:16:35 --> 01:16:37
frightening tone in the middle.

1591
01:16:37 --> 01:16:38
Beautifully sung fragment.

1592
01:16:38 --> 01:16:40
Out in the city

1593
01:16:40 --> 01:16:43
In the cold world outside

1594
01:16:43 --> 01:16:45
I do not want pity

1595
01:16:45 --> 01:16:48
Just a safe place to hide

1596
01:16:48 --> 01:16:52
Mom, please, let me back inside. . .

1597
01:16:52 --> 01:16:55
Absolutely. . .frightening.

1598
01:16:55 --> 01:16:57
We got to the last verse and said:

1599
01:16:57 --> 01:16:59
&quot;Oh, I do not really go out, I need a little rest.

1600
01:16:59 --> 01:17:01
&quot;I&#39;ll come back and finish this,&quot; you know ...

1601
01:17:01 --> 01:17:03
but he never returned.

1602
01:17:03 --> 01:17:07
It was the last moment in our shared studio.

1603
01:17:07 --> 01:17:11
When I went to see Freddie and then I saw him for the last time.

1604
01:17:11 --> 01:17:13
He told me &quot;you nothing rewritten.

1605
01:17:13 --> 01:17:16
&quot;You are my executor of the will, you can do anything with my achievements,

1606
01:17:16 --> 01:17:18
&quot;You can do anything with my music

1607
01:17:18 --> 01:17:20
&quot;But never things I was boring.&quot;

1608
01:17:20 --> 01:17:23
When was the last time I saw Freddie, Anita and I went to him

1609
01:17:23 --> 01:17:24
She is lying in bed,

1610
01:17:24 --> 01:17:28
the curtains were pulled so he could see the garden,

1611
01:17:28 --> 01:17:30
we talked about things there znajdującyc.

1612
01:17:30 --> 01:17:32
He said, &quot;This is very interesting,&quot;

1613
01:17:32 --> 01:17:35
&quot;Guys, you do not have to feel compelled to have a conversation.

1614
01:17:35 --> 01:17:37
&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here at all,

1615
01:17:37 --> 01:17:39
&quot;So even as we do not talk, then we take advantage of this moment.&quot;

1616
01:17:39 --> 01:17:42
The worst part for me was that when I was on my way to him

1617
01:17:42 --> 01:17:45
literally 250m from him, Peter Freestone called

1618
01:17:45 --> 01:17:47
to tell me, &quot;Do not come, he&#39;s gone.&quot;

1619
01:17:47 --> 01:17:49
I wrote a little epitaph

1620
01:17:49 --> 01:17:51
which is on the statue in Montreal

1621
01:17:51 --> 01:17:55
saying &quot;Freddie Mercury, lover of life - singer of songs.&quot;

1622
01:17:55 --> 01:17:58
For me it was a summary of his life because he lived life to the fullest,

1623
01:17:58 --> 01:18:00
no doubt about it, using everything you supplied.

1624
01:18:00 --> 01:18:04
He was a generous man, kind, sometimes impatient

1625
01:18:04 --> 01:18:07
but completely devoted to what was important to him,

1626
01:18:07 --> 01:18:08
and that was creating music.

1627
01:18:08 --> 01:18:13
Announced that as soon as we can, we&#39;ll play a concert commemorating,

1628
01:18:13 --> 01:18:16
to say goodbye to him in the manner he deserved.

1629
01:18:16 --> 01:18:18
We hope that many of you will give advice to accompany us

1630
01:18:18 --> 01:18:20
April 20 at Wembley Stadium

1631
01:18:20 --> 01:18:23
to commemorate the life and career of Freddie.

1632
01:18:23 --> 01:18:25
You are all invited. Come to accompany us.

1633
01:18:25 --> 01:18:29
We wrote a list of people who would like to see in concert.

1634
01:18:29 --> 01:18:30
Roger started the machine.

1635
01:18:30 --> 01:18:33
He got up in the morning and said, &quot;Listen, we take up for it.&quot; I made a few phone calls.

1636
01:18:33 --> 01:18:36
Brian said, &quot;Well, if you can do so much, I will come.&quot;

1637
01:18:36 --> 01:18:38
On stage, Mr Roger Daltrey!

1638
01:18:38 --> 01:18:40
Mr. Robert Plant, thank you!

1639
01:18:40 --> 01:18:41
Mr David Bowie!

1640
01:18:41 --> 01:18:42
Iiiii. . .

1641
01:18:42 --> 01:18:49
Any way the wind blo-ooooooo-ows!

1642
01:18:49 --> 01:18:53
We had a date, Wembley Stadium ... It had to be Wembley, is not it? It had to be.

1643
01:18:53 --> 01:18:55
Place greatest triumph Freddie.

1644
01:18:55 --> 01:18:57
It happened a lot of amazing things.

1645
01:18:57 --> 01:19:00
I would like to offer something, something very simple.

1646
01:19:00 --> 01:19:04
David Bowie suddenly began to pray the Our Father which surprised us all.

1647
01:19:04 --> 01:19:06
For Thine is the kingdom,

1648
01:19:06 --> 01:19:07
and power

1649
01:19:07 --> 01:19:08
and the glory

1650
01:19:08 --> 01:19:10
forever and ever.

1651
01:19:10 --> 01:19:12
Amen.

1652
01:19:12 --> 01:19:13
God Save the Queen.

1653
01:19:13 --> 01:19:14
God bless you.

1654
01:19:14 --> 01:19:15
Thank you goodnight!

1655
01:19:15 --> 01:19:18
I want to hear everyone.

1656
01:19:18 --> 01:19:19
I want to see the hands of everyone.

1657
01:19:19 --> 01:19:21
Three four.

1658
01:19:21 --> 01:19:24
Find me somebody to love

1659
01:19:24 --> 01:19:27
Find me somebody to love

1660
01:19:27 --> 01:19:30
Find me somebody to love

1661
01:19:30 --> 01:19:33
Find me somebody to love

1662
01:19:33 --> 01:19:34
Somebody! Somebody!

1663
01:19:34 --> 01:19:37
Somebody! Somebody! Somebody! Somebody!

1664
01:19:37 --> 01:19:40
Somebody find me somebody to love

1665
01:19:40 --> 01:19:46
Anybody find me-eeeeeeeeeeeee. . .

1666
01:19:46 --> 01:19:51
Somebody to-oooooooo. . .

1667
01:19:51 --> 01:19:52
Come on!

1668
01:19:52 --> 01:19:53
&#39;It was completely cleansing.&#39;

1669
01:19:53 --> 01:19:55
It was a kind of relief in mourning.

1670
01:19:55 --> 01:19:56
Yeah!

1671
01:19:56 --> 01:20:01
Somebody find me somebody to-oo-oo love

1672
01:20:01 --> 01:20:04
Find me somebody to-oo-oo love Oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh!

1673
01:20:04 --> 01:20:09
Find me is somebody, somebody

1674
01:20:09 --> 01:20:11
To-oo-oo love

1675
01:20:11 --> 01:20:15
Anybody anywhere find me somebody to love

1676
01:20:15 --> 01:20:17
I remember that as we descended

1677
01:20:17 --> 01:20:19
Joe Elliott of Def Leopard put his hand on my shoulder

1678
01:20:19 --> 01:20:20
and I said, &quot;Stop Brian

1679
01:20:20 --> 01:20:23
&quot;Turn around, look at the audience and remember this moment.

1680
01:20:23 --> 01:20:25
&quot;Nothing like that is never going to happen.&quot;

1681
01:20:25 --> 01:20:28
&#39;It is amazing that it is already 40 years since the founding of the band.

1682
01:20:28 --> 01:20:32
&#39;And it is still as powerful as ever.&#39;

1683
01:20:32 --> 01:20:34
Although 20 years of the 40 spent longer without Freddie.

1684
01:20:34 --> 01:20:37
There is no longer Now these John because he chose to be somewhere else.

1685
01:20:37 --> 01:20:38
For Roger and me ...

1686
01:20:38 --> 01:20:41
will always remain search.

1687
01:20:41 --> 01:20:44
The show must go on!

1688
01:20:44 --> 01:20:48
In the backstage remained all this stuff made with Freddie, who was unfinished,

1689
01:20:48 --> 01:20:50
and what we were going to do about it? Album?

1690
01:20:50 --> 01:20:52
&quot;Made In Heaven&quot; it was quite different.

1691
01:20:52 --> 01:20:56
Very strange was working with Freddie wydobywajcym voice from the speakers

1692
01:20:56 --> 01:20:59
but Brian and I felt what he wants to get Freddie

1693
01:20:59 --> 01:21:01
So we started this, and I was very happy result.

1694
01:21:01 --> 01:21:03
It seems to me that it was appropriate ending.

1695
01:21:03 --> 01:21:06
It was, uh ... it was the right album at the end.

1696
01:21:06 --> 01:21:10
When you decide to be a rock star, it is you forever.

1697
01:21:10 --> 01:21:13
Never pass a desire to make music.

1698
01:21:13 --> 01:21:15
The show must go on!

1699
01:21:15 --> 01:21:18
Great was the route of Paul Rodgers.

1700
01:21:18 --> 01:21:20
Paul was a great singer completely different.

1701
01:21:20 --> 01:21:26
I&#39;ve never given in On with the show

1702
01:21:26 --> 01:21:30
The show must go on.

1703
01:21:30 --> 01:21:33
Repeatedly amazes me that we were lucky

1704
01:21:33 --> 01:21:35
be in a great band, create a great group

1705
01:21:35 --> 01:21:38
and the fact that people still like our music.

1706
01:21:38 --> 01:21:40
Queen creates such a stimulating environment,

1707
01:21:40 --> 01:21:43
so nothing really this is not equal.

1708
01:21:43 --> 01:21:47
It was such a great source of kreatywności- Queen was the best.

1709
01:21:47 --> 01:21:50
One dream, one soul

1710
01:21:50 --> 01:21:54
One prize, one goal

1711
01:21:54 --> 01:21:59
One golden glance of what should be

1712
01:21:59 --> 01:22:00
It&#39;s a kind of magic

1713
01:22:00 --> 01:22:05
One flash of light That shows the way

1714
01:22:05 --> 01:22:08
No mortal man

1715
01:22:08 --> 01:22:09
Can win this day

1716
01:22:09 --> 01:22:11
It&#39;s a kind of magic

1717
01:22:11 --> 01:22:14
The bell That rings

1718
01:22:14 --> 01:22:16
Inside your mind

1719
01:22:16 --> 01:22:18
is challenging

1720
01:22:18 --> 01:22:21
The doors of time

1721
01:22:21 --> 01:22:27
This rage That lasts a thousand years

1722
01:22:27 --> 01:22:29
Will soon be, will soon be Will soon be. . .

1723
01:22:29 --> 01:22:32
Will soon be done

1724
01:22:32 --> 01:22:35
Will soon be done

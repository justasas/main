00:00:00 --> 00:00:02
Here I am, Lord Warden And I can not lie ...

3
00:00:02 --> 00:00:06
And here I will continue until my dying day ..

4
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
Every day it raining for a week.

5
00:00:08 --> 00:00:12
When I was a kid I loved the rain. Although it rained a lot, like now.

6
00:00:12 --> 00:00:15
When my last fight was raining. I lost reflexes.

7
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
The most beautiful girl I met, I found her in the rain.

8
00:00:18 --> 00:00:20
high heels on wet cobbles ....

9
00:00:20 --> 00:00:21
Come to say goodbye to Frankie.

10
00:00:21 --> 00:00:22
They do not waste time.

11
00:00:22 --> 00:00:27
Today it buries Frankie McLain,

12
00:00:27 --> 00:00:31
More pain, more sadness.

13
00:00:31 --> 00:00:35
Our Lord has dealt well with Frankie,

14
00:00:35 --> 00:00:40
he released before serving his sentence.

15
00:00:40 --> 00:00:41
It is a way of escape.

16
00:00:41 --> 00:00:42
There may be still better.

17
00:00:42 --> 00:00:47
Munsey sent a guy of 62 years working in the collector.

18
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
One dead, thanks to Captain Munsey.

19
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
Always ready. There it is.

20
00:00:52 --> 00:00:53
Joe is with him!

21
00:00:53 --> 00:00:54
Pity about McLain.

22
00:00:54 --> 00:00:56
¿You were good friends, Collins?

23
00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
Frankie he had no more than eight months.

24
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
I knew him ... he was within eight months, back in nine.

25
00:01:02 --> 00:01:03
Not so, Collins?

26
00:01:03 --> 00:01:04
Still spiteful?

27
00:01:04 --> 00:01:05
Leave it, Munsey.

28
00:01:05 --> 00:01:08
Nothing Munsey. &quot;Mr. &quot;

29
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
You shall not make even the slightest gesture?

30
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
Ten days of isolation they have not helped.

31
00:01:12 --> 00:01:14
Yes, not to carry knife.

32
00:01:14 --> 00:01:15
Are you still saying that it is an isolated case?

33
00:01:15 --> 00:01:17
Altogether. The incident is closed.

34
00:01:17 --> 00:01:18
Why fight me?

35
00:01:18 --> 00:01:20
After all I am doing my job.

36
00:01:20 --> 00:01:22
Very good. As you like.

37
00:01:22 --> 00:01:23
Joe!

38
00:01:23 --> 00:01:24
Doc?

39
00:01:24 --> 00:01:27
I would have liked to go down to see you, but ...

40
00:01:27 --> 00:01:28
There are meeting this morning.

41
00:01:28 --> 00:01:30
Settle a little.

42
00:01:30 --> 00:01:31
I ditto him.

43
00:01:31 --> 00:01:33
My partner Joe was in the hole,

44
00:01:33 --> 00:01:36
That&#39;s worse than make charcoal.

45
00:01:36 --> 00:01:39
Returns with head held high,

46
00:01:39 --> 00:01:43
He grassed who may be dead.

47
00:01:43 --> 00:01:44
All right, Joe?

48
00:01:44 --> 00:01:45
Glad to see you again.

49
00:01:45 --> 00:01:46
Do you know anything about your wife?

50
00:01:46 --> 00:01:47
Do you know Kid Coy?

51
00:01:47 --> 00:01:48
He&#39;d seen out there.

52
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
They have put in place of Frankie McLain.

53
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
Frankie was the most. It will cost you take your relay.

54
00:01:52 --> 00:01:53
If you say, it will, Joe.

55
00:01:53 --> 00:01:55
Incidentally, the Sneak, is already fixed.

56
00:01:55 --> 00:01:56
Everything is fine.

57
00:01:56 --> 00:01:57
That everything is fine?

58
00:01:57 --> 00:01:58
What is right?

59
00:01:58 --> 00:01:59
Nothing is.

60
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
It never was, never will be.

61
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
Until we&#39;re out, you know?

62
00:02:04 --> 00:02:05
Outside!

63
00:02:05 --> 00:02:07
After isolation, even this will look good.

64
00:02:07 --> 00:02:08
Yesterday I spoke to my lawyer.

65
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
Did it come from New York to speak?

66
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
No, do not you heard? It is here, locked.

67
00:02:12 --> 00:02:13
Roberts.

68
00:02:13 --> 00:02:14
I need help.

69
00:02:14 --> 00:02:14
I stay away.

70
00:02:14 --> 00:02:15
You&#39;re okay with Gallagher.

71
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
You and him, you can fix everything.

72
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
There are things that can not be fixed.

73
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
If you say something about me ...

74
00:02:21 --> 00:02:22
I have to tell you.

75
00:02:22 --> 00:02:23
- What does this ...? - Esfúmate.

76
00:02:23 --> 00:02:25
- Listen out. - I&#39;ve told you esfumes!

77
00:02:25 --> 00:02:25
Who?

78
00:02:25 --> 00:02:29
Wilson. An informer. He was the one who put the knife to Collins.

79
00:02:29 --> 00:02:30
Munsey made me.

80
00:02:30 --> 00:02:34
You can fix it, Gallagher. For Collins, I will pay.

81
00:02:34 --> 00:02:35
Of course, you pay.

82
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
How is the flu?

83
00:02:38 --> 00:02:39
All right.

84
00:02:39 --> 00:02:40
Mr.

85
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
Strella, have told me you hit detainees.

86
00:02:43 --> 00:02:44
I?

87
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
Captain Munsey, I have to talk. Please.

88
00:02:47 --> 00:02:48
Good morning, Gallagher.

89
00:02:48 --> 00:02:53
I think you&#39;ve fixed the little problem of the sector J.

90
00:02:53 --> 00:02:54
We appreciate your help, but ...

91
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
My boys and I try to help.

92
00:02:56 --> 00:02:57
You and your boys.

93
00:02:57 --> 00:03:01
There is an old rule here, apropos of bands and bosses.

94
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
We do not like. We do not want.

95
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
Then cácelos.

96
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
Gallaher, you&#39;ll know when you have not yet returned to your home,

97
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
in front of your band of evildoers?

98
00:03:10 --> 00:03:11
I take care of the police.

99
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
You, fulfill your grief.

100
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
So each one will be paid.

101
00:03:15 --> 00:03:16
True, Captain.

102
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
As it is written to each, his own.

103
00:03:19 --> 00:03:20
To each.

104
00:03:20 --> 00:03:20
Something is wrong?

105
00:03:20 --> 00:03:21
It was not his fault.

106
00:03:21 --> 00:03:22
Sorry, Lister.

107
00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
Breakfast warden,

108
00:03:24 --> 00:03:27
eggs, bacon and jam, arrives on time

109
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
Do you have an important meeting this morning, doctor?

110
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
Will the Captain Munsey?

111
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
Cognac is the best drink,

112
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
if you drink enough, you end up either tube.

113
00:03:38 --> 00:03:39
According to statistics,

114
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
if the level of alcohol in the blood exceeds 0.5%

115
00:03:43 --> 00:03:48
It affects blood pressure, brain activity and,

116
00:03:48 --> 00:03:49
one begins to see not clear.

117
00:03:49 --> 00:03:50
And so maybe things better.

118
00:03:50 --> 00:03:51
You will not like this.

119
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
Why do you stay?

120
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
You have no choice, Calypso.

121
00:03:55 --> 00:03:56
Me neither.

122
00:03:56 --> 00:03:58
It&#39;s not that simple, Mr. McCallum.

123
00:03:58 --> 00:04:02
This prison has detained twice than expected.

124
00:04:02 --> 00:04:04
We do not have enough work for all.

125
00:04:04 --> 00:04:05
Why not?

126
00:04:05 --> 00:04:06
Today&#39;s world.

127
00:04:06 --> 00:04:09
You can give them jobs, training,

128
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
but the industries claim to the media,

129
00:04:11 --> 00:04:13
unions say they steal jobs.

130
00:04:13 --> 00:04:15
Nobody wants to help us. We do not.

131
00:04:15 --> 00:04:19
The industries! Unions! Why not meteorologists?

132
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
You acknowledge they do not control the situation.

133
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
Sorry, but I have not understood

134
00:04:25 --> 00:04:26
the warden.

135
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
It&#39;s not about control detainees: He wants to help.

136
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
Munsey, this prison requires absolute discipline.

137
00:04:32 --> 00:04:33
Not charity.

138
00:04:33 --> 00:04:37
Their loyalty has not changed: It&#39;s too old for this position.

139
00:04:37 --> 00:04:40
Age is a matter of arteries, not years.

140
00:04:40 --> 00:04:43
Are you better philosopher than doctor.

141
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
But I get tired both on paper and in the other.

142
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
They send me to tell you that if problems persist,

143
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
if not ensure a strict order,

144
00:04:50 --> 00:04:53
there will be immediate changes to all staff.

145
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
They do not want trouble!

146
00:04:55 --> 00:04:56
Is it clear, Alcaide?

147
00:04:56 --> 00:04:57
And for you?

148
00:04:57 --> 00:04:58
Totally.

149
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
No problem.

150
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02
This simplifies everything.

151
00:05:02 --> 00:05:03
In the community

152
00:05:03 --> 00:05:04
and his servants ...

153
00:05:04 --> 00:05:06
Prisons built with thicker walls

154
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
and work completed.

155
00:05:08 --> 00:05:09
What is truth?

156
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
You and your summary remedies:

157
00:05:11 --> 00:05:14
alcaide change, new staff,

158
00:05:14 --> 00:05:15
absolute discipline.

159
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
Do we really know what this prison? A human bomb!

160
00:05:18 --> 00:05:22
And you say: golpeadla, machacadla, you&#39;ll never explode!

161
00:05:22 --> 00:05:25
¿Munsey, what do you think the doctor&#39;s point of view?

162
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
I think sometimes worries too.

163
00:05:28 --> 00:05:29
¿Alcaide?

164
00:05:29 --> 00:05:30
I dont know.

165
00:05:30 --> 00:05:31
Me: Yes.

166
00:05:31 --> 00:05:33
Like so many dreamers and inebriated,

167
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
She is talking without saying anything.

168
00:05:35 --> 00:05:36
His solution?

169
00:05:36 --> 00:05:40
No cure a sick aggravating his condition.

170
00:05:40 --> 00:05:42
With its methods, a detainee

171
00:05:42 --> 00:05:43
It is a hardened criminal departure.

172
00:05:43 --> 00:05:46
Moonshine! I&#39;m waiting for your solutions.

173
00:05:46 --> 00:05:49
For someone like you, it will never be a solution.

174
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
Why destroy rather than build?

175
00:05:51 --> 00:05:54
It takes a little patience, and a lot of understanding.

176
00:05:54 --> 00:05:55
We are too patient.

177
00:05:55 --> 00:05:56
In terms of understanding,

178
00:05:56 --> 00:05:59
the object of my visit can not be misunderstood.

179
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
He will remain in office if there may be further problems.

180
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
Bye.

181
00:06:03 --> 00:06:04
I go with you.

182
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
I&#39;m in this position long ago.

183
00:06:07 --> 00:06:08
I would not know where to go,

184
00:06:08 --> 00:06:09
or do.

185
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
The house is well placed.

186
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
I put curtains with flowers.

187
00:06:13 --> 00:06:15
He does not know yet.

188
00:06:15 --> 00:06:16
He likes to come see you.

189
00:06:16 --> 00:06:17
It is too small, better ...

190
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
For it is like a party.

191
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
There. your lawyer

192
00:06:21 --> 00:06:21
¿Ruth?

193
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
He does not want to know anything.

194
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
I sent three doctors.

195
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
They explained why it was urgent surgery.

196
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
And she insists on not accepting if you&#39;re not.

197
00:06:30 --> 00:06:31
To Ruth, no matter if you&#39;re not.

198
00:06:31 --> 00:06:32
Not even his life.

199
00:06:32 --> 00:06:33
How long does he have?

200
00:06:33 --> 00:06:34
I do not know.

201
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
Let me tell you&#39;re here.

202
00:06:36 --> 00:06:37
She loves You.

203
00:06:37 --> 00:06:38
You understand.

204
00:06:38 --> 00:06:40
All right. You know what you do.

205
00:06:40 --> 00:06:42
Talk to her. Ask him to do so.

206
00:06:42 --> 00:06:43
Try again.

207
00:06:43 --> 00:06:44
Okay, Joe.

208
00:06:44 --> 00:06:45
I waited.

209
00:06:45 --> 00:06:46
Get money and save it to your office.

210
00:06:46 --> 00:06:46
What are you going to do?

211
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
I can not do much, right?

212
00:06:48 --> 00:06:50
I do not want to intervene.

213
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
What I say is that if you send Roberts back to the collector ...

214
00:06:53 --> 00:06:55
Okay, Munsey, whatever.

215
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
Joe! Do you loose here?

216
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
I was sent for.

217
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
Munsey has found me a job, as always.

218
00:07:01 --> 00:07:02
Sit down. Right away I attend.

219
00:07:02 --> 00:07:03
I&#39;m glad you passed.

220
00:07:03 --> 00:07:06
One of my patients, old Pat. Regan, wants to see you.

221
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
there is a pass to the nurse behind you.

222
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
A cancer kills fast?

223
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
The question is not so.

224
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
Cancer is not necessarily fatal.

225
00:07:15 --> 00:07:16
Why?

226
00:07:16 --> 00:07:17
What if you operate?

227
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
It depends on each case.

228
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
The most important factor is time.

229
00:07:21 --> 00:07:22
Someone close?

230
00:07:22 --> 00:07:23
By the way, what time is it?

231
00:07:23 --> 00:07:24
Almost ten thirty.

232
00:07:24 --> 00:07:25
Insurance?

233
00:07:25 --> 00:07:28
The ten twenty-seven exactly.

234
00:07:28 --> 00:07:29
Why?

235
00:07:29 --> 00:07:29
Wilson. Half past ten.

236
00:07:29 --> 00:07:30
Wilson. Half past ten.

237
00:07:30 --> 00:07:32
Did I talked about my last limo?

238
00:07:32 --> 00:07:33
Magnificent. And spacious!

239
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
So long that, to call the driver,

240
00:07:36 --> 00:07:37
I have to put a conference.

241
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
Surprisingly, it has the same number.

242
00:07:39 --> 00:07:40
Circulates.

243
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
Wilson. Half past ten

244
00:07:42 --> 00:07:43
Where are you going?

245
00:07:43 --> 00:07:44
Let&#39;s drink.

246
00:07:44 --> 00:07:45
I force myself!

247
00:07:45 --> 00:07:46
Let me!

248
00:07:46 --> 00:07:47
Munsey made me!

249
00:07:47 --> 00:07:48
Yes, Mr. Warden.

250
00:07:48 --> 00:07:49
What?

251
00:07:49 --> 00:07:50
I am coming right away.

252
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
When it happened?

253
00:07:52 --> 00:07:53
I get it.

254
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
They just kill a prisoner.

255
00:07:55 --> 00:07:58
This what you can not hang you.

256
00:07:58 --> 00:07:59
I&#39;m your witness.

257
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
That counts, witnesses.

258
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
How lucky you asked me just before the hour.

259
00:08:04 --> 00:08:05
It is true.

260
00:08:05 --> 00:08:06
One such Wilson.

261
00:08:06 --> 00:08:07
What a pity.

262
00:08:07 --> 00:08:08
An accident?

263
00:08:08 --> 00:08:09
Totally.

264
00:08:09 --> 00:08:10
There are witnesses.

265
00:08:10 --> 00:08:11
Louie!

266
00:08:11 --> 00:08:12
Authentic human drama.

267
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
Do you remember Baseball Ace paroled?

268
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
- Dougherty? - Back to life.

269
00:08:16 --> 00:08:17
It is just loaded his wife.

270
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
This shows that no thought well.

271
00:08:19 --> 00:08:23
If he had last year, we would have won the team of cops.

272
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
If you had asked me for Wilson, he would have said do not.

273
00:08:26 --> 00:08:27
Nobody asked you.

274
00:08:27 --> 00:08:28
This will be hard for others.

275
00:08:28 --> 00:08:29
I do not care, others.

276
00:08:29 --> 00:08:30
Words cemetery.

277
00:08:30 --> 00:08:33
Why not? We are buried. We are nothing more than dead.

278
00:08:33 --> 00:08:34
What are you thinking about?

279
00:08:34 --> 00:08:35
In you and me.

280
00:08:35 --> 00:08:36
Outside.

281
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
I was told you had wanted to do it from your input.

282
00:08:39 --> 00:08:40
I thought you were smarter.

283
00:08:40 --> 00:08:41
No sermons. Yes or no.

284
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
Inmates respect me, the warden too.

285
00:08:44 --> 00:08:48
I am calm, I help both sides, and never take sides.

286
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
Despite Munsey, I&#39;m still number one.

287
00:08:50 --> 00:08:51
I&#39;ve been here six years.

288
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
How many deals have had to elope?

289
00:08:54 --> 00:08:55
Six thousand.

290
00:08:55 --> 00:08:56
They are always ready.

291
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
Do you see that kind of linotype?

292
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
It is perpetual. He&#39;s been twelve years.

293
00:09:00 --> 00:09:01
Crenshaw.

294
00:09:01 --> 00:09:02
You know Collins. It is legit.

295
00:09:02 --> 00:09:03
How soon is the plan?

296
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
If there are no setbacks, for Tuesday.

297
00:09:05 --> 00:09:06
Do you also come, boss?

298
00:09:06 --> 00:09:08
- But good luck. - Is everything ready this time.

299
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
All ready, every Tuesday for twelve years.

300
00:09:11 --> 00:09:14
In twelve years, there will be next Tuesday.

301
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
I know that this cage is full of crazies.

302
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
One will do for the wall, another through a tunnel

303
00:09:19 --> 00:09:21
or he is going to fly in a homemade balloon.

304
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
Beautiful dreams are not my genre.

305
00:09:23 --> 00:09:24
It can be done.

306
00:09:24 --> 00:09:26
It was done before and will again. Here.

307
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
For us. For you and for me.

308
00:09:28 --> 00:09:31
If I abscond with someone, it would be you.

309
00:09:31 --> 00:09:33
But now I do not need.

310
00:09:33 --> 00:09:34
To you I can tell you why.

311
00:09:34 --> 00:09:35
They have promised me parole.

312
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
Soon, this one here go out the door.

313
00:09:37 --> 00:09:39
- Next Tuesday? - Can be...

314
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
Smoking and tie in movie night,

315
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
They were happy and had many children.

316
00:09:44 --> 00:09:45
I hope so.

317
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
Checkmate.

318
00:09:47 --> 00:09:48
Did you pluck again, soldier?

319
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
Chess, dominoes, all games.

320
00:09:50 --> 00:09:52
- You Never lose? - Very rarely.

321
00:09:52 --> 00:09:55
I was born with golden fingers, as they say.

322
00:09:55 --> 00:09:57
Almost won the &quot;Golden Gloves&quot;.

323
00:09:57 --> 00:10:00
I got a watch and a robe with my name.

324
00:10:00 --> 00:10:01
My partner was there, Henrietta.

325
00:10:01 --> 00:10:02
I have a kind you see in the infirmary.

326
00:10:02 --> 00:10:03
Do you thought this through?

327
00:10:03 --> 00:10:03
All right.

328
00:10:03 --> 00:10:04
Keep me in the film room.

329
00:10:04 --> 00:10:05
Wait for me, baby.

330
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
What about you and this broad?

331
00:10:07 --> 00:10:09
Be polite, insensitive man.

332
00:10:09 --> 00:10:10
It is a lady.

333
00:10:10 --> 00:10:12
This is crazy.

334
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
You smile to a photo, the besáis,

335
00:10:15 --> 00:10:16
as if it were real.

336
00:10:16 --> 00:10:17
It is.

337
00:10:17 --> 00:10:18
And you&#39;ll notice.

338
00:10:18 --> 00:10:18
It is true.

339
00:10:18 --> 00:10:22
To me, it looks like my wife ...

340
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
It is not just a simple model. She is special for everyone.

341
00:10:25 --> 00:10:27
If I look a long time, like you,

342
00:10:27 --> 00:10:29
Henrietta will look like?

343
00:10:29 --> 00:10:31
But if Henrietta is blonde.

344
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
It will not appear at all.

345
00:10:33 --> 00:10:34
It does not have to look like.

346
00:10:34 --> 00:10:37
Our model is an inspiration, brother Coy.

347
00:10:37 --> 00:10:40
It makes you think that you want to see.

348
00:10:40 --> 00:10:44
For example, in recent days, it makes me think of Flossie.

349
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
Never I have spoken of Flossie, right?

350
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
For me. she is all women I met,

351
00:10:49 --> 00:10:51
and still others that I know, I hope so.

352
00:10:51 --> 00:10:55
I met Flossie one night, where Eddie, in Miami.

353
00:10:55 --> 00:10:59
He had sold to a Linnet two parts of a mine radio

354
00:10:59 --> 00:11:00
and I am doubling my bets.

355
00:11:00 --> 00:11:05
He had met Flossie one half day, but we were close.

356
00:11:05 --> 00:11:08
The dice are delighted, thanks to her. Luck was with me.

357
00:11:08 --> 00:11:11
Suddenly, while I was in paradise,

358
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
I heard familiar sounds

359
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
The police was on a raid.

360
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
Everyone caught red-handed.

361
00:11:18 --> 00:11:22
The raid did not worry me, my stir a bit.

362
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
Flossie put it in her handbag.

363
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
Besides being beautiful, she knew that it was all about.

364
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
As also he knew where the door was relief.

365
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
It was not a mere tourist.

366
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
My car was waiting there.

367
00:11:34 --> 00:11:38
My money and my gun in a safe place. We took off.

368
00:11:38 --> 00:11:41
Sitting next to that doll dream,

369
00:11:41 --> 00:11:43
I felt float.

370
00:11:43 --> 00:11:46
Her brain, chassis, and all that goes with it

371
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
Better than a hand of six aces.

372
00:11:48 --> 00:11:51
But, to my regret, she knew also use a gun.

373
00:11:51 --> 00:11:52
My weapon!

374
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
I came to doubt that he was equipped to use it. Now I&#39;m sure.

375
00:11:55 --> 00:11:59
Do not speak. This time I lacked words.

376
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
I asked all my gain, and I will not deny anything a lady,

377
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
especially when it is armed.

378
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
Then I left the car

379
00:12:06 --> 00:12:09
without putting the slightest objection.

380
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
And that was the last time I saw

381
00:12:11 --> 00:12:14
my car, my money and my Flossie.

382
00:12:14 --> 00:12:17
I wonder who is scamming Flossie now ...

383
00:12:17 --> 00:12:18
I do not get it.

384
00:12:18 --> 00:12:20
Why do you want someone to remember something?

385
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
Who knows when you&#39;re inside,

386
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
what seems worse outside, here seems wonderful,

387
00:12:26 --> 00:12:29
nothing but because it happens outside.

388
00:12:29 --> 00:12:30
Okay, it happens.

389
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
Joe! How&#39;s it going?

390
00:12:32 --> 00:12:33
Regan.

391
00:12:33 --> 00:12:34
I am, Collins.

392
00:12:34 --> 00:12:35
Where were you?

393
00:12:35 --> 00:12:38
I have searched all day.

394
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
Frankie McLain died in the bunk next.

395
00:12:42 --> 00:12:44
And he gave me a message for you.

396
00:12:44 --> 00:12:48
The collector cost skin Frankie and me.

397
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
But in the collector,

398
00:12:50 --> 00:12:53
there is a way out of here.

399
00:12:53 --> 00:12:54
Follow.

400
00:12:54 --> 00:12:55
He said:

401
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
&quot;Ask the soldier how, during the war,

402
00:12:58 --> 00:12:59
They took the hill ... &quot;

403
00:12:59 --> 00:13:00
the hill…

404
00:13:00 --> 00:13:01
633.

405
00:13:01 --> 00:13:05
You have to reach the pit.

406
00:13:05 --> 00:13:06
It is necessary.

407
00:13:06 --> 00:13:06
Where is Tom?

408
00:13:06 --> 00:13:07
Follow in the cell.

409
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
Another letter to his wife.

410
00:13:09 --> 00:13:10
Dear Cora,

411
00:13:10 --> 00:13:11
without hearing from you.

412
00:13:11 --> 00:13:14
Not even a simple letter.

413
00:13:14 --> 00:13:15
I have crazy ideas.

414
00:13:15 --> 00:13:16
Good night dear.

415
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
- One moment, I&#39;m coming. - Take your time.

416
00:13:18 --> 00:13:19
News?

417
00:13:19 --> 00:13:20
Here?

418
00:13:20 --> 00:13:22
I found Harry Thomas and his wife.

419
00:13:22 --> 00:13:24
We saw we would be fine one day.

420
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
We&#39;d go out for a change.

421
00:13:26 --> 00:13:27
Make a wish.

422
00:13:27 --> 00:13:28
What have you said?

423
00:13:28 --> 00:13:29
Put it on.

424
00:13:29 --> 00:13:30
Beautiful.

425
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
It is the most beautiful thing in the world.

426
00:13:33 --> 00:13:34
It seems made for you.

427
00:13:34 --> 00:13:35
It makes me feel ...

428
00:13:35 --> 00:13:36
I do not know...

429
00:13:36 --> 00:13:37
It makes me feel someone.

430
00:13:37 --> 00:13:38
Where did you get it?

431
00:13:38 --> 00:13:39
Where did you get the money?

432
00:13:39 --> 00:13:40
Where did you get it?

433
00:13:40 --> 00:13:41
I stole altered books

434
00:13:41 --> 00:13:42
and I took $ 3000.

435
00:13:42 --> 00:13:42
Your?

436
00:13:42 --> 00:13:43
You stealing!

437
00:13:43 --> 00:13:44
- Why? - Look at how we live,

438
00:13:44 --> 00:13:46
had wanted things right,

439
00:13:46 --> 00:13:48
and I was dry.

440
00:13:48 --> 00:13:50
We ever leave.

441
00:13:50 --> 00:13:51
I had to do it.

442
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
All my life I dreamed no more than this: a fur coat like this.

443
00:13:55 --> 00:13:56
And I will not give it up!

444
00:13:56 --> 00:13:59
- If something happens? - Nothing matters,

445
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
except lose.

446
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
I&#39;m sorry about this morning.

447
00:14:03 --> 00:14:04
Those things happen.

448
00:14:04 --> 00:14:08
You&#39;re not a gulf as others in this cell.

449
00:14:08 --> 00:14:09
Why protect them?

450
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
We talked, Captain.

451
00:14:11 --> 00:14:14
Before you needed less my help ..

452
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
You I can make things easier.

453
00:14:16 --> 00:14:17
How to Wilson?

454
00:14:17 --> 00:14:18
Wilson was reckless.

455
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20
And the imprudent suffer accidents.

456
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
I love censor mail.

457
00:14:22 --> 00:14:25
These letters you wrote to your house, for example.

458
00:14:25 --> 00:14:26
Unanswered

459
00:14:26 --> 00:14:28
Will you please leave me alone.

460
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
She is most important to you in the world?

461
00:14:31 --> 00:14:33
Soon you will be entitled to conditional,

462
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
if you&#39;re good.

463
00:14:35 --> 00:14:37
And I&#39;m the one who decides.

464
00:14:37 --> 00:14:39
I can only help you.

465
00:14:39 --> 00:14:39
Nobody else.

466
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
Captain, I know I&#39;m just a petty thief.

467
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
I know I&#39;m a failure,

468
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
but I&#39;m not a snitch.

469
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
I like those qualities.

470
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
Stability. Fidelity.

471
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
You&#39;re right. Both are wasting time.

472
00:14:51 --> 00:14:55
I talking to you, and you write to your wife.

473
00:14:55 --> 00:14:56
Is there any news?

474
00:14:56 --> 00:14:57
In the mail this morning.

475
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
By pity, tell me!

476
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
In a sense you&#39;re a free man.

477
00:15:01 --> 00:15:02
Your wife files for divorce.

478
00:15:02 --> 00:15:03
Just a moment.

479
00:15:03 --> 00:15:03
Sit.

480
00:15:03 --> 00:15:04
I speak the warden.

481
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
I appeal to your common sense

482
00:15:06 --> 00:15:07
and I will direct.

483
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
Tension has increased in the last few weeks.

484
00:15:10 --> 00:15:11
I am aware of everything.

485
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
Disponéis your statutory privileges.

486
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
But if you insist on fighting among you,

487
00:15:17 --> 00:15:19
assaulting guards, causing &quot;accidents&quot;

488
00:15:19 --> 00:15:22
as the workshop this morning,

489
00:15:22 --> 00:15:23
all your privileges

490
00:15:23 --> 00:15:24
They will be revoked.

491
00:15:24 --> 00:15:25
So be careful with whom you relate.

492
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
A bad life prisoner can annoy everyone.

493
00:15:28 --> 00:15:29
stay tuned.

494
00:15:29 --> 00:15:30
Protect your interests,

495
00:15:30 --> 00:15:32
as I protect mine.

496
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
If still there is a violation,

497
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
if you can not avoid problems

498
00:15:36 --> 00:15:37
or &quot;accidents&quot;

499
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
I have to use all means to control you.

500
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
That is all. Accept this commitment

501
00:15:43 --> 00:15:47
and I promise that each detainee will be treated fairly.

502
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
Cell R17.

503
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
Detained McLain, cell R17, buried.

504
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
Collins returns to R17 insulation cell.

505
00:15:55 --> 00:15:57
One dead in front of other three arrested,

506
00:15:57 --> 00:15:59
all of the cell R17.

507
00:15:59 --> 00:16:00
Now a suicide.

508
00:16:00 --> 00:16:02
Same cell, same group, same problems.

509
00:16:02 --> 00:16:05
We have nothing to do with it. One, you said the suicide.

510
00:16:05 --> 00:16:06
Lack of evidence.

511
00:16:06 --> 00:16:07
Tom was one of ours.

512
00:16:07 --> 00:16:08
Yes, you loved you.

513
00:16:08 --> 00:16:11
We do not play to Tom. We were in the cinema

514
00:16:11 --> 00:16:12
What you were, right.

515
00:16:12 --> 00:16:15
And Collins with the doctor when they killed Wilson.

516
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
I&#39;m realist. I do not believe in coincidences,

517
00:16:17 --> 00:16:18
especially if repeated.

518
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
Attacked the warden, the guards and me.

519
00:16:21 --> 00:16:25
You are not eligible for civilian life, and reject life in prison.

520
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
Tomorrow begins a new life.

521
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
All work in the pit.

522
00:16:29 --> 00:16:30
Soldier.

523
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
Hill 633. What does that mean?

524
00:16:32 --> 00:16:35
A hill in Italy, near Rome. Why?

525
00:16:35 --> 00:16:35
Account.

526
00:16:35 --> 00:16:38
The Nazis had, and we had order to win.

527
00:16:38 --> 00:16:39
What you did to assault?

528
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
You try to attack it while you strafe the Nazis.

529
00:16:42 --> 00:16:44
Spencer, pass me chess.

530
00:16:44 --> 00:16:45
Light.

531
00:16:45 --> 00:16:46
Here the hill.

532
00:16:46 --> 00:16:47
Here, we.

533
00:16:47 --> 00:16:48
Here the mountains

534
00:16:48 --> 00:16:49
And here the sea.

535
00:16:49 --> 00:16:50
- We were fried. - But you you took.

536
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
Yes. We.

537
00:16:52 --> 00:16:53
Light again.

538
00:16:53 --> 00:16:54
a boat was sent.

539
00:16:54 --> 00:16:55
They landed here.

540
00:16:55 --> 00:16:56
Bombing support.

541
00:16:56 --> 00:16:58
At H-hour, we began the assault.

542
00:16:58 --> 00:17:00
The Nazis returned fire towards us.

543
00:17:00 --> 00:17:02
Then the others attacked them from behind.

544
00:17:02 --> 00:17:02
It worked.

545
00:17:02 --> 00:17:03
Yes, we did.

546
00:17:03 --> 00:17:04
At least most.

547
00:17:04 --> 00:17:05
But we did it.

548
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
They could cover both flanks.

549
00:17:07 --> 00:17:08
Thank you, soldier.

550
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
What is your relationship with us? Where do you want to go?

551
00:17:10 --> 00:17:11
Morning.

552
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
We will see tomorrow.

553
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
I think one thing.

554
00:17:15 --> 00:17:19
This prison would need an insurance company.

555
00:17:19 --> 00:17:20
Attention all inmates.

556
00:17:20 --> 00:17:23
Privileges suspended. Back to the cell after work.

557
00:17:23 --> 00:17:25
Sorry, Gallagher, the way things are.

558
00:17:25 --> 00:17:28
We are punishing everyone for suicide Lister.

559
00:17:28 --> 00:17:30
The situation gets out of control. We had no choice.

560
00:17:30 --> 00:17:31
Have we? will mean Munsey.

561
00:17:31 --> 00:17:32
The warden&#39;s me!

562
00:17:32 --> 00:17:32
This comes from him.

563
00:17:32 --> 00:17:34
All against Munsey, that I&#39;m sick.

564
00:17:34 --> 00:17:35
He knows his job, and he does.

565
00:17:35 --> 00:17:38
I tried to be fair to you, but to no avail.

566
00:17:38 --> 00:17:41
We do charity, but discipline.

567
00:17:41 --> 00:17:43
Without exception. Nothing interviews.

568
00:17:43 --> 00:17:44
I do not care the newspaper.

569
00:17:44 --> 00:17:45
You got to McCallum?

570
00:17:45 --> 00:17:45
Please try again.

571
00:17:45 --> 00:17:46
Thanks for having me.

572
00:17:46 --> 00:17:47
Just a moment.

573
00:17:47 --> 00:17:48
One more thing.

574
00:17:48 --> 00:17:50
I will convocaros.

575
00:17:50 --> 00:17:52
This letter concerns you.

576
00:17:52 --> 00:17:55
We have always known how to work together.

577
00:17:55 --> 00:17:57
You&#39;ve helped me with men.

578
00:17:57 --> 00:17:58
What you spend?

579
00:17:58 --> 00:17:59
The prison administration.

580
00:17:59 --> 00:18:02
Parole hearings are canceled indefinitely.

581
00:18:02 --> 00:18:03
How long?

582
00:18:03 --> 00:18:04
For a year?

583
00:18:04 --> 00:18:05
Two? Five?

584
00:18:05 --> 00:18:06
Not necessarily.

585
00:18:06 --> 00:18:07
I am sorry.

586
00:18:07 --> 00:18:08
It&#39;s not my fault.

587
00:18:08 --> 00:18:09
It&#39;s your fault!

588
00:18:09 --> 00:18:11
You&#39;ve always supported Munsey!

589
00:18:11 --> 00:18:14
The last time you told me that the doors would open for me.

590
00:18:14 --> 00:18:17
In a few days I would be in my house.

591
00:18:17 --> 00:18:18
My home!

592
00:18:18 --> 00:18:19
You should know.

593
00:18:19 --> 00:18:21
These doors are only opened three times.

594
00:18:21 --> 00:18:25
When you are entering, when the sentence is served or when you die.

595
00:18:25 --> 00:18:26
Still I tell you?

596
00:18:26 --> 00:18:27
What&#39;s up friends?

597
00:18:27 --> 00:18:29
I have commissioned a story

598
00:18:29 --> 00:18:31
about how good the food here.

599
00:18:31 --> 00:18:32
try it,

600
00:18:32 --> 00:18:34
and you choose Time Man of the Year.

601
00:18:34 --> 00:18:35
This seems interesting.

602
00:18:35 --> 00:18:36
What is it?

603
00:18:36 --> 00:18:39
- Message to Collins in the pit. - We do not remove eye.

604
00:18:39 --> 00:18:40
Smell this.

605
00:18:40 --> 00:18:42
Now you know how Rin Tin Tin died.

606
00:18:42 --> 00:18:43
A telegram.

607
00:18:43 --> 00:18:43
Collins.

608
00:18:43 --> 00:18:44
What are you talking about?

609
00:18:44 --> 00:18:47
I have to bring the food to the pit.

610
00:18:47 --> 00:18:48
I do not like.

611
00:18:48 --> 00:18:51
Down there is unhealthy environment.

612
00:18:51 --> 00:18:52
Do not aim,

613
00:18:52 --> 00:18:53
only expires.

614
00:18:53 --> 00:18:55
I&#39;ve seen those going to the pit.

615
00:18:55 --> 00:18:56
More than come out.

616
00:18:56 --> 00:18:59
If you continue like this, they will be missing men.

617
00:18:59 --> 00:19:01
And they built upside down.

618
00:19:01 --> 00:19:04
Nobody knows where that will pit, where leaves

619
00:19:04 --> 00:19:05
or it serves for something.

620
00:19:05 --> 00:19:06
As I see it ...

621
00:19:06 --> 00:19:08
What are you trying to say?

622
00:19:08 --> 00:19:09
I would like a favor.

623
00:19:09 --> 00:19:10
Do not ask me a favor.

624
00:19:10 --> 00:19:11
I can not be bought.

625
00:19:11 --> 00:19:13
And you would not have enough money.

626
00:19:13 --> 00:19:15
My wife was like that bridge.

627
00:19:15 --> 00:19:16
What are you talking about?

628
00:19:16 --> 00:19:17
wonderful structure.

629
00:19:17 --> 00:19:18
And the air most of the time.

630
00:19:18 --> 00:19:19
Leave it works, go ...

631
00:19:19 --> 00:19:20
It&#39;s bad.

632
00:19:20 --> 00:19:21
I&#39;ve said it to work!

633
00:19:21 --> 00:19:22
I&#39;m fine, Soldier.

634
00:19:22 --> 00:19:22
Food!

635
00:19:22 --> 00:19:22
I do not want.

636
00:19:22 --> 00:19:23
Take it.

637
00:19:23 --> 00:19:25
For &quot;Tuesday,&quot; you were right.

638
00:19:25 --> 00:19:26
In the chapel at seven.

639
00:19:26 --> 00:19:27
We&#39;re just looking around.

640
00:19:27 --> 00:19:28
To choose or buy?

641
00:19:28 --> 00:19:30
Orders: surveillance thoroughly.

642
00:19:30 --> 00:19:34
Here, Other monitors. If you want to be you, come and pray ...

643
00:19:34 --> 00:19:35
Here the tower.

644
00:19:35 --> 00:19:36
We need to open.

645
00:19:36 --> 00:19:38
When the door opens, the low bridge.

646
00:19:38 --> 00:19:41
Everyone knows, there is no other way than this bridge.

647
00:19:41 --> 00:19:43
First, take the tower.

648
00:19:43 --> 00:19:45
You&#39;ll be here, inside.

649
00:19:45 --> 00:19:48
When we get out of the pit, we&#39;ll be there,

650
00:19:48 --> 00:19:49
abroad.

651
00:19:49 --> 00:19:51
Tower attacked from both sides.

652
00:19:51 --> 00:19:53
They have guns and ammunition.

653
00:19:53 --> 00:19:54
But only a submachine gun.

654
00:19:54 --> 00:19:55
Only one.

655
00:19:55 --> 00:19:58
They can not cover both sides.

656
00:19:58 --> 00:19:59
If we take the tower ...

657
00:19:59 --> 00:20:00
How many men?

658
00:20:00 --> 00:20:01
Five, with me. All arranged.

659
00:20:01 --> 00:20:01
With me six.

660
00:20:01 --> 00:20:03
My man will not know yours.

661
00:20:03 --> 00:20:05
Mine either. When?

662
00:20:05 --> 00:20:06
- Tomorrow at 12:15. - You&#39;re crazy!

663
00:20:06 --> 00:20:07
It is our chance.

664
00:20:07 --> 00:20:08
It takes time.

665
00:20:08 --> 00:20:10
The longer we wait, the more we risk.

666
00:20:10 --> 00:20:13
One type deflates, another is removed, other chatters.

667
00:20:13 --> 00:20:15
Thus: fast. It strongly hits,

668
00:20:15 --> 00:20:16
it strikes fast, and wins.

669
00:20:16 --> 00:20:17
Morning!

670
00:20:17 --> 00:20:19
Okay, Collins. morning.

671
00:20:19 --> 00:20:20
You handle explosives.

672
00:20:20 --> 00:20:21
- It will be difficult. - I need them.

673
00:20:21 --> 00:20:22
Okay, you will have them.

674
00:20:22 --> 00:20:23
Tomorrow then.

675
00:20:23 --> 00:20:25
In the courtyard las12: 15.

676
00:20:25 --> 00:20:26
Just two minutes.

677
00:20:26 --> 00:20:29
At exactly 12:17, I&#39;ll open the door from the tower.

678
00:20:29 --> 00:20:30
12:17.

679
00:20:30 --> 00:20:31
The courtyard will be full.

680
00:20:31 --> 00:20:33
They all go to escape.

681
00:20:33 --> 00:20:35
You&#39;ve planned everything. But we do not need a car?

682
00:20:35 --> 00:20:38
And money? We not get very far without pasta.

683
00:20:38 --> 00:20:40
Or unclothed. We were located.

684
00:20:40 --> 00:20:41
It is all I can say.

685
00:20:41 --> 00:20:43
We talk about escape from long ago.

686
00:20:43 --> 00:20:44
Well here it is.

687
00:20:44 --> 00:20:45
Do not be angry, Joe,

688
00:20:45 --> 00:20:47
but I have a very short sentence ...

689
00:20:47 --> 00:20:48
Did you run Condemns? That does not exist.

690
00:20:48 --> 00:20:49
You tell us very little.

691
00:20:49 --> 00:20:50
We do not know if this will work.

692
00:20:50 --> 00:20:52
You&#39;re going so fast that I ...

693
00:20:52 --> 00:20:54
Say it! You will rajas!

694
00:20:54 --> 00:20:56
You can not do that!

695
00:20:56 --> 00:20:57
You can not leave now.

696
00:20:57 --> 00:20:58
Understand me, Joe.

697
00:20:58 --> 00:20:59
They come!

698
00:20:59 --> 00:20:59
How many

699
00:20:59 --> 00:20:59
Two.

700
00:20:59 --> 00:21:00
I take care of them.

701
00:21:00 --> 00:21:01
Three here.

702
00:21:01 --> 00:21:02
Yes or no?

703
00:21:02 --> 00:21:03
Nothing is guaranteed.

704
00:21:03 --> 00:21:04
It is all or nothing.

705
00:21:04 --> 00:21:05
But make up your mind now.

706
00:21:05 --> 00:21:06
Now!

707
00:21:06 --> 00:21:08
Either way, without rancor.

708
00:21:08 --> 00:21:09
You, Joe ...

709
00:21:09 --> 00:21:10
I am going.

710
00:21:10 --> 00:21:11
He was sure.

711
00:21:11 --> 00:21:12
I also.

712
00:21:12 --> 00:21:13
Morning!

713
00:21:13 --> 00:21:15
What shall I do?

714
00:21:15 --> 00:21:17
If I train can still be champion.

715
00:21:17 --> 00:21:18
Who knows?

716
00:21:18 --> 00:21:20
when we meet again

717
00:21:20 --> 00:21:23
sentaríais ye ringside free.

718
00:21:23 --> 00:21:24
You dream.

719
00:21:24 --> 00:21:25
Once outside,

720
00:21:25 --> 00:21:26
We will not ever see.

721
00:21:26 --> 00:21:27
A great city for me.

722
00:21:27 --> 00:21:30
With millions of neighbors, nobody cares about you.

723
00:21:30 --> 00:21:31
I look for a lass.

724
00:21:31 --> 00:21:32
And then...

725
00:21:32 --> 00:21:33
that&#39;s all.

726
00:21:33 --> 00:21:35
Henrietta will be surprised.

727
00:21:35 --> 00:21:38
I think we will make a long trip.

728
00:21:38 --> 00:21:41
Many prisoners are married when they leave.

729
00:21:41 --> 00:21:43
Get marry! I not dream!

730
00:21:43 --> 00:21:44
Good luck, Coy.

731
00:21:44 --> 00:21:45
Do you come back to finances?

732
00:21:45 --> 00:21:48
I do not believe. Printing costs are too high.

733
00:21:48 --> 00:21:50
Still I do not know what will.

734
00:21:50 --> 00:21:51
And you, soldier?

735
00:21:51 --> 00:21:52
I&#39;ll go far.

736
00:21:52 --> 00:21:55
Since the war I want to return to a village in Italy.

737
00:21:55 --> 00:21:57
But it is my fate.

738
00:21:57 --> 00:21:59
I could not help a matter, then the other.

739
00:21:59 --> 00:22:01
In short, I never went back.

740
00:22:01 --> 00:22:02
Maybe this time ...

741
00:22:02 --> 00:22:02
Robert!

742
00:22:02 --> 00:22:04
Go away. It has been the military police.

743
00:22:04 --> 00:22:06
When? What did they say?

744
00:22:06 --> 00:22:09
I already told you, it&#39;s nothing. There are more important things.

745
00:22:09 --> 00:22:11
He has not brought food as he leaves.

746
00:22:11 --> 00:22:12
In the truck.

747
00:22:12 --> 00:22:15
You do not&#39;ll catch nothing. You&#39;ll queue like everyone else. You&#39;ll eat with everyone.

748
00:22:15 --> 00:22:15
What if there is nothing?

749
00:22:15 --> 00:22:17
You all go hungry.

750
00:22:17 --> 00:22:18
Not everyone has your luck, my daughter.

751
00:22:18 --> 00:22:20
A great love that calms the appetite.

752
00:22:20 --> 00:22:21
Robert is not against. You, yes?

753
00:22:21 --> 00:22:23
He does not know you like I do.

754
00:22:23 --> 00:22:27
Is it so wrong to accept the food of those who have taken them?

755
00:22:27 --> 00:22:29
It is not personal.

756
00:22:29 --> 00:22:32
If you are not stingy with bombs, you ought not be with the food.

757
00:22:32 --> 00:22:33
Generous Americans ...

758
00:22:33 --> 00:22:35
Enough talking. Food supplies are back, go after them.

759
00:22:35 --> 00:22:37
Hates you. He hates your uniform.

760
00:22:37 --> 00:22:39
You fought in Sicily. And still continuing.

761
00:22:39 --> 00:22:41
I&#39;m not in a position to hate anyone.

762
00:22:41 --> 00:22:42
I&#39;m crazy, so I cry.

763
00:22:42 --> 00:22:45
In a war cries easily.

764
00:22:45 --> 00:22:47
Promise me you will not return.

765
00:22:47 --> 00:22:48
If the police find you here ...

766
00:22:48 --> 00:22:50
Feed us, is against the law.

767
00:22:50 --> 00:22:51
The law is secondary,

768
00:22:51 --> 00:22:53
my wife comes first.

769
00:22:53 --> 00:22:54
Your police returns.

770
00:22:54 --> 00:22:56
Not a word about the food!

771
00:22:56 --> 00:22:57
We have not seen Robert before.

772
00:22:57 --> 00:22:58
I wanted water for the truck.

773
00:22:58 --> 00:22:59
And if they find out I&#39;m lying?

774
00:22:59 --> 00:23:00
Do I risk my life for you?

775
00:23:00 --> 00:23:01
I risk mine for you.

776
00:23:01 --> 00:23:03
For her. I will not lie to you.

777
00:23:03 --> 00:23:06
You and your police can kill among you.

778
00:23:06 --> 00:23:07
Sit down!

779
00:23:07 --> 00:23:08
Gina, it will not move from there.

780
00:23:08 --> 00:23:10
I am seeking water. If I believe I have a chance.

781
00:23:10 --> 00:23:12
You have nothing to do with it. Remember it!

782
00:23:12 --> 00:23:12
Soldier!

783
00:23:12 --> 00:23:14
Awake!

784
00:23:14 --> 00:23:16
You&#39;d have missed a story!

785
00:23:16 --> 00:23:17
Go, Spencer.

786
00:23:17 --> 00:23:19
As I was saying,

787
00:23:19 --> 00:23:21
I was there, surrounded on all sides.

788
00:23:21 --> 00:23:24
The people in front, the researchers behind.

789
00:23:24 --> 00:23:26
Sheriff men nearby.

790
00:23:26 --> 00:23:28
But I remained firm,

791
00:23:28 --> 00:23:30
smiling, sure of my rights.

792
00:23:30 --> 00:23:31
And so?

793
00:23:31 --> 00:23:32
Here I am.

794
00:23:32 --> 00:23:33
And worth. Let us try to sleep.

795
00:23:33 --> 00:23:34
I like listening to Spencer.

796
00:23:34 --> 00:23:35
He has already said too much.

797
00:23:35 --> 00:23:38
The walls hear, and always has the same.

798
00:23:38 --> 00:23:41
Which is the answer? Keep each detainee

799
00:23:41 --> 00:23:42
in solitary confinement?

800
00:23:42 --> 00:23:44
Other prisons have this problem.

801
00:23:44 --> 00:23:45
But they solved one way or another.

802
00:23:45 --> 00:23:47
We&#39;ve been hard times.

803
00:23:47 --> 00:23:48
Never like this.

804
00:23:48 --> 00:23:50
McCallum back tomorrow. Why?

805
00:23:50 --> 00:23:51
Can not you leave me alone?

806
00:23:51 --> 00:23:53
Everything has gone wrong.

807
00:23:53 --> 00:23:56
I do not know who is responsible,

808
00:23:56 --> 00:23:58
just I know that every prisoner hates us.

809
00:23:58 --> 00:23:59
Not &quot;us&quot;, &quot;me&quot;.

810
00:23:59 --> 00:24:00
&quot;They hate me.

811
00:24:00 --> 00:24:01
I wonder why.

812
00:24:01 --> 00:24:04
Wear a uniform, see if you love.

813
00:24:04 --> 00:24:07
You talk to them by the micro, I with the nightstick.

814
00:24:07 --> 00:24:09
You make the rules. I, I apply.

815
00:24:09 --> 00:24:10
But there are ways to do it ...

816
00:24:10 --> 00:24:11
Can be.

817
00:24:11 --> 00:24:13
I do not criticize. Is that...

818
00:24:13 --> 00:24:14
But of course!

819
00:24:14 --> 00:24:15
And he may be right.

820
00:24:15 --> 00:24:18
I just know I do my job as I understand it.

821
00:24:18 --> 00:24:19
But if I&#39;m the cause of these problems,

822
00:24:19 --> 00:24:21
if I&#39;m wrong and inmates are right,

823
00:24:21 --> 00:24:23
resign immediately.

824
00:24:23 --> 00:24:25
That is what would the inmates.

825
00:24:25 --> 00:24:26
That is not the answer.

826
00:24:26 --> 00:24:29
You said it: We&#39;ve had difficult times.

827
00:24:29 --> 00:24:31
And we here together.

828
00:24:31 --> 00:24:34
Keep going so.

829
00:24:34 --> 00:24:36
This should be celebrated.

830
00:24:36 --> 00:24:37
¿Alcaide?

831
00:24:37 --> 00:24:38
I go to bed. Goodnight.

832
00:24:38 --> 00:24:40
Do not get discouraged.

833
00:24:40 --> 00:24:42
It is the standard of the best stories.

834
00:24:42 --> 00:24:45
Everyone lives happily until eternity.

835
00:24:45 --> 00:24:48
Do not you think I&#39;m serious?

836
00:24:48 --> 00:24:49
In a million words:

837
00:24:49 --> 00:24:50
do not.

838
00:24:50 --> 00:24:51
You are wrong.

839
00:24:51 --> 00:24:53
I want to help the governor.

840
00:24:53 --> 00:24:55
But ... it is muddled.

841
00:24:55 --> 00:24:58
He does not know that kindness is weakness.

842
00:24:58 --> 00:25:01
And weakness is an evil that makes servants, not leaders.

843
00:25:01 --> 00:25:05
I think it was a great leader who said. &quot;The meek shall inherit the earth&quot;

844
00:25:05 --> 00:25:07
Science says otherwise.

845
00:25:07 --> 00:25:09
In nature, the weak die

846
00:25:09 --> 00:25:11
to live strong.

847
00:25:11 --> 00:25:12
Authority,

848
00:25:12 --> 00:25:13
ability,

849
00:25:13 --> 00:25:14
imagination.

850
00:25:14 --> 00:25:16
That is the big difference between men.

851
00:25:16 --> 00:25:18
I&#39;m in the middle of prisoners,

852
00:25:18 --> 00:25:20
thieves, murderers,

853
00:25:20 --> 00:25:22
alone, unarmed.

854
00:25:22 --> 00:25:23
But they respect me.

855
00:25:23 --> 00:25:24
I obey.

856
00:25:24 --> 00:25:25
That does well.

857
00:25:25 --> 00:25:27
The seat of the governor.

858
00:25:27 --> 00:25:28
You feel good.

859
00:25:28 --> 00:25:28
It is drunk.

860
00:25:28 --> 00:25:30
Why not? I am a very ordinary man

861
00:25:30 --> 00:25:32
I drunk whiskey.

862
00:25:32 --> 00:25:33
What you do you get drunk?

863
00:25:33 --> 00:25:34
The power?

864
00:25:34 --> 00:25:36
You flatter me. I&#39;m just a cop.

865
00:25:36 --> 00:25:38
Execute the orders of the governor.

866
00:25:38 --> 00:25:41
Would you crucify he ordered the prisoners?

867
00:25:41 --> 00:25:44
Do what the inmate Lister crash?

868
00:25:44 --> 00:25:48
He saw him enter his cell. And back out.

869
00:25:48 --> 00:25:51
What happened in the meantime? Had their mail censored?

870
00:25:51 --> 00:25:53
Did he refused to give any information?

871
00:25:53 --> 00:25:56
Or he lied a little about your wife?

872
00:25:56 --> 00:25:58
You will have to stop drinking, doctor.

873
00:25:58 --> 00:26:01
Imagination plays her chores.

874
00:26:01 --> 00:26:04
Visits to the cells are me work. Look out.

875
00:26:04 --> 00:26:05
That&#39;s how I control them.

876
00:26:05 --> 00:26:06
Are the controls?

877
00:26:06 --> 00:26:08
He will tell them torture.

878
00:26:08 --> 00:26:11
The more you do suffer more enjoy.

879
00:26:11 --> 00:26:14
You never leave this job.

880
00:26:14 --> 00:26:16
Where you would find many pads

881
00:26:16 --> 00:26:18
to nail your pins?

882
00:26:18 --> 00:26:20
Did I speak in that tone?

883
00:26:20 --> 00:26:22
I care, but would starve.

884
00:26:22 --> 00:26:24
Butcher species.

885
00:26:24 --> 00:26:27
For me it is the last stage.

886
00:26:27 --> 00:26:30
but for you is only the beginning is not it?

887
00:26:30 --> 00:26:32
You are Genghis Khan,

888
00:26:32 --> 00:26:33
Alexander the Great,

889
00:26:33 --> 00:26:34
Cease.

890
00:26:34 --> 00:26:36
Look at yourself in the chair warden.

891
00:26:36 --> 00:26:38
Caesar proving his throne!

892
00:26:38 --> 00:26:39
Stop!

893
00:26:39 --> 00:26:41
Is this the César cries &quot;enough&quot;?

894
00:26:41 --> 00:26:42
Go Go.

895
00:26:42 --> 00:26:44
Are you predictable, Munsey.

896
00:26:44 --> 00:26:47
Each of their reactions are predictable.

897
00:26:47 --> 00:26:48
You have cheated,

898
00:26:48 --> 00:26:50
He has lied, he has killed.

899
00:26:50 --> 00:26:53
It is worse than the worst prisoners.

900
00:26:53 --> 00:26:55
You&#39;re the psychopath, not them!

901
00:26:55 --> 00:26:57
It is that, Munsey.

902
00:26:57 --> 00:26:58
No skill.

903
00:26:58 --> 00:26:59
No imagination.

904
00:26:59 --> 00:27:00
Only force.

905
00:27:00 --> 00:27:01
Brute force.

906
00:27:01 --> 00:27:03
Congratulations.

907
00:27:03 --> 00:27:05
The force causes the leaders, yes.

908
00:27:05 --> 00:27:07
But forget one thing.

909
00:27:07 --> 00:27:09
Also it destroyed.

910
00:27:09 --> 00:27:11
At 200 meters there is a small road. Turn right.

911
00:27:11 --> 00:27:13
We have to do 160 kilometers. We must not stop.

912
00:27:13 --> 00:27:15
- Shut up. - Okay, Joe.

913
00:27:15 --> 00:27:16
Why you not look after the coup?

914
00:27:16 --> 00:27:18
I said that we stop us.

915
00:27:18 --> 00:27:19
I&#39;ll only be a couple of minutes.

916
00:27:19 --> 00:27:20
It&#39;s okay?

917
00:27:20 --> 00:27:22
No complains. But it still hurts.

918
00:27:22 --> 00:27:23
Do not miss anything.

919
00:27:23 --> 00:27:26
I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here.

920
00:27:26 --> 00:27:27
Ruth.

921
00:27:27 --> 00:27:28
Joe, dear.

922
00:27:28 --> 00:27:29
- I dreamed you. - A nice dream?

923
00:27:29 --> 00:27:31
We chased down a hill.

924
00:27:31 --> 00:27:32
- And me pillabas? - Almost.

925
00:27:32 --> 00:27:33
But if I run very slowly.

926
00:27:33 --> 00:27:36
It is my dream, so I can put the end you want.

927
00:27:36 --> 00:27:38
Soon you will leave that chair.

928
00:27:38 --> 00:27:39
And it&#39;s not a dream.

929
00:27:39 --> 00:27:40
We will give a long walk.

930
00:27:40 --> 00:27:41
Or by car or by train.

931
00:27:41 --> 00:27:42
- Walking. - Around the world.

932
00:27:42 --> 00:27:43
I am already tired.

933
00:27:43 --> 00:27:45
Sadie will bring the food.

934
00:27:45 --> 00:27:46
And then we&#39;ll talk.

935
00:27:46 --> 00:27:49
I have a million things to say. I made a list

936
00:27:49 --> 00:27:50
I can not stay.

937
00:27:50 --> 00:27:53
- Next time ... - Another next time?

938
00:27:53 --> 00:27:56
It is the last. This time, I&#39;ll stay.

939
00:27:56 --> 00:27:57
I love you, Ruth.

940
00:27:57 --> 00:27:59
Why? I&#39;m sick.

941
00:27:59 --> 00:28:00
Because you love me?

942
00:28:00 --> 00:28:03
Nobody wants a sick. People have pity them.

943
00:28:03 --> 00:28:06
I&#39;m not people. I&#39;m Joe Collins, a type.

944
00:28:06 --> 00:28:09
Forgive me. I&#39;m selfish.

945
00:28:09 --> 00:28:12
Every time you go away, I fear that you will not return.

946
00:28:12 --> 00:28:15
If only I knew where you came from, or where you go, what you do ...

947
00:28:15 --> 00:28:18
Ruth, leave things as they have always been.

948
00:28:18 --> 00:28:21
A guy who ran out of gasoline and saw a small ranch on the road

949
00:28:21 --> 00:28:24
and he found the most important thing in his life, sitting in a wheelchair.

950
00:28:24 --> 00:28:26
Let&#39;s leave it a little more.

951
00:28:26 --> 00:28:27
A day, two, perhaps.

952
00:28:27 --> 00:28:29
Then I&#39;ll tell you everything you want to know.

953
00:28:29 --> 00:28:30
I know what I know.

954
00:28:30 --> 00:28:31
The rest does not count.

955
00:28:31 --> 00:28:33
If it were not so sick, you help.

956
00:28:33 --> 00:28:35
There are many types of patients.

957
00:28:35 --> 00:28:36
Perhaps we can help each other.

958
00:28:36 --> 00:28:37
I love you, Joe.

959
00:28:37 --> 00:28:38
Finish your dream.

960
00:28:38 --> 00:28:40
I&#39;ll go slower, not have to run fast.

961
00:28:40 --> 00:28:41
And when you catch me,

962
00:28:41 --> 00:28:42
hold me strong.

963
00:28:42 --> 00:28:43
Come on.

964
00:28:43 --> 00:28:45
A couple of hours. Let&#39;s stay together.

965
00:28:45 --> 00:28:46
Is full!

966
00:28:46 --> 00:28:47
Slowly, Roberts. Do you have time.

967
00:28:47 --> 00:28:48
I&#39;ll take care of it.

968
00:28:48 --> 00:28:50
On the right. That lever.

969
00:28:50 --> 00:28:52
When we enter the accionas.

970
00:28:52 --> 00:28:55
That will take us to another road leading to the tower.

971
00:28:55 --> 00:28:57
- What talk? - I asked the time.

972
00:28:57 --> 00:28:58
Why? Do you get paid by the hour?

973
00:28:58 --> 00:29:00
- Another article? - Yes, but a good one.

974
00:29:00 --> 00:29:03
Mechanical you are going to make you famous. Will come out on the front page.

975
00:29:03 --> 00:29:05
Get out in one of those we are here.

976
00:29:05 --> 00:29:06
Tell me, Charlie,

977
00:29:06 --> 00:29:09
do you teach prison on a mechanic?

978
00:29:09 --> 00:29:12
That my departure, I will not work as a mechanic.

979
00:29:12 --> 00:29:13
And you, Andy?

980
00:29:13 --> 00:29:14
A statement to the press?

981
00:29:14 --> 00:29:16
Not much. I did what they told me.

982
00:29:16 --> 00:29:17
All?

983
00:29:17 --> 00:29:18
Where do you keep your tools?

984
00:29:18 --> 00:29:20
Eight firebombs. Quality.

985
00:29:20 --> 00:29:22
Eight detonators. And that to illuminate the patio.

986
00:29:22 --> 00:29:24
I repeat: I always do what I&#39;m told.

987
00:29:24 --> 00:29:26
We print at 12:15 o&#39;clock.

988
00:29:26 --> 00:29:27
I will be there.

989
00:29:27 --> 00:29:30
Spell your name right. For the album of his wife.

990
00:29:30 --> 00:29:32
- News. Good and bad. - Good?

991
00:29:32 --> 00:29:33
Eight pumps. Truck ready.

992
00:29:33 --> 00:29:34
- Bad? - No dynamite.

993
00:29:34 --> 00:29:35
- We need it. - Impossible, I come from there.

994
00:29:35 --> 00:29:36
- Get Them - No time.

995
00:29:36 --> 00:29:37
Listen, Louie.

996
00:29:37 --> 00:29:39
I have a mission for you.

997
00:29:39 --> 00:29:40
Go see Collins.

998
00:29:40 --> 00:29:40
He is with us

999
00:29:40 --> 00:29:41
Tell no dynamite.

1000
00:29:41 --> 00:29:42
If we continue.

1001
00:29:42 --> 00:29:43
Or we left.

1002
00:29:43 --> 00:29:44
You have 45 minutes.

1003
00:29:44 --> 00:29:46
Do you think I will not spoil the party?

1004
00:29:46 --> 00:29:48
I try to explain that ...

1005
00:29:48 --> 00:29:51
All visits are canceled. Even family.

1006
00:29:51 --> 00:29:53
- Discover yourself. - For a pass.

1007
00:29:53 --> 00:29:56
- To where? - The moat. Let&#39;s do a special.

1008
00:29:56 --> 00:29:57
What, what&#39;s wrong?

1009
00:29:57 --> 00:30:00
Nothing. You want to do an article? We will help

1010
00:30:00 --> 00:30:01
Captain Munsey office.

1011
00:30:01 --> 00:30:02
Does the car whom?

1012
00:30:02 --> 00:30:04
¿McCallum? Let him in.

1013
00:30:04 --> 00:30:05
Any problem?

1014
00:30:05 --> 00:30:06
Munsey gave orders.

1015
00:30:06 --> 00:30:07
You want to go to the pit?

1016
00:30:07 --> 00:30:08
Yes, is there something wrong with that?

1017
00:30:08 --> 00:30:10
- Is there Munsey? - Is waiting.

1018
00:30:10 --> 00:30:11
Wait here.

1019
00:30:11 --> 00:30:15
A client for the pit. The 7033, inmate Miller.

1020
00:30:15 --> 00:30:16
The man Gallagher?

1021
00:30:16 --> 00:30:18
I wanted a pass.

1022
00:30:18 --> 00:30:19
You want to see it?

1023
00:30:19 --> 00:30:20
Yes. That between

1024
00:30:20 --> 00:30:22
Interested pit?

1025
00:30:22 --> 00:30:23
I do not get it.

1026
00:30:23 --> 00:30:26
Prepare an extra on the activities of the prisoners.

1027
00:30:26 --> 00:30:29
It&#39;s true, you&#39;re a journalist.

1028
00:30:29 --> 00:30:30
Sit down.

1029
00:30:30 --> 00:30:32
Not there. Here.

1030
00:30:32 --> 00:30:36
I have gone to the pit. I have gone over a hundred times.

1031
00:30:36 --> 00:30:37
Why all this?

1032
00:30:37 --> 00:30:38
Tell me, Louie.

1033
00:30:38 --> 00:30:41
How an unlettered becomes journalist?

1034
00:30:41 --> 00:30:42
Even a journalist star?

1035
00:30:42 --> 00:30:43
I dont know.

1036
00:30:43 --> 00:30:44
Me: Yes.

1037
00:30:44 --> 00:30:45
Why the gap?

1038
00:30:45 --> 00:30:46
I&#39;ve already said.

1039
00:30:46 --> 00:30:48
- Tell me again. - To write an article.

1040
00:30:48 --> 00:30:49
I do not like that answer.

1041
00:30:49 --> 00:30:50
That&#39;s it, Jackson.

1042
00:30:50 --> 00:30:53
Gallagher has commanded you to see someone.

1043
00:30:53 --> 00:30:55
- To Whom? - To nobody. I&#39;ll write...

1044
00:30:55 --> 00:30:56
Wrong answer.

1045
00:30:56 --> 00:30:57
Let me, Captain.

1046
00:30:57 --> 00:30:59
I do not know the answers you want.

1047
00:30:59 --> 00:31:01
Let&#39;s start over. Who are you going to see?

1048
00:31:01 --> 00:31:03
I have already said, anyone!

1049
00:31:03 --> 00:31:04
What was the message?

1050
00:31:04 --> 00:31:05
No message.

1051
00:31:05 --> 00:31:06
I do not know what you&#39;re talking about.

1052
00:31:06 --> 00:31:08
You do not know much of anything, right?

1053
00:31:08 --> 00:31:10
Not even that prepares Collins

1054
00:31:10 --> 00:31:13
an escape from the pit at 12:15?

1055
00:31:13 --> 00:31:14
It is not true?

1056
00:31:14 --> 00:31:16
You lied to me right?

1057
00:31:16 --> 00:31:19
Gallagher knows what evasion.

1058
00:31:19 --> 00:31:20
I do not know.

1059
00:31:20 --> 00:31:22
I do not know what is he talking about.

1060
00:31:22 --> 00:31:24
I can hit ...

1061
00:31:24 --> 00:31:26
and keep hitting ...

1062
00:31:26 --> 00:31:28
I do not know what he wants.

1063
00:31:28 --> 00:31:29
Metedlo in solitary confinement.

1064
00:31:29 --> 00:31:32
He had an accident back the den.

1065
00:31:32 --> 00:31:34
A relationship between Gallagher and Collins?

1066
00:31:34 --> 00:31:36
If there were any, I would have told you.

1067
00:31:36 --> 00:31:38
Bring out your man.

1068
00:31:38 --> 00:31:39
Muggsy!

1069
00:31:39 --> 00:31:40
I&#39;m going!

1070
00:31:40 --> 00:31:41
Do not you have anything for me?

1071
00:31:41 --> 00:31:42
Insurance?

1072
00:31:42 --> 00:31:43
Something happens?

1073
00:31:43 --> 00:31:44
To the work!

1074
00:31:44 --> 00:31:46
I have your cardiograms, Collins.

1075
00:31:46 --> 00:31:48
- I have to become examined. - Do it quickly.

1076
00:31:48 --> 00:31:50
Travel freely!

1077
00:31:50 --> 00:31:51
They have beaten to death Louie.

1078
00:31:51 --> 00:31:52
Munsey.

1079
00:31:52 --> 00:31:53
Louie is in danger of death.

1080
00:31:53 --> 00:31:54
You have a message.

1081
00:31:54 --> 00:31:57
Whatever your plan, resignation.

1082
00:31:57 --> 00:31:59
Munsey is aware.

1083
00:31:59 --> 00:32:02
Believe me, you know that trying to hit at 12:15.

1084
00:32:02 --> 00:32:03
Watching you, Joe.

1085
00:32:03 --> 00:32:04
He wants you to try

1086
00:32:04 --> 00:32:07
An escape would be the end for Barnes.

1087
00:32:07 --> 00:32:08
And Munsey would be the hero.

1088
00:32:08 --> 00:32:11
It has your life to become governor.

1089
00:32:11 --> 00:32:12
They Are Arrested Gallagher?

1090
00:32:12 --> 00:32:13
What Gallagher? Do not.

1091
00:32:13 --> 00:32:14
Why?

1092
00:32:14 --> 00:32:16
You have no chance.

1093
00:32:16 --> 00:32:19
- How you have known Munsey? - The Munsey method.

1094
00:32:19 --> 00:32:22
It has informants. One of your own men, I guess.

1095
00:32:22 --> 00:32:25
Do not, Joe. Do not even try!

1096
00:32:25 --> 00:32:26
Thanks for trying, Doc.

1097
00:32:26 --> 00:32:27
We have ten minutes.

1098
00:32:27 --> 00:32:29
And we must take advantage of each.

1099
00:32:29 --> 00:32:30
What place do you want?

1100
00:32:30 --> 00:32:32
You are the boss. You say it.

1101
00:32:32 --> 00:32:35
Elegid to escape. What position?

1102
00:32:35 --> 00:32:38
I told you you would. It&#39;s up to you.

1103
00:32:38 --> 00:32:38
Your?

1104
00:32:38 --> 00:32:39
The same.

1105
00:32:39 --> 00:32:40
We have only a few minutes.

1106
00:32:40 --> 00:32:42
When we get out, what site do you want?

1107
00:32:42 --> 00:32:43
Where I can help better.

1108
00:32:43 --> 00:32:44
What place?

1109
00:32:44 --> 00:32:45
Latest.

1110
00:32:45 --> 00:32:47
It is the hardest place, no?

1111
00:32:47 --> 00:32:48
Latest.

1112
00:32:48 --> 00:32:49
Louie was hurt.

1113
00:32:49 --> 00:32:52
He caught as he returned the pit.

1114
00:32:52 --> 00:32:52
Coming back?

1115
00:32:52 --> 00:32:52
Munsey.

1116
00:32:52 --> 00:32:53
Travel freely.

1117
00:32:53 --> 00:32:55
They have less opportunity than a plaster duck.

1118
00:32:55 --> 00:32:57
Sorry, I had not seen him.

1119
00:32:57 --> 00:32:59
It&#39;s nothing, Hopkins.

1120
00:32:59 --> 00:33:02
But no prize catch them alive.

1121
00:33:02 --> 00:33:03
Not in this jungle.

1122
00:33:03 --> 00:33:04
Any other orders?

1123
00:33:04 --> 00:33:07
Bradley, with the guards in this sector of the wall.

1124
00:33:07 --> 00:33:08
Is full.

1125
00:33:08 --> 00:33:09
Ready?

1126
00:33:09 --> 00:33:10
Ready!

1127
00:33:10 --> 00:33:11
Let go of that!

1128
00:33:11 --> 00:33:13
Coy and Spencer, vaciad land down there.

1129
00:33:13 --> 00:33:15
I do not misbehaved with you. You never did anything to you.

1130
00:33:15 --> 00:33:16
I do not carry weapons. Save me.

1131
00:33:16 --> 00:33:17
Silence! Are you with me?

1132
00:33:17 --> 00:33:19
I do not want to be mixed up in this.

1133
00:33:19 --> 00:33:21
Ride me. I will obey.

1134
00:33:21 --> 00:33:22
But take me.

1135
00:33:22 --> 00:33:25
We are leaving. We will go together to the patio.

1136
00:33:25 --> 00:33:26
Once there, beyond each.

1137
00:33:26 --> 00:33:28
At the moment, you will obey me.

1138
00:33:28 --> 00:33:30
Keep watch the background.

1139
00:33:30 --> 00:33:32
Soldier, bring it here.

1140
00:33:32 --> 00:33:32
And me?

1141
00:33:32 --> 00:33:32
Your?

1142
00:33:32 --> 00:33:35
You will use a break. It will go for some time.

1143
00:33:35 --> 00:33:37
When you return we&#39;ll see what we do with you.

1144
00:33:37 --> 00:33:39
I can not resign.

1145
00:33:39 --> 00:33:40
It&#39;s my whole life.

1146
00:33:40 --> 00:33:41
Firm.

1147
00:33:41 --> 00:33:43
Loudspeaker. Announce your resignation.

1148
00:33:43 --> 00:33:45
Here the warden Barnes.

1149
00:33:45 --> 00:33:47
I just resign.

1150
00:33:47 --> 00:33:49
The prison will be led by Captain Munsey.

1151
00:33:49 --> 00:33:50
Tell them so!

1152
00:33:50 --> 00:33:51
Do not!

1153
00:33:51 --> 00:33:52
As a result of this resignation,

1154
00:33:52 --> 00:33:54
Prison becomes led by Captain Munsey.

1155
00:33:54 --> 00:33:54
I repeat.

1156
00:33:54 --> 00:33:56
Captain Munsey is your jailer.

1157
00:33:56 --> 00:33:58
Obey his orders.

1158
00:33:58 --> 00:33:58
Come on!

1159
00:33:58 --> 00:34:01
You&#39;re wrong! Munsey made me.

1160
00:34:01 --> 00:34:04
I want to tell you everything. No, Joe!

1161
00:34:04 --> 00:34:05
Not that!

1162
00:34:05 --> 00:34:07
Listen to me! You are not succeed in what ever!

1163
00:34:07 --> 00:34:09
It is a trap! We are waiting.

1164
00:34:09 --> 00:34:11
Jackson! You and Tom, bajad.

1165
00:34:11 --> 00:34:12
I take care of that.

1166
00:34:12 --> 00:34:13
The machine gun.

1167
00:34:13 --> 00:34:14
Faster!

1168
00:34:14 --> 00:34:15
Where we are?

1169
00:34:15 --> 00:34:17
The plan has failed. Each by itself.

1170
00:34:17 --> 00:34:18
A chance in a million.

1171
00:34:18 --> 00:34:19
It&#39;s going to break down the door!

1172
00:34:19 --> 00:34:19
Collins!

1173
00:34:19 --> 00:34:21
That hurts, doctor. And much.

1174
00:34:21 --> 00:34:24
This place is full of pain, Calypso.

1175
00:34:24 --> 00:34:25
You&#39;re hurt ...

1176
00:34:25 --> 00:34:27
Collins and Munsey dead,

1177
00:34:27 --> 00:34:28
and the others...

1178
00:34:28 --> 00:34:30
everyone else...

1179
00:34:30 --> 00:34:33
Why do they do it? They never do.

1180
00:34:33 --> 00:34:37
Alcatraz, Atlanta, Leavenworth ...

1181
00:34:37 --> 00:34:41
It has tried hundreds of times hundreds different places,

1182
00:34:41 --> 00:34:43
and they have always failed.

1183
00:34:43 --> 00:34:45
But they keep trying.

1184
00:34:45 --> 00:34:46
Why?

1185
00:34:46 --> 00:34:47
I do not know.

1186
00:34:47 --> 00:34:50
But while he locks himself a man always want to escape.

1187
00:34:50 --> 00:34:51
Do not learn.

1188
00:34:51 --> 00:34:52
And necessary.

1189
00:34:52 --> 00:34:54
Nobody escapes.

1190
00:34:54 --> 00:34:56
Nobody ever escapes.

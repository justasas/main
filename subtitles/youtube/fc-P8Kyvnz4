00:00:00 --> 00:00:01
There will always be debate ...

3
00:00:01 --> 00:00:03
whether video games are for fun.

4
00:00:03 --> 00:00:04
Believe me, some are fun.

5
00:00:04 --> 00:00:04
&lt;I&gt; CHAMPION DONKEY KONG &lt;/ i&gt;

6
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
Video games are to play at home ...

7
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
quiet on the couch, among friends.

8
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
That&#39;s what they are, and that&#39;s fun.

9
00:00:11 --> 00:00:12
But to play for competition ...

10
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
if you want to get the world record ...

11
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
if you want history to remember your name ...

12
00:00:16 --> 00:00:17
you have to pay a price.

13
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
It is something between the machine and me.

14
00:00:19 --> 00:00:23
I can ... No matter ... If you disappoint me ...

15
00:00:23 --> 00:00:23
&lt;I&gt; COMPETlDOR OF DONKEY DONG &lt;/ i&gt;

16
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
or if someone else does not matter.

17
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
I can always play. I have the control.

18
00:00:27 --> 00:00:29
This is a universe at war. continuous war.

19
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
There may be other universes ...

20
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
but ours is wars and games. William S. Burroughs.

21
00:00:34 --> 00:00:35
I&#39;m glad you mention it.

22
00:00:35 --> 00:00:36
Do we have enough tape? It seems important.

23
00:00:36 --> 00:00:38
Everyone, even the grandmother ...

24
00:00:38 --> 00:00:43
games, whether checkers, cards, present and past.

25
00:00:43 --> 00:00:44
Tell me a damn hermit nun or ...

26
00:00:44 --> 00:00:45
who has not played cards or checkers.

27
00:00:45 --> 00:00:48
I do not drink. I do not smoke. I do not take drugs.

28
00:00:48 --> 00:00:49
Play video games ...

29
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
I think it&#39;s an addiction much higher ...

30
00:00:52 --> 00:00:53
than any of the others.

31
00:00:53 --> 00:00:54
I wanted to be a hero.

33
00:00:54 --> 00:00:55

34
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
I wanted glory. He wanted fame.

35
00:00:57 --> 00:00:58
Pretty girls wanted to tell me ...

36
00:00:58 --> 00:01:00
&lt;I&gt; &#39;&#39; Hello. I see that you are good the Centipede &#39;&#39;. &lt;/ I&gt;

37
00:01:00 --> 00:01:01
&lt;I&gt; Someone made me an analogy once ... &lt;/ i&gt;

38
00:01:01 --> 00:01:02
that I will never forget.

39
00:01:02 --> 00:01:06

41
00:01:07 --> 00:01:09
You do not know the name of the best pilot of the US, right?

42
00:01:09 --> 00:01:11
Nobody knows, but Eddie Rickenbacker.

43
00:01:11 --> 00:01:14
He shot down 26 enemy aircraft.

44
00:01:14 --> 00:01:15
The best German, the Red Baron.

45
00:01:15 --> 00:01:16
Everyone knows the Red Baron.

46
00:01:16 --> 00:01:19
It is because downed 87 enemy aircraft.

47
00:01:19 --> 00:01:21
That is, it was the best.

48
00:01:21 --> 00:01:25
There are differences between people ...

49
00:01:25 --> 00:01:27
and results in some games.

BEST 5 GAMES OF THE WORLD

56
00:01:39 --> 00:01:42
&lt;I&gt; If you want to know you all over the world ... &lt;/ i&gt;

57
00:01:42 --> 00:01:43
you have to master one of those games.

58
00:01:43 --> 00:01:44
I like its simplicity ...

59
00:01:44 --> 00:01:44
and they hear ...

60
00:01:44 --> 00:01:46
many fans of classic games ...

61
00:01:46 --> 00:01:47
who they like simplicity.

62
00:01:47 --> 00:01:51
These games test the coordination between eye and hand ...

63
00:01:51 --> 00:01:53
coordination between mind and body, reflexes ...

64
00:01:53 --> 00:01:54
and comprehensive thinking ...

65
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
at a level not reached by modern games.

66
00:01:56 --> 00:01:59
&lt;I&gt; Memorize and recognize patterns is essential. &lt;/ I&gt;

67
00:01:59 --> 00:02:00
&lt;I&gt; To advance a little ... &lt;/ i&gt;

68
00:02:00 --> 00:02:01
in an ancient game of the eighties ...

69
00:02:01 --> 00:02:02
required a large increase skills.

70
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
If you do not know the next pattern ...

71
00:02:04 --> 00:02:07
&lt;I&gt; Motorcycle game Tron light, will kill you. &lt;/ I&gt;

72

Only stubborn, which for some reason ...

They love those games, keep playing.

78
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
and shoot the best gamers in the world ...

79
00:02:22 --> 00:02:26
&lt;I&gt; who have come especially for this photo shoot for Life. &lt;/ I&gt;

80
00:02:26 --> 00:02:28
These superstars arriving from North Carolina ...

81
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
California, Canada and many other places ...

82
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
so that photographed as official world champions ...

83
00:02:33 --> 00:02:34
many different games.

84
00:02:34 --> 00:02:37
&lt;I&gt; The first time two world-class players ... &lt;/ i&gt;

85
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
&lt;I&gt; fought a competition was in Life magazine. &lt;/ I&gt;

86
00:02:40 --> 00:02:41
Surely I met players ...

87
00:02:41 --> 00:02:43
among the best in the world ...

88
00:02:43 --> 00:02:45
they say or do as possible ...

89
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
to make you believe they were the best in the world.

90
00:02:47 --> 00:02:48
Well then...

91
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
&lt;I&gt; had the world record Centipede. &lt;/ I&gt;

92
00:02:50 --> 00:02:51
But then ...

93
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
&lt;I&gt; had the world record in Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

94
00:02:53 --> 00:02:54
But we did not know, because someone ...

95
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
who they were invited to Kansas City ...

96
00:02:55 --> 00:02:57
a statement that he had done ...

97
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00
&lt;I&gt; was assumed to be the champion of Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

98
00:03:00 --> 00:03:03
&lt;I&gt; The first was lied about Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

99
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
He had sent a false score ...

100
00:03:05 --> 00:03:06
&lt;I&gt; and I met him in Life magazine ... &lt;/ i&gt;

101
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
and I could play against him.

102
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
We had not been long when Bill said ...

103
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
&#39;&#39;Let&#39;s play&#39;&#39;.

104
00:03:12 --> 00:03:13
&lt;I&gt; We went to the machine, I played Donkey Kong ... &lt;/ i&gt;

105
00:03:13 --> 00:03:14
&lt;I&gt; and gave him a beating. &lt;/ I&gt;

106
00:03:14 --> 00:03:15
Well, it was better than the best.

107
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
I got 200,000 against Bill.

108
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
Bill got 800,000 with the first life of the game.

109
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
&lt;I&gt; I destroyed. I destroyed. &lt;/ I&gt;

110
00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
&lt;I&gt; He left with his head down, humiliated ... &lt;/ i&gt;

111
00:03:24 --> 00:03:25
&lt;I&gt; and made him recognize the truth. &lt;/ I&gt;

112
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
Since then, we work together.

113
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
Well, the Bible ... There is a proverb that says ...

114
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
&#39;&#39; The man magnifies the man. &#39;&#39;

115
00:03:31 --> 00:03:32
&lt;I&gt; Bill made me a better person ... &lt;/ i&gt;

116
00:03:32 --> 00:03:38
to get me to confess.

117
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
I told Steve that he is well now ...

118
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
because he suffered the wrath of Bill Mitchell.

119
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
Against 19 of the best players in the nation ...

120
00:03:45 --> 00:03:46
in fact, America ...

121
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
&lt;I&gt; got the highest possible score of Donkey Kong ... &lt;/ i&gt;

122
00:03:48 --> 00:03:51
and he discovered that the game ended on the screen 22.

123
00:03:51 --> 00:03:52
GAME RECORD Billy

124
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
Since I made my debut in the scene ...

125
00:03:54 --> 00:03:56
&lt;I&gt; in Life magazine in 1982 ... &lt;/ i&gt;

126
00:03:56 --> 00:04:00
nobody has approached my score.

127
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
When Billy Mitchell machine will ...

128
00:04:02 --> 00:04:04
you know, everything stops.

129
00:04:04 --> 00:04:05
Electricity around it.

130
00:04:05 --> 00:04:06
Everyone wants to be close.

131
00:04:06 --> 00:04:07
Everyone wants to see it.

132
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
You know, everything he does is perfect.

133
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
Billy is the person who wants to represent.

134
00:04:11 --> 00:04:12
If you piratearas machine ...

135
00:04:12 --> 00:04:14
to play against itself ...

136
00:04:14 --> 00:04:15
I could not do as well.

137
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
Billy has glamor. It has something special.

138
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
It was the first. It was the first great player.

139
00:04:19 --> 00:04:20
The question is ...

140
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
Bill is the best player of classic games of our era.

141
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
He has shaped my personality.

142
00:04:26 --> 00:04:27
I benefit every day.

143
00:04:27 --> 00:04:31
A great passion for never satisfied with what I have ...

144
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
with my job, with my family.

145
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
That&#39;s what has brought me to compete.

146
00:04:35 --> 00:04:36
It is an achiever.

147
00:04:36 --> 00:04:36
Billy PARENTS

148
00:04:36 --> 00:04:37
Billy Mitchell is a real winner.

149
00:04:37 --> 00:04:39
It&#39;s like being in a maze ...

150
00:04:39 --> 00:04:42
where all you see is salsa.

151
00:04:42 --> 00:04:43
more versatile and better seasoned person ...

152
00:04:43 --> 00:04:46
industry in chicken wings and hot sauce ... yeah, sure, I.

153
00:04:46 --> 00:04:49
There are a production target. It is the preparation.

154
00:04:49 --> 00:04:50
When there is a sales target ...

155
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
I have not met anyone who covers ...

156
00:04:52 --> 00:04:53
all those areas as me.

157
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
Sells hot sauce and himself.

158
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
It is very charming and a good ambassador ...

159
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
for games because it is authentic.

160
00:05:00 --> 00:05:01
&lt;I&gt; In my opinion, there is no reason ... &lt;/ i&gt;

161
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
Billy Mitchell to not end up in a cereal box.

162
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
Classic video games have been conquered.

163
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
On 4 July, in a playroom New Hampshire ...

164
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
Billy Mitchell, 34, became the first person ...

165
00:05:11 --> 00:05:15
Pac-Man to master by recording the first perfect game.

166

every energy, every ghost there ...

171
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
&lt;I&gt; reach the bottom of the screen 256 without dying? &lt;/ I&gt;

172
00:05:26 --> 00:05:27
It is impressive, no doubt.

173
00:05:27 --> 00:05:28
The success was not only ...

174
00:05:28 --> 00:05:29
get a perfect score ...

175
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31

180
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
If I have so lucky, if all goes in my favor ...

181
00:05:42 --> 00:05:44
if all the balls bounce in my favor ...

182
00:05:44 --> 00:05:45
There are some unfortunate out there ...

183
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
who is dying of envy.

184
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
When I was fired and I had free time ...

185
00:05:49 --> 00:05:50
I thought, &#39;&#39; What I can do ...

186
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
&#39;&#39; To feel that I have control of something? &#39;&#39;.

188
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
I looked at the Twin Galaxies website.

189
00:05:56 --> 00:05:59
&lt;I&gt; Well, I looked at the record of Donkey Kong ... &lt;/ i&gt;

190
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
He came a table and saw what was the score.

191
00:06:02 --> 00:06:08
The Billy Mitchell had with some 874,000 points.

192
00:06:08 --> 00:06:09
I thought, &#39;I can overcome it.&#39; &#39;

193
00:06:09 --> 00:06:10
Almost.

194
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
I&#39;m not the typical wife who wants it on the couch with me every night.

195
00:06:12 --> 00:06:13
Is not that.

196
00:06:13 --> 00:06:13
WIFE OF STEVE

197
00:06:13 --> 00:06:14
Need help at home and with the children ...

198
00:06:14 --> 00:06:15
or you are with children.

199
00:06:15 --> 00:06:16
He wanted to come here and play ...

200
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
and drove me crazy, because it is obsessive compulsive.

201
00:06:18 --> 00:06:19
When obsessed with something ...

202
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
it focuses so much that you have to get attention.

203
00:06:21 --> 00:06:24
Hey, and I said, &#39;You&#39;ll have to do it at night.&#39; &#39;

204
00:06:24 --> 00:06:25
Is the level 2 is easy?

205
00:06:25 --> 00:06:26
Yes, it&#39;s pretty easy.

206
00:06:26 --> 00:06:30
He dreamed of making a living as a musician.

207
00:06:30 --> 00:06:31
That was my dream.

208
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
They said it was smart ...

209
00:06:33 --> 00:06:34
I was an athlete, had talent ...

210
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
and, for some reason, he did not get anything to work.

211
00:06:37 --> 00:06:41
Steve was in one of the groups of starving grunge ...

212
00:06:41 --> 00:06:42
here in Seattle, some starving.

213
00:06:42 --> 00:06:45
We were the only ones who were going to see.

214
00:06:45 --> 00:06:46
With his music it was almost like ...

215
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
he does not want anyone to know he was doing it.

216
00:06:48 --> 00:06:50
It&#39;s a real paradox.

217
00:06:50 --> 00:06:55
## I took so long looking at your photos ##

218
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
&lt;I&gt; Maybe some small inhibitions ... &lt;/ i&gt;

219
00:06:57 --> 00:06:58
BROTHER OF STEVE

220
00:06:58 --> 00:06:59
... They have not been allowed to ...

221
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
so successful in some things and others.

222
00:07:01 --> 00:07:05
&lt;I&gt; reached the state finals, but Steve could not launch. &lt;/ I&gt;

223
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
I think I&#39;ve seen mourn Steve ...

224
00:07:07 --> 00:07:08
more than any other ...

225
00:07:08 --> 00:07:08
STEVE AMlGO

226
00:07:08 --> 00:07:09
... Frustration that dominates it.

227
00:07:09 --> 00:07:10
&lt;I&gt; And it was almost always right when launching. &lt;/ I&gt;

228
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
&lt;I&gt; injured arm. I forced myself too. &lt;/ I&gt;

229
00:07:12 --> 00:07:13
FATHER OF STEVE

230
00:07:13 --> 00:07:14
I coached the team.

231
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
It was his chance to prove his worth.

232
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
&lt;I&gt; The power not throw it destroyed ... &lt;/ i&gt;

233
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
because it is very competitive.

234
00:07:21 --> 00:07:24
## We kissed as the sky fell ##

235
00:07:24 --> 00:07:26
&lt;I&gt; ## holding you hard ## &lt;/ i&gt;

236
00:07:26 --> 00:07:28
## As he always did ##

237
00:07:28 --> 00:07:33
He saw it as, uh, an engineer at Boeing.

238
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
My dad worked for Boeing 30-odd years ...

239
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
and the plan was to go to Boeing and serving time ...

240
00:07:39 --> 00:07:40
as they call it.

241
00:07:40 --> 00:07:41
But things did not go well.

242
00:07:41 --> 00:07:42
I do not know if you said he was fired ...

243
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
the day we bought the house. Yes.

244
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
## By order discovered ##

245
00:07:46 --> 00:07:50
## All your courage and let go ##

246
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
&lt;I&gt; I never reached the top of everything. &lt;/ I&gt;

247
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
&lt;I&gt; In none of their efforts ... &lt;/ i&gt;

248
00:07:54 --> 00:07:57
It was considered the number one ...

249
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
the best ever...

250
00:07:59 --> 00:08:00
which was on top.

251
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
Ay, it has been at the gates of many things in his life ...

252
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
and I think, you know ...

253
00:08:04 --> 00:08:05
no one wants to live that long.

254
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
Lost in the cold ## ##

255
00:08:07 --> 00:08:12
## Always lost in the dark ##

256
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
## Reminding you ##

257
00:08:14 --> 00:08:17
&lt;I&gt; My highest score is saved from the last time. &lt;/ I&gt;

258
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
Slowly drowned Angeles ## ##

259
00:08:19 --> 00:08:22
## Better than all the rest ##

260
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
&lt;I&gt; Hold one last time ## ## &lt;/ i&gt;

261
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
## Then he disappears silently ##

262
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
What led me to compete ...

263
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
&lt;I&gt; never leave, it was Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

264
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
&lt;I&gt; Donkey Kong. It was the first Mario game. &lt;/ i&gt;

265
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
It takes place in a play.

266
00:08:36 --> 00:08:37
There are beams, lifts and stairs ...

267
00:08:37 --> 00:08:38
ranging from one beam to the next.

268
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
The constant goal is to overcome obstacles ...

269
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
Kong throws and that you get the girl.

270
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
&lt;I&gt; Donkey Kong certainly is the most difficult game. &lt;/ I&gt;

271
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
The first screen is extremely difficult.

272
00:08:48 --> 00:08:49
DISPLAY OF BARRlLES

273
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
Donkey Kong drop the barrels.

274
00:08:51 --> 00:08:52
You have to jump over.

275
00:08:52 --> 00:08:53
We must avoid the barrels.

276
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
You can get a hammer and break the barrels.

277
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
Well, the secret of the barrels ...

278
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
It is that, actually, can be controlled.

279
00:09:00 --> 00:09:01
Just above this ladder ...

280
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
&lt;I&gt; turn left and then right. &lt;/ I&gt;

281
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
Did you see how down? He lowered.

282
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
We must avoid barrels, fireballs ...

283
00:09:07 --> 00:09:07
Climb the stairs.

284
00:09:07 --> 00:09:08
Once you get to it ...

285
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
Donkey Kong takes it to the next level.

286
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
The average game Donkey Kong does not last more than a minute.

287
00:09:12 --> 00:09:13
It is the absolute brutality.

288
00:09:13 --> 00:09:14
The 18 stages with lifts ...

289
00:09:14 --> 00:09:14
&lt;I&gt; EXPERT IN DONKEY KONG &lt;/ i&gt;

290
00:09:14 --> 00:09:16
... Represent the greatest challenge in the world of video games.

291
00:09:16 --> 00:09:17
&lt;I&gt; The average player Donkey Kong ... &lt;/ i&gt;

292
00:09:17 --> 00:09:20
never exceeds the third phase of elevators.

293
00:09:20 --> 00:09:22
The slightest touch of one of those springs kills you.

294
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
The hammer does not work, can not be deleted.

295
00:09:24 --> 00:09:26
You can only avoid them. Nothing else.

296
00:09:26 --> 00:09:27
The secret in the third stage ...

297
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
Spring is knowing what to expect ...

298
00:09:30 --> 00:09:32
know which spring up the stairs ...

299
00:09:32 --> 00:09:34
and recognize when to retire.

300
00:09:34 --> 00:09:37
If you do not calculate well, they kill you.

301
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
It is reduced to pure precision technique.

302
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
I go for this because it is aligned with the dashed line.

303
00:09:43 --> 00:09:46
Now I wait another lines up with the solid line.

304
00:09:46 --> 00:09:48
Since I met Steve I said ...

305
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
his talent is in your hands.

306
00:09:50 --> 00:09:52
&lt;I&gt; Era pitcher. He played basketball. &lt;/ I&gt;

307
00:09:52 --> 00:09:53
It is a great artist.

308
00:09:53 --> 00:09:54
I do not know if they have seen his drawings ...

309
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
but it is very artistic.

310
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
Works at some level of your subconscious, I think.

311
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
When we went to Kansas, or wherever, with family ...

312
00:10:02 --> 00:10:03
and it sat for 100 kilometers ...

313
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
&lt;I&gt; banged her head, you know ... &lt;/ i&gt;

314
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
all the while against the seat back.

315
00:10:07 --> 00:10:09
Five six seven eight nine...

316
00:10:09 --> 00:10:11
Often I thought it might be a little autistic ...

317
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
it&#39;s just obsessive compulsive ...

318
00:10:13 --> 00:10:15
&lt;I&gt; when you get something in your head. &lt;/ I&gt;

319
00:10:15 --> 00:10:16
I wanted to be battery ...

320
00:10:16 --> 00:10:17
and I do not know where he got the idea.

321
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
This is Derek battery.

322
00:10:19 --> 00:10:20
DEREK WlEBE 5 years

323
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
Not bad.

324
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
It&#39;s ... it&#39;s enough.

325
00:10:25 --> 00:10:30
Video games require a lot of coordination between eye and hand ...

326
00:10:30 --> 00:10:31
coordination between mind and body ...

327
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
good reflexes and comprehensive thinking.

328
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
A high level of accuracy of movement.

329
00:10:35 --> 00:10:36
Such technical ...

330
00:10:36 --> 00:10:37
&lt;I&gt; involves a lot of learning. &lt;/ I&gt;

331
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
a deep thorough understanding is needed.

332
00:10:41 --> 00:10:43
Hey, for many years it was believed ...

333
00:10:43 --> 00:10:47
Billy&#39;s record of 874,000 in 1982 ...

334
00:10:47 --> 00:10:49
It was the highest score possible.

335
00:10:49 --> 00:10:51
In fact, some play ...

336
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
daily, or weeks, or months since ...

337
00:10:53 --> 00:10:54
and no one has been even close.

338
00:10:54 --> 00:10:56
No one in all that time ...

339
00:10:56 --> 00:11:00
&lt;I&gt; will be able to beat his world record. &lt;/ I&gt;

340
00:11:00 --> 00:11:04
lNTENTO BATlR STEVE OF THE MUNDlAL RECORD

341
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
Derek, look. You are on television.

342
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
You look? Say hello.

343
00:11:09 --> 00:11:10
Do not.

344
00:11:10 --> 00:11:11
It was my best game.

345
00:11:11 --> 00:11:16
600,000 had ... I think, uh, and I were all lives.

346
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
I began to hear noises ...

347
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
downstairs, shouting ...

348
00:11:21 --> 00:11:22
!Dad!

349
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
I believe I can not is going on, friends ...

350
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
Cleanse the pompis ...

351
00:11:26 --> 00:11:27
- What do you clean the derriere? - Yes.

352
00:11:27 --> 00:11:28
- One second. - How?

353
00:11:28 --> 00:11:30
Well, get me some paper.

354
00:11:30 --> 00:11:34
Derek, I will break the world record.

355
00:11:34 --> 00:11:35
!Do not play! ! Do not play!

356
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37
- Derek. - !Do not!

357
00:11:37 --> 00:11:43
&lt;I&gt; - Derek! ! Enough! - Stop playing Donkey Koooong &lt;/ i&gt;

358
00:11:43 --> 00:11:44
It&#39;s all recorded ...

359
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
This is the tape I wanted to send Twin Galaxies.

360
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
HEADQUARTERS OF TWlN GALAXlES

361
00:11:48 --> 00:11:49
Everything I do...

362
00:11:49 --> 00:11:50
I relate with transcendental meditation ...

363
00:11:50 --> 00:11:51
and I want it to reflect ...

364
00:11:51 --> 00:11:54
how I applied to video games ...

365
00:11:54 --> 00:11:55
to find champions ...

366
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
and watching them grow and improve ...

367
00:11:57 --> 00:12:00
&lt;I&gt; to start their full potential ... &lt;/ i&gt;

368
00:12:00 --> 00:12:01
that&#39;s what happens when doing this meditation.

369
00:12:01 --> 00:12:05
If Walter, in all these years since 1982 ...

370
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
I would not have continued for art&#39;s sake ...

371
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
&lt;I&gt; there would be no central organization ... &lt;/ i&gt;

372
00:12:10 --> 00:12:11
video game competitions.

373
00:12:11 --> 00:12:14
Why do we do it? Because we love.

374
00:12:14 --> 00:12:15
Because we enjoy. Because fascinates us.

375
00:12:15 --> 00:12:16
There is something in our genes ...

376
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
&lt;I&gt; my group Twin Galaxies, defended with all his strength ... &lt;/ i&gt;

377
00:12:19 --> 00:12:21
&lt;I&gt; to do and bring organized games ... &lt;/ i&gt;

378
00:12:21 --> 00:12:21
towards the future.

379
00:12:21 --> 00:12:22
Walter opened the doors ...

380
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
lba to say ... international ...

381
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
but at least national competition video games.

382
00:12:27 --> 00:12:28
We gave Twin Galaxies call.

383
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
I came up with the name suddenly.

384
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
&lt;I&gt; Walter Day did not happen. &lt;/ I&gt;

385
00:12:32 --> 00:12:35
No luck. He created his own empire.

386
00:12:35 --> 00:12:36
Stay with us for the latest video games.

387
00:12:36 --> 00:12:36
I am Walter Day ...

388
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
with the list of international ratings of Twin Galaxies.

389
00:12:38 --> 00:12:39
Being the score was very tiring ...

390
00:12:39 --> 00:12:40
because all they get me, you know?

391
00:12:40 --> 00:12:43
Because I&#39;m the man, you know? I am the police.

392
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
Video games need someone like Bush to say ...

393
00:12:46 --> 00:12:47
&#39;&#39; Look, we will do so.

394
00:12:47 --> 00:12:50
&#39;&#39; These are the rules and if you do not like, you go. &#39;&#39;

395
00:12:50 --> 00:12:51
We must do so.

396
00:12:51 --> 00:12:53
If it were not so in football, who would win?

397
00:12:53 --> 00:12:54
How do you know who wins if there are no rules?

398
00:12:54 --> 00:12:55
And if you break them, you lose.

399
00:12:55 --> 00:12:56
Llegal USE OF CÓDlGO TRAP

00:12:56 --> 00:12:57

404
00:13:00 --> 00:13:04
His best quality was also its greatest disadvantage.

405
00:13:04 --> 00:13:06
People overwhelms him for being too friendly.

406
00:13:06 --> 00:13:10
Twin Galaxies survives by people like Walter ...

407
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
&lt;I&gt; as Robert Mruczek, people like me ... &lt;/ i&gt;

408
00:13:13 --> 00:13:17
who share a passion for competitive play.

409
00:13:17 --> 00:13:18
We do for work.

410
00:13:18 --> 00:13:21
I do not see the details. I see the whole picture, yes?

411
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
I see the great concept that lies behind the question ...

412
00:13:24 --> 00:13:25
and then grabbed him.

413
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
I can not focus on all the details.

414
00:13:27 --> 00:13:29
Twin Galaxies need staff attentive to detail ...

415
00:13:29 --> 00:13:30
&lt;I&gt; as Robert Mruczek. &lt;/ I&gt;

416
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
Hey, what can not be explained, out of the ordinary ...

417
00:13:33 --> 00:13:33
CHIEF ÁRBlTRO, TWlN GALAXlES

418
00:13:33 --> 00:13:34
It is what we have to discover.

419
00:13:34 --> 00:13:35
Not mean that we are infallible.

420
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
When I look at that stack of eight films there ...

421
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40
the departure of two days of Dwayne Richard ...

422
00:13:40 --> 00:13:41
are 48 hours in a row to pay attention ...

423
00:13:41 --> 00:13:42
to make sure you do everything right.

424
00:13:42 --> 00:13:43
Metroid pack team in Brazil ...

425
00:13:43 --> 00:13:44
Atari 2600 recordings.

426
00:13:44 --> 00:13:45
I have to see them.

427
00:13:45 --> 00:13:47
It takes time to verify these things.

428
00:13:47 --> 00:13:48
And I have to look at every one.

429
00:13:48 --> 00:13:49
As I showed here.

430
00:13:49 --> 00:13:52
They are just 200 tapes. Is nothing.

431
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
This is what I really have to do.

432
00:13:54 --> 00:13:58
I see world records in my studio every day.

433
00:13:58 --> 00:13:59
Some believe that a world record ...

434
00:13:59 --> 00:14:00
It is what is marked in the Olympics ...

435
00:14:00 --> 00:14:02
or at the end of the basketball season.

436
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
&lt;I&gt; I see every day, and often, not just once. &lt;/ I&gt;

437
00:14:05 --> 00:14:05
It&#39;s exciting.

438
00:14:05 --> 00:14:06
! Derek!

439
00:14:06 --> 00:14:10
&lt;I&gt; - Stop playing Donkey Kong! - Enough &lt;/ i&gt;

440
00:14:10 --> 00:14:13
&lt;I&gt; - Stop playing Donkey Kong! - Maybe &lt;/ i&gt;.

441
00:14:13 --> 00:14:14
Yes almost.

442
00:14:14 --> 00:14:15
It has not been too bad.

443
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
! Enough!

444
00:14:17 --> 00:14:19
!Leave it alone!

445
00:14:19 --> 00:14:21
Derek, give it up. Do not.

446
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
&lt;I&gt; Stop playing Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

447
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
&lt;I&gt; - Derek? - Stop playing Donkey Kong &lt;/ i&gt;.

448
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
I&#39;ll throw the rest if you do not leave now,! Derek!

449
00:14:27 --> 00:14:28
Someone has got something ...

450
00:14:28 --> 00:14:29
that not only I can not do ...

451
00:14:29 --> 00:14:30
but no one else has done before ...

452
00:14:30 --> 00:14:31
and it&#39;s exciting to be the first to see it.

453
00:14:31 --> 00:14:33
&lt;I&gt; So the Donkey Kong is played. &lt;/ I&gt;

454
00:14:33 --> 00:14:34
A new world record.

455
00:14:34 --> 00:14:34
Welcome back.

456
00:14:34 --> 00:14:35
Bill Gates is not necessarily the most famous ...

457
00:14:35 --> 00:14:36
Redmond today.

458
00:14:36 --> 00:14:38
In short, the man who controls his game.

459
00:14:38 --> 00:14:39
&lt;I&gt; A world record Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

460
00:14:39 --> 00:14:42
It was kind of famous time in Seattle.

461
00:14:42 --> 00:14:43
I did do.

462
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
I thought it would be a good achievement.

463
00:14:45 --> 00:14:48
I did not think would happen to history.

464
00:14:48 --> 00:14:50
&lt;I&gt; says: &#39;&#39; You&#39;re the first lady of Donkey Kong &#39;&#39; &lt;/ i&gt;.

465
00:14:50 --> 00:14:51
I said, &#39;&#39; Oh, my God! &#39;.

466
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
Although it was nonsense video game ...

467
00:14:54 --> 00:14:57
not many have a friend ...

468
00:14:57 --> 00:15:00
which is the world champion in something.

469
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
It was a blessing for him in recent years ...

470
00:15:02 --> 00:15:03
the achieve.

471
00:15:03 --> 00:15:06
It was like coming to fruition for him, yes.

472
00:15:06 --> 00:15:07
Unequal ## ##

473
00:15:07 --> 00:15:08
## Do not move ##

474
00:15:08 --> 00:15:10
## I will not accept defeat ##

475
00:15:10 --> 00:15:12
You conquer ## Yes, I will conquer you ##

476
00:15:12 --> 00:15:13
MEDlO 5/6 DAY - 11: 15 DESPlDO BRUNCH MAMA 9:30 to 11:00 a.m.

477
00:15:13 --> 00:15:15
## I will seek a path and you will conquer ##

478
00:15:15 --> 00:15:16
DRAWER SUGERENClAS

479
00:15:16 --> 00:15:17
We are Kamiakin Junior High School ...

480
00:15:17 --> 00:15:20
and this is the science classroom of seventh and eighth grades.

481
00:15:20 --> 00:15:21
It&#39;s my first year of master ...

482
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
and it has been a challenge, but nice so far.

483
00:15:24 --> 00:15:30
&lt;I&gt; Arena, soil and corn starch. &lt;/ I&gt;

484
00:15:30 --> 00:15:33
I went to college in town ...

485
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
one year for a master ...

486
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
and we prepare for a year.

487
00:15:37 --> 00:15:40
And I&#39;m here, it worked.

488
00:15:40 --> 00:15:42
It&#39;s fun and it does not act as ...

489
00:15:42 --> 00:15:43
STEVE STUDENTS

490
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
&#39;&#39; It&#39;s science. It&#39;s boring&#39;&#39;.

491
00:15:45 --> 00:15:46
We talk about things ...

492
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
they are not just homework, exercises ...

493
00:15:48 --> 00:15:48
school and others.

494
00:15:48 --> 00:15:49
Well here...

495
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
&lt;I&gt; My history with Donkey Kong is that I have the world record. &lt;/ I&gt;

496
00:15:52 --> 00:15:55
Well, I did not know it was a world record.

497
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
&lt;I&gt; That&#39;s Donkey Kong, okay? Heaven. &lt;/ I&gt;

498
00:15:58 --> 00:15:59
There&#39;s like ... It&#39;s ...

499
00:15:59 --> 00:16:00
All science teachers here are rare.

500
00:16:00 --> 00:16:01
Steve deserves recognition for that ...

501
00:16:01 --> 00:16:02
also because ...

502
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
He also broke the record of Donkey Kong Jr.

503
00:16:04 --> 00:16:06
He took two titles Billy ...

504
00:16:06 --> 00:16:06
CHAMPION MAPPY

505
00:16:06 --> 00:16:07
... He was snatched.

506
00:16:07 --> 00:16:09
I do not want to be, you know, rude or anything.

507
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
&lt;I&gt; But he did. Did. Officially, he did. &lt;/ I&gt;

508
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
It was the last world record of Billy.

509
00:16:13 --> 00:16:13
&lt;I&gt; CHAMPION MlSSlLE COMMAND &lt;/ i&gt;

510
00:16:13 --> 00:16:13
It was the last that was removed.

511
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
He had five world records in 1985 ...

512
00:16:15 --> 00:16:19
&lt;I&gt; along with Donkey Kong and Steve Wiebe snatched them. &lt;/ I&gt;

513
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
It is much harder to keep up ...

514
00:16:21 --> 00:16:23
when you&#39;re up.

515
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
Billy has many aces up their sleeves.

516
00:16:25 --> 00:16:28
He does not like to rule in such situations.

517
00:16:28 --> 00:16:31
&lt;I&gt; You know, maybe someone has passed now ... &lt;/ i&gt;

518
00:16:31 --> 00:16:33
but inside, Billy has something planned.

519
00:16:33 --> 00:16:33
Billy Mitchell is.

520
00:16:33 --> 00:16:35
In my phone it says: &#39;&#39; Never give up &#39;&#39;.

521
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
If someone beats that record ...

522
00:16:37 --> 00:16:39
He has a plan to beat him again.

523
00:16:39 --> 00:16:40
I&#39;m sure.

524
00:16:40 --> 00:16:41
The worst that could happen ...

525
00:16:41 --> 00:16:45
It would give someone the credibility of a score ...

526
00:16:45 --> 00:16:47
it does not deserve.

527
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
But worse would deny someone ...

528
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
credibility when it deserves it.

529
00:16:53 --> 00:16:55
If I&#39;m not there, I do not know.

530
00:16:55 --> 00:16:56
Listen.

531
00:16:56 --> 00:16:58
I arrived home one day and there were two people ...

532
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
in the garage at the machine.

533
00:17:01 --> 00:17:01
They wanted ...

534
00:17:01 --> 00:17:01
How did you get to your garage?

535
00:17:01 --> 00:17:01
Were spies.

536
00:17:01 --> 00:17:05
It was a Saturday in July or August.

537
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
My mom was here. I was getting ready for work.

538
00:17:07 --> 00:17:08
These guys knock on the door ...

539
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
and I think I did not know they were coming.

540
00:17:10 --> 00:17:12
They said who they were ...

541
00:17:12 --> 00:17:13
and they wanted to come to look at the machine.

542
00:17:13 --> 00:17:14
I knew I had to leave and said ...

543
00:17:14 --> 00:17:16
&#39;&#39; I do not want to leave here.

544
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
&#39;&#39;I have to go to work. Mom here.

545
00:17:19 --> 00:17:20
&#39;&#39; Steve arrive at a time.

546
00:17:20 --> 00:17:22
&#39;&#39; Wait a little. Wait a little. &#39;&#39;

547
00:17:22 --> 00:17:24
To discover in an ultra elite level ...

548
00:17:24 --> 00:17:25
if the score is good or not ...

549
00:17:25 --> 00:17:27
sometimes there is no choice but to turn to professionals.

550
00:17:27 --> 00:17:29
&lt;I&gt; Brian Kuh, Donkey Kong Player ... &lt;/ i&gt;

551
00:17:29 --> 00:17:30
He went to Steve&#39;s house.

552
00:17:30 --> 00:17:31
Bill asked me to do it ...

553
00:17:31 --> 00:17:32
but I had no time, and it was Brian.

554
00:17:32 --> 00:17:35
I went with one of the most respected players of all time ...

555
00:17:35 --> 00:17:36
Perry Rodgers to back it up.

556
00:17:36 --> 00:17:38
Billy Mitchell and Twin Galaxies asked me ...

557
00:17:38 --> 00:17:39
ÁRBlTRO OF TWlN GALAXlES

558
00:17:39 --> 00:17:40
because I live near him ...

559
00:17:40 --> 00:17:41
it was to investigate.

560
00:17:41 --> 00:17:42
We went to his house.

561
00:17:42 --> 00:17:43
I mean, I&#39;m the owner. It is my home.

562
00:17:43 --> 00:17:44
&lt;I&gt; I am the wife of the type of Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

563
00:17:44 --> 00:17:45
They should have respected my wishes ...

564
00:17:45 --> 00:17:47
quiet and leave my mom and not get in, but it was not.

565
00:17:47 --> 00:17:50
&lt;I&gt; opened their machine Donkey Kong ... &lt;/ i&gt;

566
00:17:50 --> 00:17:51
&lt;I&gt; and began to take pictures of everything. &lt;/ I&gt;

567
00:17:51 --> 00:17:52
You know, looking for an excuse ...

568
00:17:52 --> 00:17:53
to invalidate your score.

569
00:17:53 --> 00:17:55
They saw a box ...

570
00:17:55 --> 00:17:58
the sender of Roy Shildt.

571
00:17:58 --> 00:17:59
They looked at her and said ...

572
00:17:59 --> 00:18:00
&#39;&#39; Roy Shildt? What does that name there? &#39;&#39;.

573
00:18:00 --> 00:18:03
Roy Shildt is the typical player would not want anything else ...

574
00:18:03 --> 00:18:05
to see humiliated Twin Galaxies.

575
00:18:05 --> 00:18:07
CHlCAS GUIDE MR. GENlAL Produced by himself, 1989

576
00:18:07 --> 00:18:10
I want you to remember that any idiot ...

577
00:18:10 --> 00:18:13
He never got no damn woman ...

578
00:18:13 --> 00:18:15
It is sensitive and considerate.

579
00:18:15 --> 00:18:17
He calls himself Mr. Cool.

580
00:18:17 --> 00:18:19
Drive a Genialmóvil to fame and fortune ...

581
00:18:19 --> 00:18:20
as stated on their website.

582
00:18:20 --> 00:18:22
Billy is jealous of all the attention that takes ...

583
00:18:22 --> 00:18:23
women everywhere.

584
00:18:23 --> 00:18:25
Basically, he wants to be like Billy.

585
00:18:25 --> 00:18:28
&lt;I&gt; I saw the world champion spit out a cherry stone ... &lt;/ i&gt;

586
00:18:28 --> 00:18:29
on the Jay Leno.

587
00:18:29 --> 00:18:30
And if he goes on that show ...

588
00:18:30 --> 00:18:33
at least I could be famous for a day.

589
00:18:33 --> 00:18:35
I was not granted it. I did not receive recognition.

590
00:18:35 --> 00:18:36
They did not take me to the television.

591
00:18:36 --> 00:18:37
It&#39;s like a ghost ...

592
00:18:37 --> 00:18:38
and I did not feel well ...

593
00:18:38 --> 00:18:40
I just want a little recognition.

594
00:18:40 --> 00:18:41
I do not want to become famous.

595
00:18:41 --> 00:18:42
Hey, Billy. How old?

596
00:18:42 --> 00:18:44
- How are you? - Billy, what&#39;s up?

597
00:18:44 --> 00:18:45
Very good. Do not you read?

598
00:18:45 --> 00:18:47
Twin Galaxies much touted Billy ...

599
00:18:47 --> 00:18:49
because it is favorable for Twin Galaxies ...

600
00:18:49 --> 00:18:51
and the world of video games ...

601
00:18:51 --> 00:18:52
Billy becomes a star.

602
00:18:52 --> 00:18:54
When Walter Day published this book in 1997 ...

603
00:18:54 --> 00:18:56
with a multitude of blunders ...

604
00:18:56 --> 00:18:57
Bill Mitchell saw him.

605
00:18:57 --> 00:18:58
I knew they were wrong. I knew they were mistakes.

606
00:18:58 --> 00:19:00
But he tried to pretend they were real ...

607
00:19:00 --> 00:19:02
&lt;I&gt; to reduce my score in Missile Command. &lt;/ I&gt;

608
00:19:02 --> 00:19:06
Roy and I met in the competition California Extreme ...

609
00:19:06 --> 00:19:08
and I knew I had a chance ...

610
00:19:08 --> 00:19:09
&lt;I&gt; Billy defeating the Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

611
00:19:09 --> 00:19:10
Steve Wiebe was able to discover ...

612
00:19:10 --> 00:19:11
the secrets of Donkey Kong ...

613
00:19:11 --> 00:19:12
to reach a million points.

614
00:19:12 --> 00:19:14
&lt;I&gt; He offered to buy me a card Donkey Kong ... &lt;/ i&gt;

615
00:19:14 --> 00:19:15
because mine was broken.

616
00:19:15 --> 00:19:16
did not have enough money.

617
00:19:16 --> 00:19:18
So it was a mutually beneficial relationship.

618
00:19:18 --> 00:19:19
I&#39;d buy a card.

619
00:19:19 --> 00:19:20
I have a chance to break the record of Billy ...

620
00:19:20 --> 00:19:22
and at the same time, eliminate Billy ...

621
00:19:22 --> 00:19:25
&lt;I&gt; and meet Roy&#39;s revenge. &lt;/ I&gt;

622
00:19:25 --> 00:19:28
Hey, I thought right then, you know?

623
00:19:28 --> 00:19:29
I did not know the story ...

624
00:19:29 --> 00:19:32
of enmity between Roy and Billy, and ...

625
00:19:32 --> 00:19:35
lntentar something just to ...

626
00:19:35 --> 00:19:38
remove one of scores of Billy ...

627
00:19:38 --> 00:19:40
It is like ... declare war.

628
00:19:40 --> 00:19:41
Said he had souped ...

629
00:19:41 --> 00:19:42
card or something, they ...

630
00:19:42 --> 00:19:43
They had no proof.

631
00:19:43 --> 00:19:44
They looked at the card.

632
00:19:44 --> 00:19:45
They photographed the card ...

633
00:19:45 --> 00:19:46
and they found nothing wrong.

634
00:19:46 --> 00:19:49
The substance of the right rubber ...

635
00:19:49 --> 00:19:51
chip on the right of all these ...

636
00:19:51 --> 00:19:55
on the right side of the right card.

637
00:19:55 --> 00:19:59
So, I must say that there is a conspiracy.

638
00:19:59 --> 00:20:02
If a card is changed, it could have problems.

639
00:20:02 --> 00:20:05
Discovering that this player could ...

640
00:20:05 --> 00:20:08
have a false score spoiled Billy master plan ...

641
00:20:08 --> 00:20:09
I wanted to do.

642
00:20:09 --> 00:20:10
That is, when you come home and you see two guys in the garage ...

643
00:20:10 --> 00:20:11
and you know why, and you have said ...

644
00:20:11 --> 00:20:12
why they are there, and you have to ...

645
00:20:12 --> 00:20:15
Someone like Bill Mitchell, that is, you know ...

646
00:20:15 --> 00:20:17
he has done folly after folly ...

647
00:20:17 --> 00:20:19
after crazy, you know?

648
00:20:19 --> 00:20:21
Billy Mitchell was one of the evaluators ...

649
00:20:21 --> 00:20:22
which is a bit strange.

650
00:20:22 --> 00:20:25
The guy competing against Steve ...

651
00:20:25 --> 00:20:28
decides whether your score is valid or not.

652
00:20:28 --> 00:20:31
Although it is a completely legal card ...

653
00:20:31 --> 00:20:33
Roy stain on it is too strong.

654
00:20:33 --> 00:20:35
&#39;&#39; Roy Shildt is a liar and a cheater.

655
00:20:35 --> 00:20:37
&#39;&#39; Roy Shildt is dross and goes for me.

656
00:20:37 --> 00:20:39
&#39;&#39; He&#39;s crazy, blah, blah. &#39;&#39;

657
00:20:39 --> 00:20:41
&lt;I&gt; Well, Bill Mitchell threatened physically. &lt;/ I&gt;

658
00:20:41 --> 00:20:45
&lt;I&gt; Hey, in fact, threatened to kill Bill Mitchell. &lt;/ I&gt;

659
00:20:45 --> 00:20:48
No, I did not do it. I did not do it. I did not do it.

660
00:20:48 --> 00:20:52
&lt;I&gt; was threatened himself to look like it was me ... &lt;/ i&gt;

661
00:20:52 --> 00:20:54
because ... to gain leverage ...

662
00:20:54 --> 00:20:56
with the other ... other people do not know.

663
00:20:56 --> 00:20:57
He imagined ...

664
00:20:57 --> 00:20:59
&lt;I&gt; know that my score Missile Command is authentic. &lt;/ I&gt;

665
00:20:59 --> 00:21:02
No matter what I say, always brings controversy.

666
00:21:02 --> 00:21:03
It&#39;s like abortion.

667
00:21:03 --> 00:21:05
If you support, you are a child of your mother.

668
00:21:05 --> 00:21:06
If you are against, you are a child of your mother.

669
00:21:06 --> 00:21:09
Eh, I&#39;m not God, I do not have all the answers.

670
00:21:09 --> 00:21:11
I must be careful with whom I speak.

671
00:21:11 --> 00:21:13
Roy was trying to help ...

672
00:21:13 --> 00:21:16
and I accepted his offer.

673
00:21:16 --> 00:21:18
Just, you know ... It was bad luck ...

674
00:21:18 --> 00:21:19
that association with him ...

675
00:21:19 --> 00:21:21
perjudicándome winding.

676
00:21:21 --> 00:21:24
We could not accept an aspiring card, so to speak.

677
00:21:24 --> 00:21:25
So we could not accept the score.

678
00:21:25 --> 00:21:28
Steve would tell him to forget the card ...

679
00:21:28 --> 00:21:32
&lt;I&gt; and Roy and only played in other machines of Donkey Kong ... &lt;/ i&gt;

680
00:21:32 --> 00:21:34
Funspot like, for example.

681
00:21:34 --> 00:21:35
The most important thing for me is to go ...

682
00:21:35 --> 00:21:37
&lt;I&gt; Funspot authorized places. &lt;/ I&gt;

683
00:21:37 --> 00:21:39
Hey, that makes it official.

684
00:21:39 --> 00:21:44
If tomorrow Tiger Woods finished with 59 hits, for nothing.

685
00:21:44 --> 00:21:46
Do in Augusta is when it counts.

686
00:21:46 --> 00:21:50
He never said ...

687
00:21:50 --> 00:21:52
as it should.

688
00:21:52 --> 00:21:55
I have taken many disappointments ...

689
00:21:55 --> 00:21:57
where you shrug and say ...

690
00:21:57 --> 00:21:58
&#39;&#39; Well, move on to the next thing. &#39;&#39;

691
00:21:58 --> 00:22:00
All would fit perfectly ...

692
00:22:00 --> 00:22:03
but he forgot one thing ...

693
00:22:03 --> 00:22:04
that I...

694
00:22:04 --> 00:22:06
Steve Wiebe convince not be a fool ...

695
00:22:06 --> 00:22:08
I dissuaded from becoming a fool.

696
00:22:08 --> 00:22:12
I did not think when I send him east.

697
00:22:12 --> 00:22:14
&lt;I&gt; I said, &#39;&#39; No doubt. Give them a beating. &#39;&#39; &lt;/ I&gt;

700
00:22:16 --> 00:22:19
Hi. My name is Justine and I am Miss Barker Winnipesaukee.

701
00:22:19 --> 00:22:20
Welcome to the seventh annual tournament ...

702
00:22:20 --> 00:22:23
Classic Games Museum at Funspot US.

703
00:22:23 --> 00:22:28
Funspot has become the best known place in the world ...

704
00:22:28 --> 00:22:31
for those who want to break records in classic games.

705
00:22:31 --> 00:22:33
## You&#39;re the best around here ##

706
00:22:33 --> 00:22:34
Nothing I can stop ## ##

707
00:22:34 --> 00:22:35
## You&#39;re the best ##

708
00:22:35 --> 00:22:38
Funspot is the Mecca of the classic games.

709
00:22:38 --> 00:22:40
This place is amazing.

710
00:22:40 --> 00:22:41
Funspot is the main place ...

711
00:22:41 --> 00:22:44
to which the press goes to meet superstars.

712
00:22:44 --> 00:22:47
You do not see many CMG ...

713
00:22:47 --> 00:22:49
&#39;&#39; Very pretty girls, &#39;&#39; if you did not know ...

714
00:22:49 --> 00:22:50
play.

715
00:22:50 --> 00:22:53
Top players of classic games in the world ...

716
00:22:53 --> 00:22:54
come to do the best are given.

717
00:22:54 --> 00:22:55
Play good.

718
00:22:55 --> 00:22:57
## You&#39;re the best around here ##

719
00:22:57 --> 00:22:59
Nothing can stop you ## ##

720
00:22:59 --> 00:23:00
## You&#39;re the best ##

721
00:23:00 --> 00:23:01
## ... Around here ##

722
00:23:01 --> 00:23:02
Just a few months ago ...

723
00:23:02 --> 00:23:04
I turned 30, I retired ...

724
00:23:04 --> 00:23:05
and I moved to New Hampshire.

725
00:23:05 --> 00:23:07
I live next to Funspot.

726
00:23:07 --> 00:23:08
Now Funspot game every day.

727
00:23:08 --> 00:23:09
&lt;I&gt; I&#39;ll eat 10 pieces of bacon well done ... &lt;/ i&gt;

728
00:23:09 --> 00:23:10
along with four boiled eggs.

729
00:23:10 --> 00:23:11
I&#39;ll take three pancakes ...

730
00:23:11 --> 00:23:12
and I hope to play a great game.

731
00:23:12 --> 00:23:13
I&#39;m in my garage.

732
00:23:13 --> 00:23:14
Let&#39;s call Billy Mitchell ...

733
00:23:14 --> 00:23:17
to see if he accepts a challenge Funspot.

734
00:23:17 --> 00:23:19
Here we go, I&#39;ll call.

735
00:23:19 --> 00:23:20
Hi. It&#39;s called Bill Mitchell.

736
00:23:20 --> 00:23:21
At this point I can not answer.

737
00:23:21 --> 00:23:22
Leave your name and phone number ...

738
00:23:22 --> 00:23:24
and I&#39;ll call you as soon as possible. Thank you.

739
00:23:24 --> 00:23:25
Leave your message at the tone.

740
00:23:25 --> 00:23:25
When ending the recording ...

741
00:23:25 --> 00:23:26
&lt;I&gt; He left the voicemail. &lt;/ I&gt;

742
00:23:26 --> 00:23:28
... Press &#39;&#39; 1 &#39;&#39; for more options.

743
00:23:28 --> 00:23:29
Hi, Billy. I&#39;m Steve Wiebe.

744
00:23:29 --> 00:23:30
I was calling to see how it goes.

745
00:23:30 --> 00:23:32
I hope you are well.

746
00:23:32 --> 00:23:34
I wanted to know what were your plans for Funspot.

747
00:23:34 --> 00:23:37
It was ... Walter Day invited me to go.

748
00:23:37 --> 00:23:38
I was wondering if you apetecería ...

749
00:23:38 --> 00:23:39
&lt;I&gt; that we, maybe, uh ... &lt;/ i&gt;

750
00:23:39 --> 00:23:41
Let&#39;s play a friendly game.

751
00:23:41 --> 00:23:43
I help many people who want to compete.

752
00:23:43 --> 00:23:45
If I think of my favorites ...

753
00:23:45 --> 00:23:48
that would help, she is the first.

754
00:23:48 --> 00:23:48
- Surprise. - Oh, dear.

755
00:23:48 --> 00:23:51
At the tender age of 80, will go to Funspot ...

756
00:23:51 --> 00:23:52
&lt;I&gt; and going to beat a world record in Qbert. &lt;/ I&gt;

757
00:23:52 --> 00:23:52
&lt;I&gt; COMPETlDORA OF QBERT &lt;/ i&gt;

758
00:23:52 --> 00:23:52
All right.

759
00:23:52 --> 00:23:53
- This is the challenge. - All right.

760
00:23:53 --> 00:23:54
- Agree? - Yes.

761
00:23:54 --> 00:23:55
Very good.

762
00:23:55 --> 00:23:56
Nothing can stop you ## ##

763
00:23:56 --> 00:23:58
## You&#39;re the best around here ##

764
00:23:58 --> 00:24:05
Nothing can stop you ## ##

765
00:24:05 --> 00:24:06
&lt;I&gt; We have a machine Donkey Kong ... &lt;/ i&gt;

766
00:24:06 --> 00:24:08
Funspot bought that year came on the market ...

767
00:24:08 --> 00:24:10
and it may be a little harder to play here.

768
00:24:10 --> 00:24:12
They complain that there are too many wild barrels.

769
00:24:12 --> 00:24:13
&lt;I&gt; Although it is a matter of chance ... &lt;/ i&gt;

770
00:24:13 --> 00:24:15
uh, if you want to break a record, you go to Funspot ...

771
00:24:15 --> 00:24:17
&lt;I&gt; and you do it in your Donkey Kong, everyone knows. &lt;/ I&gt;

772
00:24:17 --> 00:24:18
I do not want to give my record ...

773
00:24:18 --> 00:24:21
so I&#39;ve been asked to go and do it live.

774
00:24:21 --> 00:24:23
I think it&#39;s better to do it live, so ...

775
00:24:23 --> 00:24:25
&lt;I&gt; Donkey Kong excites me. &lt;/ I&gt;

776
00:24:25 --> 00:24:28
&lt;I&gt; Because I am a serious competitor of Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

777
00:24:28 --> 00:24:29
I try to beat the record ...

778
00:24:29 --> 00:24:31
Billy Mitchell achieved in 1982.

779
00:24:31 --> 00:24:33
Hey, Nicole, she ... I stressed out ...

780
00:24:33 --> 00:24:37
stay home the weekend with the kids without me.

781
00:24:37 --> 00:24:38
&lt;I&gt; I think it&#39;s sick of Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

782
00:24:38 --> 00:24:40
It does not seem to never end.

783
00:24:40 --> 00:24:41
It is an important weekend, and I hope ...

784
00:24:41 --> 00:24:42
&lt;I&gt; that this type appears ... &lt;/ i&gt;

785
00:24:42 --> 00:24:43
because, uh, you know, want to tell ...

786
00:24:43 --> 00:24:45
&lt;I&gt;, uh, it is the champion of Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

787
00:24:45 --> 00:24:47
And, uh, the fact is that, uh ...

788
00:24:47 --> 00:24:49
&lt;I&gt; no one has seen him play Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

789
00:24:49 --> 00:24:51
Nobody noticed me at first.

790
00:24:51 --> 00:24:54
He was looking for someone to pay ...

791
00:24:54 --> 00:24:56
to register for the tournament.

792
00:24:56 --> 00:24:58
&lt;I&gt; I recognized Robert Mruczek. &lt;/ I&gt;

793
00:24:58 --> 00:25:00
A Zack 30 seconds left to die.

794
00:25:00 --> 00:25:03
&lt;I&gt; So I went to the Donkey Kong machine. &lt;/ I&gt;

795
00:25:03 --> 00:25:04
Well, it seems a good story.

796
00:25:04 --> 00:25:05
It seems that the player mysterious ...

797
00:25:05 --> 00:25:06
West Coast, Steve Wiebe is here ...

798
00:25:06 --> 00:25:07
&lt;I&gt; uh, playing Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

799
00:25:07 --> 00:25:08
&lt;I&gt; Maybe I miss watching the tournament ... &lt;/ i&gt;

800
00:25:08 --> 00:25:09
to go to see him.

801
00:25:09 --> 00:25:10
- Hello, Walter. - You could come.

802
00:25:10 --> 00:25:11
- I&#39;m glad to see you. - Equally.

803
00:25:11 --> 00:25:12
I&#39;m so glad you came.

804
00:25:12 --> 00:25:13
Yes.

805
00:25:13 --> 00:25:15
It was a long flight.

806
00:25:15 --> 00:25:18
Not to distract a lot. Roy Will he come?

807
00:25:18 --> 00:25:19
No, I do not think so.

808
00:25:19 --> 00:25:20
He said nothing, unless ...

809
00:25:20 --> 00:25:20
&lt;I&gt; When you talked to him last? &lt;/ I&gt;

810
00:25:20 --> 00:25:22
&lt;I&gt; Maybe a week ago or a few days ago. &lt;/ I&gt;

811
00:25:22 --> 00:25:23
Steve, apparently ...

812
00:25:23 --> 00:25:23
It is here now ...

813
00:25:23 --> 00:25:25
to prove you have what it takes.

814
00:25:25 --> 00:25:29
&lt;I&gt; But with Donkey Kong, is, you know ... A little variable. &lt;/ I&gt;

815
00:25:29 --> 00:25:33
You could, uh, have bad luck with barrels.

816
00:25:33 --> 00:25:34
With the fireballs.

817
00:25:34 --> 00:25:35
Conveyors, elevators.

818
00:25:35 --> 00:25:37
That machine is very difficult.

819
00:25:37 --> 00:25:40
People think that the machine is possessed.

820
00:25:40 --> 00:25:41
Even Bill believes he is possessed.

821
00:25:41 --> 00:25:44
But, hey, if Steve takes 850,000 or more ...

822
00:25:44 --> 00:25:46
this machine will be a good score.

823
00:25:46 --> 00:25:46
Billy Mitchell is the champion.

824
00:25:46 --> 00:25:47
That makes me prodigy.

825
00:25:47 --> 00:25:49
We have to wonder against rookie.

826
00:25:49 --> 00:25:51
You can compare athletic events, eh ...

827
00:25:51 --> 00:25:52
with this, because this is, you know ...

828
00:25:52 --> 00:25:54
these four days are real warning ...

829
00:25:54 --> 00:25:56
and attention and, uh, you know ...

830
00:25:56 --> 00:25:58
not as hard as a decathlon or a triathlon ...

831
00:25:58 --> 00:25:59
but still, very hard.

832
00:25:59 --> 00:26:01
Do you want to respond?

833
00:26:01 --> 00:26:02
It is Funspot.

834
00:26:02 --> 00:26:03
Yes?

835
00:26:03 --> 00:26:04
Hi Brian. How are you?

836
00:26:04 --> 00:26:05
Steve Wiebe came ...

837
00:26:05 --> 00:26:07
&lt;I&gt; and I&#39;ve been in Donkey Kong all the time. &lt;/ I&gt;

838
00:26:07 --> 00:26:08
Hey, what do you think?

839
00:26:08 --> 00:26:09
Hey, I&#39;ll, uh, you know, play ...

840
00:26:09 --> 00:26:10
over the shoulder of Steve Wiebe.

841
00:26:10 --> 00:26:11
All right. We talk later.

842
00:26:11 --> 00:26:11
- Good. - Bye.

843
00:26:11 --> 00:26:12
Bye.

844
00:26:12 --> 00:26:14
Brian Kuh appeared. It is one of a kind ...

845
00:26:14 --> 00:26:18
who came to my house that fateful afternoon ...

846
00:26:18 --> 00:26:19
to examine my machine.

847
00:26:19 --> 00:26:23
We will exceed 520,000 with the first life.

848
00:26:23 --> 00:26:24
We&#39;re seeing, uh ...

849
00:26:24 --> 00:26:27
a memorable game in the tournament Funspot.

850
00:26:27 --> 00:26:28
&lt;I&gt; Maybe I&#39;ll skip dinner ... &lt;/ i&gt;

851
00:26:28 --> 00:26:28
and make a game ...

852
00:26:28 --> 00:26:29
and return with a score.

853
00:26:29 --> 00:26:31
- Come in, Brian. - Yes.

854
00:26:31 --> 00:26:32
That monkey is very, very clever ...

855
00:26:32 --> 00:26:34
and will you need to stop.

856
00:26:34 --> 00:26:36
&lt;I&gt; I could not go up quickly and gave me the left. &lt;/ I&gt;

857
00:26:36 --> 00:26:37
Yes.

858
00:26:37 --> 00:26:39
I got 229,000 points.

859
00:26:39 --> 00:26:41
Bad game, considering I&#39;ve already played some.

860
00:26:41 --> 00:26:43
Almost half of what he got Steve ...

861
00:26:43 --> 00:26:44
and Steve is playing again.

862
00:26:44 --> 00:26:45
&lt;I&gt; All right. We started in the Qbert. &lt;/ I&gt;

863
00:26:45 --> 00:26:46
Le took time.

864
00:26:46 --> 00:26:48
You said you left your other vices ...

865
00:26:48 --> 00:26:49
to practice.

866
00:26:49 --> 00:26:50
We will not lose or be disappointed.

867
00:26:50 --> 00:26:50
We will win.

868
00:26:50 --> 00:26:53
I have a project, something much more important.

869
00:26:53 --> 00:26:56
I want you to deliver this.

870
00:26:56 --> 00:26:58
What is that?

871
00:26:58 --> 00:26:59
It is the score you want to see ...

872
00:26:59 --> 00:27:01
and I have for a long time.

873
00:27:01 --> 00:27:02
You give it to Robert or Walter.

874
00:27:02 --> 00:27:03
You can lose your luggage, but not the tape.

875
00:27:03 --> 00:27:04
- Very good. - Very good?

876
00:27:04 --> 00:27:05
I do it just for fun.

877
00:27:05 --> 00:27:07
When I scores, I do himself.

878
00:27:07 --> 00:27:08
It is very convoluted.

879
00:27:08 --> 00:27:11
It has everything well tied.

880
00:27:11 --> 00:27:12
We are seeing a great game here.

881
00:27:12 --> 00:27:16
Hey, almost ... Hey, Steve almost lost a life here ...

882
00:27:16 --> 00:27:16
at the end of this screen.

883
00:27:16 --> 00:27:17
He was very, very lucky.

884
00:27:17 --> 00:27:20
&lt;I&gt; The chance was the opposite of normal. &lt;/ I&gt;

885
00:27:20 --> 00:27:21
And, uh, Steve still playing.

886
00:27:21 --> 00:27:23
Oh. I did not see it.

887
00:27:23 --> 00:27:25
Steve Wiebe with his second life.

888
00:27:25 --> 00:27:26
It has 696,000 points.

889
00:27:26 --> 00:27:28
- Who is this guy? - How? Steve Wiebe.

890
00:27:28 --> 00:27:29
- I will not bother you anymore. - Does not matter.

891
00:27:29 --> 00:27:30
- I wanted to salute you. - Yes Encantado..

892
00:27:30 --> 00:27:31
- Yeah, you too. - Agree.

893
00:27:31 --> 00:27:33
It could get over it if ...

894
00:27:33 --> 00:27:35
He would have to make a very good game.

895
00:27:35 --> 00:27:36
I do not think Billy knows the tricks ...

896
00:27:36 --> 00:27:38
but I think it&#39;s very good in the elevators.

897
00:27:38 --> 00:27:41
Well, Steve Wiebe has now 870,000 points ...

898
00:27:41 --> 00:27:42
&lt;I&gt; in an active game of Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

899
00:27:42 --> 00:27:44
Hey, if it exceeds some more screens ...

900
00:27:44 --> 00:27:46
you can reach the killer screen.

901
00:27:46 --> 00:27:47
Hey, so I know ...

902
00:27:47 --> 00:27:48
no one has ever reached the screen killer ...

903
00:27:48 --> 00:27:50
&lt;I&gt; in a machine Donkey Kong at Funspot. &lt;/ I&gt;

904
00:27:50 --> 00:27:54
Classic games have things in common.

905
00:27:54 --> 00:27:56
They have an end game.

906
00:27:56 --> 00:27:58
Not enough memory for the final screen.

907
00:27:58 --> 00:28:00
It is called &#39;&#39; screen killer &#39;&#39; because, basically ...

908
00:28:00 --> 00:28:01
no way to finish the level.

909
00:28:01 --> 00:28:05
Any data or code within the program ...

910
00:28:05 --> 00:28:07
It ends up being used to what you see on the screen.

911
00:28:07 --> 00:28:10
&lt;I&gt; Donkey Kong is very strange, because you can ... &lt;/ i&gt;

912
00:28:10 --> 00:28:11
play the fi ...

913
00:28:11 --> 00:28:12
the level of the screen kills about five seconds or so.

914
00:28:12 --> 00:28:12
Everything seems normal ...

915
00:28:12 --> 00:28:14
and suddenly, Mario leaps and dies.

916
00:28:14 --> 00:28:18
Those who came, apart from myself ...

917
00:28:18 --> 00:28:22
&lt;I&gt; that have reached the end of Donkey Kong with witnesses ... &lt;/ i&gt;

918
00:28:22 --> 00:28:24
Gosh, I think nobody has done it.

919
00:28:24 --> 00:28:25
If you want to see ...

920
00:28:25 --> 00:28:27
&lt;I&gt; the killer screen Donkey Kong &lt;i /&gt; will appear.

921
00:28:27 --> 00:28:29
&lt;I&gt; the killer screen Donkey Kong &lt;/ i&gt; will appear ...

922
00:28:29 --> 00:28:30
if they want to see it.

923
00:28:30 --> 00:28:31
You have to know how to act in the show ...

924
00:28:31 --> 00:28:32
an opponent ...

925
00:28:32 --> 00:28:34
you look in the eyes, the game ...

926
00:28:34 --> 00:28:35
&lt;I&gt; Maybe even make mental games with you. &lt;/ I&gt;

927
00:28:35 --> 00:28:36
That is, all ... is part of being champion.

928
00:28:36 --> 00:28:37
You have to overcome it.

929
00:28:37 --> 00:28:40
&lt;I&gt; Possible killer screen Donkey Kong if they want to see. &lt;/ I&gt;

930
00:28:40 --> 00:28:43
I know it&#39;s not on my side.

931
00:28:43 --> 00:28:46
It is one of the disciples of Billy.

932
00:28:46 --> 00:28:48
It&#39;s, uh ... You know, have to play perfectly.

933
00:28:48 --> 00:28:50
&lt;I&gt; is the most difficult part of Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

934
00:28:50 --> 00:28:52
And, uh, you know, not going to put anything easy.

935
00:28:52 --> 00:28:53
&lt;I&gt; Maybe it&#39;s an exciting time ... &lt;/ i&gt;

936
00:28:53 --> 00:28:55
or, you know, pressure can be with him.

937
00:28:55 --> 00:28:56
unexpected elements may occur.

938
00:28:56 --> 00:28:57
Hey, it seems that ended another level ...

939
00:28:57 --> 00:29:00
but could come a wild barrel or a ball of aggressive fire.

940
00:29:00 --> 00:29:02
I thought I would get the first screen of a Funspot killer.

941
00:29:02 --> 00:29:04
But I got caught three balls of fire.

942
00:29:04 --> 00:29:06
He had the hammer, but I still killed.

943
00:29:06 --> 00:29:08
&lt;I&gt; can happen in Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

944
00:29:08 --> 00:29:10
Eh, someone else gets the killer screen ...

945
00:29:10 --> 00:29:11
It would be a shame, but let&#39;s see what happens.

946
00:29:11 --> 00:29:12
&lt;I&gt; may yield to pressure ... &lt;/ i&gt;

947
00:29:12 --> 00:29:14
and have my first opportunity to do so.

948
00:29:14 --> 00:29:16
&lt;I&gt; Possible killer screen Donkey Kong ... &lt;/ i&gt;

949
00:29:16 --> 00:29:17
if they want to see it.

950
00:29:17 --> 00:29:18
Hey, Todd, if you are interested ...

951
00:29:18 --> 00:29:19
there is a possible killer screen Donkey Kong ...

952
00:29:19 --> 00:29:20
in a few minutes.

953
00:29:20 --> 00:29:24
I think the energy back to me.

954
00:29:24 --> 00:29:26
&lt;I&gt; I felt like a zombie ... &lt;/ i&gt;

955
00:29:26 --> 00:29:27
in the middle of the game.

956
00:29:27 --> 00:29:28
But towards the end, I felt ...

957
00:29:28 --> 00:29:30
some natural emotion of the crowd ...

958
00:29:30 --> 00:29:31
and enthusiasm.

959
00:29:31 --> 00:29:32
So I drove ...

960
00:29:32 --> 00:29:35
and he gave me energy to complete the game.

961
00:29:35 --> 00:29:38
ASESlNA THE SCREEN

962
00:29:38 --> 00:29:40
The killer screen, there it is.

963
00:29:40 --> 00:29:41
Duraclon 985,600 TOTAL POINTS: 2 HOURS 27 MlNUTOS

964
00:29:41 --> 00:29:44
&lt;I&gt; This is the maximum score of Donkey Kong made public. &lt;/ I&gt;

965
00:29:44 --> 00:29:46
Hey, Walter Day was confirmed that ...

966
00:29:46 --> 00:29:48
the highest score in history ...

967
00:29:48 --> 00:29:50
and was the first killer screen ...

968
00:29:50 --> 00:29:52
Funspot on a machine.

969
00:29:52 --> 00:29:53
Steve Wiebe has become the third person ...

970
00:29:53 --> 00:29:55
&lt;I&gt; to reach the killer screen Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

971
00:29:55 --> 00:29:57
It is pure and verification.

972
00:29:57 --> 00:29:58
You understand?

973
00:29:58 --> 00:29:59
There is nothing better than I did ...

974
00:29:59 --> 00:30:00
to the public.

975
00:30:00 --> 00:30:02
The process is valid in itself.

976
00:30:02 --> 00:30:04
&lt;I&gt; He faced and discards all ... &lt;/ i&gt;

977
00:30:04 --> 00:30:05
any doubts that may exist.

978
00:30:05 --> 00:30:07
You will receive all the praise you deserve and so ...

979
00:30:07 --> 00:30:09
this is how it is, but, you know ...

980
00:30:09 --> 00:30:11
you&#39;ve washed your image to come and play here ...

981
00:30:11 --> 00:30:11
so it&#39;s OK.

982
00:30:11 --> 00:30:12
I guess there was some sort ...

983
00:30:12 --> 00:30:14
of impromptu press conference after ...

984
00:30:14 --> 00:30:15
after getting the score.

985
00:30:15 --> 00:30:17
There was, you know ... There were cameras during the game.

986
00:30:17 --> 00:30:18
There were chambers where Steve Wiebe.

987
00:30:18 --> 00:30:21
There were cameras in the crowd focusing on Steve Wiebe.

988
00:30:21 --> 00:30:23
I did not tell all people.

989
00:30:23 --> 00:30:24
There were many witnesses to the public ...

990
00:30:24 --> 00:30:25
and people watching, so ...

991
00:30:25 --> 00:30:28
&lt;I&gt; checked in a machine Donkey Kong legitimate score ... &lt;/ i&gt;

992
00:30:28 --> 00:30:29
Steve Wiebe now.

993
00:30:29 --> 00:30:30
Just log in lnternet ...

994
00:30:30 --> 00:30:32
on page Twin Galaxies ...

995
00:30:32 --> 00:30:36
the news that Steve Wiebe just got 985,600 points ...

996
00:30:36 --> 00:30:37
which basically it is the first place ...

997
00:30:37 --> 00:30:39
officially recognized on the website.

998
00:30:39 --> 00:30:41
It has been declared world champion.

999
00:30:41 --> 00:30:42
Let&#39;s see what happens now ...

1000
00:30:42 --> 00:30:46
Steve has put pressure on Billy Mitchell.

1001
00:30:46 --> 00:30:46
Thank you.

1002
00:30:46 --> 00:30:46
[AFTER phone with Billy]

1003
00:30:46 --> 00:30:47
I think it has been a blow to him.

1004
00:30:47 --> 00:30:47
Thanks for loaning me the phone.

1005
00:30:47 --> 00:30:48
It was an important call ...

1006
00:30:48 --> 00:30:51
Oh, no, no. I get it.

1007
00:30:51 --> 00:30:52
Yes, I can imagine me.

1008
00:30:52 --> 00:30:54
I do not think he has made her very excited.

1009
00:30:54 --> 00:30:55
Yes, said the tape of the game ...

1010
00:30:55 --> 00:30:57
who sent more importantly, uh ...

1011
00:30:57 --> 00:30:57
more important than ever, I guess.

1012
00:30:57 --> 00:30:59
- Do not tell anybody. - No, well, of course.

1013
00:30:59 --> 00:31:01
KUH BRlAN SHACK

1014
00:31:01 --> 00:31:03
We all list invitation only.

1015
00:31:03 --> 00:31:05
And, uh, you know what? Walter is here.

1016
00:31:05 --> 00:31:07
We&#39;re just telling jokes and having fun.

1017
00:31:07 --> 00:31:08
Hey, who&#39;s there? ¿Todd and Duane?

1018
00:31:08 --> 00:31:09
Yes.

1019
00:31:09 --> 00:31:10
I mean it&#39;s a good idea ...

1020
00:31:10 --> 00:31:11
to greet Todd.

1021
00:31:11 --> 00:31:11
I&#39;ll tell you...

1022
00:31:11 --> 00:31:12
&lt;I&gt; that is currently playing Lady Bug. &lt;/ I&gt;

1023
00:31:12 --> 00:31:13
I not think we should stop.

1024
00:31:13 --> 00:31:15
&lt;I&gt; There&#39;s a cabaret theater in the cabin Lady Bug ... &lt;/ i&gt;

1025
00:31:15 --> 00:31:16
and Todd have a good score.

1026
00:31:16 --> 00:31:18
Well, hand me Walter.

1027
00:31:18 --> 00:31:20
Eh, a couple of hours we were in Funspot ...

1028
00:31:20 --> 00:31:22
and, uh, Brian Kuh said ...

1029
00:31:22 --> 00:31:25
Billy, uh, something had sent us to the cabin.

1030
00:31:25 --> 00:31:26
Ah!

1031
00:31:26 --> 00:31:27
Brian Kuh is a bit ...

1032
00:31:27 --> 00:31:28
It&#39;s like a close friend of Billy.

1033
00:31:28 --> 00:31:30
Talk to him all the time.

1034
00:31:30 --> 00:31:33
Hey, he said that everyone would see what was on the tape.

1035
00:31:33 --> 00:31:35
Is Brian Kuh?

1036
00:31:35 --> 00:31:37
He knows all about the tape.

1037
00:31:37 --> 00:31:39
He knows he has to protect the tape with his life.

1038
00:31:39 --> 00:31:39
I explained.

1039
00:31:39 --> 00:31:41
He could lose his life, but not the tape.

1040
00:31:41 --> 00:31:43
Who wants to hear the announcement?

1041
00:31:43 --> 00:31:46
&lt;I&gt; Even in Florida, the long arm of Billy Mitchell ... &lt;/ i&gt;

1042
00:31:46 --> 00:31:48
He has reached the Funspot seven ...

1043
00:31:48 --> 00:31:50
to create more interesting developments.

1044
00:31:50 --> 00:31:53
Let&#39;s put this tape on the screen ...

1045
00:31:53 --> 00:31:56
and basically if Steve Wiebe or Brian Kuh ...

1046
00:31:56 --> 00:31:59
or anyone wants to beat the record of this tape ...

1047
00:31:59 --> 00:32:01
before four o&#39;clock tomorrow afternoon ...

1048
00:32:01 --> 00:32:04
He will give you $ 10,000, right?

1049
00:32:04 --> 00:32:07
We know that Billy Mitchell can afford their promises, okay?

1050
00:32:07 --> 00:32:10
He has it while I try to reach one million live.

1051
00:32:10 --> 00:32:14
It has for people, you know, Funspot ...

1052
00:32:14 --> 00:32:17
and you meet ... and watch your tape.

1053
00:32:17 --> 00:32:19
Well, here we go. There are cameras on the screen ...

1054
00:32:19 --> 00:32:19
cameras in public.

1055
00:32:19 --> 00:32:20
Nobody is going to lose this time.

1056
00:32:20 --> 00:32:21
998.2.

1057
00:32:21 --> 00:32:22
Here we go.

1058
00:32:22 --> 00:32:25
All eyes of the public are on your screen.

1059
00:32:25 --> 00:32:26
Everyone looks, all cameras are here.

1060
00:32:26 --> 00:32:27
No we are going to lose anything.

1061
00:32:27 --> 00:32:28
I do not think distractions ...

1062
00:32:28 --> 00:32:29
they can steer people away now.

1063
00:32:29 --> 00:32:30
Oh, look at that.

1064
00:32:30 --> 00:32:32
With the bonus, we have the first game of a million ...

1065
00:32:32 --> 00:32:33
&lt;I&gt; Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

1066
00:32:33 --> 00:32:35
And the result says zero.

1067
00:32:35 --> 00:32:37
Only six zeros are.

1068
00:32:37 --> 00:32:40
Not even Helen of Troy received much attention.

1069
00:32:40 --> 00:32:43
Billy got the audience in his pocket, and is not even here.

1070
00:32:43 --> 00:32:47
It&#39;s his way of, you know ...

1071
00:32:47 --> 00:32:50
foreshadow what I was doing, you know ...

1072
00:32:50 --> 00:32:53
give hype Billy tape.

1073
00:32:53 --> 00:32:56
1047200 points ...

1074
00:32:56 --> 00:32:57
It is the highest score he has ever been.

1075
00:32:57 --> 00:32:58
I do not know. I guess Walter should go to the office ...

1076
00:32:58 --> 00:33:00
that computer, right?

1077
00:33:00 --> 00:33:01
Well, uh, go ahead and, uh ...

1078
00:33:01 --> 00:33:03
Pásale phone ahead and Walter, fast.

1079
00:33:03 --> 00:33:04
Hi, Billy.

1080
00:33:04 --> 00:33:06
Very good. Everything looks fantastic.

1081
00:33:06 --> 00:33:08
Billy may be the person more like ...

1082
00:33:08 --> 00:33:09
a Jedi of all players ...

1083
00:33:09 --> 00:33:13
and joke says that &#39;&#39; Obi-Wan Kenobia &#39;&#39; people.

1084
00:33:13 --> 00:33:15
Can I see some tape Billy?

1085
00:33:15 --> 00:33:16
Do you care who sees Billy?

1086
00:33:16 --> 00:33:18
No, I can not teach you the tape.

1087
00:33:18 --> 00:33:19
&lt;I&gt; Only I put once. &lt;/ I&gt;

1088
00:33:19 --> 00:33:20
Steve Wiebe had no chance ...

1089
00:33:20 --> 00:33:21
&lt;I&gt; to see anything of what made Bill Mitchell. &lt;/ I&gt;

1090
00:33:21 --> 00:33:23
So, Bill Mitchell played with great advantage.

1091
00:33:23 --> 00:33:24
When Billy Mitchell saw ...

1092
00:33:24 --> 00:33:27
the world record winning film Steve ...

1093
00:33:27 --> 00:33:29
he studied the technique of Steve.

1094
00:33:29 --> 00:33:30
When the man said: &#39;&#39; Show me your papers &#39;&#39;

1095
00:33:30 --> 00:33:31
and Obi-Wan Kenobi responded ...

1096
00:33:31 --> 00:33:32
&#39;&#39; No need to see our papers &#39;&#39;

1097
00:33:32 --> 00:33:33
and suddenly, the guy says, &#39;Come ...

1098
00:33:33 --> 00:33:34
&#39;&#39; I do not need to see your papers. &#39;&#39;

1099
00:33:34 --> 00:33:36
[SPEAKING WITH Billy MlTCHELL]

1100
00:33:36 --> 00:33:37
Let me ask you a question, because ...

1101
00:33:37 --> 00:33:39
I want to make sure I understand what you&#39;re trying to say.

1102
00:33:39 --> 00:33:41
Are you officially submitting your score?

1103
00:33:41 --> 00:33:43
They saw the tape, which undoubtedly is a copy ...

1104
00:33:43 --> 00:33:44
because I&#39;m sure they did not send the original.

1105
00:33:44 --> 00:33:49
&lt;I&gt; We will send a copy or the original Rob Mrcuzek ... &lt;/ i&gt;

1106
00:33:49 --> 00:33:52
which he is the head of Twin Galaxies referee.

1107
00:33:52 --> 00:33:55
I want to promote Twin Galaxies as &#39;&#39; integrity above all. &#39;&#39;

1108
00:33:55 --> 00:33:58
Hey, I&#39;ll do it until I die.

1109
00:33:58 --> 00:34:03
&lt;I&gt; If you know that a player cheated and deceives us ... &lt;/ i&gt;

1110
00:34:03 --> 00:34:06
&lt;I&gt; we will ensure that the score is not recognized. &lt;/ I&gt;

1111
00:34:06 --> 00:34:10
Robert says that there was a jump in scoring.

1112
00:34:10 --> 00:34:11
How is it possible?

1113
00:34:11 --> 00:34:12
&lt;I&gt; Does the player made a pause? &lt;/ I&gt;

1114
00:34:12 --> 00:34:14
Illegal system failures or too much.

1115
00:34:14 --> 00:34:16
Then it is a copy. Obviously.

1116
00:34:16 --> 00:34:19
&lt;I&gt; So the part of the left is so blurred. &lt;/ I&gt;

1117
00:34:19 --> 00:34:22
We did not believe that you were presenting.

1118
00:34:22 --> 00:34:23
Did they cheat?

1119
00:34:23 --> 00:34:25
They will paused the game after being charged ...

1120
00:34:25 --> 00:34:27
&lt;I&gt; to use the flying erase head ... &lt;/ i&gt;

1121
00:34:27 --> 00:34:29
and reload the game with different settings?

1122
00:34:29 --> 00:34:30
I find stuff.

1123
00:34:30 --> 00:34:33
I can take a week, week and a half to finish this tape ...

1124
00:34:33 --> 00:34:34
to answer your question.

1125
00:34:34 --> 00:34:36
10 AFTER WATCHING MlNUTOS ClNTA OF Billy

1126
00:34:36 --> 00:34:38
I think we can accept the score.

1127
00:34:38 --> 00:34:40
Let me see if I can put it on the website, right?

1128
00:34:40 --> 00:34:42
&lt;I&gt; All these games are fixed to the left. &lt;/ I&gt;

1129
00:34:42 --> 00:34:44
&lt;I&gt; Walter is updating the website now. &lt;/ I&gt;

1130
00:34:44 --> 00:34:45
Well, we just promoted to Billy Mitchell.

1131
00:34:45 --> 00:34:46
We send your score officially.

1132
00:34:46 --> 00:34:49
Hey, 1,047,000 and, what else, Billy?

1133
00:34:49 --> 00:34:50
- Two hundred or three hundred? - Two Hundred.

1134
00:34:50 --> 00:34:51
I thought.

1135
00:34:51 --> 00:34:52
You have been removed.

1136
00:34:52 --> 00:34:53
In the barrels, yes.

1137
00:34:53 --> 00:34:55
It&#39;s a bit ironic that it was ...

1138
00:34:55 --> 00:34:58
He was always demanding live scores.

1139
00:34:58 --> 00:35:01
&lt;I&gt; Here I am at Funspot, making a great effort ... &lt;/ i&gt;

1140
00:35:01 --> 00:35:02
to get it live ...

1141
00:35:02 --> 00:35:04
and goes and sends a recorded score ...

1142
00:35:04 --> 00:35:05
and the record is carried.

1143
00:35:05 --> 00:35:06
headquarters world record, tell me?

1144
00:35:06 --> 00:35:09
&lt;I&gt; If the score, if Donkey Kong is what defines Billy Mitchell ... &lt;/ i&gt;

1145
00:35:09 --> 00:35:12
Why he did not took time to go to Funspot?

1146
00:35:12 --> 00:35:13
Steve itself could. Steve works.

1147
00:35:13 --> 00:35:14
Steve has family. Steve has children.

1148
00:35:14 --> 00:35:15
He was. Why can not Billy?

1149
00:35:15 --> 00:35:19
I think he feels the pressure, eh ...

1150
00:35:19 --> 00:35:22
meet the expectations of the people ...

1151
00:35:22 --> 00:35:24
and is much press ...

1152
00:35:24 --> 00:35:25
and if he does not succeed ...

1153
00:35:25 --> 00:35:27
I think they feel has failed.

1154
00:35:27 --> 00:35:29
And I think you&#39;re sorry.

1155
00:35:29 --> 00:35:32
If I were to exceed one million, he would show ...

1156
00:35:32 --> 00:35:33
you know, that it has already done ...

1157
00:35:33 --> 00:35:35
because nobody knows I&#39;ve done.

1158
00:35:35 --> 00:35:38
REDMOND, WASHlNGTON AFTER 9 MONTHS

1159
00:35:38 --> 00:35:40
I have not thought much about, uh ...

1160
00:35:40 --> 00:35:41
you know, the dispute.

1161
00:35:41 --> 00:35:43
I have forgotten since I went to Funspot ...

1162
00:35:43 --> 00:35:46
and I gave everything I could. I beat my own record.

1163
00:35:46 --> 00:35:49
I&#39;ve been killing me at school, 12 or 14 hours ...

1164
00:35:49 --> 00:35:51
three classes preparing and editing ...

1165
00:35:51 --> 00:35:52
every day after school.

1166
00:35:52 --> 00:35:53
Almost until eight.

1167
00:35:53 --> 00:35:56
Many of my songs are rock ...

1168
00:35:56 --> 00:36:00
with many different guitars and voices.

1169
00:36:00 --> 00:36:02
&lt;I&gt; This is titled Three lies. I was going to sing ... &lt;/ i&gt;

1170
00:36:02 --> 00:36:05
in this cold summer day.

1171
00:36:05 --> 00:36:07
This is me actually.

1172
00:36:07 --> 00:36:08
I&#39;m supposed to be an artist ...

1173
00:36:08 --> 00:36:10
which is getting wild and crazy.

1174
00:36:10 --> 00:36:12
## I did not tell you ##

1175
00:36:12 --> 00:36:13
## You, you, you, you, you ##

1176
00:36:13 --> 00:36:16
Never stop loving ## ##

1177
00:36:16 --> 00:36:18
Soy-- because I am Mr. Marker ...

1178
00:36:18 --> 00:36:19
I do it for 25 years ...

1179
00:36:19 --> 00:36:21
and active many things automatically.

1180
00:36:21 --> 00:36:21
&#39;&#39;Okay, yes.

1181
00:36:21 --> 00:36:22
&lt;I&gt; &#39;&#39; And the reason is this ... &lt;/ i&gt;

1182
00:36:22 --> 00:36:23
&lt;I&gt; &#39;&#39; and the reason is this one, &#39;&#39; you know. &lt;/ I&gt;

1183
00:36:23 --> 00:36:24
I am now ready to ...

1184
00:36:24 --> 00:36:25
I&#39;m ready to release it.

1185
00:36:25 --> 00:36:28
## Two lies are more than enough ##

1186
00:36:28 --> 00:36:31
## But probably I tell three lies ##

1187
00:36:31 --> 00:36:32
## Goodbye Love ##

1188
00:36:32 --> 00:36:33
No matter how many people participate ...

1189
00:36:33 --> 00:36:34
It is my creation because it came ...

1190
00:36:34 --> 00:36:36
my psyche, you know.

1191
00:36:36 --> 00:36:39
The others are more attached ...

1192
00:36:39 --> 00:36:40
and they think they need more.

1193
00:36:40 --> 00:36:42
&lt;I&gt; Part of the reason I still do ... &lt;/ i&gt;

1194
00:36:42 --> 00:36:46
It is to help them make a profit ...

1195
00:36:46 --> 00:36:47
or happiness of this ...

1196
00:36:47 --> 00:36:49
so you can continue to benefit people.

1197
00:36:49 --> 00:36:50
Because it is in such a state ...

1198
00:36:50 --> 00:36:52
I do not have to do Twin Galaxies ...

1199
00:36:52 --> 00:36:52
but I would like...

1200
00:36:52 --> 00:36:54
see a positive close.

1201
00:36:54 --> 00:36:57
Boy, I have cold fingers. It&#39;s cold.

1202
00:36:57 --> 00:36:59
People ask me what my alias ...

1203
00:36:59 --> 00:37:01
what were my three initials.

1204
00:37:01 --> 00:37:06
I mean, come on. I tell people: &#39;Look at me&#39; &#39;.

1205
00:37:06 --> 00:37:08
What do you think were my three initials?

1206
00:37:08 --> 00:37:10
If you do not, you are not looking good.

1207
00:37:10 --> 00:37:11
¿TLE?

1208
00:37:11 --> 00:37:12
Do not.

1209
00:37:12 --> 00:37:13
What wore yesterday?

1210
00:37:13 --> 00:37:14
- The bandera-- - USA

1211
00:37:14 --> 00:37:18
Latino USA and Canadian friends had ...

1212
00:37:18 --> 00:37:20
and he had to leave better Americans.

1213
00:37:20 --> 00:37:21
SE ARRlENDA

1214
00:37:21 --> 00:37:23
Hi. This is a message for Walter.

1215
00:37:23 --> 00:37:25
I&#39;m Craig Glenday of Guinness records.

1216
00:37:25 --> 00:37:26
They called Guinness in England.

1217
00:37:26 --> 00:37:27
They want the call right away.

1218
00:37:27 --> 00:37:28
Hi. Craig speaking.

1219
00:37:28 --> 00:37:30
Craig, I&#39;m Walter Day of Twin Galaxies, how are you?

1220
00:37:30 --> 00:37:32
They will tell the world that rely on what we do ...

1221
00:37:32 --> 00:37:33
and consider what we do ...

1222
00:37:33 --> 00:37:35
true and honest, so ...

1223
00:37:35 --> 00:37:37
They will support us as bookmarks and official suppliers ...

1224
00:37:37 --> 00:37:39
electronic gaming content ...

1225
00:37:39 --> 00:37:40
for future books.

1226
00:37:40 --> 00:37:41
It has become very complicated.

1227
00:37:41 --> 00:37:41
&lt;I&gt; EDlTOR HEAD OF LlBRO GUlNNESS &lt;/ i&gt;

1228
00:37:41 --> 00:37:42
Having someone like Walter and his team ...

1229
00:37:42 --> 00:37:43
they know everything there is to know ...

1230
00:37:43 --> 00:37:46
on computer games, eh, it was a godsend.

1231
00:37:46 --> 00:37:47
Like most people also read your book ...

1232
00:37:47 --> 00:37:48
some people would be interested ...

1233
00:37:48 --> 00:37:50
&lt;I&gt; by what the world record Donkey Kong. &lt;/ I&gt;

1234

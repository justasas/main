00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:15,038

37
00:03:24,201 --> 00:03:26,121
'She said, "Yes."

38
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:28,641
'I said, "You're beautiful..."'

39
00:03:28,723 --> 00:03:31,242
God, come on, Veronica.

40
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:33,322
What is your damage, Heather?

41
00:03:33,404 --> 00:03:35,203
Don't blame me, blame Heather.

42
00:03:35,284 --> 00:03:38,044
She told me to haul your assinto the caf pronto.

43
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,364
Back me up, Heather.

44
00:03:39,445 --> 00:03:42,404
She really wants to talk to you, Veronica.

45
00:03:42,486 --> 00:03:45,685
OK, I'm going. Jesus Christ.

46
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:58,048
Hello, Heather.

47
00:03:58,128 --> 00:04:00,128
Veronica. Finally.

48
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,890
I got a note of Kurt Kelly's.

49
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,891
I need you to forge a hot and hornybut realistic note in Kurt's handwriting.

50
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:09,651
We'll slip it ontoMartha Dumptruck's lunch tray.

51
00:04:09,732 --> 00:04:12,731
I don't have anythingagainst Martha Dunnstock.

52
00:04:12,812 --> 00:04:14,892
You don't have anything for her.

53
00:04:14,974 --> 00:04:17,134
Come on. It'll be very.

54
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:21,534
The note will give her shower nozzlemasturbation material for weeks.

55
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:26,294
I'll think about it.

56
00:04:26,376 --> 00:04:28,335
Don't think.

57
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:36,537
Veronica needs something to write on.Bend over.

58
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:46,459
Dear Martha, you're so sweet...

59
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,219
I'm telling you, man, it'd so be righteous

60
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:52,740
to be in a Veronica Sawyer -Heather Chandler sandwich.

61
00:04:52,822 --> 00:04:54,660
Hell, yes.

62
00:04:54,742 --> 00:04:58,903
I want to put a Heather on my johnsonand spin her around like a pinwheel.

63
00:04:58,983 --> 00:05:00,462
Punch it in.

64
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,869
Westerburg feeds the world.Come on, people.

65
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:35,550
Give that leftover lunch moneyto people who don't have lunches.

66
00:05:35,632 --> 00:05:38,191
God, aren't they fed yet?

67
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:41,111
Do they even have thanksgiving in Africa?

68
00:05:41,193 --> 00:05:44,713
Oh, sure. Pilgrims, Indians, Tater Tots.

69
00:05:44,794 --> 00:05:46,714
It's a real party continent.

70
00:05:46,794 --> 00:05:49,034
Sawyer, guess what today is.

71
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,914
Ouch. Lunch-time poll?What's the question?

72
00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:54,436
Yeah, what's the question, Heather?

73
00:05:54,516 --> 00:05:58,397
God, you were with me in study hallwhen I thought of it.

74
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:00,996
I forgot.

75
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:03,637
Such a pillowcase.

76
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:09,359
It's not that bizarro thing you were babblingabout over the phone last night, is it?

77
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,078
Of course it is.

78
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,680
I told Dennis if he gives me anotherpolitical topic, I'd spew burrito chunks.

79
00:06:25,242 --> 00:06:27,001
Oh, Veronica, I'm sorry.

80
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,802
Betty Finn. Gosh.

81
00:06:28,884 --> 00:06:32,403
I'm sorry I couldn't goto your birthday party last month.

82
00:06:32,484 --> 00:06:35,404
It's OK. Your mom said you had a big date.

83
00:06:35,486 --> 00:06:38,445
I'd probably miss my ownbirthday for a date.

84
00:06:38,526 --> 00:06:40,486
Don't say that.

85
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:45,646
I was looking around the other dayand I dug up these old photographs.

86
00:06:47,008 --> 00:06:49,127
Oh. They're great.

87
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:51,248
Come on, Veronica.

88
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:53,448
I was talking to somebody.

89
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,330
Great. Here comes Heather.

90
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:04,651
Oh, shit.

91
00:07:04,732 --> 00:07:07,972
- Hi, Courtney. Love your cardigan.- Thanks.

92
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,012
I got it last night at The Limited.

93
00:07:10,093 --> 00:07:13,613
Like, totally blew my allowance.

94
00:07:13,693 --> 00:07:18,133
Check this out. You win $5 millionfrom the Publisher Sweepstakes

95
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:20,855
and the same daythe guy gives you the cheque,

96
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:26,896
aliens land on the earth and say they'll blowup the world in two days. What do you do?

97
00:07:26,977 --> 00:07:28,577
That's easy.

98
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:32,216
I'd just slide that wad over to my father

99
00:07:32,297 --> 00:07:35,257
because he's one of thestate's top brokers.

100
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:39,140
If I got that money,I'd give it all to the homeless.

101
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,859
Every cent.

102
00:07:41,941 --> 00:07:43,901
You're beautiful.

103
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,822
If you're going to openly be a bitch...

104
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,901
Why can't we talk tokinds of different people?

105
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:55,783
Fuck me gently with a chainsaw.Do I look like Mother Teresa?

106
00:07:55,864 --> 00:07:59,503
If I did, I probably wouldn't mindtalking to the geek squad.

107
00:08:02,986 --> 00:08:06,746
Did see that? Heather number onejust looked right at me.

108
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:10,746
Does it not bother you thateverybody thinks you're a piranha?

109
00:08:10,827 --> 00:08:12,786
Like I give a shit.

110
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:15,707
They all want me as a friend or a fuck.

111
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:19,068
I'm worshiped at Westerburgand I'm only a junior.

112
00:08:28,831 --> 00:08:33,592
I can't believe this, we're going to aparty at Remington University tonight

113
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:38,792
and we're brushing up on our conversationalskills with the scum of the school.

114
00:08:39,874 --> 00:08:41,033
Hi.

115
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:43,233
Hi.

116
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,434
So this is what's called a lunch-time poll.

117
00:08:47,515 --> 00:08:50,555
You win $5 millionin the Publisher Sweepstakes

118
00:08:50,636 --> 00:08:53,436
and the same day whatshisfacegives you the cheque

119
00:08:53,516 --> 00:08:55,315
aliens land on earth

120
00:08:55,397 --> 00:08:57,156
and say they'll blow up the worldin two days.

121
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,797
What are you going to do with the money?

122
00:08:59,878 --> 00:09:01,437
I'd go to Egypt.

123
00:09:01,518 --> 00:09:03,077
With a girl.

124
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,599
I'd use the money foran end-of-the-world get-together.

125
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:09,399
I'd pay Madonna a million bucksto sit on my face

126
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:11,441
and ride like the Kentucky Derby.

127
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:14,681
That's the most spooky-assed questionI ever heard.

128
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:17,561
After taxes, I'll only be getting...

129
00:09:17,643 --> 00:09:19,441
She should pay me, though.

130
00:09:19,523 --> 00:09:24,283
You go to the zoo and get a lion andput a remote control bomb up its butt...

131
00:09:24,365 --> 00:09:27,044
Then there's social security, legal fees...

132
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:31,165
Push the button on the bomband you and the lion die like one.

133
00:09:32,286 --> 00:09:34,446
What?

134
00:09:39,007 --> 00:09:42,126
Oh, my God. Here we go.

135
00:09:58,332 --> 00:10:01,252
Oh, my God.

136
00:10:22,938 --> 00:10:26,297
Hi, Veronica.Five keeps an infant alive.

137
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,699
You wanted to be a member ofthe most powerful clique in school.

138
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:36,379
If I wasn't already the head of it,I'd want the same thing.

139
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,580
Come on, Veronica.

140
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,860
You used to have a sense of humor.

141
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:47,502
Veronica, could youcome back here a minute?

142
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:49,862
A true friend's work is never done.

143
00:10:49,944 --> 00:10:52,264
- Gross.- Gross.

144
00:10:52,344 --> 00:10:55,784
Grow up, Heather. Bulimia is so '87.

145
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:59,464
- Maybe you should see a doctor.- Yeah, maybe.

146
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:03,626
Come on, Heather,let's take another look at today's lunch.

147
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,269
God, Veronica, drool much?

148
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,430
His name's Jason Dean.

149
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:25,471
He's in my American History.

150
00:11:35,874 --> 00:11:37,834
Hello, Jason Dean.

151
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:41,033
Greetings and salutations.

152
00:11:41,115 --> 00:11:43,234
Are you a Heather?

153
00:11:43,316 --> 00:11:44,395
No.

154
00:11:44,476 --> 00:11:47,836
I'm a Veronica. Sawyer.

155
00:11:49,237 --> 00:11:52,236
This may seem likea really stupid question...

156
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:54,518
There are no stupid questions.

157
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,519
You inherit $5 million.The same day aliens land on the earth

158
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:04,439
and say they're going to blow it upin two days. What do you do?

159
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:10,120
That's the stupidest questionI've ever heard.

160
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:13,681
Who's that guy in the coatthink he is anyways?

161
00:12:13,763 --> 00:12:15,442
Bo Diddley?

162
00:12:15,523 --> 00:12:17,963
Veronica's into his act, no doubt.

163
00:12:18,044 --> 00:12:21,083
I don't know. Probably row outto the middle of a lake,

164
00:12:21,165 --> 00:12:23,645
bring along a bottle of tequila,

165
00:12:23,725 --> 00:12:26,805
my sax and some Bach.

166
00:12:28,365 --> 00:12:29,884
How very.

167
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:34,326
Come on, Veronica.

168
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,087
Later.

169
00:12:37,168 --> 00:12:39,128
Definitely.

170
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,329
Let's kick his ass.

171
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:46,450
Shit, Ram, we're seniors, man.

172
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:48,970
We're too old for kindof that kind of crap.

173
00:12:50,051 --> 00:12:52,411
Let's give him a good scare, though.

174
00:12:58,373 --> 00:13:00,132
You going to eat this?

175
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:04,453
What did your boyfriend say when you toldhim you were moving to Sherwood, Ohio?

176
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:06,695
Answer him, dick.

177
00:13:06,774 --> 00:13:11,135
Hey, Ram, doesn't this cafeteriahave a "no fags allowed" rule?

178
00:13:11,215 --> 00:13:15,895
They seem to have an open-door policyfor assholes, though, don't they?

179
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:20,537
What did you say, dickhead?

180
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:23,097
I'll repeat myself.

181
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:31,700
They won't expel him, they'll justsuspend him for a week or something.

182
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,860
He used a real gun.They should throw his ass in jail.

183
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:38,501
No way. He used blanks.

184
00:13:38,582 --> 00:13:42,101
All JD really did wasruin two pairs of pants.

185
00:13:42,182 --> 00:13:44,142
Maybe not even that.

186
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,503
Can you bleach out urine stains?

187
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:51,703
You seem pretty amused. I thoughtyou had given up on high school guys.

188
00:13:51,785 --> 00:13:53,785
Never say never.

189
00:13:56,227 --> 00:13:58,307
What are you going to do, Heather?

190
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:01,666
Take the two shots or send me out?

191
00:14:03,347 --> 00:14:05,626
Did you have a brain tumor for breakfast?

192
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:08,428
First you ask if you can be red,

193
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:10,628
knowing that I'm always red.

194
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,469
Shit.

195
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:19,951
It's your turn, Heather.

196
00:14:25,473 --> 00:14:27,433
Easy shot, Heather.

197
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:29,632
No way, no day.

198
00:14:29,714 --> 00:14:32,393
Give it up, girl.

199
00:14:40,236 --> 00:14:42,596
- Holy shit.- Incredible!

200
00:14:45,798 --> 00:14:49,037
So tonight's the night.Are you two excited?

201
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:51,318
I'm giving Veronica her shot,

202
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,719
her first Remington party.

203
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:55,878
You blow it tonight, girl,

204
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,520
and it's keggers with kids all next year.

205
00:15:11,164 --> 00:15:12,483
Why?

206
00:15:12,564 --> 00:15:13,563
Why not?

207
00:15:15,204 --> 00:15:16,964
Heather, your mother's here.

208
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:19,285
Come on, whoever wants a ride.

209
00:15:21,886 --> 00:15:25,806
- Bye. Thank you.- Bye-bye, girls.

210
00:15:25,886 --> 00:15:28,726
Hey, take a break, Veronica. Sit down.

211
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:34,448
So what was the first weekof spring vacation withdrawal like?

212
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:36,488
I don't know. It was OK, I guess.

213
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,449
Hey, kid, isn't the prom coming up?

214
00:15:40,531 --> 00:15:42,170
I guess.

215
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,330
Any contestants worth mentioning?

216
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:45,970
Maybe.

217
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,330
There's kind ofa dark horse in the running.

218
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:53,812
God, will somebody tell mewhy I read these spy novels?

219
00:15:53,893 --> 00:15:56,213
Because you're an idiot.

220
00:15:56,294 --> 00:15:58,654
Oh, yeah, that's it.

221
00:15:58,734 --> 00:16:01,054
You two...

222
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:05,974
Great pâté, but I gotta motor if I wantto be ready for that party tonight.

223
00:16:09,337 --> 00:16:11,016
Corn nuts!

224
00:16:11,097 --> 00:16:12,416
BQ or plain?

225
00:16:12,498 --> 00:16:14,257
BQ!

226
00:16:17,859 --> 00:16:21,058
You're going to pull asuper-chug with that?

227
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:26,340
No, but if you're nice,I'll let you buy me a slushie.

228
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,341
I see you knowyour convenience-speak pretty well.

229
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:34,421
Yeah, well, I've beenmoved around all my life.

230
00:16:34,502 --> 00:16:38,342
Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas...

231
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:40,543
Sherwood, Ohio.

232
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,504
There's always beena Snappy Snack Shack.

233
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:49,064
Any town, any time, pop a ham and cheesein the microwave and feast on a turbo-dog.

234
00:16:50,106 --> 00:16:51,944
Keeps me sane.

235
00:16:53,026 --> 00:16:54,705
Really?

236
00:16:56,587 --> 00:17:00,908
That thing you pulled in the caff todaywas pretty severe.

237
00:17:00,988 --> 00:17:05,189
Yeah, well, the extremealways seems to make an impression.

238
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,230
Did you say a cherry or Coke slushie?

239
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,630
I didn't. Cherry.

240
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,192
Great bike.

241
00:17:23,274 --> 00:17:27,954
Yeah. Just a humble perkfrom my dad's construction company.

242
00:17:28,034 --> 00:17:29,793
Seen the commercial, right?

243
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:32,915
"Bringing every state to a higher state."

244
00:17:32,996 --> 00:17:34,956
Wait a minute. Jason Dean.

245
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:37,595
Your pop's Big Bud Dean Construction?

246
00:17:37,676 --> 00:17:40,795
It must be rough moving place to place.

247
00:17:40,878 --> 00:17:44,758
Everybody's life has got static.Is your life perfect?

248
00:17:44,838 --> 00:17:47,837
Yeah. I'm going toa Remington University party.

249
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,320
No, my life's not perfect.

250
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,440
I don't really like my friends.

251
00:17:56,522 --> 00:18:00,322
Yeah, I don't really likeyour friends, either.

252
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:05,722
Well, it's just likethey're people I work with

253
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:08,883
and our job is being popular and shit.

254
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:12,884
Maybe it's time to take a vacation.

255
00:18:22,486 --> 00:18:26,086
Hello, ladies.Throw your coats on the floor.

256
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,087
Veronica, this is Brad.

257
00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:29,568
Excellent.

258
00:18:29,648 --> 00:18:32,848
Did you girls bringyour partying slippers?

259
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:35,849
- Let's party.- She loves to party.

260
00:18:41,691 --> 00:18:44,331
'Dear diary, I want to kill,

261
00:18:44,411 --> 00:18:47,611
'and it's for more thanjust selfish reasons.

262
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,452
'More than a spoke in my menstrual cycle.

263
00:18:50,534 --> 00:18:52,372
'You have to believe me.'

264
00:18:52,454 --> 00:18:56,814
It's so great to talk to a girland not have to ask "what's your major?"

265
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,855
I hate that.

266
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,376
So, when you go to college,

267
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:10,137
what subjects do you think you'll study?

268
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:16,018
Come on, David.Shouldn't we get back to the party?

269
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:17,739
We will.

270
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,700
It's just you're so hot tonight.

271
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,740
I can't control myself.

272
00:19:33,383 --> 00:19:36,663
'I can't explain it butI'm allowed an understanding

273
00:19:36,744 --> 00:19:41,344
'that my parents and theseRemington assholes have chosen to ignore.

274
00:19:41,425 --> 00:19:43,905
'I understand that I must stop Heather.'

275
00:20:18,554 --> 00:20:20,834
How's my little cheerleader?

276
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:27,674
Oh, I know everyoneat your high school isn't so uptight.

277
00:20:27,756 --> 00:20:30,716
- Come on.- I don't feel so good, OK?

278
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,716
Let's do it on the coats.It'll be excellent?

279
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:36,197
I have a prepared speech I tell my suitor

280
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,996
when he wants morethan I'd like to give him.

281
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,959
Gee, blank, I had a really nice...

282
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,519
Save the speeches for Malcolm X.

283
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,840
I just want to get laid.

284
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:52,081
You don't deserve my fucking speech.

285
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:56,161
'Betty Finn was a true friendand I sold her out

286
00:20:56,243 --> 00:20:59,082
'for a bunch of Swatchdogsand Diet Cokeheads.

287
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:02,842
'Killing Heather would be like offingthe Wicked Witch of the West.

288
00:21:02,924 --> 00:21:06,123
'Wait, East. West!I sound like a fucking psycho.'

289
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:20,806
What's your damage?Brad says you're being a cooze.

290
00:21:20,888 --> 00:21:24,769
I feel really sick, like I'm gonna throw up.Can we please jam now?

291
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:26,607
No. Hell, no.

292
00:21:37,731 --> 00:21:41,171
'Tomorrow I'll be kissingher aerobicised ass

293
00:21:41,252 --> 00:21:44,892
'but tonight let me dream ofa world without Heather,

294
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:47,093
'a world where I am free.'

295
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:56,095
You stupid fuck.

296
00:21:56,176 --> 00:21:58,575
You goddamn bitch.

297
00:21:58,657 --> 00:22:03,297
You were nothing before you met me.You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn.

298
00:22:03,377 --> 00:22:06,857
You were a Bluebird, you were a Brownie,

299
00:22:06,938 --> 00:22:09,578
you were a Girl Scout Cookie.

300
00:22:09,658 --> 00:22:12,298
I got you into a Remington party.

301
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,099
What's my thanks?It's on the hallway carpet.

302
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:17,980
I got paid in puke.

303
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:21,381
Lick it up, baby. Lick it up.

304
00:22:22,982 --> 00:22:25,062
Monday morning you're history.

305
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:27,382
I'll tell everyone about tonight.

306
00:22:27,463 --> 00:22:30,742
Transfer to Washington,transfer to Jefferson,

307
00:22:30,824 --> 00:22:35,344
no one at Westerburg's gonna let youplay their reindeer games.

308
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:46,986
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.

309
00:22:47,988 --> 00:22:49,587
That's OK.

310
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:55,909
I saw the croquet set up in the back.You up for a match?

311
00:23:05,832 --> 00:23:08,152
I thank you.

312
00:23:08,232 --> 00:23:12,593
That was my first game of strip croquet.

313
00:23:12,673 --> 00:23:14,673
You're welcome.

314
00:23:14,754 --> 00:23:18,473
It's a lot more interestingthan just flinging off your clothes

315
00:23:18,554 --> 00:23:21,114
and boning awayon a neighbor's swing set.

316
00:23:21,196 --> 00:23:23,676
There's lots to be said for throwing off...

317
00:23:27,876 --> 00:23:29,916
What a night.

318
00:23:29,998 --> 00:23:31,836
What a life.

319
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:35,437
They wanted to move meinto high school out of the sixth grade

320
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,359
because I was supposed to bethis big genius.

321
00:23:38,439 --> 00:23:40,439
Then we decided to chuck the idea

322
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:44,319
because I'd have troublemaking friends, blah, blah, blah.

323
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:46,441
Now blah, blah, blah is all I do.

324
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,519
I use my grand IQto decide what color gloss to wear

325
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:52,482
and how to hit three keggers before curfew.

326
00:24:01,725 --> 00:24:05,605
Heather Chandler is one bitchthat deserves to die.

327
00:24:05,686 --> 00:24:07,965
Killing her won't solve anything.

328
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:12,766
I say we just grow up, be adults and die.

329
00:24:15,568 --> 00:24:17,488
But before that...

330
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:20,928
I'd love to see Heather Chandlerpuke her guts out.

331
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:29,530
Trust me, she skipsthe Saturday morning trip to grandma's

332
00:24:29,611 --> 00:24:31,571
even when she's not hung over.

333
00:24:32,891 --> 00:24:36,331
We'll just concoct ourselvesa little hangover cure

334
00:24:36,413 --> 00:24:40,052
that'll induce her to spewred, white and blue, then.

335
00:24:41,694 --> 00:24:45,895
What about milk and orange juice?What's the up-chuck factor on that?

336
00:24:45,974 --> 00:24:49,373
I'm a no-rust-build-up man, myself.

337
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:51,415
Don't be a dick.

338
00:24:51,496 --> 00:24:53,376
That stuff will kill her.

339
00:25:01,017 --> 00:25:04,296
I know, we can cook up some soupand put it in a Coke.

340
00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:07,138
That's pretty sick, eh?

341
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:10,540
Should it be chicken noodleor bean with bacon?

342
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:15,139
Put a lid on that stuff.I say we go with big blue here.

343
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,941
What are you talking about?

344
00:25:17,022 --> 00:25:21,942
She would never drink anythingthat looked like that, anyway.

345
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:25,223
So we'll... put it in this.

346
00:25:25,303 --> 00:25:27,943
She won't be able to seewhat she's drinking.

347
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:29,984
Let me get a cup, jerk.

348
00:25:34,026 --> 00:25:35,906
OK.

349
00:25:36,987 --> 00:25:39,867
Milk and orange juice.

350
00:25:39,947 --> 00:25:44,387
Maybe we could, like, cough upa phlegm globber in it or something.

351
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,389
- No?- Nothing.

352
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:01,432
Oh, well. Milk and orange juicewill do quite nicely.

353
00:26:01,512 --> 00:26:03,673
You're chicken.

354
00:26:03,752 --> 00:26:05,712
You're not funny.

355
00:26:13,074 --> 00:26:14,833
I'm sorry.

356
00:26:30,318 --> 00:26:32,958
- Veronica?- What?

357
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,120
Never mind. I'll, er, carry the cup.

358
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:43,640
Morning, Heather.

359
00:26:45,441 --> 00:26:49,322
Veronica... and Jesse James.

360
00:26:49,403 --> 00:26:51,763
Quelle surprise.

361
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:55,043
Hear about Veronica'saffection for regurgitation?

362
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:58,324
Last night we bothsaid things we didn't mean.

363
00:26:58,405 --> 00:27:00,124
Did we?

364
00:27:00,205 --> 00:27:02,043
How did you get in?

365
00:27:02,126 --> 00:27:06,086
Veronica knewyou'd have a hangover

366
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,647
so I whipped this up for you.

367
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,487
It's a family recipe.

368
00:27:10,568 --> 00:27:12,808
What, you put a phlegm globber in it?

369
00:27:12,888 --> 00:27:15,848
I'm not going to drink that piss.

370
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:18,488
I knew this stuff'd be too intense for her.

371
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,530
Intense.

372
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,329
Grow up.

373
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,611
You think I'll drink itjust because you call me chicken?

374
00:27:31,812 --> 00:27:33,732
Just give me the cup, jerk.

375
00:27:52,577 --> 00:27:54,617
Corn nuts.

376
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:12,501
Oh, my God.

377
00:28:12,582 --> 00:28:15,022
I can't believe it.

378
00:28:15,103 --> 00:28:17,062
I just killed my best friend.

379
00:28:17,144 --> 00:28:19,024
And your worst enemy.

380
00:28:19,104 --> 00:28:21,063
Same difference.

381
00:28:29,746 --> 00:28:31,946
What are we going to tell the cops?

382
00:28:34,507 --> 00:28:37,067
"Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."

383
00:28:37,147 --> 00:28:39,627
Cops.

384
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:42,707
I can't believe this is my life.

385
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:45,389
Oh, my God.

386
00:28:45,469 --> 00:28:47,989
I'm going to have to sendmy SAT scores

387
00:28:48,069 --> 00:28:50,469
to San Quentin instead of Stanford.

388
00:28:53,151 --> 00:28:55,791
All right, just a little freaked, here.

389
00:28:57,192 --> 00:28:59,911
At least you got what you wanted.

390
00:28:59,993 --> 00:29:01,874
Got what I wanted?

391
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:04,873
It's one thing to wantsomebody out of your life,

392
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:09,233
it's another thing to serve thema wake-up cup full of liquid drainer.

393
00:29:33,281 --> 00:29:37,000
All right, we did a murderand that's a crime,

394
00:29:37,082 --> 00:29:42,883
but if this were likea suicide thing, you know?

395
00:29:45,603 --> 00:29:47,322
Like a suicide thing?

396
00:29:47,404 --> 00:29:49,683
Yeah, yeah.

397
00:29:50,764 --> 00:29:54,685
You can do Heather's handwritingas well as your own, right?

398
00:29:55,766 --> 00:29:57,445
Right?

399
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:06,208
- Yeah.- All right.

400
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:11,008
You might think what I've done is shocking?

401
00:30:11,089 --> 00:30:12,289
Yeah.

402
00:30:18,091 --> 00:30:21,171
To me, though,suicide is the natural answer

403
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:24,810
to the myriad of problemslife has given me.

404
00:30:24,892 --> 00:30:28,131
That's good but Heatherwould never use the word myriad.

405
00:30:28,213 --> 00:30:30,534
This is the last thing she'll ever write,

406
00:30:30,613 --> 00:30:33,533
she'll want to useas many 50-cent words as possible.

407
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:36,574
She missed myriadon the vocab test two weeks ago.

408
00:30:36,656 --> 00:30:38,696
That only proves my point more.

409
00:30:38,775 --> 00:30:41,855
The word is a badgefor her failures at school.

410
00:30:41,935 --> 00:30:44,975
Oh. OK, you're probably right.

411
00:30:47,577 --> 00:30:53,738
People think just becauseyou're beautiful and popular,

412
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:57,218
life is easy and fun.

413
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,540
Yeah.

414
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:05,382
No one understood I had feelings too.

415
00:31:08,302 --> 00:31:11,301
I die knowing no one knew the real me.

416
00:31:14,024 --> 00:31:16,184
That's good.

417
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:18,224
Have you done this before?

418
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:24,505
Any other principalwould take the same position...

419
00:31:24,586 --> 00:31:26,626
keep things business as usual.

420
00:31:26,706 --> 00:31:29,265
Heather Chandler'snot your everyday suicide.

421
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:32,866
- She was very popular.- If I let these kids out before lunch,

422
00:31:32,948 --> 00:31:35,987
the switchboard would light uplike a Christmas tree.

423
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:41,748
I was impressed that she made proper useof the word myriad in her suicide note.

424
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:45,069
I find it profoundly disturbing

425
00:31:45,151 --> 00:31:48,510
that we're told ofthe tragic destruction of youth

426
00:31:48,592 --> 00:31:51,472
and all we can think to talk about

427
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:54,951
is adequate mourning timesand misused vocabulary words.

428
00:31:55,034 --> 00:31:56,833
Oh, Christ!

429
00:31:56,914 --> 00:32:00,074
We must revel in this revealing moment.

430
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:03,872
Look, I suggest thatwe get everybody together,

431
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:06,954
both students and teachers,in the cafeteria

432
00:32:07,035 --> 00:32:10,995
and just talk and feel...

433
00:32:11,077 --> 00:32:12,755
together.

434
00:32:12,837 --> 00:32:16,157
Thank you, Ms Fleming.You call me when the shuttle lands.

435
00:32:16,238 --> 00:32:18,718
Now, is this Heather the cheerleader?

436
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:21,438
That would be Heather McNamara.

437
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,519
Damn. I'd be willing to go half a dayfor a cheerleader.

438
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,920
God, it's unfair. It's just so unfair.

439
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:33,080
We should get off a whole week,not just an hour.

440
00:32:33,162 --> 00:32:34,881
Write the school board.

441
00:32:34,962 --> 00:32:37,681
Watch it, you might be digesting food.

442
00:32:37,763 --> 00:32:40,643
- Yeah, where is your urge to purge?- Fuck it.

443
00:32:40,724 --> 00:32:42,483
Look...

444
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:48,203
Heather left behind one of her Swatches.

445
00:32:49,285 --> 00:32:51,845
She'd want you to have it, Veronica.

446
00:32:51,926 --> 00:32:56,646
She always saidyou couldn't accessorize for shit.

447
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:58,807
Sorry to hear about your friend.

448
00:32:58,887 --> 00:33:01,606
I thought she was your usual airhead bitch.

449
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:03,608
Guess I was wrong.

450
00:33:03,688 --> 00:33:05,648
We all were.

451
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,889
What a waste.

452
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:13,009
Oh, the humanity.

453
00:33:20,212 --> 00:33:21,811
Veronica?

454
00:33:29,895 --> 00:33:32,614
Veronica, what are you doing?

455
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:50,058
I'm just so thrilled...to finally have an example

456
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:54,059
of the profound sensitivity ofwhich a human animal is capable.

457
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,740
That example is Heather Chandler.

458
00:33:57,822 --> 00:33:59,500
I have her note.

459
00:34:01,822 --> 00:34:04,622
I'm gonna pass this note around the class

460
00:34:04,702 --> 00:34:08,102
so you can all feelits pathetic beauty for yourself.

461
00:34:09,064 --> 00:34:11,183
And while we do this,

462
00:34:11,265 --> 00:34:14,705
I think it's a good opportunity to share...

463
00:34:14,785 --> 00:34:18,625
the feelings that this suicidehas spurred in all of us.

464
00:34:18,706 --> 00:34:21,426
Now, who would like to begin?

465
00:34:21,506 --> 00:34:23,466
I heard it was really gnarly.

466
00:34:23,546 --> 00:34:27,307
She sucked down a bowl ofmulti-purpose deodorizing disinfectant

467
00:34:27,387 --> 00:34:29,026
and then smash!

468
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:33,787
Tracy, let's not rehash the coroner'sreport, let's talk emotions.

469
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:37,309
Heather and I used to go out

470
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:39,470
but she said I was boring.

471
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:42,430
But now I realize I really wasn't boring...

472
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:45,231
it's just that she wasdissatisfied with her life.

473
00:34:47,992 --> 00:34:50,192
That's... very good, Peter.

474
00:34:57,194 --> 00:35:00,593
Are we going to be tested on this?

475
00:35:00,675 --> 00:35:02,635
'We were the same size

476
00:35:02,716 --> 00:35:06,756
'so we could borrow each other'sclothes, mix it up. It was fun.'

477
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:11,198
"I remember I won hera rhino at the 4-H Club... '"

478
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:13,678
You're an asshole. Mute him.

479
00:35:14,678 --> 00:35:19,319
- 'We liked the same clothes... '- How many networks did you run to?

480
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:21,639
'It won't be the same without her.'

481
00:35:21,721 --> 00:35:24,921
What are you talking about?You hated her. She hated you.

482
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,320
'Every English classI looked forward to seeing her... '

483
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:31,641
Heather Chandleris more popular than ever now.

484
00:35:33,003 --> 00:35:35,802
- Scary stuff.- Yeah.

485
00:35:37,644 --> 00:35:40,004
Hey, son, I didn't hear you come in.

486
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:43,724
Hey, Dad, how was work today?

487
00:35:47,847 --> 00:35:51,927
It was miserable.Some damn tribe of withered old bitches

488
00:35:52,007 --> 00:35:55,207
doesn't want us to terminatethat fleabag hotel.

489
00:35:55,288 --> 00:35:59,688
All because Glen Miller and his bandonce took a shit there.

490
00:35:59,769 --> 00:36:02,968
Just like Kansas.You remember fucking Kansas?

491
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,490
That was the one with the wheat, right?

492
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:09,371
Yeah. Save the Memorial Oak Tree Society.

493
00:36:09,451 --> 00:36:11,851
Showed those fucks.

494
00:36:11,932 --> 00:36:15,973
30 of those 4th of July fireworksattached to the trunk.

495
00:36:16,053 --> 00:36:18,013
Arraigned but acquitted.

496
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:22,694
Gosh, Pop,I almost forgot to introduce my girlfriend.

497
00:36:22,774 --> 00:36:24,694
Oh. Veronica, this is my dad.

498
00:36:24,775 --> 00:36:26,734
Dad, Veronica.

499
00:36:26,816 --> 00:36:27,975
Hi.

500
00:36:29,656 --> 00:36:33,656
Son, why don't you askyour little friend to stay for dinner?

501
00:36:33,736 --> 00:36:37,336
I can't. My mom's makingmy favorite meal tonight...

502
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:39,777
spaghetti, lots of oregano.

503
00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:41,498
How nice.

504
00:36:41,578 --> 00:36:43,498
The last time I saw my mom

505
00:36:43,579 --> 00:36:47,660
she was waving froma library window in Texas. Right, Dad?

506
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:51,140
Right...

507
00:36:51,221 --> 00:36:52,580
son.

508
00:36:55,142 --> 00:36:57,102
Right.

509
00:36:59,023 --> 00:37:01,582
Take a break, Veronica. Sit down.

510
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:08,103
So what was the first dayafter Heather's suicide like?

511
00:37:08,185 --> 00:37:10,225
Well, it was OK, I guess.

512
00:37:11,305 --> 00:37:13,225
Terrible thing.

513
00:37:13,306 --> 00:37:17,226
So, will we get to meetthis dark horse prom contender?

514
00:37:17,307 --> 00:37:19,787
Maybe.

515
00:37:19,867 --> 00:37:23,506
God, will somebody tell mewhy I smoke these things?

516
00:37:23,588 --> 00:37:25,827
Because you're an idiot.

517
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:28,829
Oh, yeah. That's it.

518
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:30,989
You two...

519
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:35,070
Great pâté but I have to motorif want to be ready for that funeral.

520
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,391
I blame not Heather

521
00:37:42,472 --> 00:37:45,871
but rather a society

522
00:37:45,953 --> 00:37:48,113
that tells its youth

523
00:37:48,193 --> 00:37:53,273
that the answers can be foundin the MTV video games.

524
00:37:54,395 --> 00:37:58,915
We must pray that the otherteenagers of Sherwood, Ohio,

525
00:37:58,996 --> 00:38:02,515
know the name of that righteous dude

526
00:38:02,597 --> 00:38:05,557
who can solve their problems.

527
00:38:05,638 --> 00:38:09,719
It's Jesus Christ and he's in the book.

528
00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:13,199
Amen.

529
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,200
'O God, this is a tragic thing

530
00:38:20,281 --> 00:38:23,560
'and sometimesI have a hard time dealing with it.

531
00:38:23,642 --> 00:38:25,842
'Please send Heather to heaven.'

532
00:38:25,921 --> 00:38:28,681
'Dear God, please make surethis never happens to me,

533
00:38:28,763 --> 00:38:30,722
'I don't think I can handle suicide.

534
00:38:30,804 --> 00:38:35,564
'Early acceptance into an Ivy League schooland please let it be Harvard. Amen.'

535
00:38:35,645 --> 00:38:40,525
'Jesus God in heaven,why did you kill such hot snatch?

536
00:38:40,605 --> 00:38:44,445
'It's a joke, man.Jeez, people are so serious.

537
00:38:44,526 --> 00:38:46,525
'Hail Mary, who aren't in heaven,

538
00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:49,567
'pray for all us sinnersso we don't get caught.

539
00:38:49,648 --> 00:38:51,607
'Another joke, man.'

540
00:38:51,688 --> 00:38:55,448
'I prayed for the death ofHeather Chandler many times.

541
00:38:55,529 --> 00:38:59,048
'I felt bad every time I did itbut I kept doing it.

542
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:01,769
'Now I know you understood everything.

543
00:39:01,851 --> 00:39:04,650
'Praise Jesus. Hallelujah.'

544
00:39:05,932 --> 00:39:07,892
'Hi. I'm sorry.

545
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:13,733
'Technically, I did not kill Heather Chandler,but, hey, who am I trying to kid, right?

546
00:39:13,813 --> 00:39:17,253
'I just want my high schoolto be a nice place.

547
00:39:17,334 --> 00:39:19,012
'Amen.

548
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:21,055
'Did that sound bitchy? '

549
00:39:25,736 --> 00:39:29,016
Veronica, what are you doing tonight?

550
00:39:30,258 --> 00:39:34,498
I don't know. Mourning.Maybe watch some TV. Why?

551
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:39,258
Well, Ram asked me out tonight...

552
00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:42,459
but he wants to double with Kurt...

553
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,980
and Kurt doesn't have a date.

554
00:39:45,061 --> 00:39:47,620
Heather, I have something going with JD.

555
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,020
Please, Veronica.Put Billy the Kid on hold tonight.

556
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:53,181
I'll be your best friend.

557
00:39:56,423 --> 00:39:59,142
So we on tonight, man, or what?

558
00:39:59,224 --> 00:40:01,184
I don't know.

559
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:03,624
I still got to talk to Heather, dude.

560
00:40:03,705 --> 00:40:05,625
Weird funeral?

561
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:09,346
That pudwapper just stepped on my foot.

562
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:12,385
- Let's kick his ass.- Cool off.

563
00:40:12,467 --> 00:40:14,947
- We're seniors.- Goddamn geek!

564
00:40:16,108 --> 00:40:19,869
Well. Sit and spin.

565
00:40:19,948 --> 00:40:22,348
That little prick.

566
00:40:34,111 --> 00:40:36,511
You piece of shit fag.You like to suck big dicks?

567
00:40:36,593 --> 00:40:39,673
- Cut it out.- Say, "I like to suck big dicks."

568
00:40:39,753 --> 00:40:42,752
Leave him alone, Ram.

569
00:40:45,474 --> 00:40:47,033
Say it.

570
00:40:49,796 --> 00:40:51,235
Say it!

571
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:52,955
OK, OK.

572
00:40:54,276 --> 00:40:56,236
You like to suck big dicks.

573
00:41:01,398 --> 00:41:03,358
I like to suck big dicks.

574
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,319
I can't get enough of 'em.Are you satisfied?

575
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,280
Don't worry. Ram's been so sweet lately,

576
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,360
consoling me and stuff.

577
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:17,521
It'll be really very. Promise.

578
00:41:17,602 --> 00:41:20,802
OK. Just as long asit won't be one of those nights

579
00:41:20,882 --> 00:41:25,002
where they get shitfacedand take us to a pasture to tip cows.

580
00:41:30,765 --> 00:41:33,604
- Is it sleeping, dude?- I think so, man.

581
00:41:37,246 --> 00:41:38,805
Come here.

582
00:41:38,887 --> 00:41:43,927
Oh, shit. Cow tipping is thefucking greatest! Punch it in.

583
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:49,168
Shit. On the count of three, guy.

584
00:41:50,689 --> 00:41:52,328
One...

585
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,248
two... three!

586
00:42:04,013 --> 00:42:08,253
When I get that feeling,I need sexual healing.

587
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:10,413
Yeah, right, asshole.

588
00:42:16,855 --> 00:42:18,815
What is this shit?

589
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:28,058
Doing a favor for Heather. Double date.

590
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:31,256
I tried to tell you at the funeralbut you rode off.

591
00:42:31,339 --> 00:42:33,298
Another fucking Heather.

592
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:40,220
I'm sorry. I'm feeling alittle superior tonight.

593
00:42:41,421 --> 00:42:43,381
Seven schools in seven states

594
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:46,860
and the only thing differentis my locker combination.

595
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:54,503
Our love is god. Let's go get a slushie.

596
00:43:05,226 --> 00:43:10,026
I'm not belittling the foodless fund,Peter, but we're talking teen suicide here.

597
00:43:10,107 --> 00:43:15,067
The number one song in America todayis Teenage Suicide Don't Do It by Big Fun.

598
00:43:15,149 --> 00:43:20,069
Westerburg finally got one of these thingsand I'm not gonna blow it.

599
00:43:20,149 --> 00:43:24,909
So Heather gets the front page andI get crammed in by the Taco Bell coupon.

600
00:43:24,991 --> 00:43:29,351
Hi, guys, I came to check upon this week's lunch-time poll topic.

601
00:43:29,431 --> 00:43:32,871
Don't worry about it, Veronica.Sit down?

602
00:43:32,953 --> 00:43:37,433
That funeral yesterdaymust have really been rough?

603
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:38,913
Oh, yeah.

604
00:43:38,994 --> 00:43:43,875
We were wondering if you had any poems,artwork that Heather did

605
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:47,595
that we can put inthe Heather Chandler yearbook spread?

606
00:43:47,676 --> 00:43:49,475
The what?

607
00:43:49,557 --> 00:43:55,277
Look, it's a two-page layout with hersuicide note right up here in the corner.

608
00:43:57,078 --> 00:43:59,717
It's more tasteful than it sounds.

609
00:43:59,799 --> 00:44:03,680
I don't know, Dennis,this stuff leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

610
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,759
Like last night, Veronica?

611
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,441
Excuse me? I don't get it.

612
00:44:12,522 --> 00:44:14,321
You did last night.

613
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,322
Kurt told us of your little date.

614
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:20,163
Yeah, and? I left him drunkand flailing in cow shit.

615
00:44:20,244 --> 00:44:23,404
Well, I don't know. He was really detailed.

616
00:44:23,484 --> 00:44:25,724
Shut up, Courtney.

617
00:44:25,805 --> 00:44:28,765
No, don't shut up.I'd like to know exactly what I did.

618
00:44:29,846 --> 00:44:33,806
Come on, Veronica.I'll show you the lunch-time poll topic.

619
00:44:35,927 --> 00:44:37,926
What the fuck?

620
00:44:38,007 --> 00:44:41,047
I rarely listen toNeanderthals like Kurt Kelly

621
00:44:41,129 --> 00:44:43,009
but he said that he and Ram

622
00:44:43,088 --> 00:44:47,208
had a nice little sword fightin your mouth last night.

623
00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:51,370
Ew! That son of a bitch.

624
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:54,889
Hi, Kurt?

625
00:44:54,971 --> 00:44:57,610
Hi, this is Veronica Sawyer.

626
00:44:57,692 --> 00:45:02,971
I didn't expect to be calling, either.I guess my emotions took over.

627
00:45:03,054 --> 00:45:07,734
I was wondering if you wanted those thingsyou've been saying to really happen.

628
00:45:07,814 --> 00:45:11,774
It's always been a fantasy of mineto have two guys at once.

629
00:45:11,855 --> 00:45:14,574
Oh, sure, you can write to Penthouse forum.

630
00:45:16,497 --> 00:45:18,896
Yeah, in the woods behind the school.

631
00:45:18,977 --> 00:45:20,776
At dawn.

632
00:45:20,857 --> 00:45:22,817
Don't forget Ram.

633
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:36,259
Why am I writing a suicide note when we'rejust going to be shooting them with blanks?

634
00:45:36,341 --> 00:45:39,381
We're not gonna be using blanks this time.

635
00:45:40,502 --> 00:45:42,542
You can't be serious.

636
00:45:42,622 --> 00:45:44,421
I am.

637
00:45:44,503 --> 00:45:47,422
Listen, my Bonnie and Clyde days are over.

638
00:45:47,504 --> 00:45:50,583
Wait a second, wait a second.Do you take German?

639
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,263
French.

640
00:45:52,345 --> 00:45:54,864
All right. These are echt Luger bullets.

641
00:45:54,946 --> 00:45:58,225
My grandfather snareda shitload of them back in WWII.

642
00:45:58,306 --> 00:46:00,706
They're like tranquillizers,

643
00:46:00,787 --> 00:46:06,027
only they break the skin's surface enoughto cause blood but no real damage.

644
00:46:06,107 --> 00:46:09,386
So it looks likethe person's been shot and killed

645
00:46:09,468 --> 00:46:12,787
and really they're justunconscious and bleeding?

646
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:14,468
Oh.

647
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:16,349
Right.

648
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:20,510
See, we shoot Kurt and Ram,make it look like they shot each other

649
00:46:20,591 --> 00:46:25,550
and by the time they regain consciousness,they'll be the laughing stock of the school.

650
00:46:25,632 --> 00:46:28,751
The note's the punch line.How'd that turn out?

651
00:46:28,834 --> 00:46:31,953
First tell me the similarityis not incredible.

652
00:46:33,354 --> 00:46:35,113
It's incredible similarity.

653
00:46:37,315 --> 00:46:39,355
OK.

654
00:46:41,036 --> 00:46:43,115
"Ram and I died the day we realized"

655
00:46:43,196 --> 00:46:47,676
"we could never reveal our forbidden loveto an uncaring and un-understanding world."

656
00:46:47,758 --> 00:46:51,878
"The joy we shared in each other's armswas greater than any touchdown,"

657
00:46:51,958 --> 00:46:54,118
"yet we were forced to live the lie"

658
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:57,598
"of sexist, beer-guzzling, jock assholes."

659
00:46:57,679 --> 00:46:59,919
That's perfect.

660
00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:03,479
Let's take a look at someof the homosexual artifacts

661
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,520
I dug up to plant at the scene.

662
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:09,920
All right. An issue of Stud Puppy.

663
00:47:10,002 --> 00:47:12,522
That's great!

664
00:47:12,603 --> 00:47:16,882
A candy dish, a Joan Crawford postcard.

665
00:47:16,965 --> 00:47:18,885
Good.

666
00:47:18,965 --> 00:47:20,925
Some mascara.

667
00:47:22,084 --> 00:47:26,685
All right, now, here's the oneperfecto thing I picked up...

668
00:47:26,766 --> 00:47:27,926
mineral water.

669
00:47:28,006 --> 00:47:32,846
Come on, a lot of peopledrink mineral water. It's come a long way.

670
00:47:32,927 --> 00:47:34,646
Yeah, but this is Ohio.

671
00:47:34,728 --> 00:47:38,328
If you don't have a brewski in your hand,you might as well be wearing a dress.

672
00:47:38,408 --> 00:47:40,608
Oh, you're so smart.

673
00:47:51,252 --> 00:47:53,332
Hi, Veronica.

674
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,332
Hi, guys.

675
00:47:57,453 --> 00:47:59,493
Glad you could make it.

676
00:48:07,775 --> 00:48:09,895
So should I just whip it out or...

677
00:48:09,976 --> 00:48:14,017
Well, I've made a circleon each side of the clearing.

678
00:48:14,097 --> 00:48:16,537
Ram, you come over here.

679
00:48:16,618 --> 00:48:18,057
Kurt.

680
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:23,177
When you get to the circle, strip.

681
00:48:23,259 --> 00:48:25,218
What about you?

682
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:28,659
I was hoping you couldrip my clothes off me, sport.

683
00:48:30,181 --> 00:48:31,540
Oh.

684
00:48:31,622 --> 00:48:33,261
Good idea.

685
00:48:41,303 --> 00:48:44,463
OK. Count of three, guys.

686
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:48,024
One...

687
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:52,385
two...

688
00:48:53,947 --> 00:48:56,707
Three!

689
00:48:59,187 --> 00:49:01,146
You missed him completely?

690
00:49:01,228 --> 00:49:03,227
It was worth it just to see the look...

691
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:06,189
Don't move. I'll get him back.

692
00:49:42,398 --> 00:49:44,157
Ha!

693
00:50:12,124 --> 00:50:14,123
- No.- Now!

694
00:50:25,208 --> 00:50:27,767
- Hey, I heard it that time.- What?

695
00:50:27,847 --> 00:50:29,927
Another gunshot from the woods.

696
00:50:30,008 --> 00:50:31,967
Oh, shit. Let's roll!

697
00:50:32,049 --> 00:50:33,929
Kurt doesn't look too good.

698
00:50:34,008 --> 00:50:36,128
Just remember he's left-handed.

699
00:50:36,209 --> 00:50:39,489
Keep going until you hit the clearing.

700
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,689
Come on.

701
00:50:45,772 --> 00:50:48,132
- Mother of shit!- Call in.

702
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:52,532
Hey, I heard something out there.

703
00:50:52,613 --> 00:50:54,573
I'm checking it out.

704
00:50:54,653 --> 00:50:58,292
This is Officer McCord.I've got two dead bodies in the woods

705
00:50:58,374 --> 00:51:00,133
behind Westerburg High.

706
00:51:46,345 --> 00:51:50,226
'Milner, can you hear me?What's going down? '

707
00:51:50,306 --> 00:51:54,025
Yeah... I think what I heardwas just a bunny rabbit.

708
00:51:54,107 --> 00:51:57,786
All I've got here is two kidsmaking out in a station wagon.

709
00:51:57,868 --> 00:51:59,749
'Should I pry them apart? '

710
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:02,988
No. Forget it.I got all the answers back here.

711
00:52:03,069 --> 00:52:04,708
Hey...

712
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,349
are they naked?

713
00:52:18,673 --> 00:52:21,312
Yeah, so what's the deal?

714
00:52:21,394 --> 00:52:24,913
Suicide. Double suicide.They shot each other.

715
00:52:24,995 --> 00:52:27,035
Hey, that's Kurt Kelly.

716
00:52:27,115 --> 00:52:29,515
Yeah, and the linebacker, Ram Sweeney.

717
00:52:31,436 --> 00:52:35,075
My God, suicide. Why?

718
00:52:36,357 --> 00:52:39,356
Does this answer your question?

719
00:52:39,438 --> 00:52:41,758
Oh, man. They were fags.

720
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:46,479
Listen up. "We realized we could neverreveal our forbidden love"

721
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,879
"to an uncaringand un-understanding world."

722
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:52,639
Jesus H Christ!

723
00:52:52,721 --> 00:52:55,561
The quarterback buggering the linebacker.

724
00:52:56,642 --> 00:52:58,562
What a waste.

725
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:00,602
Oh, the humanity.

726
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:36,930
So we killed them, didn't we?

727
00:53:37,012 --> 00:53:39,131
Yeah. Of course.

728
00:54:04,217 --> 00:54:07,697
Echt Luger bullets. I'm such an idiot.

729
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:14,458
Look, you believed itbecause you wanted to believe it.

730
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:19,300
Your true feelingswere too gross and icky for you to face.

731
00:54:20,581 --> 00:54:23,420
I did not want them dead.

732
00:54:24,982 --> 00:54:28,022
- You did too.- I did not.

733
00:54:28,102 --> 00:54:29,341
Did too.

734
00:54:29,424 --> 00:54:30,743
- I did not.- Did too.

735
00:54:30,822 --> 00:54:32,661
- Did not.- Did too.

736
00:54:32,743 --> 00:54:34,943
- Did not! Did not!- Did too!

737
00:54:35,025 --> 00:54:37,105
Shut up! I did not want them dead.

738
00:54:37,185 --> 00:54:40,505
- Come on, you did. You're just...- ♪ Mary had a little lamb... ♪

739
00:54:40,586 --> 00:54:44,145
I did not!

740
00:54:45,386 --> 00:54:46,986
Young love!

741
00:54:47,067 --> 00:54:50,828
School's cancelled todaybecause Kurt and Ram killed themselves

742
00:54:50,908 --> 00:54:52,907
in a repressed homosexual suicide pact!

743
00:54:52,988 --> 00:54:54,947
No way.

744
00:54:57,028 --> 00:54:58,788
God!

745
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:03,749
The football season is over, Veronica.

746
00:55:03,831 --> 00:55:06,591
Kurt and Ramhad nothing to offer the school

747
00:55:06,672 --> 00:55:08,712
but date rapes and AIDS jokes.

748
00:55:10,153 --> 00:55:12,233
Sure.

749
00:55:13,433 --> 00:55:16,432
Can we make an ice runbefore the funeral?

750
00:55:22,674 --> 00:55:25,714
If there's any wayyou can hear me, Kurt buddy...

751
00:55:28,276 --> 00:55:31,755
I don't care thatyou really were some... pansy.

752
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:35,397
You're my own flesh and blood

753
00:55:35,478 --> 00:55:37,438
and you made me proud.

754
00:55:39,999 --> 00:55:42,919
My son's a homosexual and I love him.

755
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,239
I love my dead, gay son.

756
00:55:48,521 --> 00:55:53,481
How do you think he'd react to a sonthat had a limp wrist with a pulse?

757
00:56:09,485 --> 00:56:14,925
'Dear diary, my teen angst bullshithas a body count.

'Are we going to prom or to hell? '

764
00:56:38,852 --> 00:56:43,772
Now, it seems we were ina similar position on Monday

765
00:56:43,854 --> 00:56:46,894
when I thoughtfully suggestedwe get everybody together

766
00:56:46,975 --> 00:56:50,015
for an unadulteratedemotional outpouring, but no.

767
00:56:50,095 --> 00:56:54,055
You took this as an opportunityto play yet another round

768
00:56:54,136 --> 00:56:56,415
of "let's laugh at the hippy".

769
00:56:56,497 --> 00:56:59,896
- Pauline...- Shut up, Paul.

770
00:56:59,977 --> 00:57:02,177
I've seen a lot of bullshit...

771
00:57:02,259 --> 00:57:04,778
ángel dust, switchblades,

772
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:08,858
sexually perverse photography exhibitsinvolving tennis rackets...

773
00:57:08,939 --> 00:57:11,058
but this suicide thing...

774
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:16,300
guess that's more on Pauline's wavelength.

775
00:57:16,381 --> 00:57:19,060
We're just going to write off today

776
00:57:19,141 --> 00:57:24,541
and on Friday she can holdher little love-in or whatever.

777
00:57:25,983 --> 00:57:27,742
Whatever.

778
00:57:33,345 --> 00:57:34,744
Attention!

779
00:57:36,185 --> 00:57:38,745
May I have your attention, please?

780
00:57:38,826 --> 00:57:42,867
This school has beentorn apart by tragedy.

781
00:57:42,948 --> 00:57:46,667
I'm here today to fuse it back againthrough togetherness.

782
00:57:46,748 --> 00:57:50,108
I want everyone to clasp hands.

783
00:57:50,188 --> 00:57:53,907
We need to connect this cafeteriainto one mighty circuit!

784
00:57:53,989 --> 00:57:56,909
- Excuse me.- Here comes the TV crew!

785
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,750
Lock your paws!

786
00:57:58,831 --> 00:58:01,471
- We're ready when you are.- Hi, there.

787
00:58:02,511 --> 00:58:06,511
Come on. Let's go. Here.

788
00:58:06,593 --> 00:58:09,432
This will be on TV.Let's show them how you feel!

789
00:58:09,513 --> 00:58:12,913
Looks like Miss Phlegm'son another one of her crusades.

790
00:58:12,994 --> 00:58:15,074
With usual success, of course.

791
00:58:15,154 --> 00:58:16,913
Come on, get up!

792
00:58:16,995 --> 00:58:18,634
Hi, what's your name?

793
00:58:18,715 --> 00:58:20,514
I'm Heather Duke.

794
00:58:26,037 --> 00:58:29,436
Is this as good for you as it is for me?

795
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:32,158
Those fish sticks can wait. Let's go.

796
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:34,198
Come on, kids!

797
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:38,318
The whole world is watching!

798
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,840
Show them that you care!

799
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:46,560
Greetings and salutations.

800
00:58:46,642 --> 00:58:51,402
I'll need a VHS copy of this by Mondayfor my Princeton application.

801
00:58:52,803 --> 00:58:56,442
You can beat this,don't let suicide get you down.

802
00:58:57,725 --> 00:59:00,205
That thing this afternoon,

803
00:59:00,285 --> 00:59:03,045
I'm so angry, it was chaos, fucking chaos.

804
00:59:04,486 --> 00:59:06,366
What are you talking about?

805
00:59:06,446 --> 00:59:10,165
I mean, today was great.Chaos was great.

806
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:13,566
Chaos is what killed thedinosaurs, darling.

807
00:59:14,848 --> 00:59:16,968
Face it, our way is the way.

808
00:59:17,049 --> 00:59:19,489
We scare people into not being assholes.

809
00:59:19,569 --> 00:59:22,169
Our way is not our way.

810
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:25,089
Oh, yeah? Tell that tothe judge, all right?

811
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:27,008
Tell it to Kurt Kelly.

812
00:59:27,091 --> 00:59:29,451
I'm telling it to you.

813
00:59:31,812 --> 00:59:33,892
God, you can be so immature.

814
00:59:33,973 --> 00:59:37,572
Oh! You kids are makingtoo much damn noise.

815
00:59:39,214 --> 00:59:41,293
We beat the bitches.

816
00:59:41,374 --> 00:59:43,854
Beautiful. The beaver's home.

817
00:59:43,935 --> 00:59:46,895
Judge told them to slurp shit and die.

818
00:59:46,975 --> 00:59:50,494
I put a Norwegian in the boiler room.

819
00:59:50,577 --> 00:59:52,976
Masterful.

820
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:55,896
And then when that blew,

821
00:59:55,977 --> 00:59:59,137
it set off a pack ofthermals I stuck upstairs.

822
01:00:08,821 --> 01:00:11,141
Some days it's great to be alive.

823
01:00:13,581 --> 01:00:15,981
Stick it to those goddamn...

824
01:00:16,063 --> 01:00:18,023
Do you like your father?

825
01:00:19,463 --> 01:00:21,903
Never given the matter much thought.

826
01:00:24,783 --> 01:00:26,743
Liked my mother.

827
01:00:27,545 --> 01:00:30,625
They said her death was an accident

828
01:00:30,706 --> 01:00:33,545
but she knew what she was doing.

829
01:00:33,626 --> 01:00:38,506
She walked into the building two minutesbefore my dad blew the place up.

830
01:00:38,588 --> 01:00:41,748
She waved at me and then...

831
01:00:41,828 --> 01:00:43,788
boom.

832
01:00:43,869 --> 01:00:47,670
'Dudes, if I get one more requestfor that Big Fun song,

01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,309

What? You can't bring them back,you must know that.

842
01:01:12,955 --> 01:01:16,996
I'm not trying to bring anybody backexcept maybe myself.

843
01:01:27,638 --> 01:01:29,477
No!

844
01:01:30,959 --> 01:01:33,759
To think onceI actually thought you were cool.

845
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:38,279
If you can't deal with me nowthen just stay home and shoot your TV,

846
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,961
blow up a couple toasters or something.

847
01:01:41,042 --> 01:01:45,122
Just don't come to schooland don't mess with me.

848
01:01:47,723 --> 01:01:49,722
You'll be back.

849
01:02:01,286 --> 01:02:03,606
Me and Martha Dumptruck?

850
01:02:03,687 --> 01:02:05,486
Where did you get this?

851
01:02:06,648 --> 01:02:11,008
Oh, I just had the nicest little chatwith Ms Dumptruck.

852
01:02:11,088 --> 01:02:13,129
Got along famously.

853
01:02:13,209 --> 01:02:16,569
It's scary how everybody's gota little story to tell.

854
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:19,089
Want to see the canoeing shots?

855
01:02:19,171 --> 01:02:21,009
What is this? Blackmail?

856
01:02:25,091 --> 01:02:27,252
I'll give you a week's lunch money.

857
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:33,131
I don't want your money.I want your strength.

858
01:02:33,213 --> 01:02:36,253
Westerburg does not needmushy togetherness,

859
01:02:36,334 --> 01:02:38,534
it needs a strong leader.

860
01:02:38,615 --> 01:02:41,655
Heather Chandler was that leader but...

861
01:02:41,735 --> 01:02:44,135
But she couldn't handle it.

862
01:02:44,216 --> 01:02:46,215
I think you can.

863
01:02:47,297 --> 01:02:49,256
Moby Dick is dunked.

864
01:02:49,338 --> 01:02:54,018
The white whale drank some bad planktonand splashed through a coffee table

865
01:02:54,099 --> 01:02:56,739
and now it's your turn to take the helm.

866
01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:58,939
What about the photographs?

867
01:02:59,019 --> 01:03:02,459
Oh, don't worry.I'll ask you to do me a favor

868
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:04,620
and it'll be one you'll enjoy.

869
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:07,301
You'll get the negatives back then.

870
01:03:09,662 --> 01:03:13,141
But in the meantime, strength.

871
01:03:14,903 --> 01:03:16,983
Here's a little gift...

872
01:03:18,063 --> 01:03:20,224
from Heather to Heather.

873
01:03:59,994 --> 01:04:01,593
- Guess who.- Heather?

874
01:04:19,718 --> 01:04:21,037
'Hello? '

875
01:04:21,118 --> 01:04:22,757
Hello, Betty? This is Veronica.

876
01:04:26,439 --> 01:04:28,998
I don't believe it, I'm winning!

877
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:33,080
Don't you start getting cocky on me, girl.

878
01:04:34,842 --> 01:04:37,081
I really missed you.

879
01:04:37,162 --> 01:04:40,202
I know I'm not as exciting asyour other friends.

880
01:04:40,283 --> 01:04:42,243
That is bullshit.

881
01:04:42,323 --> 01:04:44,283
Shoot.

882
01:04:44,364 --> 01:04:46,644
Do you know I'm still a virgin?

883
01:04:46,724 --> 01:04:49,804
OK, I French-kissed Al Springer once.

884
01:04:49,885 --> 01:04:51,845
It was a total disaster.

885
01:04:51,925 --> 01:04:54,845
Shoot the ball.

886
01:04:57,367 --> 01:05:02,247
Betty, your daydreams are a lot better thanmy realities, believe me.

887
01:05:04,808 --> 01:05:07,888
But now, prepare to die.

888
01:05:07,968 --> 01:05:09,727
Ronnie.

889
01:05:24,853 --> 01:05:27,613
You're not just going for those two shots.

890
01:05:27,693 --> 01:05:31,333
I mean, go ahead, knock me out.It's the only way to win.

891
01:05:33,015 --> 01:05:35,294
It's not my style.

892
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:39,136
Nice guys finish last, I should know.

893
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:49,137
Bravo.

894
01:05:50,218 --> 01:05:51,937
Bravo.

895
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,579
Listen, I got to get home, OK?

896
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,779
OK.

897
01:05:57,861 --> 01:05:59,659
Thanks.

898
01:05:59,741 --> 01:06:01,621
Bye, Betty.

899
01:06:01,701 --> 01:06:03,140
Bye.

900
01:06:03,221 --> 01:06:06,141
Betty, leaving so soon?

901
01:06:06,223 --> 01:06:07,781
I'm red.

902
01:06:35,109 --> 01:06:39,189
'The Westerburg suicideswere tough on all of us,

903
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:43,989

905
01:06:47,792 --> 01:06:50,631

908

Cleansing synchronicity?

909
01:06:59,234 --> 01:07:03,035
Outpouring of emotion?

910
01:07:03,115 --> 01:07:05,435
Ha! Look! There's Heather.

911
01:07:06,676 --> 01:07:09,355
There's Heather. Where are you, Veronica?

These programs are eating suicide up.

917
01:07:40,243 --> 01:07:43,083
They're making it sound likea cool thing to do.

918
01:07:43,165 --> 01:07:48,125
Are you trying to tell me it's not a timefor troubled youth? Stand up straight.

919
01:07:48,205 --> 01:07:51,405
All we want is to betreated like human beings,

920
01:07:51,486 --> 01:07:54,006
not patronized like bunny rabbits.

921
01:07:54,087 --> 01:07:56,248
I don't patronize bunny rabbits.

922
01:07:56,328 --> 01:07:58,327
Treated like human beings?

923
01:07:58,408 --> 01:08:02,168
Is that what you said,little Miss Voice-of-a-generation?

924
01:08:02,249 --> 01:08:05,488
How do you think adultsact with other adults?

925
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:08,249
You think it's all justa game of doubles tennis?

926
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:11,770
When teenagers complainthey want to be treated like human beings,

927
01:08:11,851 --> 01:08:14,651
it's because they arebeing treated like human beings.

928
01:08:14,732 --> 01:08:19,212
Well, I guess I picked the wrong timeto be a human being.

929
01:08:19,293 --> 01:08:21,292
Well, you'll live.

930
01:08:27,415 --> 01:08:29,375
Want some pâté?

931
01:08:31,456 --> 01:08:33,896
Hi, everybody. Door was open.

932
01:08:33,976 --> 01:08:36,335
Veronica, have you heard?

933
01:08:36,416 --> 01:08:38,776
We were doing Chinese at the food fair

934
01:08:38,858 --> 01:08:42,178
when we heard Martha Dumptrucktried to buy the farm.

935
01:08:42,257 --> 01:08:46,097
She belly-flopped in front of a carwearing a suicide note.

936
01:08:47,099 --> 01:08:48,858
Is she dead?

937
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:52,619
No. That's the punch line.She's in stable condition.

938
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:57,740
Just another case of a geek trying to imitatethe popular people and failing miserably.

939
01:08:57,822 --> 01:08:59,782
Is that pâté?

940
01:09:03,823 --> 01:09:07,303
- I said I was sorry.- You were out of control.

941
01:09:07,384 --> 01:09:10,464
Heather and Kurt were a shockbut Martha Dumptruck?

942
01:09:10,545 --> 01:09:13,664
Get crucial. She dialedsuicide hotlines in her diapers.

943
01:09:13,745 --> 01:09:15,864
You're not funny.

944
01:09:16,906 --> 01:09:21,106
Look, Martha couldn't take the heatso she got out of the kitchen.

945
01:09:21,187 --> 01:09:25,906
Just think what a better place this worldwould be if every nimrod followed her cue.

946
01:09:25,989 --> 01:09:28,869
Just shut up. Hot Probs is on.

947
01:09:28,949 --> 01:09:30,428
Oh, shit. Yeah.

948

No, it...

956
01:10:00,236 --> 01:10:03,836
It's Madonna. Jeez. No, not that.

957
01:10:03,916 --> 01:10:07,315
Hey, babe, I need a name.

958
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:14,959
My name is Tweety.

959
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,999
'Tweety?

960
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,959
'Ooh, tweet! '

961
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:21,800
God has cursed me, I think.

The last guy I had sex withkilled himself the next day.

963
01:10:30,242 --> 01:10:32,202
I'm failing math.

964
01:10:32,283 --> 01:10:34,002
My whole life is a mess.

965
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:36,963
I'm supposed to be captain ofthe cheerleading...

966
01:10:37,045 --> 01:10:40,284
She knows we listen to this show.

967
01:10:40,365 --> 01:10:43,685
Holy shit! We'll crucify her.

Now where is she going?

986

Heather.

987

- What are you trying to do? Kill me?- What are you trying to do? Sleep?

988
01:12:01,623 --> 01:12:04,063
Suicide is a private thing.

989

Heather, you're throwing your life away

990
01:12:06,745 --> 01:12:09,665
to become a statisticin the US fucking A Today.

991
01:12:09,746 --> 01:12:12,666
That's the least privatething I can think of.

992
01:12:12,746 --> 01:12:15,705
What about Heather and Kurt and Ram?

993
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:22,107
If everyone jumped off a bridge, would you?

994
01:12:25,349 --> 01:12:27,148
Probably.

995
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:31,990
Hey now, if you were happyevery day of your life,

996
01:12:32,071 --> 01:12:35,671
you wouldn't be a human being,you'd be a game show host.

997
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:40,632
What do you say we knock off early,buy some shoes, something lame like that?

998
01:12:41,593 --> 01:12:43,312
OK.

999
01:12:49,315 --> 01:12:51,074
So it's come to this.

1000
01:12:51,155 --> 01:12:52,954
Heather Chandler did polls,

1001
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:57,555
I want you to do a petition,as a favor, as the favor.

1002
01:12:57,637 --> 01:13:00,596
You've heard of the group Big Fun, right?

1003
01:13:00,677 --> 01:13:03,876
That's right. Teenage Suicide Don't Do It.

1004
01:13:03,958 --> 01:13:08,878
Right. Some teenybopper ragsays that they want to play a prom.

1005
01:13:08,959 --> 01:13:12,880
It could be Westerburg'sif we get everybody's John Hancock.

1006
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,719
I'll get right on it, coach.

1007
01:13:14,801 --> 01:13:18,040
Little gift for you. I won't be needing it.

1008
01:13:51,368 --> 01:13:52,968
Heather?

1009
01:13:53,049 --> 01:13:54,248
Veronica.

1010
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:56,930
Color me stoked, girl.

1011
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:59,050
Everyone's signed this petition,

1012
01:13:59,131 --> 01:14:02,450
even the ones who thinkBig Fun are tuneless Eurofags.

1013
01:14:02,531 --> 01:14:04,250
People love me.

1014
01:14:04,332 --> 01:14:06,252
You haven't signed yet.

1015
01:14:06,332 --> 01:14:09,372
People love you but I know you.

1016
01:14:09,452 --> 01:14:12,292
Jennifer Forbes told methe petition she signed

1017
01:14:12,374 --> 01:14:15,933
was to put a hot tub in the cafeteriaand Doug Hilton said...

1018
01:14:16,015 --> 01:14:19,014
Some people needdifferent kinds of convincing.

1019
01:14:19,095 --> 01:14:21,374
Just sign the petition, OK?

1020
01:14:21,456 --> 01:14:23,376
Don't talk to me like that, OK?

1021
01:14:23,456 --> 01:14:25,776
Look, it was JD's idea.

1022
01:14:25,857 --> 01:14:30,537
He made out the signature sheetand everything so why not just sign it?

1023
01:14:30,617 --> 01:14:31,896
No.

1024
01:14:34,138 --> 01:14:35,697
Jealous much?

1025
01:14:39,499 --> 01:14:43,980
Heather, why can't you just be a friend?Why are you such a megabitch?

1026
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:47,101
Because I can be.

1027
01:14:48,462 --> 01:14:50,741
Veronica, why are you pulling my dick?

1028
01:14:50,822 --> 01:14:54,782
Do you think if Betty Finn'sfairy godmother made her cool,

1029
01:14:54,862 --> 01:14:58,102
she'd still hang outwith her dweebette friends?

1030
01:14:58,184 --> 01:15:00,424
No way, Veronica.

1031
01:15:12,347 --> 01:15:14,667
Want to go out tonight?

1032
01:15:14,747 --> 01:15:17,627
Catch a movie, some miniature golf?

1033
01:15:17,709 --> 01:15:22,829
I was thinking more along the linesof slitting Heather Duke's wrists open,

1034
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:25,070
making it look like a suicide.

1035
01:15:25,151 --> 01:15:27,870
Now you're talking. I could be up for that.

1036
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:31,430
I've already startedunderlining meaningful passages

1037
01:15:31,511 --> 01:15:34,711
in her copy of Moby Dick,if you know what I mean.

1038
01:15:36,233 --> 01:15:38,273
I knew you'd be back, Veronica.

1039
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:42,393
I knew it. I was positive sure.

1040
01:15:46,835 --> 01:15:48,794
It's over, JD, over.

1041
01:15:48,875 --> 01:15:50,433
Grow up!

1042
01:15:50,516 --> 01:15:52,354
You don't get it.

1043
01:15:52,436 --> 01:15:54,516
You were wrong. I was right.

1044
01:15:57,037 --> 01:15:59,077
Strength, damn it!

1045
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:02,319
Come on, come back!

1046
01:16:11,402 --> 01:16:13,240
Yes?

1047
01:16:13,322 --> 01:16:17,762
Your friend Jason Dean stopped by.He seemed very concerned about you.

1048
01:16:17,843 --> 01:16:21,442
He said he thoughtyou might try to kill yourself.

1049
01:16:21,523 --> 01:16:23,482
You have been depressed lately.

1050
01:16:23,564 --> 01:16:25,524
Oh, he left this for you.

1051
01:16:32,646 --> 01:16:34,605
Oh, my God.

1052
01:16:35,607 --> 01:16:39,607
He said that we shouldkeep you away from sharp objects,

1053
01:16:39,687 --> 01:16:42,847
closed garage doors,chemical substances.

1054
01:16:42,928 --> 01:16:45,808
- Prescription drugs.- Prescription drugs.

1055
01:17:24,058 --> 01:17:28,698
"To neither lovenor reverence wilt thou be kind,"

1056
01:17:28,779 --> 01:17:33,219
"and even for hate thou canst but kill,"

1057
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:35,460
"and all are killed."

1058
01:17:37,501 --> 01:17:38,980
I like it.

1059
01:17:39,062 --> 01:17:41,461
It's got that what-a-cruel-world

1060
01:17:41,541 --> 01:17:45,981
so let's-toss-ourselves-in-the-abysstype of ambiance?

1061
01:17:47,783 --> 01:17:50,782
Come on. It's Heather's copy of Moby Dick.

1062
01:17:53,063 --> 01:17:56,023
Why don't you give it a try?Underline something.

1063
01:17:58,025 --> 01:18:00,625
Get off of my bed, you fucking psycho!

1064
01:18:00,706 --> 01:18:04,587
You think you're a rebel?Do you actually think you're a rebel?

1065
01:18:04,666 --> 01:18:07,586
You're not a rebel.You're fucking psychotic.

1066
01:18:09,308 --> 01:18:11,828
You say "tom-ay-to", I say "tom-ah-to".

1067
01:18:11,908 --> 01:18:13,828
Hold it.

1068
01:18:13,909 --> 01:18:17,148
Eskimo. Look at that.

1069
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:20,830
That's one word. I love it!

1070
01:18:20,911 --> 01:18:25,310
I usually go for the whole sentence myselfbut this is perfecto.

1071
01:18:25,391 --> 01:18:29,070
Eskimo, you know, it's so mysterious.

1072
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:33,792
Eskimo.

1073
01:18:38,434 --> 01:18:40,393
Come on.

1074
01:18:42,075 --> 01:18:44,275
JD, you are not listening to me.

1075
01:18:45,316 --> 01:18:47,796
Nag. Nag. Nag. Nag. Nag!

1076
01:18:49,596 --> 01:18:51,876
Th-th-that knife is filthy.

1077
01:18:51,958 --> 01:18:55,478
Do you think I'm going totake out her tonsils with it?

1078
01:18:55,559 --> 01:18:58,879
Excuse me, I think I know Heathera little better than you do.

1079
01:18:58,959 --> 01:19:03,160
If she was going to slit her wrists,the knife would be spotless.

1080
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:07,199
How's this? Can you see your fuckingreflection in the thing?

1081
01:19:10,002 --> 01:19:13,201
Tomorrow someone elsewill move into her place.

1082
01:19:14,643 --> 01:19:16,402
That person could be me.

1083
01:19:21,084 --> 01:19:24,564
Ha! There's only one of usknows Heather's handwriting.

1084
01:19:24,645 --> 01:19:28,125
If you think I'll write anothersuicide note, you're wrong.

1085
01:19:28,206 --> 01:19:30,846
You don't get it! Society nods its head

1086
01:19:30,927 --> 01:19:35,447
at any horror the American teenagercan think to bring upon itself.

1087
01:19:35,528 --> 01:19:39,968
Nobody's going to care aboutexact handwriting. Help me. Quick.

1088
01:19:49,811 --> 01:19:52,050
Life sucks.

1089
01:19:55,172 --> 01:19:57,132
It's perfecto.

1090
01:19:58,252 --> 01:20:01,931
Jesus, I've gota meaningfully marked-up Moby Dick.

1091
01:20:02,014 --> 01:20:04,373
What else does a suicide need?

1092
01:20:04,455 --> 01:20:06,415
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1093
01:20:11,656 --> 01:20:13,415
No!

1094
01:20:19,578 --> 01:20:21,537
Open the door!

1095
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:31,180
Eskimo.

1096
01:20:35,461 --> 01:20:40,061
Heather Duke underlined a lot of thingsin this copy of Moby Dick

1097
01:20:40,143 --> 01:20:44,023
but I believe the word Eskimo,

1098
01:20:44,103 --> 01:20:46,463
underlined all by itself,

1099
01:20:46,544 --> 01:20:50,344
is the key to understanding Heather's pain.

1100
01:20:50,425 --> 01:20:54,425
On the surface, Heather Dukewas the vivacious young lady

1101
01:20:54,506 --> 01:20:56,785
we all knew her to be...

1102
01:20:56,867 --> 01:21:00,506
but her soul was in Antarctica,

1103
01:21:00,588 --> 01:21:06,629
freezing with the knowledgeof the way fellow teenagers can be cruel...

1104
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:12,469
the way that parents can be unresponsive...

1105
01:21:12,549 --> 01:21:16,829
and as she writes so eloquentlyin her suicide note,

1106
01:21:16,911 --> 01:21:19,870
the way that life can suck.

1107
01:21:21,832 --> 01:21:25,071
We'll all miss Sherwood's little Eskimo.

1108
01:21:27,313 --> 01:21:31,793
Let's just hopeshe's rubbing noses with Jesus.

1109
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:34,035
Is this turnout weak or what?

1110
01:21:35,395 --> 01:21:38,435
I had at least 70 morepeople at my funeral.

1111
01:21:40,036 --> 01:21:41,275
Heather?

1112
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:47,277
Oh, God, Veronica,

1113
01:21:47,358 --> 01:21:50,678
my afterlife is so boring.

1114
01:21:50,759 --> 01:21:53,559
If I have to sing Kumbaya one more time...

1115
01:21:53,639 --> 01:21:55,278
What are you doing here?

1116
01:21:55,359 --> 01:21:57,959
I made your favorite...

1117
01:21:58,041 --> 01:22:00,201
spaghetti.

1118
01:22:00,281 --> 01:22:02,240
Lots of oregano.

1119
01:22:04,721 --> 01:22:06,560
Dinner!

1120
01:22:08,483 --> 01:22:10,442
Veronica! Dinner!

1121
01:22:34,648 --> 01:22:37,688
'Dear diary, last entry.

1122
01:22:37,769 --> 01:22:39,528
'No one can stop JD...

1123
01:22:39,610 --> 01:22:43,491
'not the FBI, the CIA or the PTA.

1124
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:47,970
'He once told me thatthe extreme always makes an impression.

1125
01:22:48,051 --> 01:22:49,811
'Well, now it's my turn.

1126
01:22:49,892 --> 01:22:54,692
'Let's see how the son of a bitch reactsto a suicide he didn't perform himself.'

1127
01:23:31,182 --> 01:23:32,981
I can't believe you did it.

1128
01:23:33,062 --> 01:23:35,022
I was teasing.

1129
01:23:36,422 --> 01:23:37,861
I loved you.

1130
01:23:39,103 --> 01:23:41,903
Sure, I was coming up here to kill you.

1131
01:23:44,385 --> 01:23:48,785
First I was going to try and get you backwith my amazing petition.

1132
01:23:52,546 --> 01:23:56,986
It's a shame you can't see whatour fellow students really signed.

1133
01:24:00,748 --> 01:24:02,708
All right, listen.

1134
01:24:05,950 --> 01:24:11,551
"We students ofWesterburg High will die. Today."

1135
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:15,189
"Our burning bodieswill be the ultimate protest"

1136
01:24:15,272 --> 01:24:18,191
"to a society that degrades us."

1137
01:24:19,272 --> 01:24:21,232
"Fuck you all."

1138
01:24:22,753 --> 01:24:28,313
It's not very subtle, but neither'sblowing up a whole school, now, is it?

1139
01:24:30,035 --> 01:24:32,475
Talk about your suicide pacts?

1140
01:24:34,916 --> 01:24:37,796
When our school blows up tomorrow,

1141
01:24:37,876 --> 01:24:41,956
it's going to be the kind of thingto infect a generation!

1142
01:24:42,038 --> 01:24:45,597
I mean, it's going to bea Woodstock for the '80s.

1143
01:24:53,961 --> 01:24:55,920
Damn it, Veronica.

1144
01:24:57,561 --> 01:25:00,481
We could havetoasted some marshmallows together.

1145
01:25:04,124 --> 01:25:06,963
What does she want? A written invitation?

1146
01:25:07,043 --> 01:25:09,043
Veronica! Dinner!

1147
01:25:09,124 --> 01:25:10,883
Sheesh.

1148
01:25:15,766 --> 01:25:17,725
Veronica, I...

1149
01:25:20,566 --> 01:25:25,486
Oh, I... I... I should have let youtake that job at the mall.

1150
01:25:25,567 --> 01:25:30,247
It was just that I was afraid of youcoming home late at night and I...

1151
01:25:38,811 --> 01:25:41,691
Hey, Mom, why so tense?

1152
01:25:47,373 --> 01:25:50,573
Hey, Prob, I need some helpwith my homework.

1153
01:25:50,654 --> 01:25:53,694
Not right now, tiger. I'm a little busy.

1154
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:25,701
Veronica, JD told meyou committed suicide last night.

1155
01:26:25,781 --> 01:26:29,460
- Where is he? Where's JD?- We have to talk.

1156
01:26:29,542 --> 01:26:34,462
Whether to kill yourself or not is the mostimportant decision a teenager can make.

1157
01:26:34,543 --> 01:26:35,942
Get a job.

1158
01:29:08,859 --> 01:29:11,179
Rodney, where's everybody going?

1159
01:29:12,380 --> 01:29:16,180
- It's Friday.- Shit, another damn pep assembly.

1160
01:29:16,261 --> 01:29:20,581
Yeah. You know, these things,they get pretty artificial

1161
01:29:20,662 --> 01:29:23,461
but you know, at leastyou get out of class.

1162
01:29:24,542 --> 01:29:27,302
Rodney, what's underneath the gym?

1163
01:29:31,024 --> 01:29:32,984
The boiler room.

1164
01:29:39,146 --> 01:29:41,666
May I see your hall pass?

1165
01:29:45,868 --> 01:29:48,827
I knew that loose was too noose.

1166
01:29:50,068 --> 01:29:52,948
I mean noose too loose.

1167
01:29:54,269 --> 01:29:56,228
Goddamn you, woman.

1168
01:29:57,190 --> 01:29:59,150
Like father, like son.

1169
01:29:59,231 --> 01:30:03,671
A serious-as-fuck bomb in the boiler roomto set off a pack of thermals upstairs.

1170
01:30:06,073 --> 01:30:11,032
Ok, let's start by putting the bomb downon the ground.

1171
01:30:14,954 --> 01:30:16,633
I knew that.

1172
01:30:17,074 --> 01:30:18,873
I knew that.

1173
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:22,074
OK, put your hands on your head.

1174
01:30:23,196 --> 01:30:25,315
You didn't say "Simon says".

1175
01:30:48,161 --> 01:30:49,920
Let's go!

1176
01:30:50,001 --> 01:30:52,322
Let's go, Rottweilers, let's go!

1177
01:30:52,843 --> 01:30:56,082
Let's go, Rottweilers, let's go!

1178
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:21,087
W- E-S!

1179
01:31:21,169 --> 01:31:23,409
- T-E-R!- T-E-R!

1180
01:31:23,489 --> 01:31:26,049
- B-U-R!- B-U-R!

1181
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:27,649
- G!- G!

1182
01:31:27,730 --> 01:31:30,130
- What does it spell?- Westerburg!

1183
01:31:30,211 --> 01:31:33,171
- Again!- Westerburg!

1184
01:31:33,251 --> 01:31:35,251
Westerburg!

1185
01:32:06,579 --> 01:32:08,939
Lean to the left, lean to the right!

1186
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:12,340
Stand up, sit down, fight, fight, fight!

1187
01:32:24,423 --> 01:32:25,902
Stop!

1188
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:55,269
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1189
01:33:26,918 --> 01:33:30,637
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1190
01:33:36,039 --> 01:33:38,999
You think becauseyou started this you can end it?

1191
01:33:39,081 --> 01:33:42,080
I'll kill, I'll fuckingkill you, I swear to God.

1192
01:33:45,442 --> 01:33:48,202
How do I turn off the bomb, asshole?

1193
01:33:48,283 --> 01:33:50,163
Fuck you!

1194
01:33:58,726 --> 01:34:00,646
Shit!

1195
01:34:01,886 --> 01:34:04,605
It's all over, JD. Help me stop it.

1196
01:34:14,649 --> 01:34:17,328
You want to clean theslate as much as I do.

1197
01:34:18,289 --> 01:34:22,569
All right, so maybe I amkilling everyone in the school...

1198
01:34:22,650 --> 01:34:24,610
because nobody loves me.

1199
01:34:25,891 --> 01:34:29,891
Let's face it, all right?The only place different social types

1200
01:34:29,972 --> 01:34:33,251
can genuinely get alongwith each other is in heaven.

1201
01:34:37,934 --> 01:34:40,454
Which button do I press to turn it off?

1202
01:34:40,535 --> 01:34:42,975
Try the red one, all right?

1203
01:34:44,815 --> 01:34:48,696
People are going to look atthe ashes of Westerburg and say,

1204
01:34:48,776 --> 01:34:51,696
"Now, there is a schoolthat self-destructed,"

1205
01:34:51,777 --> 01:34:56,497
"not because society didn't carebut because the school was society!"

1206
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:00,339
It's pretty deep?

1207
01:35:00,419 --> 01:35:02,419
Which red button?

1208
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:07,860
Press the middle one to turn it off...

1209
01:35:07,941 --> 01:35:09,901
if that's what you really want.

1210
01:35:09,981 --> 01:35:12,501
You know what I want, babe?

1211
01:35:13,663 --> 01:35:14,902
What?

1212
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:26,424
Cool guys like you out of my life.

1213
01:36:14,356 --> 01:36:16,316
Color me impressed.

1214
01:36:19,197 --> 01:36:23,797
You... you really fucked me uppretty bad, Veronica.

1215
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:30,080
You...

1216
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,600
you got power.

1217
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,000
Power I didn't think you had.

1218
01:36:41,842 --> 01:36:43,521
The slate is clean.

1219
01:37:07,008 --> 01:37:09,608
Pretend I did blow up the school...

1220
01:37:10,769 --> 01:37:12,729
all the schools.

1221
01:37:14,049 --> 01:37:16,089
Now that you're dead,

1222
01:37:16,170 --> 01:37:18,569
what are you going to do with your life?

1223
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:49,310
Veronica... you look like hell.

1224
01:38:49,392 --> 01:38:51,752
Yeah? I just got back.

1225
01:38:53,593 --> 01:38:55,633
Veronica, what are you doing?

1226
01:38:55,713 --> 01:38:57,432
Heather, my love,

1227
01:38:57,514 --> 01:38:59,674
there's a new sheriff in town.

1228
01:39:04,836 --> 01:39:06,955
Hey, Martha!

1229
01:39:07,036 --> 01:39:10,475
My date for the promkind of flaked out on me.

1230
01:39:10,557 --> 01:39:13,236
If you aren't doing anything that night,

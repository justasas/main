513
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,380
say my girls pound is run by an honor
system

514
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,219
what's that well it's just some kind of
Catholic thing you know it's all about

515
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:41,759
guilt original sin rot in hell for all
eternity is something along those lines

516
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,450
at that time it is not it's about
accountability it's about taking

517
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:47,639
responsibility for your own actions

518
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:51,719
you know as a matter of fact I think the
honor system might just be the thing we

519
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:55,949
need right here on the good old
satellite of love candy

520
00:40:55,949 --> 00:40:59,309

locked up and only let us have one

delicious candy bar a day

522
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:04,740
yeah well from now on it will be on the
honor system you still get to have one a

523
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:06,659
day but you have to police yourself

524
00:41:06,659 --> 00:41:11,159
well she might can honor really build
character towards the King crow I mean

525
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:15,719
ever since demosthenes went walking the
streets thank you doing looking for one

526
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:19,739
honorable man by lamplight honor has
been one of the most notice traits that

527
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:25,229
we have history filled with stories of
men and women who are not let our just

528
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:26,789
stand in the way of their own

529
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:31,259
d personal sense of honor out George
Washington cutting down the cherry tree

530
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:35,790
is a parable perhaps but it's still in
doing straight how of Honor contributes

531
00:41:35,789 --> 00:41:40,349
to the dignity and the stature of our
nation's leaders you you ask upon her

532
00:41:40,349 --> 00:41:41,579
can build character

honor would we even have character to

you with your chambers mr. Scrooge

25
00:01:18 --> 00:01:21
thinking that you would have finished
business for the day but we failed to

26
00:01:21 --> 00:01:24
make anyone here that&#39;s not surprising

27
00:01:24 --> 00:01:28
I&#39;m the only person who lives there
right consequently we have called here

28
00:01:28 --> 00:01:32
at this festive season of the year mr.
Scrooge it seems more than usually

29
00:01:32 --> 00:01:36
desirable to make some slight provision
for the poor and destitute who suffer

30
00:01:36 --> 00:01:39
terribly at this present time many
thousands are in want of common

31
00:01:39 --> 00:01:44

want of common comfort I don&#39;t know

the current want to be with him and a
useful cause we&#39;re here to be made here

37

the Port of London meet and drinkin
means of warm we choose this time

40
00:02:14 --> 00:02:18

no honor in life I was your partner
Jacob Marley in life

153
00:11:23 --> 00:11:32
why there&#39;s a troubled me it is required
of everyone that the spirit within him

154
00:11:32 --> 00:11:38
to walk abroad among his fellow men and
if that spirit goes not forth in life it

155
00:11:38 --> 00:11:45
is condemned to do so after death my
spirit never walked beyond the narrow

156
00:11:45 --> 00:11:49
limits of our money-changing hole so I
cannot rest

157
00:11:49 --> 00:11:53
I cannot stay I cannot linger anywhere

158
00:11:53 --> 00:12:08

in life I made it link by link would you

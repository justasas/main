1
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,647
Can we discuss that?

2
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:18,784
Because I'm like very upset.

3
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:21,720
Is there like a writer's guideto horror films that says,

4
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:24,156
"bitch must fall down!"

5
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:26,392
Because that is themost unprovoked,

6
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:29,328
unrealistic fuckingtumble I've ever seen.

7
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,163
And I've seen a lotof fucking horror films.

8
00:00:31,165 --> 00:00:33,599
And then, she just stays there.

9
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:37,102
It's like, she's waiting forclown face to catch up to her.

10
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:38,102
I think I need to write

11
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:40,706
a manifesto for how tomake good horror films.

12
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:44,176
Cause this genrehas just gone to shit!

13
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:45,577
What are you talking about?

14
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,413
We got the scream movies.

15
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:49,448
Nothing beats the original.

16
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,051
Man, those shits came outlike 20 years ago!

17
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:54,253
Okay, well, we got the conjuring

18
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:55,454
and the insidious movies.

19
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:57,489
That's not the point.That is the point.

20
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,591
You just said that therewere no good horror movies.

21
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:03,095
Okay, fine, there's some goodhorror movies that have came out.

22
00:01:03,097 --> 00:01:05,097
But, the shitty one'soutnumber the good one's.

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,266
That's the problem.All right, so,

24
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,468
according to Parker,

25
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,570
what makes a good horror movie?

26
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,439
I don't know, the essentials,

27
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,641
good dialog,

28
00:01:15,643 --> 00:01:17,810
characters that Iactually care about.

29
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:21,346
Characters that are ableto use their better judgment.

30
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:23,248
Like, if you are home alone

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,084
and you hear weird noises,

32
00:01:25,086 --> 00:01:27,586
don't just yell,"hello?"

33
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:30,556
Get the fuck out of there, man.

34
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:31,824
I see you're veryserious about this.

35
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:33,225
Yes, you gotta be.

36
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,864
Wait, wait, wait,wait, pause that.

37
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:41,733
Why?

38
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:42,801
Pause it!

39
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,375
Am I going crazyor do you hear that?

40
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:51,710
You're going crazy.

41
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,112
I'm being serious!

42
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,148
I don't hear anything.

43
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,449
Cause you're not listening.

44
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,419
Can you stop? Causeyou're not funny.

45
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:03,222
I'm not trying to befunny, I hear noises.

46
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:06,492
Yeah, right, we're sittinghere watching a horror movie,

47
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:08,660
talking about horrormovies and all of a sudden

48
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:10,229
you start hearing weird noises.

49
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,797
Stop playing, miles. I agree

50
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:14,166
that this is bad timing, but,

51
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:17,469
I... really do hearsomething, I'm not joking.

52
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,438
It sounds like it'scoming from downstairs.

53
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:25,444
If you tell meyou didn't hear that,

54
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:27,146
I will bop you.

55
00:02:27,148 --> 00:02:30,349
Okay, fine, I heard that.

56
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,518
But, your mom's workingthe night shift right?

57
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,886
So, we're the only one's here.

58
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:36,588
Park, I don't thinkthat's my mom down there.

59
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,437
So, what do you wanna do?

60
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,540
What? Check it out, I guess.

61
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:57,843
Are you...? Didn't we just havea conversation about that?

62
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,945
And now you wanna go dothe same thing that those

63
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:01,813
dumb motherfuckersdo in the movies.

64
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:04,283
First off, it's two of us,

65
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:06,518
therefore, we'remore of a threat.

66
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,688
And b, this isn't a horrormovie, this is life!

67
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,824
In life, motherfuckers run away.

68
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,326
What are you talking about?

69
00:03:14,328 --> 00:03:16,261
Besides, how do you know

70
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,430
there's not a groupof intruders down there.

71
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:20,732
Intruders equipped with guns,

72
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:24,469
or equally harmful sharp assobjects or an assortment of both.

73
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,805
I'm not running outof my own house.

74
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:28,407
It's about the principles.

75
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,676
Fuck principles, principlesdon't keep you alive.

76
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:32,945
Look, I'll grab the bat,

77
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:34,346
you grab the broom.

78
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,880
The broom?

79
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,816
What you want me to do?Swoop the shit out of them?

80
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,385
Come on.Nah, nah, nah.

81
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:41,820
I'm not going down there, man.

82
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:44,656
I don't care what yousay, or how you say it,

83
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,491
I'm not going down there.

84
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:47,726
I'm not doing it.

85
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:12,784
One, two, three.

86
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:13,852
Aah!

87
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,625
What the fuck areyou doing here?

88
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:20,892
You're ready?

89
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:22,728
I know that, Kenan. I live here.

90
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,329
But, I thought that youwere at Nia's house.

91
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,531
We were, and now we're here.

92
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:28,467
Y'all sounding likesome fucking pussies.

93
00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:29,668
You know what, Ithink you're voices

94
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,036
might be a littlehigher than mine.

95
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,371
And you were like...

96
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,975
Yeah, it's funny now.

97
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,710
But, you almost got fucked up.

98
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:40,879
By who? Me and Parker, bitch!

99
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:44,316
Oh, I mean, not, not quite.

100
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,018
Not quite.

101
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,322
If those were really intruders,

102
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:52,291
they would've got fuckedup with our quickness.

103
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:53,859
No doubt.

104
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,531
Can we take a little breakfrom the horror movies?

105
00:04:59,533 --> 00:05:00,666
I mean, I'm just saying.

106
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:01,967
No, come on.I'm just saying.

107
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,857
Okay, so, aside fromthe other components,

108
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,994
good dialogs, smartcharacters, that kinda thing,

109
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,829
what is the one ingredient

110
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,332
needed to makea solid horror film?

111
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,968
The 'o.S.' Factor. I don't know.

112
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,970
The "oh, shit" factor. The what?

113
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:40,072
'O.S.'

114
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:42,507
and what's the'o.S.' Factor?

115
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,109
I was thinking aboutthe movies you named.

116
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:47,379
Scream, insidious,the conjuring,

117
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:50,082
they all havethat 'o.S.' Factor.

118
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:53,552
You know, something fresh,something that throws you off

119
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,354
and makes you say,

120
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:57,456
"oh, shit"

121
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,791
hence, the 'o.S.' Factor.

122
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:01,526
I just feel like nowadays,

123
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,528
horror movies abide by the same

124
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,130
formulate blueprint.

125
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:06,531
And in my opinion, it really

126
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,467
belittles us asaudience members.

127
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:09,835
I shouldn't haveto turn my brain off

128
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,636
to enjoy a horror movie.

129
00:06:11,638 --> 00:06:12,704
You see what I'm saying?

130
00:06:13,673 --> 00:06:15,040
I wanna be surprised.

131
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,442
I wanna care aboutwhat's going on.

132
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,010
I want an experience.

133
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,657
Yo, one more week.

134
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,959
To what?

135
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:35,594
To, to what?

136
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,896
To your fuckingbirthday, you dum-dum.

137
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,432
Yeah. Being legaland shit like me.

138
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:41,933
Yo, I was thinking about this.

139
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,170
We should go to a strip club.

140
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,939
Are you for real? Yeah, man!

141
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,542
Please, don't toywith my emotions.

142
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,878
I'm serious, man. Let'shit that shit up.

143
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:01,720
How am I the onlyone here again?

144
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,524
It's just pitiful, man!

145
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:10,996
Mr. Roland?

146
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:14,599
Mr. Roland?

147
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:17,702
Mr. Roland!

148
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,473
Notice me!

149
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,008
What does the board say, miles?

150
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,477
Sorry.

151
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,213
I'm not asking for an apology, I'masking to tell me what the board says.

152
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:31,516
"If you have a question,raise your hand"

153
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:32,584
"exclamation point."

154
00:07:32,586 --> 00:07:34,186
He can read.

155
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:35,587
I had my doubts.

156
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,721
But, you came through.

157
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,523
Why I gotta raise my hand, now?

158
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,791
I'm the only one here.

159
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,793
It's not like you havehands to choose from.

160
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,028
The rules don't change.

161
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,131
Rules are for the majority.

162
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,966
I'm above the law, Mr. Roland.

163
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,468
If you were above the law,

164
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,190
you wouldn't be indetention now, would you?

165
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,840
Mr. Roland comingwith the fire!

166
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:59,244
Miles, I'm losingmy Patience with you.

167
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,046
Is it okay if I goto the bathroom?

168
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:03,682
Didn't you have 10 freeminutes before you got here?

169
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,951
Yeah, but, I didn'thave to go then.

170
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,519
As much as I'd like to,

171
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,788
I can't control the actionsof my bladder, Mr. Roland.

172
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,825
You have threeminutes, starting now.

173
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:20,732
Say I never came back,what would you do?

174
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:22,567
Now, you havetwo and a half minutes.

175
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,804
You wanna continue?

176
00:08:25,806 --> 00:08:27,839
I could make itgo down to 30 seconds.

177
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:29,541
I leave now.

178
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,572
Fuck!

179
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:02,274
Shit!

180
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:04,110
What happened here?

181
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:07,279
Aidan hit me in the facewith a fucking rock!

182
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:10,882
It was an accident,Dudeski, I said I was sorry.

183
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,217
I was trying to hitchase with the rock,

184
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,318
but Kurt got in the way.

185
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,318
Oh, okay.

186
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,922
Why the fuck you trying to hitme in the face with a rock?

187
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:19,791
It wasn't a big rock.You would've been fine.

188
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:20,926
Kurt's fine.

189
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,561
No, I'm not.

190
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,697
Aidan, you're clearly missingthe larger issue at hand,

191
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,632
you don't throw rocks at people.

192
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,301
Dudeski, you totallyhad it coming,

193
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:30,869
you were being an asshole.

194
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,671
How's that being an asshole?

195
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,940
Nic, give me oneexample of assholery

196
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:37,709
that would work in smashin the face of fucking rock.

197
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:40,312
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Smash,is a bit excessive.

198
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:43,281
I didn't wanna smash you.I just chucked it in the air

199
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,817
with the hopes that it wouldhit you in the temple.

200
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,919
I didn't wanna hit you hardenough to do any serious damage.

201
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,588
But, I did wannahit you hard enough

202
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,855
to get my point across

203
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,697
that you can't keep beingan asshole to people.

204
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,361
Ah, well, you still haven'ttold me what I did.

205
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:58,296
You know what you do, chase.

206
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,299
Okay, yeah, sure I do.

207
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:03,301
See?

208
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:05,371
Still in pain, Kurt?

209
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:09,841
Well, seeing as how I got hitlike two seconds ago,

210
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,110
yeah, Aidan, I'm stillin pain, but thanks.

211
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,079
Yeah, that's whatI'm here for, Dudeski.

212
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,780
Not to throw rocks at you,

213
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,650
but to ask if you're okay in theevent you do get hit by a rock.

214
00:10:22,154 --> 00:10:23,788
Okay.

215
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,391
So, there's kitty's coalitionand Sloan's salon.

216
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:28,960
Which kinda soundslike a brothel.

217
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:30,261
Both place are downtown,

218
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:32,330
so, that's like a 15minute walk from here.

219
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,666
Sigh.

220
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,334
I think you gotta be21 and over for Sloan's

221
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,869
because they serve alcohol.

222
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,238
Kitty's coalition is...

223
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:42,841
18 and over.

224
00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:48,246
Listen, yo!

225
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,416
Today, I was washing myhands in the bathroom,

226
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:54,285
and this urinalflushed by itself.

227
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,054
I was the only onein the bathroom.

228
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:58,723
And the urinal that flushedwasn't the one I was using.

229
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:01,826
And I wasn't even close to it.

230
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,897
Parker, I'm serious.

231
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,299
And this actually happened?

232
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:10,869
Yeah, it actually happened, man.

233
00:11:10,871 --> 00:11:12,771
I can't tell if you'remessing with me.

234
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:13,872
I'm not.

235
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,741
Weird shit is happening.

236
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,485
Ah, don't touch it, man.

237
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,020
Does, does it hurt?

238
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,755
Yeah, this shit hurts.

239
00:12:03,757 --> 00:12:05,323
And I know it wasn'there last night.

240
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,492
What do you think it is?

241
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:09,094
I don't know man, I mean,

242
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:11,296
maybe you scratchedyourself in the sleep?

243
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:14,299
No. How can you say no for sure?

244
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:17,001
If you did in your sleep,you wouldn't know.

245
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,404
I didn't do it in myfucking sleep, park.

246
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,874
This falls into thecategory of 'weird shit'

247
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,236
and I need youto acknowledge that.

248
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:28,346
Okay.

249
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,448
What do you knowabout your house?

250
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,017
Were there any crimescommitted here?

251
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,521
Not that I know of, why?

252
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:39,290
I'm just thinking about howit goes in the movies, man,

253
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,860
you know, weird stuffstarts happening.

254
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:44,462
And then you find outthe house that you living in

255
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,198
contains a secretportal to hell.

256
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,968
Or I don't know, the last family

257
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,770
that lived here was all murdered

258
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:54,072
under mysterious circumstances,that kinda thing.

259
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,077
Or,

260
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,780
you remembernightmare on elm street?

261
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,015
What if you're momkilled someone

262
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:07,819
and now their evil ghosthas come back to haunt you

263
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,954
as a form of retributionfor her sins?

264
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,199
You wanna turn the TV back on?The fuck?

265
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:24,102
Kenan, I need to know what youknow about this house.

266
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,237
What? Miles?

267
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,406
What do you thinkI'd know that you don't?

268
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,575
I don't know, do youknow anything about

269
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:32,377
any secret portals or

270
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,879
or vengeful spirits?Give me something.

271
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,117
Look, before youmock my suffering,

272
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:40,218
look at this shit.

273
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,854
How did you get that?

274
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:43,854
I don't know.

275
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,456
Looks like you scratchedyourself or something.

276
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,592
My nails are not that sharp.

277
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:51,329
I'm telling you this hassomething to do with the house.

278
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,298
Kenan, has anything weirdbeen happening to you?

279
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,067
Nope, not to my knowledge.

280
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:58,002
Seems like you'rethe prime target, miles.

281
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,004
Why is that?

282
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,374
And the mocking continues.

283
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,609
I had to.

284
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,411
Yeah, okay.

285
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:09,380
It's all fun and games untila motherfucker gets possessed.

286
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,622
Boy has lost his fucking mind.

287
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:26,965
You remember, when wewent into the kitchen,

288
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:29,234
because we thought someonehad broken into the house,

289
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:31,236
but it was really,just Kenan and Nia?

290
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,271
Yeah.

291
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,340
Sigh.

292
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,407
Well,

293
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,409
for a split second,

294
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,378
not even,

295
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,147
I thought...

296
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,016
I saw somethingelse in the kitchen.

297
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,485
What do you mean something else?

298
00:14:49,421 --> 00:14:50,521
It was so quick,

299
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,123
I don't even know how to,

300
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:53,590
I just,

301
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,628
I felt like I caught glimpseof something that was...

302
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,163
I thought I was going crazy,

303
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:00,805
that's why I didn't sayanything about it.

304
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,233
But, now...

305
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,444
Hey, ma?Question.

306
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:15,580
Hey, miles?Answer.

307
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,302
What do you knowabout this house?

308
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,686
Like, did you getone of those deals,

309
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,454
that was too good to be true,

310
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:25,290
cause something reallybad happened here?

311
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,925
Oh, boy!

312
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:30,028
No, I don't know what you'reexpecting to hear, miles.

313
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,362
The house is fairly new.

314
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:32,664
It's in a good neighborhood.

315
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:34,365
The crimes ratesare lower than low.

316
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:36,301
That's why we movedhere, doohickey.

317
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,237
Bop, leave a message please,

318
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:41,005
I promise I won'tget back to you.

319
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:44,976
No, I know that...

320
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:46,710
Since we've been here,

321
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:49,681
things have been kosher,but what about before?

322
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,683
The worst thing that happenedhere that I know of,

323
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:54,485
believe it or not, it's Mr.Huntly's cat going missing.

324
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,721
And they found it the same day.So, I...

325
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:58,990
Why are you askingme this, miles?

326
00:15:58,992 --> 00:16:01,492
You ever killanybody before, ma?

327
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,494
No, why would youeven ask me that?

328
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:05,129
- No.- Cause he's mental.

329
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,451
Cause I think I'm being hauntedby something in this house.

330
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sorry,

331
00:16:09,002 --> 00:16:10,335
did you say haunted?

332
00:16:10,337 --> 00:16:11,402
Don't listen to him, ma.

333
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:12,737
I'm telling the truth.

334
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,739
Things have been happeningto me at school,

335
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,441
then I woke up with this.

336
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,079
It looks like youscratched yourself.

337
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22,146
That's what I said.

338
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,648
No, you know what it could be?

339
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,648
An allergic reaction.

340
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,418
I used a different detergentto wash your clothes.

341
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,420
Why you still doingthis boy's laundry, ma?

342
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:30,588
He's about to be 18.

343
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,123
And you're about to be 23

344
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,458
yet you still live at home

345
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,094
with your mom.

346
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,395
Explain that to me.

347
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,163
You graduated from college,

348
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,166
you have a job,

349
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,135
why are you still here?

350
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,637
Go home, Roger?

351
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,207
Nia and I are in a processof getting our own spot.

352
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:50,375
And you...

353
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,377
Know this.

354
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:54,245
So, leap off my testicle.

355
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,613
So, apparently,I'm not sitting here.

356
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:56,681
Sorry, ma.

357
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,583
Well, back to what matters.

358
00:16:58,585 --> 00:17:01,152
Ma, I don't think thisis an allergic reaction.

359
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:03,287
I'm gonna give you somethingto put on it after dinner.

360
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,156
It really doesn't look that bad.

361
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:07,425
Er, this is just...

362
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,494
I gotta say this is delightful.

363
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,562
I'm being neglectedby my own family.

364
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,132
I just want the bothof you to know,

365
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,534
if anything happens to me,you're gonna be like,

366
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,169
"oh, man, maybe we should've

367
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:20,505
taken miles's concernsmore seriously.

368
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,106
If only wecan go back."

369
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,641
Well, by then itwill be too late,

370
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:25,443
and you have to livewith your mistake.

371
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,213
Pass the gravy, Kenan.

372
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,353
Two words, here it is,

373
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,489
over-dramatic.

374
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:41,225
Um... actuallythat's one word.

375
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,427
But, thanks for playing.

376
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,108
Yo!

377
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,810
My bad.

378
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:01,512
You can't be doingstuff like that, man.

379
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:03,481
My bad, I thought you heard me.

380
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,385
Pop tart?

381
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,153
No, I'm not really hungry.

382
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,254
Um.

383
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:11,823
Ah.

384
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,231
Yo?

385
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,632
What?

386
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,101
What are you doing?

387
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,135
Eating my pop tart.

388
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:27,171
Yeah, but, why are youchewing like that?

389
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,239
Like what?

390
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,143
You sound likea fucking giraffe.

391
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,513
I didn't realize I waschewing that loud.

392
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,849
Well, if you don'tknow, now you know.

393
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,817
I'm over here in my zone and

394
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,119
you messing up the flow.

395
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,188
Damn, my bad.

396
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,790
I'm mad you calledme a giraffe though.

397
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:48,659
Anyway,

398
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:51,229
you find anything yet?

399
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,501
Nope, there hasn't been amurder here in over 30 years.

400
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:57,702
30 years?

401
00:18:57,704 --> 00:18:59,137
30 years.

402
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,372
And even then, itwasn't really a murder.

403
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,407
It was a vehicularmanslaughter case.

404
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:04,509
Shit!

405
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,210
So, we got nothing to work with?

406
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:07,278
Nope.

407
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,516
I just asked...

408
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,354
There's no reason this shitshould be happening to me.

409
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:20,758
Okay, don't get mad.

410
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,694
I know that I saidbefore about possibly

411
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,196
seeing something in the kitchen.

412
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:27,632
But, I was thinking,

413
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:30,635
what if this was just mymind playing tricks on me?

414
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:32,837
You a flip floppingmotherfucker, you just said...

415
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,772
I know, I know.

416
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,441
But, what am I supposedto make of everything?

417
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,910
I mean this is a good house.

418
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:40,778
This is a good neighborhood.

419
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,446
I don't knowwhat's going on, miles.

420
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,315
Me either.

421
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,250
Okay, so...

422
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,920
Why don't you try and enjoythe next couple of days?

423
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,688
You got your birthday coming up,

424
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,889

425
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,291
fun shit!

426
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:55,660
Look,

427
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,662
maybe there is no haunting.

428
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,799
I don't get you at all, park.

429
00:20:01,801 --> 00:20:04,769
Now, every thing'sa hallucination?

430
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,671
I just want youto enjoy your birthday.

431
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,574
You wanna makesome more pop tarts?

432
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,509
I know you want to.

433
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,451
Miles.

434
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:22,220
Miles?

435
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,521
Mi...

436
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,592
Happy birthday, baby.

437
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:31,862
Make a wish.

438
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,771
Dang!He still here.

439
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,876
When you have timeto make me a cake?

440
00:20:45,878 --> 00:20:47,345
Don't worry about it.

441
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:48,446
This looks good.

442
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,847
Eat it.

443
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:52,250
For breakfast?

444
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,320
Youthful mother of mine,

445
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:57,555
embrace me.

446
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:12,036
Yo!

447
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,272
I love it!

448
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,741
Imma wear on my GQ tee.

449
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:18,309
You the "ma", ma.

450
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:31,555
Yes, miles. Yougot me something?

451
00:21:31,557 --> 00:21:33,624
You never give meanything for my birthday.

452
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,494
How cheap was it?

453
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,062
Just open it.

454
00:21:46,338 --> 00:21:48,606
I do enjoy Dunkin' donuts.

455
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,676
But, 10 dollars, that's it?

456
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:52,977
That's it?

457
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,645
Man, that's a good deal.

458
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,681
You get a dozen donuts.

459
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,482
You get a box of munchkins.

460
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,384
You got possibilities, man.

461
00:22:00,386 --> 00:22:02,653
High value.

462
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,956
Fine, thanks Kenan.

463
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,391
You're not welcome.

464
00:22:07,393 --> 00:22:09,627
Oh, I forgot to ask you, um...

465
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:11,629
Any supernaturaloccurrences last night?

466
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:14,999
Nope.

467
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:18,402
That's surprising, I expecteda full on possession by now.

468
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,104
Kenan, stop.

469
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:22,606
Argh...Mi-miles.

470
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,876
Asshole!

471
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:28,612
Argh! No!

472
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:35,553
Sorry, ma.

473
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:37,722
Not even subtle about it.

474
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,826
All right, let's takea trip downstairs.

475
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:43,961
There's lots of cards, youknow what that means.

476
00:22:43,963 --> 00:22:46,630
A lot of mullah, baby.

477
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,435
So, any more weird stuff?

478
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,871
Nope, for the lasttwo days, nothing.

479
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:55,873
See?

480
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,780
Happy day of birth,

481
00:23:02,782 --> 00:23:06,384
we got tobacco, scratchoffs and titties.

482
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,854
And boom.

483
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,422
What the fuck is this?

484
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:13,758
Strong, strong shit, Miley.

485
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,559
All I did was sniff thestuff and I'm buzzed.

486
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,130
I had you doingthe Harlem shake.

487
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:21,866
Come on, Dudeski,glug, glug, glug.

488
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:23,801
Don't be a littlewhore, chug that shit.

489
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,903
Oh, man, uh!

490
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,711
Whoa!Shit.

491
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,112
Now, whose readyfor some Booty's

492
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:37,548
on some Booty's on some Booty?

493
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:02,833
What you asking again?

494
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,970
Would you rather drinkpee flavored lemonade

495
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:07,638
or lemonade flavored pee?

496
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,775
I mean either way I lose.

497
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:13,711
Exactly, but it'sabout how you lose.

498
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:18,883
I don't know man, Imean, all right, so,

499
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:21,151
if I drink

500
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,220
pee flavored lemonade,

501
00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:25,256
yeah, it's lemonade,

502
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:27,658
but it still tasteslike pee, so,

503
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,780
there's really no differencefrom drinking actual pee.

504
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:34,932
But, if I drinklemonade flavored pee,

505
00:25:34,934 --> 00:25:38,068
yeah, it tastes like lemonade,but it's still pee.

506
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,737
You gotta make a choice.

507
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,307
Either way, you look at it,

508
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,909
urine is gonna be involved.

509
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,011
That's just a given.

510
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,679
But, it's up to you to do decide

511
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,548
whether or not youactually want to taste it.

512
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:55,019
I guess, I'll do it withthe lemonade flavored pee.

513
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:56,654
Ah, good, man.

514
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,657
Wha...

515
00:26:00,692 --> 00:26:01,792
What's this?

516
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:06,163
Did you get thisfrom the strip club?

517
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,266
Whoa, whoa, but how?

518
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,936
Don't question my ways, Brosiff.

519
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:13,103
That's kind of insanitary.

520
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,673
Mm, smells likefucking butterflies.

521
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,742
What do butterflies smell like?

522
00:26:22,714 --> 00:26:23,948
Wait, wait.

523
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:26,283
So,

524
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,219
fuck bitches get money.

525
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:33,691
Does that mean,fuck bitches like

526
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:35,326
have sex with bitches

527
00:26:35,328 --> 00:26:36,727
and get money?

528
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:39,897
Or is it like

529
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:41,131
forget bitches,

530
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,601
we don't need 'em,

531
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:45,669
and get money.

532
00:26:45,671 --> 00:26:48,205
I, I see, I alwaysthought it was like,

533
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:50,874
fuck bitches, likewe don't want 'em,

534
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:53,043
just focus on the cash flow.

535
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:54,979
Um.

536
00:26:54,981 --> 00:26:56,880
What, what, what?Wait, wait.

537
00:26:56,882 --> 00:26:58,315
What I think,

538
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,651
it's deliberately ambiguous.

539
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,186
It's like,

540
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,788
I hit a baby

541
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,358
with a chair.

542
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,894
Did you hear the baby usingthe chair as a weapon?

543
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,998
Or, did you hear the baby,

544
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,333
that just so happento have a chair.

545
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,972
I saw a woman with binoculars.

546
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,908
Did you see the womanwith your binoculars?

547
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,078
Or did you see that thewoman had binoculars?

548
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:30,948
That's good, that's good.

549
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:36,820
Mind fuck, Dudeski.

550
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,338
Yo, you know whatI could go for right now?

551
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:44,395
A Patti LaBelle,

552
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:45,829
sweet potato pie.

553
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,232
Yeah.

554
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:50,200
Yo, nobody's sleepingtoo late tomorrow

555
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:52,236
cause we're all goingout to lunch for little

556
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:54,738
post birthday repast.

557
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,774
Say, uh, 12:30 infront of the park?

558
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:59,209
Plan? Plan.

559
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,345
Nighty-night,hoe-bags.

560
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,954
Yo, tonight was dope.

561
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,223
Thanks.

562
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:16,193
Yeah, yep.My son is legal now.

563
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:23,200
But, you know what,

564
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,969
I still don't get why'd itall just stop like that.

565
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:30,140
Miles, let it go.

566
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:33,777
I can't. Oh, Parker, can youplease tell me how the fuck

567
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:36,113
you go from being justas convinced as I am

568
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:38,415
to now downplayingthe whole situation?

569
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:41,185
I don't wanna keep talkingabout this, all right?

570
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:43,721
Look, the weird shit is over,

571
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:46,190
if there was ever anyweird shit to begin with.

572
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:48,125
You're fine, youhad a good night,

573
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:49,326
it's Donzo, man.

574
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:51,161
Yo, all t he horrormovies you watch

575
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:53,130
and you still not into the game.

576
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:54,798
Er, you trynabrush everything off

577
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,300
and that's whenshit gets serious.

578
00:28:56,302 --> 00:28:57,801
Parker, come on.

579
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:02,106
I'll see you tomorrow.

580
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,175
Hopefully.

581
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,261
But, you gotta let meborrow 10 dollars.

582
00:29:57,263 --> 00:29:58,495
I don't gotta doanything, Aidan,

583
00:29:58,497 --> 00:29:59,997
you already owe me 10 dollars.

584
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:01,331
I'll pay you back.

585
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,900
Yeah, you can't askme for more money

586
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:04,368
when you haven't paidme back from before.

587
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,003
No, look at it like this,

588
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:08,572
if I borrow another 10dollars, I'll owe 20 dollars.

589
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:10,574
So, you'll getback even more money.

590
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:12,109
No, I'll loose more money

591
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:13,477
because you're notgonna pay me back.

592
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:16,246
Aidan, you still oweme five dollars.

593
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,529
Well, loan me another 5 andthen you'll be even with Kurt.

594
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:22,920
Man, chase is on some bullshit.

595
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:24,421
No! Still not picking up?

596
00:30:24,423 --> 00:30:26,957
This was his idea, how he gonnainvite somebody somewhere

597
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:28,425
and then not answer his phone?

598
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:29,425
You think he overslept?

599
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,395
Probably. Yo, whatis this guy doing?

600
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:33,363
I was waiting in thatpark for two hours,

601
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:34,598
cold as shit, my boy.

602
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,401
Shit.

603
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:39,937
Man, I give up!One of y'all call him.

604
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,406
Not it.

605
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,151
Look at this.

606
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,090
Oh, shit!Yeah.

607
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:02,059
Yeah, but nothing's real, right?

608
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:03,861
A fucking brand.

609
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:06,029
And listen to this.

610
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,367
I got this last night.

611
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:13,036
Happy birthday, miles.

612
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,072
Who is this?I don't know.

613
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:17,307
But, I know itwasn't any of them.

614
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:20,911
I got the voicemail at 10:42 P.M.

615
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:23,080
We were all walking atkitty's at that time.

616
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:24,481
I would've seen them do it.

617
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,484
Okay, look,

618
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,186
I believe you all right.

619
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:30,320
I'm sorry.

620
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:32,022
I believe you.

621
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:34,258
She's at work. Didyou tell your mom?

622
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,026
Kenan? He's at Nia's place.

623
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:38,061
Okay.

624
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,063
Let's get some foodin our systems

625
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:41,498
and then backto the drawing board.

626
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:49,039
I'm done with this shit!

627
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,642
Let's just go kick downDudeski's door.

628
00:31:51,644 --> 00:31:53,410
This is simply unacceptable!

629
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,081
Okay.

630
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,483
I gotta tell y'all something.

631
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:01,051
- No, seriously.- Here we go.

632
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:02,252
Ay, yeah, no...

633
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,553
Hold on, wait a minute.

634
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:06,023
Isn't that chase's house?

635
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,204
We were just with him, bro.

636
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,676
Did you catch what thosedetectives were saying?

637
00:32:28,246 --> 00:32:30,514
What? They said hewas ripped open.

638
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:35,352
From what I heard,his parents came home

639
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:37,354
and they found himstuffed in the closet.

640
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:42,392
No sign of a break in,nothing like that, so,

641
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:44,127
they're callingit a freak accident,

642
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:46,196
which makes absolutely no sense.

643
00:32:48,032 --> 00:32:49,333
This is crazy.

644
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,103
I don't like this, Parker.

645
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:57,107
I got that weird-ass voice mail,

646
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:58,408
I don't know who it's from.

647
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:00,477
I got this...

648
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,212
Whatever this is onthe back of my neck

649
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:03,480
and now chase is...

650
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,217
I knew this wasn't fucking done,

651
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,154
we've got to figure this out.

652
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:14,291
Yeah.

653
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,995
But, we can't doshit by ourselves.

654
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:23,567
Here, listen to it now.

655
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,385
What's this?

656
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:43,453
The thing that'sbeen following you,

657
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:44,453
is not human.

658
00:33:44,455 --> 00:33:48,392
It disguised as voiceto send you that message.

659
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:52,562
You see, those look like regularheadphones, but they're not.

660
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:57,067
They were designed toidentify demonic pitch.

661
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:59,669
That is what it soundslike in its real form.

662
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,140
Some scary shit, right?

663
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:04,808
So, we're dealing with a demon?

664
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:05,808
That's right.

665
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,145
You say you have a markon your neck, right?

666
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:09,746
Yeah.

667
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,750
That's the mark of the Gorenos.

668
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,354
Yes. The "Gorenos"?

669
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:18,822
Nothing but evil.

670
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:21,124
It's a demon from the unseen.

671
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,160
The unseen?

672
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:26,096
See there's heavenand there's hell

673
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:28,265
and in betweenthere is purgatory.

674
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,201
But, just above purgatory,

675
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:33,336
is the world of the unseen.

676
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:36,640
These evil entities,

677
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:38,542
they have their own sort of

678
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,244
agency if you will.

679
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:44,815
We're talking about evilthat has separated itself

680
00:34:44,817 --> 00:34:48,819
from the constraintsof hell and purgatory.

681
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,288
What does it want with me?

682
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,856
You're 18 now.

683
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:56,159
Your soul is in its prime.Its ready.

684
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:57,494
Ready for what?

685
00:34:57,496 --> 00:34:59,796
And a lot of people turn 18,

686
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:01,331
why does it want me?

687
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,701
Unlike other evilforces, the Gorenos

688
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:06,436
needs to be summoned.

689
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:09,539
But, I didn't summon it.

690
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,341
Yes, you didn't.

691
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,743
But, somebody did.

692
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,315
Somebody made a dealwith this thing.

693
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:22,252
And the reward was yoursoul when you turn 18.

694
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:27,357
Now, what's so appealingabout the Gorenos?

695
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,626
It can Grant you one wish,

696
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,262
in return...

697
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,131
For a soul.

698
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:36,533
So, why hasn't italready taken it?

699
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:37,734
Cause it needs you.

700
00:35:38,569 --> 00:35:41,204
This is a process.

701
00:35:41,206 --> 00:35:44,274
The Gorenos has it's ownway of doing things.

702
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:45,909
First,

703
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:47,677
it stalks you.

704
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,246
You won't even know it's there.

705
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,681
That's probably what it did

706
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:54,885
for those weeks leadingup to your birthday.

707
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:58,155
And then it makesits presence known,

708
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,457
it haunts you.

709
00:36:00,459 --> 00:36:04,194
That would explain the strangestuff that's been going down.

710
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,763
And finally,

711
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:08,732
it leaves a mark on you.

712
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,634
It owns you.

713
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,838
But, it's already leftits mark on me.

714
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,306
So, what does that mean?

715
00:36:16,308 --> 00:36:17,574
The good news,

716
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:19,309
well not good news.

717
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:22,245
But, the upside, if youwanna call it a upside,

718
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:24,814
is that its gonna letyou live for a while.

719
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:29,786
So, it can feed off your soul.Why?

720
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:31,555
Did the Gorenos kill chase?

721
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:32,889
Almost definitely.

722
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:34,191
But, how?

723
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:37,327
It uses your body as a host.

724
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:40,263
And it feeds on yoursoul at night,

725
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:42,832
which gives it strengthto go out and kill.

726
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:46,636
This thing gets off on carnage.

727
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:50,473
That's what the people whocall for it don't realize.

728
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:53,610
The only reasonthat it needs a soul,

729
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:55,879
is to have something to feed on.

730
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,648
When it kills,

731
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,484
it uses so much of its energy,

732
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:04,287
that it has to replenish.

733
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,856
And that's where you come in.

734
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:11,394
Basically, you area nutritious meal.

735
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,997
And it's gonna keep ondoing what its doing

736
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:16,566
until it has nothingleft to feed on.

737
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:18,802
And by that point...

738
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,472
I'll be dead.

739
00:37:22,474 --> 00:37:23,873
How is it choosing its victims?

740
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:27,377
It has dibs on anyone thatmiles come in contact with.

741
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,846
Me? Even you?

742
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:32,616
Not so much, it preferthe younger flesh.

743
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:34,417
But,

744
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,719
if you're virgin,

745
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:37,654
you will live, unless,

746
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,258
you have been offered directly

747
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,293
to the Gorenos. Whoa,whoa, whoa, wait.

748
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:45,462
Virgins are really spared?

749
00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:46,997
That's like an actual thing?

750
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,966
So, I'm good then.

751
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:57,040
Sorry, uh, that wasreally inappropriate.

752
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:01,511
So, how do we stop it?

753
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,481
Give me some time.

754
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:06,783
A pact with theGorenos is strong,

755
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,618
but I'm going to seewhat I can find out.

756
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,720
What am I supposedto do in the mean time?

757
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:12,522
Here's a suggestion,

758
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,891
find out who fuckedyou over and why.

759
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:17,861
We'll be in touch.

760
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:20,830
You guys got my information,thanks for reaching out.

761
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:22,565
Thank you for beingwho you said you were.

762
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,670
I really do wannahelp you, all right?

763
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:28,838
And listen,

764
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,441
you still have time.

765
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:35,312
That's the part youcannot lose sight of.

766
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:37,847
The Gorenos feeds at night,

767
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:40,016
when you are sleeping.

768
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:42,085
That's when you'reat your weakest.

769
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,054
So, don't go to sleep.

770
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,901
Yo,

771
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,537
the voice mail is gone.

772
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:02,872
It was on here and nowit's not on here!

773
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,775
Fuck, man!

774
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:08,745
Yo, who would give meup to a fucking demon?

775
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:10,847
Ugh, that's the golden question!

776
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,682
I'm a nice guy, right?

777
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:13,950
I don't have beef with nobody.

778
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:15,352
You don't.

779
00:39:18,989 --> 00:39:20,090
Was it you?

780
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:22,959
Yes, miles,

781
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,527
it was me.

782
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,463
Motherfucker, I didn'tsummon no demon!

783
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:27,964
Are you fucking cross faded?

784
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:35,438
Oh, shit!

785
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:37,140
What?

786
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:39,409
No, "oh, shit!",the 'o.S.' Factor.

787
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:40,710
What?

788
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,579
Remember, the 'o.S.' Factor?

789
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:44,047
That's what separatesthe good horror movies

790
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,047
from the shitty ones.

791
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,117
That moment, that makesyou go, "oh, shit"?

792
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,386
And what aboutthe 'o.S.' Factor?

793
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:51,788
This is the real life caseof the 'o.S.' Factor.

794
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,690
I think I know who set you up.

795
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:55,658
Who?

796
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,726
Kenan!

797
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,063
What makes you say Kenan?

798
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:01,931
Now, I could be totally off,

799
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:05,635
but if my observational skillsare as good as I think they are,

800
00:40:05,637 --> 00:40:07,537
all signs point to Kenan.

801
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:09,839
I mean, when he is notminimizing your turmoil,

802
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:11,875
he is blatantly ignoring it.

803
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:14,544
And he refuses to let anyoneelse to believe you either.

804
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,415
Guilt disguised as contempt!

805
00:40:29,996 --> 00:40:30,895
Who is it?

806
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:33,763
Open the fucking door, Kenan.

807
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,576
Yo, you got a fucking problem?

808
00:40:50,881 --> 00:40:52,549
Did you summon the Gorenos?

809
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,654
I'm gonna take thatlong pause as a yes.

810
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,873
What do you knowabout the Gorenos?

811
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,575
What do you knowabout the Gorenos?

812
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:22,078
How'd you find out?

813
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,148
You're good actor, Kenan.

814
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,517
You're good at shit.

815
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,620
Why would you makea deal with that?

816
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:32,755
It's complex, man.

817
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,858
Nah, it seems prettycut and dry to me.

818
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,093
Look,

819
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:39,162
I know we've had ourdiscrepancies, but,

820
00:41:39,164 --> 00:41:41,264
goddamn, Kenan, I'mstill your brother.

821
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,233
Why'd you do it?

822
00:41:43,235 --> 00:41:44,601
I didn't think it would work.

823
00:41:44,603 --> 00:41:46,002
That's not what I asked you.

824
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,904
Why did you do it?

825
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:48,904
I'm sorry, miles.

826
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:51,774
Sorry is not gonna protectmy fucking soul, Kenan.

827
00:41:52,877 --> 00:41:54,210
I was 16, man.

828
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,948
You remember when Nia and Igot in that accident?

829
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:01,117
One of my biking gothit by the pickup truck.

830
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,888
Nia was a fucking vegetable.

831
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,291
I just messed up my wrist and...

832
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,561
She slammed her headin the sidewalk.

833
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,231
They declared her brain dead.

834
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,301
I got to go homethat night, man.

835
00:42:18,303 --> 00:42:19,636
She didn't.

836
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:22,772
Her parent's wanted tokeep her on life support,

837
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:24,641
but there is norecovering from that.

838
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:27,176
I had to bring her back.

839
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,983
I remember, they did allthose stories on her.

840
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:36,786
She just woke up one day,and she was fine, right?

841
00:42:38,622 --> 00:42:39,689
Yeah.

842
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:43,092
I always wondered about that.

843
00:42:43,094 --> 00:42:44,294
Now, you know what happened.

844
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:46,930
But, Kenan,

845
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:49,098
here's the part thatyou overlooked,

846
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,100
death is inevitable.

847
00:42:51,102 --> 00:42:52,902
Everyone has their time to die,

848
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,071
and Nia's time wasat that hospital!

849
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:57,206
You fucked with thatand you shouldn't have.

850
00:42:58,609 --> 00:42:59,776
You don't havethe right to decide

851
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:00,843
who lives and who doesn't.

852
00:43:00,845 --> 00:43:02,712
I was 16...Exactly!

853
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:04,213
You were 16!

854
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:07,016
You were old enough tounderstand what you were doing.

855
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,955
How did you even know howto summon the Gorenos?

856
00:43:11,957 --> 00:43:13,222
I found everything online.

857
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:17,627
That's just disturbing.

858
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,234
It came into our room one night.

859
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,237
It was this...

860
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,435
I can't even describe it.

861
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,679
But, I asked it to bringNia back to life.

862
00:43:40,751 --> 00:43:42,986
All the friends you have,all the people you know,

863
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:45,254
I didn't choose you per Se.And you choose me?

864
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,204
The Gorenos saw yousleeping and it...

865
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:50,660
Implied that

866
00:43:50,662 --> 00:43:52,795
it would be interestedin you when you got older.

867
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,097
And I said okay.

868
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:57,300
All right, cause thatmakes it so much better!

869
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,936
Also, why would you bringit in to our room?

870
00:43:59,938 --> 00:44:01,971
Why would you putme at risk like that?

871
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,407
Obviously, I wasn't concernedwith logistics, okay,

872
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:06,075
I wanted to act fast.

873
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,679
Anyway, the next day,

874
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,848
Nia was fine.

875
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:14,150
And everyone was sayingit was a medical miracle.

876
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:16,853
I... I'm sorry, miles.

877
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,656
You sacrificed me

878
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:21,924
in order to bringback your girlfriend?

879
00:44:21,926 --> 00:44:23,893
And then you didn't evengive me a heads up,

880
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:26,362
even after I told you

881
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:28,031
what was going on.

882
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:30,066
You trivializedthe entire thing.

883
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,370
You think I wasn'tgonna catch on?

884
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,708
Look, I don't expectyou to help me.

885
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,211
Actually, even if youoffered to help,

886
00:44:42,213 --> 00:44:44,047
I'd tell you to gofuck yourself.

887
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,451
Just so you know,the Gorenos has big plans.

888
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,888
You know why it wants me?

889
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,256
It wants to feed on me

890
00:44:53,258 --> 00:44:55,324
because my soul is asource of nourishment.

891
00:44:55,326 --> 00:44:56,993
This thing is a killer.

892
00:44:56,995 --> 00:45:00,763
And after it kills, it needsme to refill itself back up.

893
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:05,201
It already killed chase,

894
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,071
it's gonna kill again.

895
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,908
And I don't evenknow how to stop it.

896
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,197
Are you gonna tellmom about this?

897
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,329
So, did you tell your mom?

898
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:07,897
She's working late tonight.

899
00:46:07,899 --> 00:46:09,165
Did you call her?

900
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:10,967
I've been trying,but her phone's off.

901
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:14,871
And honestly, she's notgonna believe me anyway.

902
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:17,073
What about the mark?What about chase?

903
00:46:17,075 --> 00:46:19,308
Kenan has her convincedthat I'm crazy, man.

904
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,043
He knows how to absorb himself.

905
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:24,247
Just like thefucking movies, yo.

906
00:46:24,249 --> 00:46:26,149
Either the adults are Mia,

907
00:46:26,151 --> 00:46:28,851
or they refuse the accept theexistence of supernatural.

908
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,353
Preach.

909
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,990
So, no news on howto break the pact?

910
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:35,892
We can't just have an exorcism?

911
00:46:35,894 --> 00:46:38,361
Nope, this isn'treally a possession,

912
00:46:38,363 --> 00:46:41,164
it's more of a bodily draining.

913
00:46:45,836 --> 00:46:47,003
So, what do we do?

914
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:48,204
I know what we don't do,

915
00:46:48,206 --> 00:46:50,072
we don't go to sleep.

916
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:51,841
What's that shit Nas said?

917
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:54,510
"I never sleep coz sleepis the cousin of death."

918
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:56,345
If I'm asleep, I'm weak.

919
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:58,214
And if I'm weak,it's snack time.

920
00:46:58,216 --> 00:47:00,516
So, we just gotta stay up.

921
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:03,486
Well, technicallyI could go to sleep.

922
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,856
But, I won't.

923
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:08,591
Thank you.

924
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:11,828
And actually speakingof snack time,

925
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,563
I think we needa little incentive

926
00:47:13,565 --> 00:47:15,298
for pulling an all nighter.

927
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:52,235
Parker?

928
00:47:52,502 --> 00:47:53,636
Parker!

929
00:47:56,306 --> 00:47:58,608
Exactly. Oh, shit.

930
00:47:58,610 --> 00:47:59,876
What time is it?

931
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:03,145
1:32. In the morning?

932
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:04,213
Yeah.

933
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:08,484
Guess that sugaroverload was a bit much.

934
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,455
I don't even know.How do you feel?

935
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,292
Wait,

936
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:19,061
I was sleeping, it got me.

937
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,930
It fed? Whatit feels like.

938
00:48:20,932 --> 00:48:22,298
And if it fed,

939
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,233
then it's out there again.

940
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:25,968
And you rememberwhat Haywood said,

941
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:28,504
anyone who comes in contactwith me is up for grabs.

942
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,908
It already got chase.

943
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,177
Whose next?

944
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:37,179
I'm assuming it's goingafter our friend group.

945
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:38,915
I know Kurt's still a virgin.

946
00:48:38,917 --> 00:48:40,116
But, reg isn't.

947
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:41,584
And I'm pretty sureAidan isn't either.

948
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:44,020
Since you're morepositive about reg,

949
00:48:44,022 --> 00:48:45,554
let's start with him.

950
00:48:50,961 --> 00:48:52,561
Reg, what up, miles?

951
00:48:52,563 --> 00:48:54,096
Where are you right now?

952
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,065
I went on a walk.

953
00:48:56,067 --> 00:48:57,133
I'm at the park.

954
00:48:57,135 --> 00:48:58,701
What are you goingon a walk for?

955
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:00,503
It's almost two in the morning.

956
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:02,505
I ain't been sleeping, man.

957
00:49:02,507 --> 00:49:04,240
I try to block it out, but,

958
00:49:04,242 --> 00:49:06,208
I keep thinking about chase.

959
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,376
I just been going on these walks

960
00:49:07,378 --> 00:49:09,145
trying to clear myhead, then I go home.

961
00:49:09,147 --> 00:49:11,547
Reg, I tried to tellyou guys sooner,

962
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:13,716
but you gotta comeover my house.

963
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:16,152
Listen, I knowwhat killed chase.

964
00:49:16,154 --> 00:49:17,520
And I know that it's after you

965
00:49:17,522 --> 00:49:18,988
and potentially Aidan.

966
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:20,089
What are you talking about?

967
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:21,590
I'm talking about the Gorenos.

968
00:49:21,592 --> 00:49:23,025
That's what it's called.

969
00:49:23,027 --> 00:49:25,027
It's a demon from theworld of the unseen.

970
00:49:25,029 --> 00:49:27,029
Look, it's a really long story,

971
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:29,598
but, the shorter versionis that it's feeding on my

972
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,701
soul and going outand killing my friends

973
00:49:31,703 --> 00:49:35,004
cause that's what it doesand it's fucking evil!

974
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:37,073
Sounds like you haven't beengetting no sleep either.

975
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:38,374
Reg, I'm serious.

976
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:40,209
Miles, my boy,

977
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:42,745
there's no demon tryingto kill me, all right?

978
00:49:42,747 --> 00:49:44,613
And even if there wasa demon out here,

979
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:47,016
why would it be after me?I ain't do nothing.

980
00:49:47,018 --> 00:49:48,651
Cause that's what demons do.

981
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:50,486
They got an appetitefor mutilation.

982
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,254
They'll kill anybody,fuck the motive.

983
00:49:53,223 --> 00:49:54,991
Look,

984
00:49:54,993 --> 00:49:56,993
try to get some rest, all right?

985
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:58,294
I think you need itmore than I do.

986
00:49:58,296 --> 00:50:00,529
Regs, no, no, no, no, no, no!

987
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,734
Well, where is he? Fuck!He thinks I'm crazy.

988
00:50:04,736 --> 00:50:06,502
Let's go. He's at the park.

989
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:12,041
Oh, no! What's going on?

990
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:14,777
Miles, wake up!

991
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:16,712
Miles, wake up!

992
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:18,280
What the hell are you doing?

993
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:21,450
You passed out. What happened?

994
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:26,255
I feel weak. Want meto get you some water?

995
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:27,423
No, we gotta save regs.

996
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:29,258
Stay here, takeit easy, I'll go.

997
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,493
Parker. Parker, what?

998
00:50:30,495 --> 00:50:32,061
It's not gonna doanything to me.

999
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:34,530
You said you feel weak,just stay here and relax.

1000
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:37,066
Don't go to sleep, but relax.

1001
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:39,301
If he is not at thepark, check his house.

1002
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:28,344
That's the imprint.

1003
00:52:28,346 --> 00:52:31,780
Listen, I don't care what thenews report say, it's all wrong.

1004
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:33,549
Chase didn't diein a freak accident,

1005
00:52:33,551 --> 00:52:36,285
and reg wasn't killedin an animal attack.

1006
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:37,453
I believe you, okay.

1007
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,289
Every thing is justtoo close together

1008
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,224
to be written offas tragic coincidence.

1009
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:44,293
No, Kurt,

1010
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:46,395
you should be safesince you're a virgin.

1011
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:49,198
Aidan, I knew you hada little thing with Nicky,

1012
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,467
but I didn't know if youguys actually did it or not.

1013
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:53,269
Yeah, we did.

1014
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:56,605
I'm not a virgin either, miles.

1015
00:52:56,607 --> 00:52:58,174
What?Since when?

1016
00:52:58,176 --> 00:52:59,408
Since I got togetherwith Malerey.

1017
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:00,509
Are you...

1018
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:01,944
Kurt, I asked you about that,

1019
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:03,379
you said you guysdidn't do anything.

1020
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:04,379
First time you asked, we didn't.

1021
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:05,948
But, we got togetheragain and it happened.

1022
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:07,750
And you're both targets now.

1023
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:09,552
Why is it only afterpeople who had sex?

1024
00:53:09,554 --> 00:53:11,487
Because, sex out ofwedlock is a sin.

1025
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:14,290
Therefore, yoursouls are impure,

1026
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:16,392
which is very appealingto a murderous demon.

1027
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:19,395
So, what now?

1028
00:53:19,397 --> 00:53:21,363
Now, we stick together.

1029
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:23,966
Yeah, you guys should stayat my place tonight.

1030
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:26,268
By the way,

1031
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:28,938
I'm sure you know this already,

1032
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,980
but that was a reallyreally sick thing...

1033
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,877
What your brother did.

1034
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:36,879
Bringing the Gorenoshere and everything.

1035
00:53:37,447 --> 00:53:38,614
Yeah, that...

1036
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:42,618
Yeah, what a dick move.

1037
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,356
Are y'all gonna cook?

1038
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:50,292
For real?Hmm mm.

1039
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:54,897
Hey baby, you want some lasagna?Kenan and Nia are cooking.

1040
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:58,300
No, thanks, but I would liketo talk to you about something.

1041
00:53:58,635 --> 00:53:59,902
Sure.

1042
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:01,403
I want you to know,

1043
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:02,738
your elder son,

1044
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:04,306
your first born child,

1045
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:07,476
Kenan Lamar Grantis a demon worshiper.

1046
00:54:07,478 --> 00:54:08,711
Oh, boy! He's a what?

1047
00:54:08,713 --> 00:54:11,580
Yeah, oh, boy!

1048
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,949
When Kenan and Niagot into that accident,

1049
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:15,684
Nia, was brain dead.

1050
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:17,652
Do you know the odds

1051
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:19,688
of regaining brainfunction after that?

1052
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:22,358
They're not very high.

1053
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,460
Which means,Nia was basically dead.

1054
00:54:25,028 --> 00:54:26,795
But, what happened?

1055
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,697
She came back to lifeand you know why?

1056
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:32,635
It wasn't some miraculous event,

1057
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:35,037
Kenan summoned the demoncalled the Gorenos.

1058
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:37,706
And it gave him Nia backin return for my soul.

1059
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:38,874
What is he talking about?

1060
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:40,609
You're not supposedto be here, Nia.

1061
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:41,744
Miles. That's whatI'm talking about.

1062
00:54:41,746 --> 00:54:43,012
No, it's true.

1063
00:54:43,014 --> 00:54:45,347
Ma, didn't I tell youhe was gonna do this?

1064
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:46,815
Anything to make it believable.

1065
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,851
This is real!

1066
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:51,887
It left its symbol on me.

1067
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:53,622
It's right there!

1068
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,024
You think I'm making this up?

1069
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:57,559
It's all online.

1070
00:54:57,561 --> 00:54:59,495
The stuff aboutthe Gorenos is fake.

1071
00:54:59,497 --> 00:55:01,363
Just like slender man.

1072
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:03,699
Just some stuff to scare kids.

1073
00:55:03,701 --> 00:55:05,034
Miles, you're takingthis too far.

1074
00:55:05,036 --> 00:55:07,670
No, I'm not, Kenan. You needto own up to what you did.

1075
00:55:07,672 --> 00:55:09,505
Nia should be dead!

1076
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:12,041
Okay, look that is thesecond time you said that,

1077
00:55:12,043 --> 00:55:13,876
you don't evenstop it! Wanna believe!

1078
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:15,544
Cause listen to you, demons?

1079
00:55:15,546 --> 00:55:17,613
Demon!Okay.

1080
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:20,482
In what world am I supposedto believe any of that?

1081
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:22,785
No! You need to stop.

1082
00:55:22,787 --> 00:55:24,520
You need to wake up.

1083
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:27,489
Things are happeningthat defy logic, all right?

1084
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:30,392
Every thing I'mtelling you is true.

1085
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:31,960
But, if you're still gonnatake Kenan's side,

1086
00:55:31,962 --> 00:55:33,762
you're fucking stupid!

1087
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:36,565
Don't you ever in your lifetalk to me like that!

1088
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:41,103
Unclench your jaw.

1089
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,909
Ma, I'm sorryfor cursing at you,

1090
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:49,378
I'm sorry for yelling.

1091
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,081
But I'm not sorryfor what I said.

1092
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:53,349
Oh, really?

1093
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:58,620
Look, everything happensfor a reason.

1094
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:00,055
We might not haveall the answers.

1095
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:01,457
But, we don't need them

1096
00:56:01,459 --> 00:56:03,459
and that's the partyou need to remember.

1097
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:06,628
Kenan and Nia werehurt real bad.

1098
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:09,798
But, by the grace of god,they are both here.

1099
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,280
They're both well and we're notgonna talk about this any more.

1100
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,740
Miles,

1101
00:56:17,742 --> 00:56:20,109
I'm sorry about chase and reg,

1102
00:56:20,111 --> 00:56:23,679
I am. I don't even knowwhat to say, it's terrible.

1103
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:28,984
You are angry andrightfully so, all right?

1104
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:32,054
But, you do not have a rightto take that out on all of us,

1105
00:56:32,056 --> 00:56:34,723
especially Nia!You owe her an apology.

1106
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,559
I knew this was gonna happen.

1107
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,128
To be clear thisis not optional.

1108
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:43,532
I'm sorry.

1109
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:47,970
I'm sorry Kenan did this.

1110
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:55,711
Cursing at me like that.

1111
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:57,846
Nia, I'm sorry. Youdidn't do anything.

1112
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,933
I can't fall asleep.

1113
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,835
If I go to sleep,we're all at risk.

1114
00:57:19,837 --> 00:57:22,671
Um, not all of us.

1115
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:25,908
Yes, Parker, your virginityhas made you untouchable, yes.

1116
00:57:30,046 --> 00:57:32,014
I'm all in for thegroup bonding sesh,

1117
00:57:32,016 --> 00:57:33,982
really, I'm truly,I'm lovin' it, but,

1118
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:35,951
you do realize wecan't stay attached

1119
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,986
to wieners forever, right?

1120
00:57:37,988 --> 00:57:39,655
Whoa, obviously, but,

1121
00:57:39,657 --> 00:57:42,691
for right now, it's united westay and divided we die.

1122
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:45,093
If anything happens, at leastwe got each other's backs.

1123
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,834
Kurt?

1124
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:53,769
Kurt?

1125
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:58,006
Aidan?

1126
00:57:59,909 --> 00:58:01,243
Yo, miles,

1127
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:03,178
you wanna get somethingto eat from downstairs?

1128
00:58:04,848 --> 00:58:06,181
We should stay here.

1129
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:07,983
It's just going downstairs.

1130
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,985
We'd be right back.You know you're hungry.

1131
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:20,930
What's up?

1132
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:24,132
You were in the bathroomthis whole time?

1133
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:26,134
Oh, no. Yeah, why?

1134
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,638
It's locked.

1135
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,940
Aidan? Kurt?

1136
00:58:31,942 --> 00:58:33,262
If you can hear me,say something.

1137
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:36,044
Help!

1138
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:37,646
Parker, where you going?

1139
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:39,248
Really?

1140
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:41,750
Aidan? Kurt?

1141
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:44,119
Help!

1142
00:58:53,162 --> 00:58:54,263
You all right, man?

1143
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:56,832
Whoa, what happened?

1144
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:58,000
You passed out, man.

1145
00:58:58,835 --> 00:58:59,902
Again?

1146
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:02,804
Where's Kurt?

1147
00:59:02,806 --> 00:59:05,040
He's down the hallway,he's about to call 911.

1148
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:07,676
Kurt, we're good, he's awake.

1149
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:16,785
I feel like nobody's parentsare ever home for this shit.

1150
00:59:16,787 --> 00:59:18,720
Right? What the fuck?

1151
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,622
This is gotta be child neglect.

1152
00:59:20,624 --> 00:59:22,925
No! I still feel weak, man.

1153
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:25,027
Then, that thing isprobably getting stronger.

1154
00:59:25,029 --> 00:59:26,895
Yo,

1155
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,298
can you dream whenyou're unconscious?

1156
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,599
I don't know.

1157
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,200
I don't think so.

1158
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:33,200
Cause when you pass out,

1159
00:59:33,202 --> 00:59:35,304
it shuts off the part ofyour brain needed for sleep.

1160
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:38,974
What?

1161
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:40,909
I'm educated.

1162
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,011
Did you have a dream?

1163
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:46,848
I don't even wantto get into it, okay.

1164
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:49,084
But, just know, it wasvery unpleasant.

1165
00:59:50,153 --> 00:59:52,254
And Parker, youwere fucking pussy.

1166
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,690
I'm sorry?

1167
00:59:54,692 --> 00:59:57,059
I'm just gladthat shit wasn't real.

1168
00:59:57,061 --> 01:00:00,062
You know, excludingmy being a pussy,

1169
01:00:00,064 --> 01:00:03,065
this dream can meanone or two things.

1170
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:05,968
Either you just had aa final destination moment,

1171
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:07,903
where you envisionedthe inevitable,

1172
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,638
or,

1173
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,740
the Gorenos is on thatFreddy Krueger shit.

1174
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:13,674
Invading your thoughts,

1175
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:15,844
using your nightmaresto fuck with you, man.

1176
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:20,315
It can't do that, can it?

1177
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:21,650
I don't know.

1178
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:26,355
All right, it's...

1179
01:00:27,323 --> 01:00:29,658
2:45.

1180
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,960
You guys gotta make your exitbefore my mom gets here.

1181
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,161
Which gives us until

1182
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:34,863
6:30.

1183
01:00:34,865 --> 01:00:36,765
And by then the sun will be up,

1184
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:39,167
and the Gorenos can't doshit during the day time.

1185
01:00:39,169 --> 01:00:41,103
So, for these next few hours,

1186
01:00:41,105 --> 01:00:43,639
we gotta tough it out.And please...

1187
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:46,174
Don't let me fallasleep or faint.

1188
01:00:46,176 --> 01:00:48,010
I don't think we canstop you from fainting, miles.

1189
01:00:48,012 --> 01:00:49,077
Yeah!

1190
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:50,345
We'll just be alert.

1191
01:00:50,347 --> 01:00:52,981
And if you can't preventthe act itself,

1192
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:54,750
try and wake me upas soon as possible.

1193
01:00:54,752 --> 01:00:56,818
Uh, you see, it's stillnot that easy.

1194
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,887
Kurt! Just go with it.When a person...

1195
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:01,056
Yes and okay.

1196
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:07,763
Connect four tournament?

1197
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:56,178
I know what you're trying to do.

1198
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:59,181
But, you and I both knowI'm not your type, all right.

1199
01:02:01,851 --> 01:02:03,351
You can't touch this.

1200
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:09,191
So, personally, I think you'rewasting your time and mine.

1201
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:13,328
You know what I mean?

1202
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:16,732
Cut this shit.

1203
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,861
You ain't finishedscaring me off?

1204
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:48,363
And I hate to let you down,

1205
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:50,866
but you ain't the first demonthat's been after me,

1206
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:55,137
you old fuckface.

1207
01:03:12,321 --> 01:03:14,256
This weather is bipolar.

1208
01:03:25,868 --> 01:03:27,502
I know how to stop the Gorenos.

1209
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:30,839
Are you serious?

1210
01:03:30,841 --> 01:03:32,474
How?What do I have to do?

1211
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:35,210
It is easier said than done.

1212
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:36,812
But, you have to kill the person

1213
01:03:36,814 --> 01:03:39,114
that summoned itin the first place

1214
01:03:39,116 --> 01:03:42,150
and you have to re-kill thesoul that was brought to life.

1215
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:45,153
They don't tell you this online.

1216
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:46,822
But, it took seven trips

1217
01:03:46,824 --> 01:03:49,524
to seven different librariesto find this book.

1218
01:03:56,566 --> 01:03:58,834
So, I have to kill

1219
01:03:58,836 --> 01:04:00,068
Kenan and Nia?

1220
01:04:00,070 --> 01:04:03,271
Well, it's a little moreintense than that.

1221
01:04:03,273 --> 01:04:04,940
You have to use a knife

1222
01:04:04,942 --> 01:04:07,843
and you have to stabthem in the heart.

1223
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:09,511
That's the only waythis would work.

1224
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,047
Why does it haveto be in the heart?

1225
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:15,617
The only way to guaranteethat Kenan and Nia

1226
01:04:15,619 --> 01:04:17,285
can't be brought back,

1227
01:04:17,287 --> 01:04:19,321
it has to be in the heart.

1228
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:23,258
I kinda feel bad though.

1229
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:24,960
Nia didn't even do anything.

1230
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:26,895
Well,

1231
01:04:26,897 --> 01:04:28,463
you didn't do anything,

1232
01:04:28,465 --> 01:04:29,965
neither did your friends.

1233
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:32,334
But, y'all had tosuffer, am I right?

1234
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,469
Look,

1235
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:36,471
I am acutely aware of that.

1236
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,307
This is a shitty situation.

1237
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,878
But, at the same time,

1238
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,414
I don't know if I'm capableof killing someone.

1239
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:49,985
Even if it's the person who hadno regard for my own life.

1240
01:04:49,987 --> 01:04:53,922
Miles, I understand whereyou're coming from completely.

1241
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,892
This is some heavy stuff.

1242
01:04:56,894 --> 01:05:00,228
But, killing those two isthe only way to end this.

1243
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:04,666
If there's no Kenan,there's no Gorenos.

1244
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:07,135
He's the only reasonwhy it's here.

1245
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:11,539
And you're sure thisis the way to do it?

1246
01:05:11,541 --> 01:05:13,475
It says it right here,doesn't it?

1247
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:19,347
I can't do it.

1248
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,184
I can't do something like that.

1249
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,021
That's my brother.

1250
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:27,689
"Violence begets violence."

1251
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:30,158
That was Dr. king.

1252
01:05:30,693 --> 01:05:32,260
And some times,

1253
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:35,964
"you have to pick the gun upto put the gun down."

1254
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:38,466
That was Malcolm X.

1255
01:05:39,335 --> 01:05:42,103
Haywood, look,

1256
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:45,573
I'm beyond gratefulfor all your help.

1257
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:49,511
But, I can't do it.

1258
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:50,911
I'm sorry.

1259
01:05:50,913 --> 01:05:54,082
Uh, maybe there isanother way to stop it.

1260
01:05:56,218 --> 01:05:57,419
And if not?

1261
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:00,221
I don't know.

1262
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:03,491
But, I'm not a murderer.

1263
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:07,095
Miles, I'm going to giveit to you straight.

1264
01:06:07,097 --> 01:06:08,563
This is not the right time

1265
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:11,132
to become morallyafflicted, all right?

1266
01:06:13,002 --> 01:06:15,670
That thing is feedingon your soul.

1267
01:06:15,672 --> 01:06:17,672
You understand what I'm saying?

1268
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:21,009
You are getting weaker,

1269
01:06:21,011 --> 01:06:23,611
but it's getting stronger.

1270
01:06:23,613 --> 01:06:25,680
You said you'vebeen fainting, right?

1271
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:30,485
And that's only the tipof the pencil, believe me.

1272
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:33,521
Miles,

1273
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:37,993
your friends are dying.

1274
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:41,129
You are dying.

1275
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:45,500
It's not gonna stop unless

1276
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:48,203
you do something about it.

1277
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:53,234
Hey.

1278
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:56,504
Miles, look.

1279
01:07:56,506 --> 01:07:58,473
I know I'm not yourfavorite person right now.

1280
01:07:58,475 --> 01:08:00,775
I get it, but...

1281
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:04,179
Have you tried to empathize?

1282
01:08:04,181 --> 01:08:06,781
Nia is my fucking everything!

1283
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:09,250
I've been in love withthat girl since I was 10.

1284
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:11,453
Why would I let her die

1285
01:08:11,455 --> 01:08:14,322
when there's an opportunity,a clear opportunity

1286
01:08:14,324 --> 01:08:16,357
for me to prevent it?

1287
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:17,625
You gonna sit thereand tell me you

1288
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:19,194
wouldn't have donethe same thing

1289
01:08:19,196 --> 01:08:20,728
if it happened tosomeone that you loved.

1290
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:23,164
I don't think you realize this,

1291
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:25,400
but the more youdefend yourself,

1292
01:08:25,402 --> 01:08:26,568
the more fucked up you sound.

1293
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:27,802
What more can I say?

1294
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:30,772
I'm sorrythat your friends are...

1295
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,509
Yeah.

1296
01:08:34,511 --> 01:08:36,511
I'm sorrythe Gorenos wanted you.

1297
01:08:38,514 --> 01:08:39,681
It is what it is.

1298
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:42,183
Just try not to think about it.

1299
01:08:42,185 --> 01:08:43,418
Try not to...

1300
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:46,654
Yo,

1301
01:08:46,656 --> 01:08:48,356
you're a fucking dick, man!

1302
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:52,894
Are you gonna be home tonight?

1303
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:56,131
Why?

1304
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,334
Wait. No.

1305
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:01,703
Nia's coming over.

1306
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:05,373
I know what's done is done.

1307
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:06,641
But, if I could go back...

1308
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,810
If you could go back,you'd do the same shit.

1309
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:14,883
Yeah.

1310
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,386
Not really sure where Iwas going with that.

1311
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:56,524
Where the fuck have you been?

1312
01:09:56,526 --> 01:09:58,393
I've been calling you all day.

1313
01:09:58,395 --> 01:10:00,528
My phone was acting up,what's wrong?

1314
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:05,600
Kurt's dead.What?

1315
01:10:06,902 --> 01:10:08,503
You hear about it?

1316
01:10:08,505 --> 01:10:10,538
It was on the news.

1317
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:14,242
Kurt's neighbors said they founda scalp in his backyard.

1318
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:16,544
Turns out the scalp was Kurt'sand that's all they found.

1319
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:18,880
But... That thing isgetting stronger.

1320
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:21,616
It can kill in the daytime now.

1321
01:10:21,618 --> 01:10:24,419
People on the newsso fucking retarded.

1322
01:10:24,421 --> 01:10:26,654
They're saying a wild animalis roaming the streets.

1323
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:29,324
Why can't theyunderstand the fact

1324
01:10:29,326 --> 01:10:30,959
that this is nota worldly matter?

1325
01:10:30,961 --> 01:10:32,627
Where's Aidan?

1326
01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:34,495
He's fine, I called himlike 10 minutes ago.

1327
01:10:34,497 --> 01:10:36,331
But, who knows how longthat's gonna last?

1328
01:10:38,367 --> 01:10:39,667
I saw Haywood today.

1329
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:42,437
What happened?

1330
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:44,939
I know how to stop the Gorenos.

1331
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:57,652
Kenan?

1332
01:10:58,554 --> 01:10:59,687
Kenan?

1333
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:03,491
What happened?

1334
01:11:03,493 --> 01:11:05,493
There's some stuff that hasn'tbeen sitting well with me.

1335
01:11:05,495 --> 01:11:06,894
And what stuff would that be?

1336
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:08,830
This whole thing with miles.

1337
01:11:08,832 --> 01:11:11,833
Babe, I told you, he's in a badplace right now, he just needs,

1338
01:11:11,835 --> 01:11:13,835
needs some time to getit together, yeah,

1339
01:11:13,837 --> 01:11:16,004
that's what you said beforeand I went along with it.

1340
01:11:16,006 --> 01:11:17,705
But, in the back of my head,

1341
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:19,874
I couldn't help but thinkthat maybe there's more to it.

1342
01:11:19,876 --> 01:11:22,010
And what does that mean?

1343
01:11:22,012 --> 01:11:24,912
It means, I did someresearch, okay, and I think

1344
01:11:24,914 --> 01:11:26,381
miles is telling the truth.

1345
01:11:26,383 --> 01:11:27,582
No, he's not.

1346
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:30,752
Kenan, I was brain dead.

1347
01:11:30,754 --> 01:11:32,887
Do you know what that means?

1348
01:11:32,889 --> 01:11:36,724
The complete and irreversibleloss of brain function.

1349
01:11:36,726 --> 01:11:39,460
Now, for years Ithought I was this

1350
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:39,460
I don't know, wonder woman

1351
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:43,364
because I was able to recoverfrom something like that.

1352
01:11:43,366 --> 01:11:46,534
And no one knew how I didit, not even the doctors.

1353
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:48,069
Everyone justit called a miracle.

1354
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:51,372
And I mean thepublicity was awesome.

1355
01:11:51,374 --> 01:11:53,608
Yeah, it was, but thenI guess you could...

1356
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:54,909
Say that I became...

1357
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:56,878
Contemplative.

1358
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:00,948
How is that in a matter of days,

1359
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:03,051
not even, I'm back to normal?

1360
01:12:03,053 --> 01:12:05,053
It was like you said,it was a miracle.

1361
01:12:05,055 --> 01:12:06,721
It was bullshit, okay?

1362
01:12:06,723 --> 01:12:07,855
It was a lie.

1363
01:12:07,857 --> 01:12:09,891
And you know it was a lie.

1364
01:12:09,893 --> 01:12:11,759
No one can recoverfrom something like that.

1365
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:14,896
And if they can, they were neverbrain dead to begin with.

1366
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:17,732
Kenan, you're caught.

1367
01:12:17,734 --> 01:12:22,103
The Gorenos grants people onewish in return for a soul.

1368
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:24,739
I'm back to life andeverything is all good.

1369
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:28,109
And then miles turns 18and it all goes downhill, why?

1370
01:12:28,111 --> 01:12:31,346
You sacrificed your ownbrother, for what?

1371
01:12:31,348 --> 01:12:34,382
For you, Nia, I love you.

1372
01:12:34,384 --> 01:12:35,883
Did you think I couldfunction without you?

1373
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:38,553
Maybe not at first, butyou'd have to, all right?

1374
01:12:38,555 --> 01:12:40,555
You don't have a choice.

1375
01:12:40,557 --> 01:12:42,824
That's how it goes, we die.

1376
01:12:42,826 --> 01:12:45,493
Some of us diesooner than others.

1377
01:12:45,495 --> 01:12:47,095
But, it happens.

1378
01:12:47,097 --> 01:12:49,564
Of course, it's sad, of course,

1379
01:12:49,566 --> 01:12:52,400
it sucks, but, you findways to deal with it.

1380
01:12:52,402 --> 01:12:54,936
This was the only waythat I could deal with it.

1381
01:12:54,938 --> 01:12:57,572
And no one seems to understandthat, not even you.

1382
01:12:57,574 --> 01:13:00,141
Kenan, this was,not only was this selfish,

1383
01:13:00,143 --> 01:13:03,611
but it was just really fucked upthing to do, I mean honestly,

1384
01:13:03,613 --> 01:13:05,847
who does thatand thinks it's okay?

1385
01:13:05,849 --> 01:13:07,982
And you continuedto lie about it.

1386
01:13:07,984 --> 01:13:10,618
Look at how you're acting!

1387
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,654
Nia, yeah, I was selfish,but that is the point.

1388
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,858
You're such a bigpart of my life.

1389
01:13:17,693 --> 01:13:18,993
That I...Miles was right.

1390
01:13:18,995 --> 01:13:21,462
Fuck miles! I shouldn't be here.

1391
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:33,668
Don't open the door.

1392
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:35,002
Why? Cause youknow who it is?

1393
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:37,472
Let me go, Kenan.

1394
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,920
I'm sure, we all knowwhat this is about.

1395
01:14:52,922 --> 01:14:54,155
What the fuck is that?

1396
01:14:54,157 --> 01:14:55,556
It's called a knife.

1397
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:57,959
See,

1398
01:14:57,961 --> 01:15:00,261
this was not how I wantedthings to play out.

1399
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,698
But, then I saw how...

1400
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:06,734
Remorseless you are.

1401
01:15:08,136 --> 01:15:09,804
Just, empty.

1402
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:14,775
And I guess that prompteda change of heart.

1403
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:16,978
So, you gonna stab us?

1404
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,948
I have to.

1405
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:24,051
Miles, I want you to know thatI believe you about the Gorenos.

1406
01:15:24,053 --> 01:15:25,720
Did Kenan finally admit it?

1407
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:29,657
About fucking time!

1408
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:34,095
So, I now know howto stop the Gorenos.

1409
01:15:36,832 --> 01:15:38,165
I have to kill you.

1410
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:44,272
And I have to kill Nia.

1411
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:48,576
Which I feel terribleabout, cause

1412
01:15:48,578 --> 01:15:50,011
this wasn't evenyour fault, Nia.

1413
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:53,548
But, I gotta stabyou guys in the heart.

1414
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,285
So, you think we're justgonna let you stab us?

1415
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:01,088
Are you fucking retarded?

1416
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:03,724
What you balling upyour fist for, Kenan?

1417
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:06,027
I mean, let's useour heads here.

1418
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:07,862
Fist...

1419
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:11,232
Versus knife.

1420
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:13,935
Not really a fair fight.

1421
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:16,737
Kenan! Kenan, stop!

1422
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:18,706
Kenan!

1423
01:16:26,315 --> 01:16:27,582
Nia,

1424
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:29,784
Nia, let's go.

1425
01:16:29,786 --> 01:16:31,352
- Nia, let's go.- I'm not going.

1426
01:16:31,354 --> 01:16:33,688
Kenan, I love you, okay?

1427
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:35,690
Nia, I love you too,but we need to leave.

1428
01:16:35,692 --> 01:16:37,358
Why? I think we should stay.

1429
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,093
Because I'm notsupposed to be here.

1430
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:40,928
Yet, here you are.Yes, here I am.

1431
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:42,897
And as long as I'm here,people are gonna die.

1432
01:16:42,899 --> 01:16:44,699
Miles is gonna die.

1433
01:16:44,701 --> 01:16:46,200
Kenan, I love you so much.

1434
01:16:46,202 --> 01:16:48,703
But, you brought somereally evil shit here.

1435
01:16:48,705 --> 01:16:50,137
And I cannot get behind it.

1436
01:16:54,309 --> 01:16:57,044
I know a way that we can ridof it and still be together.

1437
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:07,154
Look, I can't forceyou to do anything.

1438
01:17:07,156 --> 01:17:08,789
But, I know what I'm doing.

1439
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:11,359
Nia, please listen to me,I don't wanna be without you.

1440
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:14,128
Then don't.

1441
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:18,099
No, no...!

1442
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:31,812
No!

1443
01:17:33,215 --> 01:17:34,715
No!

1444
01:18:07,184 --> 01:18:08,083
The CSI folks

1445
01:18:08,084 --> 01:18:11,986
found both Kenan and Nia'sfingerprints on the knife.

1446
01:18:11,988 --> 01:18:14,989
So, they inferred that it waseither a joint suicide

1447
01:18:14,991 --> 01:18:16,223
or murder suicide.

1448
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:20,394
And as far as I was concerned,

1449
01:18:20,396 --> 01:18:22,096
I was at Parker'swhen it happened.

1450
01:18:22,098 --> 01:18:23,364
So, I don't know shit.

1451
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:30,037
My mom thought the easiestthing to do was move out,

1452
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:32,039
and I don't really blame her.

1453
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:33,708
We got an apartment downtown.

1454
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:36,744
That worked out betterfor my mom anyway

1455
01:18:36,746 --> 01:18:38,245
since it was closerto the hospital.

1456
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,315
And with me goingto college soon,

1457
01:18:41,317 --> 01:18:42,717
it didn't make sensefor her to live

1458
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:43,717
in a big house like that

1459
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:46,320
by herself especiallyafter what happened.

00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
well these or let&#39;s not waste any time

35
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
you&#39;ll remember we agreed to a thing for
this week&#39;s invention exchange and that

36
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
theme was action figures

37
00:02:46 --> 00:02:51
no it was action figures tell you what
we&#39;ll make it a competition you win and

38
00:02:51 --> 00:02:52

00:02:52 --> 00:02:57

40
00:02:57 --> 00:03:02
cheese factory monster ago go and Frank

00:03:02 --> 00:03:05

42
00:03:05 --> 00:03:09

00:03:09 --> 00:03:12
it&#39;ll be fun shall we toss a coin see
who goes first

44
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
I did we want a lot of habits d where

45
00:03:15 --> 00:03:18
all action figures have two things in
common

46
00:03:18 --> 00:03:22
merchandising and accessories but there
is a fatal flaw in this philosophy that

47
00:03:22 --> 00:03:27
yours truly and the monkey here have
rooted up like the posse scabbit is the

48
00:03:27 --> 00:03:28
component factor

49
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
most kids can&#39;t be satisfied with just a
simple start up kid

50
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
one doll naked alone and afraid you got
to have all the accessories

51
00:03:34 --> 00:03:39
but why stop at the dog don&#39;t you see a
cell component tall introducing Johnny

52
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
long torso the doll who is himself sold
separately

53
00:03:42 --> 00:03:46
Johnny long torso Johnny long torso

54
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
the man who comes in pieces watch

55
00:03:49 --> 00:03:55
he&#39;s long now you might want to start
with the long torso starter unit and

56
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
then add the action head

57
00:03:57 --> 00:04:01
just look at the detail on this then
accentuate the head with the right and

58
00:04:01 --> 00:04:06
left eyeball action packs plus Johnny&#39;s
perfect years sold separately

59
00:04:06 --> 00:04:10
now get your hero up off the floor and
give him something to do with the left

60
00:04:10 --> 00:04:18
arm right arm and right leg left leg
limp acts then if you order now you also

61
00:04:18 --> 00:04:24
get the high performance right and left
foot upgrades all for only ten dollars

62
00:04:24 --> 00:04:29
with this coupon not included and then
gear up for high adventure with the hair

63
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
kit the rugged knows option

64
00:04:31 --> 00:04:36
this week and sassy but portions the
realistic action fashion so much more

65
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
now all together this hunk of rubber
would go for about eight blocks

66
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44
what is sold separately one Johnny long
persecuted can bring in three hundred

67
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
dollars and all adds up to merchandising
profit

68
00:04:47 --> 00:04:56
the American Way well small down honey

77
00:05:15 --> 00:05:15
Europe

78
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18

oxford was the real author of

79

Shakespeare&#39;s plays and sonnets

the annual masquerade once wound up to
Rocco skating season yet still today

113

mobile apps or brokers glide from their
work at a world into the make-believe

115
00:07:30 --> 00:07:33

the world championship as she plays out
the last moment of the dying part

154
00:10:10 --> 00:10:15

156
00:10:16 --> 00:10:21
brave army of toy soldiers is called out
to deal with the only dragon in

captivity

158
00:10:21 --> 00:10:27
Operation Desert ice storm the soldiers

as long as you drop before you came with
chalet skating is a comparatively new

165
00:10:52 --> 00:10:53
development of the art

166
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
it requires all the grace and control

167
00:10:55 --> 00:10:56
all of the dancer

168
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59

00:11:18 --> 00:11:23
artistry is blended into brilliant
choreography on Broadway but not here

175
00:11:23 --> 00:11:28

glassy state to interpret a moonlight

176
00:11:28 --> 00:11:29
comparable on

177
00:11:29 --> 00:11:33
I with the silver not every circus has
eight acrobat except this one

178
00:11:33 --> 00:11:37
millisecond in their breathtaking
routine and when it&#39;s all done on skates

00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
these daring young performers are
accomplishing feeling even more

180
00:11:40 --> 00:11:44
difficult than many an aerialist in a
real circuit or even my mom will be

181

00:12:03 --> 00:12:07
the precision of a juggler and the nerve
, testify and the boredom of an

00:12:07 --> 00:12:10
accordionist today is great

189
00:12:10 --> 00:12:16

332
00:21:20 --> 00:21:21
a variety of operating systems

333
00:21:21 --> 00:21:26
well I guess that&#39;s a store well I&#39;ve
undergone a complex personal evolution

334
00:21:26 --> 00:21:29
wherein painful confusion has given way
to what I like to think of it as some

335
00:21:29 --> 00:21:33
degree of wisdom culminating in my
current Zarathustra and sense of self is

336
00:21:33 --> 00:21:36
that it know if it helps you that&#39;s good

337
00:21:36 --> 00:21:41
put gypsy I don&#39;t know what is it that I
often panic while making sandwiches

338
00:21:41 --> 00:21:45
yeah whoa well maybe it&#39;s that kind of
thing is it that I smell conspiracy and

339
00:21:45 --> 00:21:50
everything and I don&#39;t know what I mean
most of the time the spreads a small

340
00:21:50 --> 00:21:52
piece of the puzzle foot

341
00:21:52 --> 00:22:00
gypsy is it an odor no well no well

342

difficult

maybe he&#39;s our three roads in the scale

347
00:22:16 --> 00:22:20

movie version of darkness visible by

we were having contact with it from the
ground car suddenly he let out a yell

354
00:22:42 --> 00:22:43
and then went blank

355
00:22:43 --> 00:22:47
there was nothing we could do better
take a look at the money he said carbs

356
00:22:47 --> 00:22:49
and he said good and then have never
seen anything like it

357
00:22:49 --> 00:22:52

mustache those animals

361

we could apply such burns Mexican food I
don&#39;t know

365
00:23:18 --> 00:23:21
probably some kids prank

366
00:23:21 --> 00:23:24

miracle more than I enemy hope does with

the antidote brought about an almost

734
00:45:11 --> 00:45:11
human appearance

735
00:45:11 --> 00:45:15

759
00:46:28 --> 00:46:31
any hope in the mission antidote might
become founded to have a lasting effect

760
00:46:31 --> 00:46:35

monsters are or any hope that the film

completely in charge and they want

810
00:49:47 --> 00:49:50
results they want that I need to know
the magic

811
00:49:50 --> 00:49:53
please phrase it in the form of a
question depending on that you know all

812
00:49:53 --> 00:49:55

00:49:55 --> 00:49:59
I don&#39;t think you buzz when I but after
they want now don&#39;t make it work

814
00:49:59 --> 00:50:06
all right but understand that just the
theory but I&#39;m Coco Chanel and that was

815
00:50:06 --> 00:50:11
much worse and and if my theory is
correct

816
00:50:11 --> 00:50:14
he gets progressively worse quick ship
mature me

817
00:50:14 --> 00:50:18
well when i first hit him in the other
lab I gave him the injection of the

818
00:50:18 --> 00:50:22
animal my brother and Nora develop John
Lilly called for the prescription and he

819
00:50:22 --> 00:50:23
became almost normal

820
00:50:23 --> 00:50:28
but the condition left with only five
days then you left for the weekend

821
00:50:28 --> 00:50:31
following injection effect of the animal
world more rapidly

822
00:50:31 --> 00:50:35
what are you trying to say I&#39;m Coco
Chanel injection with effective for only

823
00:50:35 --> 00:50:41
a few hours they kind of precisely
there&#39;s your odd kind of that if he is

824
00:50:41 --> 00:50:44
using the antidote he escaped with as
his body needs it

825
00:50:44 --> 00:50:48
there is no telling how bad you will get
after each injection we&#39;re going from

826
00:50:48 --> 00:50:50
good read that&#39;s a wrap

827
00:50:50 --> 00:50:53
no he doesn&#39;t get larger the radius of
the danger zone

828
00:50:53 --> 00:50:56
isn&#39;t that always the way I don&#39;t have
any antidote

829
00:50:56 --> 00:51:01
i&#39;m not sure but it&#39;s conceivable
inconceivable within hours you could

830
00:51:01 --> 00:51:05
contaminate everything and everybody

last week when you asked what was the

899
00:55:31 --> 00:55:33

we&#39;ll have this idea

900
00:55:33 --> 00:55:37
ok that Jean put it somewhere well then

901
00:55:37 --> 00:55:37
look at a unit

902
00:55:37 --> 00:55:40
Joel yeah pina colada song yeah what
part

903
00:55:40 --> 00:55:44
could you phrase it in the form of a
question okay Joel what&#39;s the deal with

904
00:55:44 --> 00:55:45
the Pina Colada song

905
00:55:45 --> 00:55:49
oh and I have a follower ok you mean if
you like pina coladas night and caught

906
00:55:49 --> 00:55:49
in the rain

907
00:55:49 --> 00:55:52
if you&#39;re not into health food and you
have half a brain

908
00:55:52 --> 00:55:55
if you like making love at midnight on
the do that&#39;s the one

909
00:55:55 --> 00:56:01
yep yep well okay I&#39;m all right in the
early nineteen eighties Rupert Holmes

910
00:56:01 --> 00:56:05
wrote the Pina Colada song because pina
coladas and personal ads were on the

911
00:56:05 --> 00:56:09
forefront of the American consciousness
and you know pop song writers do just

912
00:56:09 --> 00:56:13
that they write about pop culture you
know like you know there&#39;s ray stevens

913
00:56:13 --> 00:56:16
the streak Henry grossest junk food
junkie

914
00:56:16 --> 00:56:21
CW McCall&#39;s convoy and others oh not so
fast there in the am PM

915
00:56:21 --> 00:56:24
ok so this man and women are in this
relationship for all

916
00:56:24 --> 00:56:26
let&#39;s say eight months so that&#39;s the
average national length of a dating

917
00:56:26 --> 00:56:29
relationship of males 18 to 34 and they
don&#39;t even know that each other likes

918
00:56:29 --> 00:56:30
pina coladas

919
00:56:30 --> 00:56:32
what would they always panic in order
Manhattan&#39;s or something yeah and when

920
00:56:32 --> 00:56:34
they probably already have been caught
in the rain together and

921
00:56:34 --> 00:56:37
and then one of them at least mention
that they like getting caught in the

922
00:56:37 --> 00:56:37
rain

923
00:56:37 --> 00:56:40
huh and if this couple will call them
Rick and Julie for the purposes of this

924
00:56:40 --> 00:56:43
argument if Julian Ricky been together
for any amount of time

925
00:56:43 --> 00:56:46
well doesn&#39;t each of them have a
responsibility to communicate to the

926
00:56:46 --> 00:56:48
other his or her dissatisfaction with
the relationship

927
00:56:48 --> 00:56:51
yeah cuz by responding to the personal
hit not only are they cheating on each

928
00:56:51 --> 00:56:53
other they&#39;re cheating on each other
with each other

929
00:56:53 --> 00:56:56
yeah and since seventy two percent of
the population of North America lives in

930
00:56:56 --> 00:56:59
a landlocked state or province in
actuality this couple has no idea

931
00:56:59 --> 00:57:02
whether they&#39;re like making love in the
tools in a cape and it&#39;s probably one in

932
00:57:02 --> 00:57:05
a kazillion chance that Rick and Julie
would actually answer each other&#39;s and

933
00:57:05 --> 00:57:08
tango and although the song tries to
paint a rosy picture of a relationship

934
00:57:08 --> 00:57:08
reborn

935
00:57:08 --> 00:57:11
it is human nature that either Rick or
Julie maybe both I don&#39;t know what

936
00:57:11 --> 00:57:14
harbor at least a fragment of resentment
that the other set out to cheat on him

937
00:57:14 --> 00:57:14
or her

938
00:57:14 --> 00:57:17
which would unleash itself and fits a
passive-aggressive behavior and bitter

939
00:57:17 --> 00:57:17
recriminations

940
00:57:17 --> 00:57:21
ok listen all I&#39;m saying is that Rupert
Holmes wrote a song about a couple of

941
00:57:21 --> 00:57:22
popular trends all right

942
00:57:22 --> 00:57:25
it doesn&#39;t make the hurt go away we
don&#39;t blame usual

943
00:57:25 --> 00:57:28
hey Rupert Holmes wrote amethi that was
my cannibalism

944
00:57:28 --> 00:57:34
when was that popular listen crow it&#39;s a
well-known fact that Timothy was a duct

945
00:57:34 --> 00:57:37
work wait a minute let&#39;s review here and
start scrobbling it&#39;s hungry as hell

946
00:57:37 --> 00:57:39
energy that leg looks well what

947
00:57:39 --> 00:57:53
akmal on the word for inability to get
the fuck out with the radiation boring

948
00:57:53 --> 00:57:57
how are we going to find him now Beetle
Bailey the motion retired has over 5

949
00:57:57 --> 00:57:59
million people in the city and this is
one of them

950
00:57:59 --> 00:58:06
changes that should be 20 to 25 feet
Nora I want to take a bit of 3050 of the

951
00:58:06 --> 00:58:06
editor

952
00:58:06 --> 00:58:10
not too long but I need a blender do it
and get it to me immediately

953
00:58:10 --> 00:58:15
but you won&#39;t like it will need an air
gun and quite like a string in a picture

954
00:58:15 --> 00:58:18
of even a blue flag them down with Tiger
time

955
00:58:18 --> 00:58:21
that means we&#39;ll have to get within 20
or 25 feet it means you have to go after

956
00:58:21 --> 00:58:28
months into something it takes one step

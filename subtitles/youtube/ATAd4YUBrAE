the idea dr. cattle the suppression of

16
00:01:46 --> 00:01:50
lurking behind it are the most important
jobs this department is now engaged them

17
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
at the outside of this letter

18
00:01:52 --> 00:01:56
there is one vital fact i would like to
submit that it&#39;s a powerful agency

19
00:01:56 --> 00:01:59
I speak of the school parent
associations of this country which can

20
00:01:59 --> 00:02:05
be invaluable in stepping out this skirt
their help their eternal vigilance could

21
00:02:05 --> 00:02:07
be the deciding factor in our fight
against it

22
00:02:07 --> 00:02:12
the weed marijuana is grown in every
state in the Union recently in the city

23
00:02:12 --> 00:02:17
of brooklyn new york a field of
marijuana was found behind a tenement

24
00:02:17 --> 00:02:23
court the weed was here being cultivated
regularly script and bride and sold in

25
00:02:23 --> 00:02:30
schools and government army posts in and
around New York the dr leaves and

26
00:02:30 --> 00:02:35
berries are ground up and made into
cigarettes by a simple and machine

27
00:02:35 --> 00:02:42
the deadly narcotic is that&#39;s quickly
and easily prepared for its market the

28
00:02:42 --> 00:02:47
sale of marijuana is even more difficult
to detect halt and the traffic in drugs

29
00:02:47 --> 00:02:50
such as opium morphine and heroin

30
00:02:50 --> 00:02:58
they are hidden in fact jewelry cases in
the heels of shoes women shoes

31
00:02:58 --> 00:03:03
especially because the drugs can be
secreted in false heels

32
00:03:03 --> 00:03:09
hello shaving brushes are another medium
books with false enters our afternoon

33
00:03:09 --> 00:03:12
watch cases are convenient hiding places

34
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
the value of drugs that seized is
enormous

35
00:03:15 --> 00:03:20
recently a huge supply of heroin was
taken it was concealed in an apparently

36
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
harmless shipment of 35 barrels of olive
oil

37
00:03:23 --> 00:03:24
the deadly drug was

38
00:03:24 --> 00:03:28
burned in the incinerator of the Bureau
of Engraving and printing and more

39
00:03:28 --> 00:03:30
vicious more deadly

Menace of marijuana

happen to you

232
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
yes that&#39;s right it was mother standing
nearby

233
00:16:07 --> 00:16:11
there you see you think it&#39;d be all
right it if i speaking about it

234
00:16:11 --> 00:16:28
quiet yours okay look so that when i&#39;ll
have your Victorian the moment it&#39;s been

235
00:16:28 --> 00:16:30
fingering you what I got to worry about

236
00:16:30 --> 00:16:35
I have to tell me if it&#39;s like . across
exactly what I&#39;m all right kidney

237
00:16:35 --> 00:16:39
don&#39;t let me see you like that

238
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
yeah

239
00:16:42 --> 00:16:46
yeah

240
00:16:46 --> 00:16:50
there is no doubt that there is an
organized gang distributing the narcotic

241
00:16:50 --> 00:16:54
to students not only in high school but
all over the city

242
00:16:54 --> 00:16:58
you government men have got to find some
way to put it into it

243
00:16:58 --> 00:17:02
of course I agree with you dr. Carol but
do you realize that marijuana is not

244
00:17:02 --> 00:17:03
like other forms of dope

245
00:17:03 --> 00:17:06
you see it grows while in almost every
state in the Union

246
00:17:06 --> 00:17:10
therefore there is practically no
interstate commerce in the drug as a

247
00:17:10 --> 00:17:12
result the government&#39;s hands are tied

248
00:17:12 --> 00:17:17
and frankly the only sure your is a
widespread campaign and education

249
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
oh it&#39;s alright to talk about education
mr. Wyatt

250
00:17:20 --> 00:17:24
but we educate us can&#39;t do anything
until the public is sufficiently aroused

251
00:17:24 --> 00:17:29
let me show you something in nineteen
thirty the records on marijuana in the

252
00:17:29 --> 00:17:32
Washington office of the Narcotics
Division scarcely build a small for like

253
00:17:32 --> 00:17:33
this today

254
00:17:33 --> 00:17:42
they build cabinets all these devoted to
marijuana records

255
00:17:42 --> 00:17:50
here is an example a 15 year old lad
apprehended in the act of staging a

256
00:17:50 --> 00:17:56
holdup 16 years old and a marijuana edit
here is the most tragic case

257
00:17:56 --> 00:18:00
yes I remember just a young boy under
the influence of the drug

258
00:18:00 --> 00:18:03
he killed his entire family with the
next then there is the most vicious type

259
00:18:03 --> 00:18:11
of cake here in Michigan a young girl 17
years old a Reaper smoker taken in a

260
00:18:11 --> 00:18:16
raid in the company with five young men
here is a particularly flagrant case

261
00:18:16 --> 00:18:20
yes i remember the newspapers made quite
a play of it in west virginia wasn&#39;t it

262
00:18:20 --> 00:18:25
yes and there are hundreds of them
coming up new ones every day I&#39;d like to

263
00:18:25 --> 00:18:29
take these records if i made i feel they
would be of invaluable assistance to me

264
00:18:29 --> 00:18:31
in combating the evil in my school

265
00:18:31 --> 00:18:34
you&#39;re very welcome dr. Carol

266
00:18:34 --> 00:18:36
sit down

267
00:18:36 --> 00:18:39

different story

straightforward question and I&#39;d like to

373
00:25:58 --> 00:26:02
did you during the last three months
notice any changes in the demeanor and

374
00:26:02 --> 00:26:03
attitude of your student William barber

375
00:26:03 --> 00:26:12
yes in a number of things for example at
times dis association of ideas in a

376
00:26:12 --> 00:26:17
another instance I happen to attend the
recent Interscholastic tennis matches

00:26:17 --> 00:26:21

exceedingly good player

I saw him mr. ball by as much as three
or four feet

379
00:26:24 --> 00:26:27
this I understand could be attributed to
the use of marijuana

380
00:26:27 --> 00:26:32
it causes errors in time-space objection
your honor the witness isn&#39;t qualified

381

did you notice any changes that would
lead you to believe as an educator that

386
00:26:48 --> 00:26:51
he was under some severe mental strain
which might possibly have been induced

387
00:26:51 --> 00:26:52
by some drug

388
00:26:52 --> 00:26:58
yes I recall distinctly a few weeks ago

414
00:28:35 --> 00:28:42
that&#39;s not good I gotta actually do the
crack on the harbor he comes in he&#39;s on

415
00:28:42 --> 00:28:47
the t you want to take a power honest
and blow his top of the DA you mean you

416
00:28:47 --> 00:28:51
think where we&#39;d all be better off that
he never heard of the right it

417
00:28:51 --> 00:28:55
well what are you waiting for

418
00:28:55 --> 00:28:59
you read it and gentlemen of the jury
have a duty to perform a duty to

419
00:28:59 --> 00:29:02
yourselves and to our community

420
00:29:02 --> 00:29:09
Mary Lane is dead the evidence you&#39;ve
heard this trial could not fail to the

421
00:29:09 --> 00:29:15
issue of the guilt of the defendant is
an admission he pressed the trigger of

422
00:29:15 --> 00:29:19
the weapon that sent lovely and innocent
Mary lathe to a tragic and untimely

423
00:29:19 --> 00:29:21
death

424
00:29:21 --> 00:29:26
we are not so much concerned about the
motives behind the d that as to the deed

425
00:29:26 --> 00:29:26
itself

426
00:29:26 --> 00:29:31
why are the defendant has told you that
he saw someone attacking Mary land

427
00:29:31 --> 00:29:35
I&#39;m going to mind went blank from that
moment on that he paints have been

428
00:29:35 --> 00:29:41
unable to produce one witness to
substantiate that statement later the

429
00:29:41 --> 00:29:46
general the jury your word able man
testify at this trial then we were

430
00:29:46 --> 00:29:50
trying to bring up the fact that the
defendant might have become mormon tenet

431
00:29:50 --> 00:29:55
of saying that when he fired the shot
that killed Mary made but the defense

432
00:29:55 --> 00:29:58
has been able to prove that he was
insane

433
00:29:58 --> 00:30:01
William Harper was saying when he
visited the apartment where the tragedy

434
00:30:01 --> 00:30:01
occurred

435
00:30:01 --> 00:30:04
he was in the habit of visiting the
place he was saying when he went to a

436
00:30:04 --> 00:30:07
better with another young woman you&#39;re
all hardwood went out of that room

437
00:30:07 --> 00:30:12
you heard it from the defendants own
lips involved as he was in a tawdry love

438
00:30:12 --> 00:30:19
affair Mary Lane within the way she had
found him out in a moment of anger he

439
00:30:19 --> 00:30:21
deliberately and willfully killed her

440
00:30:21 --> 00:30:24
if such deeds are permitted to go
unpunished

441
00:30:24 --> 00:30:28
this community would cease to be a
decent and safe place for us on our

442
00:30:28 --> 00:30:29
children to live

443
00:30:29 --> 00:30:35
I do not believe i have to plead or even
demand that you bring in a verdict to

444
00:30:35 --> 00:30:39
punish the defendant for the crime that
he has committed against society you

445
00:30:39 --> 00:30:40
want upright citizens

446
00:30:40 --> 00:30:45
that is why you were chosen to judge
another and his honest upright citizens

447
00:30:45 --> 00:30:48
there is only one verdict which you can
find

448
00:30:48 --> 00:30:48
and that is

449
00:30:48 --> 00:30:56
hey buddy - guilty and this Court will
be adjourned until the jury&#39;s verdict is

450
00:30:56 --> 00:31:01
rated

451
00:31:01 --> 00:31:12
I want you all feel the same about this
case but he might have been insane when

452
00:31:12 --> 00:31:12
he did it

453
00:31:12 --> 00:31:15
no he wasn&#39;t he - what he was doing

454
00:31:15 --> 00:31:19
but supposing he wasn&#39;t saying you&#39;ll
never make me believe it or anybody else

455
00:31:19 --> 00:31:32
we were taking place bowl boat

456
00:31:32 --> 00:31:35
11 for conviction one for acquittal

457
00:31:35 --> 00:31:39
what does a reasonable doubt about the
boys sanity

458
00:31:39 --> 00:31:42
we can&#39;t no doubt about the fact that he
might deter he admitted himself

459
00:31:42 --> 00:31:45
I wasn&#39;t the first time he was there

460
00:31:45 --> 00:31:48
we got to make an example before boys
like that to terminate all of our

461
00:31:48 --> 00:31:52
children we can&#39;t have every murder
hiding behind the gag but he&#39;s insane

462
00:31:52 --> 00:31:55
sure they see red before they killed
somebody but whose father this

463
00:31:55 --> 00:32:00

468
00:32:25 --> 00:32:29

unfortunate case one whose horrible
tragedy will forever remain with me i am

546
00:38:25 --> 00:38:29
happy to have been enabled before it was
too late to order the verdict of the

547
00:38:29 --> 00:38:34
jury in the case of the People vs
William harbor to be satisfied but young

548
00:38:34 --> 00:38:34
man

549
00:38:34 --> 00:38:38
although this Court is convinced that to
declare you guilty would have been a

550
00:38:38 --> 00:38:40
gross miscarriage of justice

551
00:38:40 --> 00:38:46
we cannot condone your eggs and we can
express only the hope that your

552
00:38:46 --> 00:38:51
experiences may not alone keep you but
thousands of others from the vicious

553
00:38:51 --> 00:38:56
that balls of marijuana thus I am
ordering you to remain in this court

554
00:38:56 --> 00:38:57
during the next case

555
00:38:57 --> 00:39:01
so that you will be obliged to witness
what you yourself so narrowly escaped

556
00:39:01 --> 00:39:04
call the case of the People vs Ralph
Wiley

557
00:39:04 --> 00:39:09
yeah

558
00:39:09 --> 00:39:29
Your Honor in this case the state waives
trial the defendant route while it is

559
00:39:29 --> 00:39:32
recommended your honor that the
defendant be placed at an institution

560
00:39:32 --> 00:39:34
for the criminally insane for the rest
of his natural life

561
00:39:34 --> 00:39:40
defendant council joins the state in
this request sent to counsel for the

562
00:39:40 --> 00:39:43
defense as well as counsel for the state
seem to agree on this

563
00:39:43 --> 00:39:49
I see no reason why the request should
not be granted that happened right here

564
00:39:49 --> 00:39:50
to your neighbors

565
00:39:50 --> 00:39:55
it is not too much to say that in your
hands lies the possibility of averting

566
00:39:55 --> 00:39:58
other tragedies like we must work out
entirely

567
00:39:58 --> 00:40:02
so that our children are up flights to
learn the truth because it is only

568
00:40:02 --> 00:40:08
through knowledge that we can safely
protect them failing this the next

569
00:40:08 --> 00:40:17
tragedy may be that of your daughter or
your son or yours or yours or yours

570
00:40:17 --> 00:40:23
yeah

571
00:40:23 --> 00:40:23
it

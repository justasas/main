to seek advice from an old man this is a
serious matter of old r and desperate

230
00:15:03 --> 00:15:06

387
00:24:48 --> 00:24:50
have simply vanished into thin air

388
00:24:50 --> 00:24:53

is vanishing into thin air including a

389
00:24:53 --> 00:24:55
few frames and a little search for the
missing children

390
00:24:55 --> 00:24:58
the armed forces are continuing their
search for the mysterious object from

space

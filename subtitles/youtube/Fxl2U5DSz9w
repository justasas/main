Hello.

3
00:00:03 --> 00:00:03
(Voice from audience) PEDAL!

4
00:00:03 --> 00:00:06
Well, pedal, how are you?

5
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
Forgive me, I called him a fag.

6
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
I miss this word, you know? I grew up speaking it.

7
00:00:11 --> 00:00:15
I mean, I never meant it gay. When I was a kid, I did not know who he is &quot;gay,&quot; was I not realized,

8
00:00:15 --> 00:00:20
I did not know that people do things like that, I had no idea.

9
00:00:20 --> 00:00:25
The pedal does not mean gay when someone called a fag, it is because he was a fag, you know?

10
00:00:25 --> 00:00:30
He behaved like a fag. - Nii .. - Shut up, fagot!

11
00:00:30 --> 00:00:35
- You should not use this word .. - Japa, pedal!

12
00:00:35 --> 00:00:39
I never call a gay fag, if not turned out to be a fag.

13
00:00:39 --> 00:00:43
Not because he is gay, you get it? If I saw two guys obciągających each other,

14
00:00:43 --> 00:00:48
I do not know why would I want to watch, but if I saw it,

15
00:00:48 --> 00:00:51
I do not know,

16
00:00:51 --> 00:00:56
I came across a couple of guys, obciągających yourself, honoring your penizja -

17
00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
It is the plural of &quot;penis&quot;, I came up with it today.

18
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
Penizja.

19
00:01:02 --> 00:01:07
- Okazałbym them respect, you know, &quot;Hello gentlemen&quot; and so on ..

20
00:01:07 --> 00:01:13
But if one of them took out a cock mouth and began to behave really gay, he said annoying, gay things,

21
00:01:13 --> 00:01:18
- Residents of Phoenix (Arizona capital) is the Phoenicians .. or something like that,

22
00:01:18 --> 00:01:20
I would say - Hey, shut up, fagot!

23
00:01:20 --> 00:01:22
Pedal!

24
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
Stop being a fag and suck the dick! That&#39;s what I told him.

25
00:01:27 --> 00:01:33
Never przezywałbym someone for what sucks, because if you can suck a dick, that&#39;s great, I respect you.

26
00:01:33 --> 00:01:38
Because I can not, it&#39;s not like I tried and failed,

27
00:01:38 --> 00:01:43
I just .. I put myself in this situation in mind, and I could not because I&#39;d be afraid. That&#39;s the only reason.

28
00:01:43 --> 00:01:48
If you can suck dick, I believe that there is some force, allowing it to do. I believe it.

29
00:01:48 --> 00:01:53
I do not believe that anyone Blowjob someone comes easily.

30
00:01:53 --> 00:01:56
Even if this is something you do every day, to every new dick you have to give something back.

31
00:01:56 --> 00:02:00
There is something you need to do to get ready.

32
00:02:00 --> 00:02:03
- Well let&#39;s go.

33
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
- Oh, you ... you Wyss

34
00:02:06 --> 00:02:09
- Alright! WE DRIVE!

35
00:02:09 --> 00:02:10
So, &quot;pedal&quot; ..

36
00:02:10 --> 00:02:13
I do not know a lot of words, they are not bad words.

37
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
There are no bad words, are such that people use to hurt others, and become bad.

38
00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
It is the word, which I love, but I can not use, because others use it inappropriately to hurt others.

39
00:02:20 --> 00:02:25
The word &quot;pussy&quot; is a beautiful word to me is the beauty of it.

40
00:02:25 --> 00:02:30
So beautifully, I imagine around him chocolate.

41
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
I love how it sounds.

42
00:02:32 --> 00:02:35
I use it only when I am alone in the laundry, I sing around.

43
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
Pussy, pussy ... - I sing it.

44
00:02:38 --> 00:02:44
I never call a woman a cunt, except for my mother, who for some strange reason she likes it ..

45
00:02:44 --> 00:02:48
This is a very misused word. Should mean vagina, which, I believe, not working at all.

46
00:02:48 --> 00:02:54
Because the vagina are so sweet, such a nice, little things, the tycimi lips in the shape of flower petals,

47
00:02:54 --> 00:02:59
I can hear in your ears piccolo piccolo every time I see them. Pululullu, lululuu ..

48
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
Plrululuuu

49
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
Even the word vagina seems too rough for them. They should be called:

50
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
Falalalalla ahhahaha

51
00:03:07 --> 00:03:12
All the time, around each of them should fly butterfly. All the time, a small butterfly.

52
00:03:12 --> 00:03:18
When a woman goes to the doctor: I still years around the butterfly, so it is in good shape, if we have a butterfly.

53
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
How can you look at something so nice and say - This is a cunt! ? In general, it does not fit.

54
00:03:21 --> 00:03:27
Perhaps, though a giant vagina attacked the city, threw buses flipped telephone booths,

55
00:03:27 --> 00:03:33
one might say - Somebody shoot down this cunt bazooka! We step into a shop with sweets!

56
00:03:33 --> 00:03:35
So, &quot;fagot&quot;, &quot;cunt&quot; ..

57
00:03:35 --> 00:03:39
Everyone has their own words that offend him, other things that offend them when they hear them.

58
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
Strikes me most when I hear the word c.

59
00:03:43 --> 00:03:49
It&#39;s not about the nigger, I mean &quot;c word.&quot; Literally. When I hear, like a white lady from CNN with a good haircut says &quot;word c.&quot;

60
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
This shows the way white people coped with the pronunciation of the word nigger. Just enough.

61
00:03:52 --> 00:03:57
They found a workaround for the word nigger. &quot;A word c.&quot;

62
00:03:57 --> 00:04:04
That&#39;s stupid, because when you say &quot;word c.&quot;, Insert the word &quot;nigger&quot; to the listener&#39;s head. It is generally speaking the words of.

63
00:04:04 --> 00:04:09
You say &quot;word c.&quot;, I think to myself - Oh, she means nigga .. Makes me say this in your head!

64
00:04:09 --> 00:04:14
Maybe you just said it herself and took responsibility for it?

65
00:04:14 --> 00:04:18
Speak these shitty words you want to say.

66
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
Say it, do not hide behind the first letter, as PEDAL,

67
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
just say nigger, stupid CIPO.

68
00:04:24 --> 00:04:27
I do not know, do not care about it ..

69
00:04:27 --> 00:04:28
Some may want to kick my ass ..

70
00:04:28 --> 00:04:33
This shit just comes to my mind. One day I thought about someone &quot;nigger&quot;, I will tell you this story.

71
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
And it is not racist, there is no racial ground. Let me tell you.

72
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
I went to the cafe, to the cool, independent cafes

73
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
I do not like Starbucks already, because those people already do not care.

74
00:04:40 --> 00:04:44
Simply squeeze the button, diarrhea some old grandmother flows into a cup ..

75
00:04:44 --> 00:04:50
Youth, cool cafe, Poster bands on the walls, called &quot;Roaring .. costa&quot;

76
00:04:50 --> 00:04:55
the guy behind the counter wore a tight-fitting T-shirt, squats on the head and Zagaje: - What are you, dude?

77
00:04:55 --> 00:04:58
I ask - I get a cappuccino? He said: - Sure, it gets, dude!

78
00:04:58 --> 00:05:03
He was amazed that he could help me. - Totally, I have all this equipment here, it&#39;s great!

79
00:05:03 --> 00:05:09
I started making my coffee, worked so hard! He collected the seeds on my cup, put it somewhere, porozgniatał own,

80
00:05:09 --> 00:05:15
&quot;Click! Clack! Click!&quot;, Then he took the milk, began to whip foam, then hit the table, I do not know why but it looked great,

81
00:05:15 --> 00:05:20
put them into a cup, he sprinkled cocoa and says: - Here you go, buddy. And I was wiped out!

82
00:05:20 --> 00:05:26
For some reason, when I got out there, the only thought in my head said: - This fucking nigger made me coffee!

83
00:05:26 --> 00:05:30
I do not know why he was not black! This word were then in my heart, for some reason.

84
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
- This fucking nigger made me coffee.

85
00:05:34 --> 00:05:37
I do not know,

86
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
I do not care about it ..

87
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
All the sweat, oh ..

88
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
Last too much food and too often pounded horse.

89
00:05:45 --> 00:05:51
It is not good to blame yourself and just leave the room, because you meet someone and you think: - Damn, she knows ..

90
00:05:51 --> 00:05:56
You need to spend some time alone, so, you know, this process a shame ..

91
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
I can not stop eating. Today is weighed, I do not know exactly why,

92
00:05:58 --> 00:06:02
I do not use this information, not guided by it in their behavior, why get hung his head

93
00:06:02 --> 00:06:07
finding out exactly how much shit I am.

94
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
Weighed, usually I fluctuate around 230 pounds,

95
00:06:09 --> 00:06:14
240 today, I weigh 240 pounds, which is not right,

96
00:06:14 --> 00:06:19
as impossible, that when you are a doctor and there is a pattern, how much more or less you should weigh,

97
00:06:19 --> 00:06:24
impossible that it sounded &quot;your age plus 200 pounds.&quot;

98
00:06:24 --> 00:06:27
I watched two boxers fighting today, and they weighed the 110 pounds.

99
00:06:27 --> 00:06:32
So they both need a fat kid and a dead dog by weight catch up with me.

100
00:06:32 --> 00:06:36
And it is very bad, because I have 40 years, and my doctor said:

101
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
- You must be fewer people, it can not be you so much.

102
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
He told me that it was wrong.

103
00:06:41 --> 00:06:45
He also started asking me about my eating habits, as if they were there, if there was any pattern.

104
00:06:45 --> 00:06:49
It&#39;s just chaos and horror. This hopelessness,

105
00:06:49 --> 00:06:55
because he asks: - How many meals a day do you eat? - I do not know, green. It blurs. Just I eat and shit, all day.

106
00:06:55 --> 00:07:00
I fill the body up to the maximum capacity, then I burst out through the anus, just like that.

107
00:07:00 --> 00:07:05
Each pile of this extreme, whether it&#39;s a little bit explains

108
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
my eating habits?

109
00:07:08 --> 00:07:14
He tries to continue: - Wait .. how long after the start of a meal you feel full and stop eating?

110
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
I was like - I keep eating when you feel full.

111
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
The meal does not stop when I&#39;m full!

112
00:07:19 --> 00:07:24
The meal ends when I start to hate myself - when I finish

113
00:07:24 --> 00:07:31
I suppose that normal people eat up: - Oh, just crossed the exact dosage of proteins, which I demand, I achieved it,

114
00:07:31 --> 00:07:36
Now I pause their power and turns them into useful energy for the whole day.

115
00:07:36 --> 00:07:41
Every time, when I eat, I come to - why I ate it whore ...

116
00:07:41 --> 00:07:46
Take it from me, I do not want to look at it ...

117
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
Here it is already ...

118
00:07:49 --> 00:07:53
I syrup in his veins instead of blood have syrup.

119
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
Later, it will get worse ...

120
00:07:55 --> 00:08:00
I can not take care of yourself. It is always uncomfortable to me, I&#39;m sweating,

121
00:08:00 --> 00:08:03
This here is a real nightmare.

122
00:08:03 --> 00:08:05
This is my nightmare, lifelong

123
00:08:05 --> 00:08:10
the best thing that happened to me, it kolarki (tight briefs with trouser leg), so I&#39;m happy with them.

124
00:08:10 --> 00:08:16
For most it&#39;s extraordinary, but before kolarkami I was trapped between two worlds horrible briefs and boxers.

125
00:08:16 --> 00:08:22
Slips are normal guys with one leg on one side, and the second leg on the other. Quite separate legs,

126
00:08:22 --> 00:08:29
with all the space between them, briefs included in this little valley, then come down, there may simply attach,

127
00:08:29 --> 00:08:32
nice hold of all air space between them.

128
00:08:32 --> 00:08:37
For me everything is compact together, painful, burning, red, sweaty, yes.

129
00:08:37 --> 00:08:40
It looks like a pig&#39;s ass.

130
00:08:40 --> 00:08:45
Even the penis is curved like a tail, a veritable pig&#39;s ass.

131
00:08:45 --> 00:08:51
A briefs are all snap and set: - It&#39;s your balls and cock, fat bastard like?

132
00:08:51 --> 00:08:57
Just stick to the genitals that his wickedly sharp material, and I - Oh ... - after some time I got there, a ball

133
00:08:57 --> 00:09:03
wet material, amalgamation of wet cotton, the size of a tennis ball, a big puff of wet cotton.

134
00:09:03 --> 00:09:09
A boxer shorts were even worse, with them all flew and touched each other, sad about each other ...

135
00:09:09 --> 00:09:14
I need to have everything down there separated, all immobilized.

136
00:09:14 --> 00:09:19
And wearing boxers always some reason I was ... water.

137
00:09:19 --> 00:09:24
A quarter cup of water, cluttering up the ass all the time.

138
00:09:24 --> 00:09:27
Water ... hanging in my anus.

139
00:09:27 --> 00:09:32
Denying gravity, as if inverted glass of water in the ass.

140
00:09:32 --> 00:09:37
I somehow manage, because I can not stop eating. I practice a lot, run at some time after 5 miles,

141
00:09:37 --> 00:09:41
to maintain a shitty body that I have.

142
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
Because what I eat, man, it&#39;s high-octane shit.

143
00:09:44 --> 00:09:49
One day I ate a Cinnabon. You know what it is Cinnabon?

144
00:09:49 --> 00:09:53
Let me explain for those of you who respect themselves enough to give a wide berth such shit like this,

145
00:09:53 --> 00:09:59
and they have no idea what they eat like me. Because the queue for Cinnabon is not too varied.

146
00:09:59 --> 00:10:07
There are no representatives of all groups of wanting to try Cinnabon. Do not you see there small Chinese woman, nor the little guy.

147
00:10:07 --> 00:10:14
And no one is happy standing in line at Cinnabon. Nobody says - I love it, can not wait.

148
00:10:14 --> 00:10:18
Nobody gets excited about that as soon as it gets.

149
00:10:18 --> 00:10:23
All people like me or fatter, saying: - About whore, take Cinnabon.

150
00:10:23 --> 00:10:26
Maybe you can still recall, because it would be ...

151
00:10:26 --> 00:10:32
I will explain to you exactly what it is Cinnabon. Tall 6 feet, rolled in a roll, cinnamon cake,

152
00:10:32 --> 00:10:36
created for one sad fat man.

153
00:10:36 --> 00:10:42
Even if you have a vagina, if you eat Cinnabon you&#39;re a guy. In that one moment, you&#39;re a man.

154
00:10:42 --> 00:10:47
Sticky, hot bule, glade on top spermowatym syrup.

155
00:10:47 --> 00:10:52
This heat sperm, there is no option that is not warm sperm.

156
00:10:52 --> 00:10:53
It can not not be warm sperm.

157
00:10:53 --> 00:10:57
They should call it Drzewko Fat Queer.

158
00:10:57 --> 00:11:01
Only after this, we have to say. Because it would not stop us. Just us cares.

159
00:11:01 --> 00:11:04
- I&#39;ll Tree Fat Queer.

160
00:11:04 --> 00:11:08
Yes, with hot sperm, whatever.

161
00:11:08 --> 00:11:13
You do not think I&#39;m serious? Cinnabon buy, now,

162
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
I buy Cinnabon at the airport,

163
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
which flew.

164
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
You understand that it is all the more disgusting, is not it?

165
00:11:20 --> 00:11:27
When you&#39;re out, when you&#39;re at the airport from which you are flying, you might say - I have to eat, I need food,

166
00:11:27 --> 00:11:32
in case I was trapped in the air forever, I should eat now.

167
00:11:32 --> 00:11:39
This airport where I landed. The journey ended. Is 20 minutes from home, in kórym have bananas, apples and other

168
00:11:39 --> 00:11:44
and I&#39;m sitting on a suitcase and plunges Cinnabon, knife and fork ...

169
00:11:44 --> 00:11:47
Uuuhhh ...

170
00:11:47 --> 00:11:54
This was particularly bad, he was an old guy just closed the buffet, I to him: - Oh, no, give it to me. Come on, already.

171
00:11:54 --> 00:11:58
He did not want me to sell it, he said: - This is a very old, please do not buy it. Leave. It&#39;s too old.

172
00:11:58 --> 00:12:03
I said: - Dude, I eat. It will happen next.

173
00:12:03 --> 00:12:08
You decide whether we will turn up tomorrow in the newspaper, but this shit lands on my face.

174
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11
I have already taken this decision shit, do not blow it. Just give it to me.

175
00:12:11 --> 00:12:16
Give me the syrup. Oh, yeah, syrup. - Drink it with your eyes closed.

176
00:12:16 --> 00:12:21
Sperm from Cinnabon. For large, thick pedal, as I am.

177
00:12:21 --> 00:12:24
Yes, I&#39;m thick pedal.

178
00:12:24 --> 00:12:31
You know, I finished 40 years, so I&#39;m actually half-dead. 40 years is a strange age, it comes to the point,

179
00:12:31 --> 00:12:35
you&#39;re not so old that people began to worry about, no one says - helped today, 40-year-old, so I&#39;m comfortable with it,

180
00:12:35 --> 00:12:40
I could do something for him. No one spends his holidays spreading hot meals 40-year olds.

181
00:12:40 --> 00:12:44
There are also young enough that anybody was proud of you and happy, they just say - Yeah, do your job, asshole.

182
00:12:44 --> 00:12:48
No one cares. Do what you must.

183
00:12:48 --> 00:12:52
The world looks different. When you have 40 years you go to the doctor, none of them trying to fix anything.

184
00:12:52 --> 00:12:56
Stop trying to do anything. When you&#39;re 40, you say: - Yes, these things begin to happen.

185
00:12:56 --> 00:12:59
They cease to care.

186
00:12:59 --> 00:13:02
I went to the doctor because I hurt my ankle. When you have 20 years old and come from spoiled spatula,

187
00:13:02 --> 00:13:09
Dr. reconstruct your shoulder. Miracles of modern medicine will take the ear and make him shoulder. Strange.

188
00:13:09 --> 00:13:11
When you are 40 years old, they do not give you any options. They do not care about it.

189
00:13:11 --> 00:13:17
Through my ankle limping a month, I do not know why. The doctor came from overexposure and says:

190
00:13:17 --> 00:13:21
- Your ankle is simply tolerated.

191
00:13:21 --> 00:13:26
- You mean that somehow it hurt? - No, it&#39;s just been a shitty.

192
00:13:26 --> 00:13:29
You see the black area over there? Ble such hardened.

193
00:13:29 --> 00:13:33
With time doing such, they are not already too good.

194
00:13:33 --> 00:13:38
I asked: - Well, that&#39;s it? Goodbye, world? Nothing can be done?

195
00:13:38 --> 00:13:40
- No. It is incurable gównianość ankle. Just enough.

196
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
Though, actually, you can do something. You can stretch it.

197
00:13:42 --> 00:13:45
Half an hour a day stretch ankle.

198
00:13:45 --> 00:13:50
- How long will it take until a fix? - No. We just now have to do it.

199
00:13:50 --> 00:13:53
It&#39;s a new thing you do every day,

200
00:13:53 --> 00:13:57
until you and your shitty cube both die.

201
00:13:57 --> 00:14:03
- Dude, that hurts. And it&#39;s hard. - Well, you can also take Aleve. Take Aleve. Can you buy.

202
00:14:03 --> 00:14:08
You can take ... no matter how much. Do not pay attention to dose. - Wow, really?

203
00:14:08 --> 00:14:13
- Yeah, you can take 10 per day will be fine. He said take Aleve 10, a day.

204
00:14:13 --> 00:14:18
I say: - Is not it damage my organs? - Oh, yes, it will make some damage over time,

205
00:14:18 --> 00:14:23
but you will have to weigh that with how much you enjoy when you do not hurt ankle.

206
00:14:23 --> 00:14:26
By the way, it&#39;s all true. Exactly what he said. At one point I asked:

207
00:14:26 --> 00:14:31
- And what if I was an athlete? - You&#39;re not an athlete.

208
00:14:31 --> 00:14:35
So NO to everything you wanted to say.

209
00:14:35 --> 00:14:36
Depressing.

210
00:14:36 --> 00:14:42
It harms older. As my grandmother is 95 years vision of the left eye it is excluded. Lately, when I have seen, he says:

211
00:14:42 --> 00:14:47
- I do not see the left eye. We like: - Wooah, looked like Christmas in the 40s?

212
00:14:47 --> 00:14:51
We wanted to quickly move away from the subject of the eye, you know.

213
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
We went with her to the doctor, we had far, there are some 50 meters away from her,

214
00:14:54 --> 00:14:57
go and say - you know, she did not see the left eye. And he, I swear to God, he replied:

215
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
- Well, probably a lot of tumors in the head.

216
00:14:59 --> 00:15:03
I swear, exactly what he said.

217
00:15:03 --> 00:15:08
I remember because it knocked me off my feet, how little knowledge he put into this one diagnosis.

218
00:15:08 --> 00:15:12
He said he probably has bought TUMORS,

219
00:15:12 --> 00:15:16
in head. He is a doctor, and he called her HEAD.

220
00:15:16 --> 00:15:19
Fortunately, he says a fucking HEAD, I swear, that&#39;s what he thought.

221
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
- Well, probably a lot of tumors in the fucking head.

222
00:15:21 --> 00:15:27
Who cares, this bitch for the week will be dead, not even getting up from your desk by her eye.

223
00:15:27 --> 00:15:34
That kind of need two eyes to see shitty place where it posadziliście because I love her too much?

224
00:15:34 --> 00:15:39
I&#39;m almost there, one foot there already am. 40-year-olds is also good specimens.

225
00:15:39 --> 00:15:44
I have one friend who was much younger than myself girls, far too young.

226
00:15:44 --> 00:15:50
And this is not right. When it comes with some, I say: - Dude ... do not ... Literally, her face showing a finger and say:

227
00:15:50 --> 00:15:54
- Do not fuck her. It&#39;s awful, because ...

228
00:15:54 --> 00:15:59
She then does so - Yyyy. - It&#39;s just bad, you know?

229
00:15:59 --> 00:16:03
He planned to make love to her, as he said, all night. He wanted it lasted a really long time. So he says:

230
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
- I drank a lot of milk, so I could no longer fuck.

231
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
I said: - Who told you that this is important?

232
00:16:09 --> 00:16:14
He says: - Well, I can orgasm more, if you drink milk.

233
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
This guy really thinks

234
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
that when you run out of sperm, but napiłeś milk, the body will react:

235
00:16:20 --> 00:16:24
- Oh, dude, ideally, send it again,

236
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
nobody pokapuje, please keep it.

237
00:16:27 --> 00:16:33
I ended up seed, but skim milk does the trick, let them flow, Spatter the face of a kitten or something.

238
00:16:33 --> 00:16:37
Come on? I come to face your cat.

239
00:16:37 --> 00:16:43
She sees me, he has a face ubryzganą sperm. He knows that he should be careful. He knows it, and now it was her fault.

240
00:16:43 --> 00:16:47
I walked to the cat face once, but shame!

241
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
I do not have a cat. I never had.

242
00:16:50 --> 00:16:55
Definitely spuściłbym at him, do not want to cut back, just do not have a cat.

243
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
I have a dog. I also, when I was a teenager, and ...

244
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
so, once I did something ...

245
00:17:01 --> 00:17:06
I ... I made my dog ​​licked cottage cheese with my testicles,

246
00:17:06 --> 00:17:11
which from now on it is the fact that I will never forget. You know it.

247
00:17:11 --> 00:17:17
I did it. I hesitated before this sentence just because I was not sure whether to say that

248
00:17:17 --> 00:17:22
I let the dog lick cottage cheese with my testicles, or that I made to do it.

249
00:17:22 --> 00:17:28
And frankly, considering how dogs fond of cheese, I think I made him an offer he can not refuse.

250
00:17:28 --> 00:17:31
I remember it so thoroughly, especially the view of the dog&#39;s face when he saw it:

251
00:17:31 --> 00:17:36
- Oh, whore, dude, what&#39;s wrong with you? Why are we doing this?

252
00:17:36 --> 00:17:41
Put it on a plate, why do I have to lick it from your damn egg?

253
00:17:41 --> 00:17:48
Okay, let&#39;s do it, come on, I do not care. You&#39;ll live with it, I&#39;ll be dead in two years. I&#39;m a dog. That is your problem.

254
00:17:48 --> 00:17:50
Forgive me, I&#39;m such a pessimist.

255
00:17:50 --> 00:17:57
I&#39;m terrible. And I should not be, although I&#39;m a real lucky. I am healthy, relatively young,

256
00:17:57 --> 00:18:02
I am white, thanks for that! This is a huge advantage kidding me?

257
00:18:02 --> 00:18:08
I love being white. Really. If you are not white, you lose a lot, because it is pretty good.

258
00:18:08 --> 00:18:11
Let me explain. I&#39;m not saying that white people are better.

259
00:18:11 --> 00:18:16
I say that being white is definitely better, who would argue?

260
00:18:16 --> 00:18:20
If I could choose to be white przedłużałbym each year: - Oh, yes, I take this bright, definitely

261
00:18:20 --> 00:18:24
I like the vision to remain white, thank you.

262
00:18:24 --> 00:18:30
Here&#39;s why it&#39;s so good. I get a time machine to any epoch, and will be horny when I get there.

263
00:18:30 --> 00:18:32
It is a unique privilege of whites.

264
00:18:32 --> 00:18:34
Blacks can not mess with the time machine!

265
00:18:34 --> 00:18:39
Black says: - Hey, before 1980? Thank, I do not want to go there.

266
00:18:39 --> 00:18:43
And I can get to any time! Year 2? I do not even know what happened then.

267
00:18:43 --> 00:18:47
But I know that when I get there - Welcome, we have prepared a table for you right here.

268
00:18:47 --> 00:18:51
- Oh, thank you. Lovely here in Year 2.

269
00:18:51 --> 00:18:56
I can get to any time ... in the past. I do not want to go into the future and find out what happened to the white, because

270
00:18:56 --> 00:18:59
We pay dearly for all this, of course.

271
00:18:59 --> 00:19:00
Do not we fall just from place 1 to 2.

272
00:19:00 --> 00:19:03
They bring us to the ground and they will fuck in the ass forever.

273
00:19:03 --> 00:19:08
And we definitely deserve it, but so far - Weeeee!

274
00:19:08 --> 00:19:13
If you are white and do not admit that it was great, you&#39;re an asshole.

275
00:19:13 --> 00:19:14
This is great. And for that I&#39;m a guy!

276
00:19:14 --> 00:19:15
How big advantage may be one person?

277
00:19:15 --> 00:19:20
I am a white man! You can not even hurt my feelings!

278
00:19:20 --> 00:19:25
How do you call a white guy to hurt him? - Hey, white boy! - Eh, I broke down day.

279
00:19:25 --> 00:19:28
He should not call me that.

280
00:19:28 --> 00:19:33
It reminds me of how I held the earth and other people. Horror.

281
00:19:33 --> 00:19:37
But I&#39;m married, something spoils my position.

282
00:19:37 --> 00:19:41
One evening the wife sent me to Walgreens (a chain of stores in the US), toilet paper, because it is over,

283
00:19:41 --> 00:19:46
because the whole store threw in the trash to be able to get out of the house.

284
00:19:46 --> 00:19:51
So I&#39;m going to Walgreens at night and suddenly I see a deer. A hate deer.

285
00:19:51 --> 00:19:56
I hate it because there are plenty out there. I used to live in the city, then I loved the deer because it was a rare sight in the city,

286
00:19:56 --> 00:20:01
when you see a deer while driving with friends around the village, you see it and: - Stop the car. You do not scare the deer. It is such a beautiful,

287
00:20:01 --> 00:20:03
beautiful deer, look at the beautiful deer.

288
00:20:03 --> 00:20:05
See how looks around, so mysterious and beautiful.

289
00:20:05 --> 00:20:10
God sent us a gift. Everyone, let&#39;s enjoy, nacieszcie the gift of a beautiful deer.

290
00:20:10 --> 00:20:14
But where I now live, deer stand in my garden every day and they suck.

291
00:20:14 --> 00:20:18
It&#39;s so rats with hooves. They mean nothing.

292
00:20:18 --> 00:20:21
They have ticks, Lyme disease can be acquired, they shit everywhere,

293
00:20:21 --> 00:20:26
and making noises, you know? They do so: - Khhhh ... It&#39;s assholes.

294
00:20:26 --> 00:20:31
It&#39;s shitty animals. Every morning I go out and throw stones in them,

295
00:20:31 --> 00:20:36
with sincere hope that I hit one in the head with a rock.

296
00:20:36 --> 00:20:41
They do deal with do not. - Pwwshh ... I do not care about it.

297
00:20:41 --> 00:20:44
I do not have firearms, but if I had, baby deer Take a shot in the mouth and do not would feel nothing.

298
00:20:44 --> 00:20:47
I did not feel anything.

299
00:20:47 --> 00:20:49
I would say: - Oh, he&#39;s dead, it&#39;s interesting.

300
00:20:49 --> 00:20:54
I suppose that happens when you shoot him in the fucking mouth.

301
00:20:54 --> 00:20:56
I&#39;d really much to kill a small deer.

302
00:20:56 --> 00:20:58
We are pleased to obciągnąłbym twenty bleeding dick in a row,

303
00:20:58 --> 00:21:03
to get AIDS, then wydupczyć the deer and kill him with my AIDS. I would not hesitate for a second.

304
00:21:03 --> 00:21:06
I really mean it. Seriously.

305
00:21:06 --> 00:21:11
Well, I see the deer and behold, how stupid are the deer. I hit him on the eyes of the lights, he said: - DYY .. and so on,

306
00:21:11 --> 00:21:16
and then he goes: - May I? I can go? Can ... I said - GO! No go. - Mog ..

307
00:21:16 --> 00:21:17
- NO GO!

308
00:21:17 --> 00:21:24
Then he try to leave, I look at him, he at me - AAA! panicked, he began to run and drove flesh in my fucking car.

309
00:21:24 --> 00:21:30
Destroyed my mirror, he shattered it, broke his neck, I heard breaking a vertebrae

310
00:21:30 --> 00:21:35
and then he dragged your stupid Jelenia head back into the woods and died.

311
00:21:35 --> 00:21:36
And I&#39;m glad he&#39;s dead.

312
00:21:36 --> 00:21:38
From the first moment I was happy.

313
00:21:38 --> 00:21:44
I got out of the car and yelled toward the forest: - I am glad that zdechłeś, you fucking idiot!

314
00:21:44 --> 00:21:49
I hope your wife-deer will find you and will die of a broken heart!

315
00:21:49 --> 00:21:50
May your children-deer died of starvation ...

316
00:21:50 --> 00:21:51
... Ruined my mirror, you ...

317
00:21:51 --> 00:21:55
... Gay, cipowaty czarnucho-deer!

318
00:21:55 --> 00:22:00
Well, I&#39;m on my way to Walgreens, I went further.

319
00:22:00 --> 00:22:04
I need to buy drugs all the time, because I have children. Children are a bucket of diseases, living in your home.

320
00:22:04 --> 00:22:07
Constantly we infect them. More recently, last week, I contracted the flu,

321
00:22:07 --> 00:22:11
because my daughter nakaszlała my mouth.

322
00:22:11 --> 00:22:14
Just like that. Hit me straight in the back wall of the throat.

323
00:22:14 --> 00:22:17
- Thanks, sweetie, I&#39;m sick, that&#39;s what I felt.

324
00:22:17 --> 00:22:22
Actually, she did it because she wanted to tell me a secret.

325
00:22:22 --> 00:22:27
In her opinion, the secrets passes straight into the mouth of people.

326
00:22:27 --> 00:22:32
What could be defined as the lower limit of impaired behavior.

327
00:22:32 --> 00:22:37
So in general, she is 5 years old. What secrets could be, which necessarily need to hear?

328
00:22:37 --> 00:22:42
She tells me something, and I - Bloody hell, are you serious?

329
00:22:42 --> 00:22:47
My God .. honey, do not tell anyone, but it&#39;s a little fucked up, do not you think?

330
00:22:47 --> 00:22:51
Abortowała child on Christmas Eve? My God!

331
00:22:51 --> 00:22:52
She is 5 years old, you know what that means?

332
00:22:52 --> 00:22:55
Nothing she says is important.

333
00:22:55 --> 00:22:57
He never in his life did not say nothing.

334
00:22:57 --> 00:23:00
He never in his life did not say nothing.

335
00:23:00 --> 00:23:06
It could get past me every word uttered by a stupid child, and nothing would have changed.

336
00:23:06 --> 00:23:08
Everything would have been exactly the same.

337
00:23:08 --> 00:23:11
I like the things that he says, are beautiful and poetic, and I love to listen to them,

338
00:23:11 --> 00:23:13
but I do not need to hear any of them.

339
00:23:13 --> 00:23:15
One must be able to distinguish between when you become a parent, it can.

340
00:23:15 --> 00:23:17
You can not listen to them every time they speak, they speak all the time.

341
00:23:17 --> 00:23:20
They talk and do not care about what you do, whether it&#39;s the right moment.

342
00:23:20 --> 00:23:24
I could find yourself in the middle of shooting the police, and she mówiłaby some shit.

343
00:23:24 --> 00:23:28
He does not care about it, because he has 5 years. Such children are focused on the people themselves. Do not have the skills, no five year-old will say:

344
00:23:28 --> 00:23:31
No no, finish it, I&#39;ll tell you later, cool.

345
00:23:31 --> 00:23:34
They can not.

346
00:23:34 --> 00:23:40
Sometimes it becomes impossible. One time I was with the children in New York, I have 2 such shit, remember this, please.

347
00:23:40 --> 00:23:46
We were on a crowded street here holding two year old. He can walk, but will not go, so it Pisser.

348
00:23:46 --> 00:23:52
And weighs as much as 20 children, is tiny, but it has the density of a collapsing star. It&#39;s hard to understand how it can weigh as much.

349
00:23:52 --> 00:23:57
It&#39;s something like a fat raccoon holding a bowling ball.

350
00:23:57 --> 00:24:02
A pain in my arm is so strong that it sends signals to the brain:

351
00:24:02 --> 00:24:06
- Do not you love her, take off her. It does not mean anything.

352
00:24:06 --> 00:24:12
So I fight with my left arm, and the five-year hold on like this. I hope that is okay, an hour there look.

353
00:24:12 --> 00:24:17
Just pull the little man through crowds of strangers.

354
00:24:17 --> 00:24:22
Horns briefcases give her eyes, what do I care.

355
00:24:22 --> 00:24:26
Hurry, because my pocket vibrates, the wife wants to know where we are, because they sent me there,

356
00:24:26 --> 00:24:32
So I scream toward his pocket, as if the wife had to hear me - NO LONGER WHORE go, STOP!

357
00:24:32 --> 00:24:37
Or that little wound on the back all the time. Calutki.

358
00:24:37 --> 00:24:39
His thin voice from two feet above the ground.

359
00:24:39 --> 00:24:43
I really have to listen to all this shit?

360
00:24:43 --> 00:24:48
Maybe I have every two seconds to kneel beside her: - What did you say, darling? Go ahead.

361
00:24:48 --> 00:24:52
No, I&#39;m sorry Lord! Go ahead, go ahead ..

362
00:24:52 --> 00:24:56
Yes, dogs are sometimes brown. Good point.

363
00:24:56 --> 00:25:01
Well, they do not miss me so useless shit that came out of your stupid face.

364
00:25:01 --> 00:25:06
What would be the parent of me, I pretended to listen to something like that?

365
00:25:06 --> 00:25:09
I remember the first time when the daughter uttered a full sentence. It was a big deal,

366
00:25:09 --> 00:25:11
I never expressed all thought the same. She spoke a single word.

367
00:25:11 --> 00:25:16
I washed the dishes and just heard: - Daddy, do not taste my chicken.

368
00:25:16 --> 00:25:19
I dropped my plate, my wife came running, crying and ściskaliśmy out

369
00:25:19 --> 00:25:19
huge moment!

370
00:25:19 --> 00:25:22
A week later, I make dinner, the daughter says: - Daddy, do not taste my chicken.

371
00:25:22 --> 00:25:27
- The dinner will be chicken, you want to fuck?

372
00:25:27 --> 00:25:34
&quot;I do not like chicken&quot; - I do not like you, okay? I do not like people who want me to work, and do not appreciate when I do it.

373
00:25:34 --> 00:25:41
You do not like chicken? It might do something that you like? Get out of that chair and do dinner, whatever you so much every taste.

374
00:25:41 --> 00:25:47
You&#39;ll like chicken when shove it up your ass. Because this happens, if you do not eat. Really.

375
00:25:47 --> 00:25:52
Grinding it into mush and you wdmuchnę in the rectum through a straw.

376
00:25:52 --> 00:25:53
I have to feed her.

377
00:25:53 --> 00:25:56
She must eat.

378
00:25:56 --> 00:26:01
When your child does not want to eat, you fall into a frenzy, because you have a physical need for feeding children, this instinct.

379
00:26:01 --> 00:26:04
And as soon as they sit and look at the full plate, you say - NO WHORE EAT!

380
00:26:04 --> 00:26:07
You die, you idiot, Eat food!

381
00:26:07 --> 00:26:09
- I do not like it. - It does not matter, put it to his face!

382
00:26:09 --> 00:26:15
Have your fingerprints at the hospital, they know that I have you, I can not let you die, piece of shit start to eat!

383
00:26:15 --> 00:26:20
You have your own social security number, you&#39;re on the list, eat!

384
00:26:20 --> 00:26:25
If you are too skinny, I&#39;ll sit czaisz?

385
00:26:25 --> 00:26:30
I love my children, I would give my life for them, but my life, whore, stinks. Just like that.

386
00:26:30 --> 00:26:36
When you become a parent, all the pleasures go. Nobody has ever you go, that&#39;s it.

387
00:26:36 --> 00:26:39
You can not sleep, do not sleep, do not eat, at least not meals.

388
00:26:39 --> 00:26:45
Eat at fast standing, some macaroni and cheese, which she did not want to eat, it is now your dinner.

389
00:26:45 --> 00:26:48
People shout: - Hurry up! - I&#39;m just trying ...

390
00:26:48 --> 00:26:51
You do not do anything cool, your friends-single ask: - Have you seen this movie?

391
00:26:51 --> 00:26:54
- No, I have not seen a fucking film, okay?

392
00:26:54 --> 00:26:58
You can not even enjoy being a parent, because you do not feel proud because you are in this sucks.

393
00:26:58 --> 00:27:04
Everyone is. We are committed huge mistakes when we see it: - Oops, irreversible damage over there, we go further.

394
00:27:04 --> 00:27:10
My five-year plan has seizures, strange fears, I say: - Good luck, honey, it&#39;s all my doing ... I&#39;m sorry?

395
00:27:10 --> 00:27:15
With time, it is becoming increasingly difficult, do you think it will be easier, because when they are children, it is hard. You feed them, put them clothes,

396
00:27:15 --> 00:27:21
put into the car, you do everything. Do you think it would be easier, you will soon get older and begin to do the same things. It&#39;s not like that.

397
00:27:21 --> 00:27:25
Grow, they will be able to do it, but so that, whore, do not. Therefore, it is easier to actually when they are smaller,

398
00:27:25 --> 00:27:32
because when you want to eat, you take food and you push them to face when you wear the shoe just grab a leg and assume.

399
00:27:32 --> 00:27:35
Stretching their hands by the sweater,

400
00:27:35 --> 00:27:38
drop it in the car, close the door ..

401
00:27:38 --> 00:27:45
And then ... Parents live for tiny vacation from their children when they threw them already in the car, have closed their doors,

402
00:27:45 --> 00:27:47
You organize your tiny walk to their own ...

403
00:27:47 --> 00:27:50
It&#39;s like a Mediterranean cruise.

404
00:27:50 --> 00:27:55
Shortness of breath for a few seconds: - Well, I think I&#39;m ready.

405
00:27:55 --> 00:27:58
- Well let&#39;s go!

406
00:27:58 --> 00:28:01
Once I changed diapers daughter, it is already not too large, but still wears them and this is wrong,

407
00:28:01 --> 00:28:03
because the child does not piles. This child

408
00:28:03 --> 00:28:03
SRA.

409
00:28:03 --> 00:28:05
That&#39;s not right. I changed the last diaper,

410
00:28:05 --> 00:28:10
it was like shit forty-alcoholic.

411
00:28:10 --> 00:28:13
It was as if the night chlała Jäger,

412
00:28:13 --> 00:28:17
then he went to Denny&#39;s and took the Grand Slam (pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausages)

413
00:28:17 --> 00:28:20
He ate half and got into a fight in the parking lot,

414
00:28:20 --> 00:28:23
passed has caused death and pants,

415
00:28:23 --> 00:28:28
her pals drove her home with the windows down and threw it on my lawn,

416
00:28:28 --> 00:28:30
and now I have to clean this shit!

417
00:28:30 --> 00:28:34
This is madness. In addition, you can not react, you can not say - What the fuck, it&#39;s disgusting!

418
00:28:34 --> 00:28:37
You can not get carried away by her shit. You need to be nice.

419
00:28:37 --> 00:28:42
You open the diaper and there is just chaos. Same bananas. It is...

420
00:28:42 --> 00:28:46
Each new shit amazes me. I never get used to them. Every time I say - Okay, wow, this is ...

421
00:28:46 --> 00:28:49
What is this?

422
00:28:49 --> 00:28:51
Have you had only diarrhea for a week, I think.

423
00:28:51 --> 00:28:54
Because it is awful.

424
00:28:54 --> 00:28:59
But it can not. Each time you do this: - Oh, wow ...

425
00:28:59 --> 00:29:04
You really do have something, honey, it&#39;s a little painful ...

426
00:29:04 --> 00:29:06
It&#39;s really ... okay.

427
00:29:06 --> 00:29:10
Well, let me zeskrobię little knees ...

428
00:29:10 --> 00:29:13
A little bit of plecków,

429
00:29:13 --> 00:29:15
Let&#39;s get it all in one place ...

430
00:29:15 --> 00:29:20
uprzątnijmy, at the end of clearing your little pussy ...

431
00:29:20 --> 00:29:25
Who knew that so will my life look like? I had no idea

432
00:29:25 --> 00:29:30
that my only contact with the pussy will be cleaning one of the little shit, several times a day.

433
00:29:30 --> 00:29:33
They do not tell us that!

434
00:29:33 --> 00:29:37
When going to be a father, no one takes you to the website and warns: - Hey, you often have to clean the vulva daughter because

435
00:29:37 --> 00:29:42
every time when doing your pants, shit goes straight to cunt. They do not tell us that!

436
00:29:42 --> 00:29:44
Nobody can not tell.

437
00:29:44 --> 00:29:47
And someone should, because this is one of the biggest parts of being a dad. Much bigger than Christmas.

438
00:29:47 --> 00:29:52
Because then you have every day. And you do it well, from front to back, this is important.

439
00:29:52 --> 00:29:53
Nevertheless, I am glad that I have a daughter. The girls are great.

440
00:29:53 --> 00:29:56
I do not want to clear the shit eggs a boy. I&#39;m glad it&#39;s not my responsibilities.

441
00:29:56 --> 00:29:59
The boys ... I feel their strange. I have several nephews, sometimes come to play,

442
00:29:59 --> 00:30:02
sometimes parade around the house with these small, red fiutkami ...

443
00:30:02 --> 00:30:04
I hate this view, these small fiutki bother me,

444
00:30:04 --> 00:30:09
I have this strange feeling that one will approach and begin to fuck my nose or something,

445
00:30:09 --> 00:30:11
I know it&#39;s irrational fear, but it really scares me.

446
00:30:11 --> 00:30:16
I&#39;ll go to sleep, and one of them ... - Whore! What are you doing?! The kid flew my nose!

447
00:30:16 --> 00:30:18
He would like this: - Nihihi! - Whore, come out of there!

448
00:30:18 --> 00:30:23
Mind your kids, huh? Fuck my nose when I&#39;m asleep!

449
00:30:23 --> 00:30:26
Boys difficult to raise. I have sisters, and they all have children, very sorry for them,

450
00:30:26 --> 00:30:28
because it is really hard until I feel sorry for them.

451
00:30:28 --> 00:30:31
The case is like that. The girls equally difficult to raises, but on a completely different level.

452
00:30:31 --> 00:30:33
They are completely different. In my opinion the difference is this:

453
00:30:33 --> 00:30:36
Boys rozpieprzają things.

454
00:30:36 --> 00:30:39
The girls - are fucked up.

455
00:30:39 --> 00:30:41
Such a difference.

456
00:30:41 --> 00:30:46
The boys at home are causing damage, which can be measured in dollars. As the hurricane.

457
00:30:46 --> 00:30:51
The girls leave scars in your psyche (Greek term related to a known us &quot;soul&quot;), which you find later.

458
00:30:51 --> 00:30:54
as genocide or another monstrosity.

459
00:30:54 --> 00:30:57
My sister in law visited me once with his son having maybe four years

460
00:30:57 --> 00:31:04
came and after spending many days with him, sitting with a drink, he says: - I can not I can not I&#39;m doing, I can no longer

461
00:31:04 --> 00:31:07
I I cover her with a blanket, try to calm down,

462
00:31:07 --> 00:31:12
and then the boy falls, holds a handful of sand. Where did it come from? I do not have a house of sand.

463
00:31:12 --> 00:31:14
He has a whole bunch.

464
00:31:14 --> 00:31:19
He goes to her mother and tosses it to her straight to drink.

465
00:31:19 --> 00:31:24
It was everything she had, and he destroyed it, just like that ...

466
00:31:24 --> 00:31:29
It was at this very confident. - Guess what? This shit goes straight there.

467
00:31:29 --> 00:31:33
I was knocked out of the legs, because my girls in my life that something like this is not done.

468
00:31:33 --> 00:31:37
Do not have gone to them by the thought that you could do something like that. But they are fucked up.

469
00:31:37 --> 00:31:43
One day my five-year broke a toy. She demanded that I destroy her sister&#39;s toy,

470
00:31:43 --> 00:31:46
to be fair.

471
00:31:46 --> 00:31:49
And I did ...

472
00:31:49 --> 00:31:54
Here is what she did with me. I destroyed this little toy, I felt terrible, sobbed,

473
00:31:54 --> 00:31:59
I looked at her, she had this bizarre, horrible smirk on his face ...

474
00:31:59 --> 00:32:03
Here&#39;s the difference between boys and girls. And really, this translates into differences between men and women.

475
00:32:03 --> 00:32:09
Because a man can steal your car, burn your house to the ground, or kick you into oblivion,

476
00:32:09 --> 00:32:14
but a woman can ruin your life. You see the difference?

477
00:32:14 --> 00:32:20
The guy cut off your arm and throw it into the river, but your humanity will leave untouched.

478
00:32:20 --> 00:32:23
There will be smashed who you are.

479
00:32:23 --> 00:32:28
Women do not resort to violence, but nasrają you in the middle of the heart.

480
00:32:28 --> 00:32:33
With my wife we ​​live in a married about nine years, so we are at the finish line.

481
00:32:33 --> 00:32:40
After nine years and two children start to think: - Nah ... We will not unless it anymore? Who would want that?

482
00:32:40 --> 00:32:45
For some time we went to therapy and the therapist once said - should go on a date.

483
00:32:45 --> 00:32:52
I said: - Screw you. I do not want ... once went on a date with my wife, but I do not call her. On average, I had fun.

484
00:32:52 --> 00:32:56
Some things are easier when you are in a marriage, you better understand more look at ourselves.

485
00:32:56 --> 00:33:01
We spend a large part due to attempts to change the other person, then we realize what we bring to the pool.

486
00:33:01 --> 00:33:02
Then we blame the other side a little bit less.

487
00:33:02 --> 00:33:05
My wife has never let me fly, I know. But now a little different look to it.

488
00:33:05 --> 00:33:10
Pissed off, I used to say: - Do not fucking with me for months. How can I do this?

489
00:33:10 --> 00:33:16
Now, I look at myself and say: - How the hell had sex for so many years ?! He fucked me so many years!

490
00:33:16 --> 00:33:19
It is rather certain that she did not like most of these pieprznięć.

491
00:33:19 --> 00:33:24
Which means that many times sacrificed for the team, you have to respect that.

492
00:33:24 --> 00:33:28
Because I ... I think women really hard sex comes when too much do not want to.

493
00:33:28 --> 00:33:32
This is not a skill that usually have. Guys - yes. We have different sexual abilities.

494
00:33:32 --> 00:33:38
Men can fuck - anything. We do not care about it, we will fuck you even if you do not like it you know.

495
00:33:38 --> 00:33:45
We will fuck you even if you do not want to fuck you. Even if it is hard - Give me a moment, I&#39;ll find a way.

496
00:33:45 --> 00:33:47
We do not care about anything. Fuck .. things.

497
00:33:47 --> 00:33:54
We go all the keyhole on the donkey ass shit we care. The lower the demand. We do not care.

498
00:33:54 --> 00:33:59
Women have a different skill, it is to decide whether to have sex, with the help of reason.

499
00:33:59 --> 00:34:01
What amazes me personally.

500
00:34:01 --> 00:34:06
A woman may decide she does not want to fuck in the middle of fucking!

501
00:34:06 --> 00:34:10
It is strange to me. They can just stop, because something from the environment it dissipated.

502
00:34:10 --> 00:34:16
If I fuck you, and you pokazałabyś me a picture of you, shut-off head of my mother, I would say:

503
00:34:16 --> 00:34:18
- Woah,

504
00:34:18 --> 00:34:22
As soon as I finish orgasm, we need to talk.

505
00:34:22 --> 00:34:25
It really ... hmm ...

506
00:34:25 --> 00:34:32
Because I have to be drained. I need it. This is needed. From the day when was 12 years old I did not leave a single day.

507
00:34:32 --> 00:34:38
Draining every day. A sex practiced up twenty times, so ... most of the work is handmade.

508
00:34:38 --> 00:34:44
You know what? Wala horse far too much and it makes me sad. I do not know why. Perhaps because it is terribly selfish.

509
00:34:44 --> 00:34:46
I know it&#39;s wrong, I know that someone somewhere that I hurt.

510
00:34:46 --> 00:34:49
Something is wrong with it. One day I came up with, that you can determine how bad the man after

511
00:34:49 --> 00:34:54
how soon after the attacks on the WTC masturbating, how long waited.

512
00:34:54 --> 00:34:59
And I - I not lived to see the collapse of the second tower. That I am.

513
00:34:59 --> 00:35:05
I had to do, it was a compulsion. &quot;Otherwise they would have won,&quot; I say so myself. It was a tough time for all of us.

514
00:35:05 --> 00:35:10
I know that everyone odczekaliście week because you are amazing, I did not give advice.

515
00:35:10 --> 00:35:13
An erection is an erection, you need to get rid of it somehow.

516
00:35:13 --> 00:35:14
Erections destroy everything.

517
00:35:14 --> 00:35:17
I honestly do not hate erections, every one I&#39;ve had in my life.

518
00:35:17 --> 00:35:21
I remember my first, I was 9 years old. It is the worst in the life of a little boy, that you start to have erections when you are 9 years old.

519
00:35:21 --> 00:35:24
I do not climax for the next three.

520
00:35:24 --> 00:35:28
That means three years of malicious erections,

521
00:35:28 --> 00:35:33
who do not want to leave until you pass out, moaning in a ditch somewhere.

522
00:35:33 --> 00:35:34
You wake up, and he&#39;s still hard!

523
00:35:34 --> 00:35:38
It&#39;s terrible. If you see a 9-year-old on the street, just give him 20 bucks, because it is very unfortunate.

524
00:35:38 --> 00:35:43
Or possij his junk, whatever you think it happy.

525
00:35:43 --> 00:35:48
I remember when I was 9 years old when I drive, I did not know why or what to do,

526
00:35:48 --> 00:35:55
simply I brushed dick about things. So much did. About everything, if I found myself in front of the car, I pushed him to the car.

527
00:35:55 --> 00:35:59
This warmed by the sun, pleasant.

528
00:35:59 --> 00:36:04
I was coming back from the school run, to move the whole house. I fucked this house. The walls, floor ...

529
00:36:04 --> 00:36:07
If you left the 9-year-old son at home, just fucks your house. Because they just do.

530
00:36:07 --> 00:36:14
We had a couch in the house, she was my bitch. All day her fucked. I advanced, without any results, frustrated.

531
00:36:14 --> 00:36:18
I did also his chujkowi strange things like pressing it from the refrigerator door, I do not know why.

532
00:36:18 --> 00:36:24
I wanted to feel some pressure. I liked it, as one party is metal, the other rubber, closed with a magnet ...

533
00:36:24 --> 00:36:27
Coolness caressed me on eggs ...

534
00:36:27 --> 00:36:32
- It is well, well, I do not know why, it&#39;s okay.

535
00:36:32 --> 00:36:36
I do not see how you ever passed. Because I was this bad, I still am,

536
00:36:36 --> 00:36:41
I never understood that some guests are so confident, they can go out with a girl, lean, kiss and so on,

537
00:36:41 --> 00:36:46
I could not, I would say something like: - I CAN ... YOU fuck ?!

538
00:36:46 --> 00:36:50
I remember once I was a girl, I was 20, I did have a stand-up, I played in Washington.

539
00:36:50 --> 00:36:55
After the performance, one of the waitresses came over to my hotel room was lovely, we started to caress the hotel,

540
00:36:55 --> 00:37:00
she likes it, until clings to me. So I direct my hand under her blouse, and she holds me back.

541
00:37:00 --> 00:37:06
I said: - Well, okay. We cherish on, touch her butt, and she holds me back. After some time, she went home.

542
00:37:06 --> 00:37:11
Nothing happened. The next time we met, she asked: - Hey, what happened that night?

543
00:37:11 --> 00:37:16
I was like - what? She: - How the hell had sex?

544
00:37:16 --> 00:37:21
I answered: - Because ... you would not. - And I wanted it very much. - So why me powstrzymywałaś?

545
00:37:21 --> 00:37:25
- Because I wanted to, you still continued.

546
00:37:25 --> 00:37:30
I asked: - What is this? - Well, I&#39;m a little strange turns me when a guy does not stand up, pressed to the ground and fucks.

547
00:37:30 --> 00:37:32
I am very winds.

548
00:37:32 --> 00:37:35
I said: - You could tell me, definitely I&#39;d do it for you.

549
00:37:35 --> 00:37:37
She does not! It must be real and a little dangerous.

550
00:37:37 --> 00:37:39
- Have you gone mad ?! WHORE

551
00:37:39 --> 00:37:45
Do you think you zgwałciłbym hoping and little chance that you&#39;ll like it?

552
00:37:45 --> 00:37:50
That idiot thinks - I think I like her rape, I&#39;m not sure ...

553
00:37:50 --> 00:37:55
I suspect that you may like being raped, it may just be hanging around.

554
00:37:55 --> 00:38:01
But I do not ask, it would spoil everything. I&#39;ll risk it and rape, what the hell. What harm could happen?

555
00:38:01 --> 00:38:03
In any case, it&#39;s already behind me, sex gone.

556
00:38:03 --> 00:38:08
It was my only wife. It&#39;s sad, because my wife is beautiful. I love to look at her, pity her,

557
00:38:08 --> 00:38:14
She is wonderful. Over 40 years, and it looks great. Not because I look younger, she looks her age.

558
00:38:14 --> 00:38:19
But I like it. I think it&#39;s very sexy. I like women-WOMEN. It&#39;s a big change.

559
00:38:19 --> 00:38:22
Has gray strands in her hair, in my opinion, is a sexy, really.

560
00:38:22 --> 00:38:27
He has strong arms of raising children. It is strong and sexy, on a completely different level, you know?

561
00:38:27 --> 00:38:33
It&#39;s changing. It smells different. Her eyes were blue, they are now black. Terribly deep.

562
00:38:33 --> 00:38:37
It looks a little like crazy. With these wrinkles on the face after all the shit that got me.

563
00:38:37 --> 00:38:40
You can see her character.

564
00:38:40 --> 00:38:47
It looks a bit like those farmers of the Dust Bowl (the period in the 30&#39;s &quot;twentieth century., When a huge ecological disaster affected villages USA)

565
00:38:47 --> 00:38:50
It is very strong, like me, shakes me. That&#39;s why I like women. Women-WOMEN, you know.

566
00:38:50 --> 00:38:55
The girls had long since finished with them. 22-year-old - cross the road. Go .. drink, whatever you&#39;re doing there.

567
00:38:55 --> 00:38:57
Have fun. - Wooooo!

568
00:38:57 --> 00:38:58
It&#39;s not for me.

569
00:38:58 --> 00:39:04
I like women. I know this may offend 22-year-old girls. - I am a woman, I&#39;m 22 years old, I am definitely a woman.

570
00:39:04 --> 00:39:07
(...), I&#39;m a woman!

571
00:39:07 --> 00:39:12
Not for me, sorry. To me, you&#39;re not a woman until you give birth to a few children, and your personal life ends up in the toilet.

572
00:39:12 --> 00:39:17
You become a woman, the little people coming out of your vagina and trample thy dreams.

573
00:39:17 --> 00:39:20
If after all that still stand upright, you Woman.

574
00:39:20 --> 00:39:23
If you&#39;re silly, you go to the clubs, with a ponytail and skirt,

575
00:39:23 --> 00:39:30
You stand and wait for the entrance, outside the 2 degrees, you&#39;re in this skirt - But it will be great! You&#39;re a girl!

576
00:39:30 --> 00:39:36
I would give you a sweater and drove home. Blaming himself for you, but do not want to go, or be associated.

577
00:39:36 --> 00:39:41
Okay, I want to fuck you, but you would not want to, so fuck you anyway.

578
00:39:41 --> 00:39:45
Yes, definitely I would have you passed. But...

579
00:39:45 --> 00:39:51
That is the difference between girls and women and it is not about age. Not without reason was a film &quot;Wild Girls&quot;.

580
00:39:51 --> 00:39:56
And not &quot;wild women.&quot; Because no one would buy slabs of feral women.

581
00:39:56 --> 00:39:58
Because when girls grow wild, show people tits.

582
00:39:58 --> 00:40:02
When women grow wild, they kill men,

583
00:40:02 --> 00:40:04
and children drown in the bathtub. They do wild women.

584
00:40:04 --> 00:40:09
No one show tits. They fuck in bras. Here&#39;s the whole story.

585
00:40:09 --> 00:40:15
Try to take a picture of 40-Letná wife mode when coming out of the shower - Fuck you! Get the fuck out of here!

586
00:40:15 --> 00:40:20
This is not funny. You thought it would be sweet, and here - Fuck you!

587
00:40:20 --> 00:40:21
- Forgive...

588
00:40:21 --> 00:40:26
Because she has no boobs. She has breasts. You need to check and maintain.

589
00:40:26 --> 00:40:31
I get bills for my wife&#39;s breasts, these are matters of mature women.

590
00:40:31 --> 00:40:36
Girls have boobs, with small, joyful suteczkami. This is great.

591
00:40:36 --> 00:40:41
But you&#39;re not a woman, as long as you do not have długaśnych, wyżutych nipples.

592
00:40:41 --> 00:40:46
Oh, and you are not a man until you suck one such breast, by the way.

593
00:40:46 --> 00:40:51
Thanks a lot, I hope you spent the time! Thanks! Good night.

594
00:40:51 --> 00:40:54

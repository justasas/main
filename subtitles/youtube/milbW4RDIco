yeah

7
00:00:21 --> 00:00:25
good evening

8
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
the bomb isn&#39;t likely to drop certainly
not in the near future

9
00:00:28 --> 00:00:31
although the Russian invasion of
Afghanistan has heightened tension

10
00:00:31 --> 00:00:34
between East and West few believed that
a nuclear war is imminent

11
00:00:34 --> 00:00:38
but what the Afghan crisis has made us
do is examine what preparations have

12
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
been made to enable you and me as
opposed to government to survive a

13
00:00:41 --> 00:00:42
nuclear attack

14
00:00:42 --> 00:00:46
Britain civil defense corps was
disbanded in 1968 and since then most

15
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
people seem to have wanted to avoid the
subject altogether they think either

16
00:00:50 --> 00:00:54
that there&#39;ll be no nuclear war or that
no one will survive it

17
00:00:54 --> 00:00:58
both assumptions are questionable in
this film we&#39;ve attempted to find out

18
00:00:58 --> 00:01:00
how many could survive a nuclear attack

19
00:01:00 --> 00:01:03
what life would be like after such a
catastrophe and what&#39;s being done to

20
00:01:03 --> 00:01:04
help us survive

21
00:01:04 --> 00:01:08
you may find some of this film
disturbing but as long as we remain a

22
00:01:08 --> 00:01:11
likely target for attack we must think
about the unthinkable

23
00:01:11 --> 00:01:14
if the bomb drops

24
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
after a nuclear war the whole of Europe
could become a vast an inhabitable

25
00:01:18 --> 00:01:19
desert

26
00:01:19 --> 00:01:23
no industrial society nothing that we
would recognize as government would

27
00:01:23 --> 00:01:26
survive there would be a state of total
anarchy

28
00:01:26 --> 00:01:30
with all those who remained alive pray
two bands of savage Marauders with

29
00:01:30 --> 00:01:36
disease rampant and violent death
commonplace in an all-out nuclear war to

30
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
use the word survival is idiotic

31
00:01:38 --> 00:01:42
the apocalyptic words of general sir
john hackett former commander-in-chief

32
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
of NATO&#39;s northern army group a
catastrophe with untold loss of life

33
00:01:46 --> 00:01:51
an inferno from which there will be no
recovery in the popular mind if the

34
00:01:51 --> 00:01:55
results of nuclear war are to be so
awesomely destructive

35
00:01:55 --> 00:01:58
there is nothing to be gained by
preparing for survival afterwards

36
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
for 12 years

37
00:02:01 --> 00:02:04
civil defense equipment has lain in
warehouses gathering dust

38
00:02:04 --> 00:02:08
so to have fresh thoughts about our
survival if war came tomorrow

39
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
most of us would die with better
preparations

40
00:02:11 --> 00:02:16
most of us could survive if people are
adequately informed and could take

41
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
adequate preparations as you could
reduce your casualty level to about

42
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
thirty percent in other words we have
something like seven sixty five cent

43
00:02:23 --> 00:02:27
percent survivors and it&#39;s those people
that we&#39;ve got to do something about and

44
00:02:27 --> 00:02:31
that&#39;s the whole resin debt for civil
defense

45
00:02:31 --> 00:02:35
it&#39;s no good having weapons to fight for
the freedom of the west and while our

46
00:02:35 --> 00:02:35
boys are dying

47
00:02:35 --> 00:02:38
the front the last thought they have is
that the people back home are not going

48
00:02:38 --> 00:02:39
to survive either

49
00:02:39 --> 00:02:42
so what&#39;s the point of the whole bloody
mess

50
00:02:42 --> 00:02:45
yeah

51
00:02:45 --> 00:02:49
the belief that the next war will be the
last one isn&#39;t new

52
00:02:49 --> 00:02:54
HG Wells is 1936 film things to come
reflected contemporary military thinking

53
00:02:54 --> 00:02:57
when it showed the bomber as the
ultimate weapon of destruction

54
00:02:57 --> 00:03:01
Paul has broken out suddenly there may
be an air raid the streets can be

55
00:03:01 --> 00:03:01
dangerous

56
00:03:01 --> 00:03:06
do not a simple in crowds keeping dogs
go can take refuge in the underground

57
00:03:06 --> 00:03:10
railways go get the square

58
00:03:10 --> 00:03:15
the film cause panic in the streets for
years later when these scenes had become

59
00:03:15 --> 00:03:16
a reality

60
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
many of those who took to the shelters
did so believing it was the end of

61
00:03:19 --> 00:03:22
civilization

62
00:03:22 --> 00:03:27
they were wrong so too was the belief
that such powerful weapons could so

63
00:03:27 --> 00:03:30
frightened politicians that war could be
prevented

64
00:03:30 --> 00:03:35
today after Afghanistan the Doomsday
Clock of the association of Atomic

65
00:03:35 --> 00:03:39
Scientists stands at seven minutes to
midnight closer to nuclear war than at

66
00:03:39 --> 00:03:44
any time since the two superpowers gain
the bomb the Soviet Union appears to

67
00:03:44 --> 00:03:48
believe that her civil defense program
means that most of her people could

68
00:03:48 --> 00:03:48
survive

69
00:03:48 --> 00:03:52
it&#39;s yet another undermining of the
delicate balance of terror known as

70
00:03:52 --> 00:03:57
mutually assured destruction seems that
the Russians do not accept at least the

71
00:03:57 --> 00:04:00
mutual part of a short destruction
because what

72
00:04:00 --> 00:04:05
mutually assured destruction meant as a
theory was that you in a sense bad your

73
00:04:05 --> 00:04:06
breasts to the enemy

74
00:04:06 --> 00:04:11
you took no defensive measures you
accepted the fact that you remained

75
00:04:11 --> 00:04:16
absolutely vulnerable to his attack and
then there would be an element of

76
00:04:16 --> 00:04:19
stability because if he had enough
weapons to attack you being vulnerable

77
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
and you had enough weapons to attack him
being vulnerable

78
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
there was a deterrent mechanism at work

79
00:04:25 --> 00:04:28
the travel is the Russians didn&#39;t seem
to accept this part of adoption and so

80
00:04:28 --> 00:04:32
they have developed a substantial civil
defense program think anything that they

81
00:04:32 --> 00:04:36
might come to the point of the strategic
nuclear exchange and then if that were

82
00:04:36 --> 00:04:43
so they want to lose less bad in the
United States today the nuclear arsenals

83
00:04:43 --> 00:04:46
are bigger than they&#39;ve ever be an
average of three tons of high explosives

84
00:04:46 --> 00:04:47
for every man

85
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
woman and child on earth many would
agree that the greater the number of

86
00:04:51 --> 00:04:51
weapons

87
00:04:51 --> 00:04:56
the greater the chance of there being
used in a small overcrowded island like

88
00:04:56 --> 00:04:59
ours is there any point in trying to
protect ourselves

89
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
how many of the missiles might be
targeted on Britain

90
00:05:02 --> 00:05:08
I think that they would be looking at
something like x 200 targets in the

91
00:05:08 --> 00:05:12
united kingdom and perhaps allocating
nearly as many as 400 weapons to the

92
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
destruction of those targets given that
they went all all go off or work today I

93
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
mean if I took map the United Kingdom
and I put pins in for all the minister

94
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
targets which I think they would be
interested in there would not be many

95
00:05:21 --> 00:05:26
parts in our kingdom which would not
have pinzon on or is the sixth nineteen

96
00:05:26 --> 00:05:30
forty-five an American plane dropped a
bomb called little boy on the city of

97
00:05:30 --> 00:05:31
Hiroshima

98
00:05:31 --> 00:05:36
even now people are dying from the after
effects of that explosion today weapons

99
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
are a thousand times more powerful

100
00:05:38 --> 00:05:43
the common view is that if we don&#39;t all
die immediately radiation will kill as

101
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
painfully over the years

102
00:05:45 --> 00:05:50
Bruce Sibley is a scientist who has
studied ways of coping with radiation

103
00:05:50 --> 00:05:56
I can tell you that all of the data in
the last three decades convinces me that

104
00:05:56 --> 00:06:00
although will be catastrophic damage in
the cities and that millions of people

105
00:06:00 --> 00:06:04
died as a result of the initial effects
of the weapon and the initial radiation

106
00:06:04 --> 00:06:09
long-term wise over the over the decades
that we have to survive and build a new

107
00:06:09 --> 00:06:15
society people will be able to grow food
on contaminated land and monitor it

108
00:06:15 --> 00:06:19
carefully and keep that level down that
goes into the bodies and minimize the

109
00:06:19 --> 00:06:24
number of deaths that will occur over
the decades as regards increases in

110
00:06:24 --> 00:06:28
leukemia cancer and genetic

111
00:06:28 --> 00:06:33
some things like this I mean the sort of
proportions we&#39;re talking about are

112
00:06:33 --> 00:06:37
rather similar to what we live with
every day of our lives in peace time we

113
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
don&#39;t worry about deaths on the road

114
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
we don&#39;t worry about that we don&#39;t
appear to worry about deaths on the road

115
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
we don&#39;t appear to worry about accidents
in the hospitals that case is coming

116
00:06:46 --> 00:06:51
into the hospital as people being killed
in in work and people were dying in

117
00:06:51 --> 00:06:55
hospital France smoking all of these
statistics we live with every day of our

118
00:06:55 --> 00:06:55
lives

119
00:06:55 --> 00:06:58
and yet once we start to talk about
nuclear war casualties in the aftermath

120
00:06:58 --> 00:07:02
. where people are eating contaminated
food with radioactivity in it

121
00:07:02 --> 00:07:06
we start getting very excited because I
scientists might say well 200 people out

122
00:07:06 --> 00:07:10
of a million who have eaten crops that
are contaminated may die of leukemia

123
00:07:10 --> 00:07:16
these are the facts of nuclear war life
being exchanged for the fact that we

124
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
live with today in peace

125
00:07:19 --> 00:07:25
Mieses bluff Arizona the American
burning corporation simulates a nuclear

126
00:07:25 --> 00:07:28
explosion

127
00:07:28 --> 00:07:32
the normal assumption is that explosions
like this would destroy our highly

128
00:07:32 --> 00:07:43
industrialized society and centers back
hundreds of years but in this experiment

129
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
only half a mile away

130
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
boeing had buried some of the equipment
which might be needed to start industry

131
00:07:48 --> 00:07:53
working again in four days a team of
eight men had died it all up again and

132
00:07:53 --> 00:07:57
reassemble the factory in spite of the
closeness of the blast most of the

133
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
equipment was astonishingly unscathed

134
00:07:59 --> 00:08:06
so protecting industry is possible and
the Russians estimate they can limit

135
00:08:06 --> 00:08:10
their civilian casualties to only five
percent Britain&#39;s precautions are

136
00:08:10 --> 00:08:16
somewhat further behind present planning
does not envisage issue of the Anderson

137
00:08:16 --> 00:08:22
type shelters that were issued in the
last war now doubtless you&#39;ve been

138
00:08:22 --> 00:08:27
regaled by many tales from your mother&#39;s
and father&#39;s about the hours they spent

139
00:08:27 --> 00:08:32
an Anderson shelters in the last war at
the home defence college at easing world

140
00:08:32 --> 00:08:36
near york a briefing for the men who run
Britain after the bomb

141
00:08:36 --> 00:08:41
well it&#39;s thought that the transition to
war or a possible war will start with

142
00:08:41 --> 00:08:46
the phase of international attention of
some weeks and during this period . such

143
00:08:46 --> 00:08:51
actions do not appear provocative to an
enemy or too disturbing to the general

144
00:08:51 --> 00:08:55
public will be put into effect and for
president planning purposes today some

145
00:08:55 --> 00:08:59
three to four weeks is allowed for local
authorities to implement the war

146
00:08:59 --> 00:09:00
emergency plans

147
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
this is the nub of Britain civil defense
policy

148
00:09:03 --> 00:09:08
Britain&#39;s plans are based on the
questionable assumption that they&#39;ll be

149
00:09:08 --> 00:09:14
at least three or four weeks warning of
nuclear attack during that time the

150
00:09:14 --> 00:09:17
government intends to print and
distribute this booklet to every home in

151
00:09:17 --> 00:09:21
the country but while the planners are
banking on three weeks warning of

152
00:09:21 --> 00:09:25
nuclear attack her majesty&#39;s stationery
office safe will take at least four

153
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
weeks just to print the booklet

154
00:09:27 --> 00:09:32
if you&#39;re basing your planning on an
assumption that you will get three weeks

155
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
warning i think that&#39;s great for state
and I think that given the readiness of

156
00:09:35 --> 00:09:42
modern weapons for example one could
imagine a nuclear exchange taking place

157
00:09:42 --> 00:09:44
within 48-72 hours

158
00:09:44 --> 00:09:48
it certainly isn&#39;t going to take more
than 48 to 72 hours to start to savor

159
00:09:48 --> 00:09:54
divisions in east germany railing
westwards then responds to an urgent

160
00:09:54 --> 00:09:59
appeal by the freedom-loving peoples of
Western Europe there at army launched

161
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
attacks to crush provocations by the
aggressive NATO forces

162
00:10:02 --> 00:10:07
by the second day fraternal forces of
the Warsaw Pact having liberated large

163
00:10:07 --> 00:10:11
areas of West Germany service across the
river rhine a lightning attack with

164
00:10:11 --> 00:10:15
nuclear war possibly only hours away
would cut the ground from under Britain

165
00:10:15 --> 00:10:18
civil defense we have no plans for this
situation

166
00:10:18 --> 00:10:22
only the most primitive advice could be
issued two are unprotected population

167
00:10:22 --> 00:10:28
the third day remnants of NATO air power
to launch the barbers and unprincipled

168
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31

169
00:10:31 --> 00:10:34
yeah

170
00:10:34 --> 00:10:38
is heated on all France the imperialists
treacherously launch atomic weapon

171
00:10:38 --> 00:10:42
the socialist camp was reluctantly
forced to respond with weapons of huge

172
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
destructive power

173
00:10:44 --> 00:10:50
surviving this depends upon information
and currently Britain&#39;s population is

174
00:10:50 --> 00:10:58
among the most ill informed in Europe
three days before the feared attack the

175
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
government will order the broadcasting
authorities to transmit a series of

176
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
official films telling people what to do

177
00:11:03 --> 00:11:11
these films are secret but we have
managed to obtain copies of them they&#39;ve

178
00:11:11 --> 00:11:15
never been seen before and won&#39;t be seen
again until nuclear war is imminent

179
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
their advice is intended to be
reassuring

180
00:11:18 --> 00:11:24
the time has now come to make everything
ready for you and your family in case an

181
00:11:24 --> 00:11:25
air attack happens

182
00:11:25 --> 00:11:29
this does not mean that war is bound to
come but there is a risk of this and we

183
00:11:29 --> 00:11:32
must all be prepared for it

184
00:11:32 --> 00:11:37
when you hear the attack warning you and
your family must take cover at once

185
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
do not stay out of doors

186
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
if you are caught in the open lie down

187
00:11:43 --> 00:11:50
since its official policy to inform
people only when war is imminent

188
00:11:50 --> 00:11:54
it&#39;s reasonable to ask what armed with
this ignorance people would expect to do

189
00:11:54 --> 00:11:55
you do if you had a warning

190
00:11:55 --> 00:12:00
run for it and understand that now I&#39;ll
be totally unprepared

191
00:12:00 --> 00:12:04
would you know what to do if you heard
sirens sound good out of it

192
00:12:04 --> 00:12:08
what would you do and if I was you I&#39;d
come and get the kids and what would you

193
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
do then drive and countryside&#39;s on it

194
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
I sitar minute got any way

195
00:12:12 --> 00:12:17
that Indian idea when you take any
preparations a tool

196
00:12:17 --> 00:12:21
what progress you got a better engine
you hadn&#39;t yet been written about it

197
00:12:21 --> 00:12:25
you&#39;ve got it in you and the West crimes
bill busy

198
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
what would you do

199
00:12:27 --> 00:12:32
I haven&#39;t built shelters for anybody i&#39;m
like see what&#39;s happening with a little

200
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
bum ya

201
00:12:34 --> 00:12:38
scattered everything runs down the jobs
or you won&#39;t have to happen but roses

202
00:12:38 --> 00:12:48
the advice to stay at home is followed
by instructions on how to make a fallout

203
00:12:48 --> 00:12:54
shelter here more cracks begin to appear
in Britain civil defense theories we

204
00:12:54 --> 00:12:57
asked a Yorkshire family to build a
fallout shelter following the government

205
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
recommended design

206
00:13:00 --> 00:13:06
they found that it required 100 plastic
bags or similar containers access to a

207
00:13:06 --> 00:13:11
garden the strength to dig and carry
over a ton of Earth and floor joists

208
00:13:11 --> 00:13:17
strong enough to bear that sort of
weight they and every other family are

209
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
also advised to buy and take with them
enough food to last a fortnight

210
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
assuming the shops could meet that sort
of sudden demand

211
00:13:23 --> 00:13:28
this is to be home at least four days
and possibly weeks

212
00:13:28 --> 00:13:31
do you really think it&#39;s wise to bring
the dog in with you

213
00:13:31 --> 00:13:36
well with a ten-year-old daughter thinks
the world of the double have no

214
00:13:36 --> 00:13:36
alternative

215
00:13:36 --> 00:13:39
what do you think conditions will be
like in here after a couple weeks

216
00:13:39 --> 00:13:46
critical that would serve those what can
you do if you leave your home your local

217
00:13:46 --> 00:13:51
authority may take it over for homeless
families and if you&#39;re more the

218
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
authorities in the new place will not
help you with food accommodation or

219
00:13:55 --> 00:13:56
other essentials

220
00:13:56 --> 00:13:59
you are better off in your own home

221
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
stay there

222
00:14:02 --> 00:14:12
I would call it neglect and die in its
present form because i don&#39;t think

223
00:14:12 --> 00:14:16
anyone could survive in the cities in
make-shift shelters

224
00:14:16 --> 00:14:19
it&#39;s absolutely preposterous to expect
anyone to survive under those conditions

225
00:14:19 --> 00:14:23
but with respect i mean the guests
coming would publish a book like that

226
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
unless it had researched into its
effectiveness

227
00:14:25 --> 00:14:30
well I i can tell you that I&#39;ve worked
in civil defense for some 25 years and

228
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
the literature that was being churned
out in the fifties is practically the

229
00:14:33 --> 00:14:38
same as what we now have been protect
and survive this this idea of turning a

230
00:14:38 --> 00:14:43
table and putting against a wall and and
surrounding it with cushions and and

231
00:14:43 --> 00:14:49
painting the windows white and bringing
in enough food to last for a fortnight

232
00:14:49 --> 00:14:53
into the room so you can live in this
room for a fortnight I mean good heavens

233
00:14:53 --> 00:14:58
if this building is in the target area
and it shattered broken in some way then

234
00:14:58 --> 00:15:02
the fallout dust which comes down
immediately after the explosion in high

235
00:15:02 --> 00:15:07
levels very heavy dust the initial stuff
that comes down this will be very very

236
00:15:07 --> 00:15:11
highly radioactive it will not be
stopped by cushions it will not be

237
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
stopped by wood and the people that are
sheltering in that makeshift shelter

238
00:15:14 --> 00:15:19
will certainly be be be dead within a
few days to a few weeks from radiation

239
00:15:19 --> 00:15:24
sickness on the outskirts of Geneva the
house of Monsieur Marcel guy

240
00:15:24 --> 00:15:27
there&#39;s nothing special about Monsieur
guy or about his house

241
00:15:27 --> 00:15:31
it happens to have a fallout shelter in
the basement but then so does every

242
00:15:31 --> 00:15:37
Swiss home built since nineteen sixty
without getting out

243
00:15:37 --> 00:15:42
stay for today&#39;s images and have you got
food supplies in there sufficient for 14

244
00:15:42 --> 00:15:42
days

245
00:15:42 --> 00:15:53
yes you can see it&#39;s not what do you got
here then

246
00:15:53 --> 00:16:02
well sugar some spaghetti and so on and
frozen food in here

247
00:16:02 --> 00:16:06
what about the problem of ventilating an
area like this with six people in it who

248
00:16:06 --> 00:16:10
any of the ventilation system which can
be used without the filter which is here

249
00:16:10 --> 00:16:12
or if necessary

250
00:16:12 --> 00:16:17
here we go to the filters I would that
filter removal radioactivity for example

251
00:16:17 --> 00:16:18
and yes yes it will

252
00:16:18 --> 00:16:23
it&#39;s made appreciate the printer people
this what you can conditions will be

253
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
like down here if you had to spend a
fortnight

254
00:16:25 --> 00:16:32
well it&#39;s not there it&#39;s here but i
think but if you have the choice between

255
00:16:32 --> 00:16:39
leaving outside and I outside and
leaving here a little small space just

256
00:16:39 --> 00:16:46
she chose to believe in here before any
new houses built in Switzerland shelter

257
00:16:46 --> 00:16:50
plans have to be approved by the local
civil defense Authority half the extra

258
00:16:50 --> 00:16:54
cost is paid by the government and in
another 10 years they&#39;ll be shelters for

259
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
the entire population

260
00:16:57 --> 00:17:00
the Swiss government estimates that the
whole of their civil defense including

261
00:17:00 --> 00:17:05
shelters and training people in the
basic tasks like firefighting cost about

262
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
10 pounds per head per year

263
00:17:07 --> 00:17:12
it is of course easy for a small neutral
and above all wealthy country to believe

264
00:17:12 --> 00:17:16
in civil defense in this country the
home office is now reconsidering

265
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
Britain&#39;s precautions but here the
priorities are different

266
00:17:19 --> 00:17:22
why is it that we don&#39;t have a shelter
policy in this country because of the

267
00:17:22 --> 00:17:23
enormous expense

268
00:17:23 --> 00:17:28
it&#39;s simply too expensive if you&#39;re
talking about a communal shelter policy

269
00:17:28 --> 00:17:31
yes we&#39;re talking about billions and
billions and billions of pounds

270
00:17:31 --> 00:17:38
the amount in at the beginning of of
when I took office I spent a year was

271
00:17:38 --> 00:17:44
nineteen point eight million pounds and
that had been going up in real terms so

272
00:17:44 --> 00:17:47
it&#39;s staying the same in real terms the
amount of the total amount of being

273
00:17:47 --> 00:17:52
going up but thats left less than 50
pence per head of the populations in it

274
00:17:52 --> 00:17:58
if you say so yeah well did was it your
feeling for that was an adequate figure

275
00:17:58 --> 00:18:03
well it was it was adequate for the
threat that existed at the time isn&#39;t

276
00:18:03 --> 00:18:06
easy you know I think to have to go to
Parliament and have to come to the

277
00:18:06 --> 00:18:12
country and try to provide answers to
very difficult questions because we

278
00:18:12 --> 00:18:14
believe that this has got to be done

279
00:18:14 --> 00:18:17
we&#39;ve embarked on this revealed if
you&#39;ve embarked upon the review is that

280
00:18:17 --> 00:18:20
some indication that the government may
be prepared to substantially increase

281
00:18:20 --> 00:18:23
the amount of money that spent on civil
business is what we got to look at when

282
00:18:23 --> 00:18:26
we have had a look at the options which
come out of the review

283
00:18:26 --> 00:18:28
but in any event we are likely to be
talking in terms of increased

284
00:18:28 --> 00:18:29
expenditure are we

285
00:18:29 --> 00:18:33
I&#39;m not going to burn any boats in
answer to that question at the present

286
00:18:33 --> 00:18:36
time

287
00:18:36 --> 00:18:41
immediately before an attack on Britain
the telephone lines carrying the

288
00:18:41 --> 00:18:46
Speaking Clock will be used to activate
a network of 7,000 sirens scattered all

289
00:18:46 --> 00:18:47
over the country

290
00:18:47 --> 00:18:52
Britain&#39;s early warning system is based
on the three massive radar scanners at

291
00:18:52 --> 00:18:55
filing Dale&#39;s it&#39;s the home of the
four-minute warning

292
00:18:55 --> 00:18:58
and correlated with Eva

293
00:18:58 --> 00:18:58
yeah

294
00:18:58 --> 00:19:01
go ahead get right

295
00:19:01 --> 00:19:03
yeah

296
00:19:03 --> 00:19:07
this is the senior duty officer
confidence report now

297
00:19:07 --> 00:19:10
confidence report now

298
00:19:10 --> 00:19:14
UK alarm level one missile attack threat
to us imminent

299
00:19:14 --> 00:19:17
yeah

300
00:19:17 --> 00:19:32
yeah

301
00:19:32 --> 00:19:37
megaton bomb exploded 7,000 feet about
the house apartments would create a fire

302
00:19:37 --> 00:19:42
ball over a mile across over Piccadilly
Circus Trafalgar Square the very heart

303
00:19:42 --> 00:19:46
of London the fireball would last for
approximately 10 seconds reaching inside

304
00:19:46 --> 00:19:51
in temperatures of hundreds of thousands
of degrees centigrade over an area for

305
00:19:51 --> 00:19:56
about a mile down as far as box or
bridge that he wins and 700 miles an

306
00:19:56 --> 00:20:00
hour while some of the more substantial
buildings might be left partially

307
00:20:00 --> 00:20:01
standing

308
00:20:01 --> 00:20:05
they have shifted on their foundations
anything else and human beings would

309
00:20:05 --> 00:20:08
have simply vanished

310
00:20:08 --> 00:20:12
over the entire centre of london oxford
street park lane mayfair kensington

311
00:20:12 --> 00:20:16
london town as far as the borders of
Hampstead down here on the river over

312
00:20:16 --> 00:20:21
chelsea and fulham because of the
intense change in pressure houses

313
00:20:21 --> 00:20:22
simply explode

314
00:20:22 --> 00:20:25
people

315
00:20:25 --> 00:20:29
blast would reach better see bridge with
in 11 seconds with winds of a hundred

316
00:20:29 --> 00:20:33
and eighty miles an hour out as far as
seven miles

317
00:20:33 --> 00:20:38
that&#39;s down through Putney hammersmith
Barnes as far as q bridge houses would

318
00:20:38 --> 00:20:42
have their roofs ripped off doors and
windows will be blown in

319
00:20:42 --> 00:20:46
anybody caught in the open will be blown
over their body covered with blistering

320
00:20:46 --> 00:21:09
second-degree burns should major centers
of population be hit the scenes of

321
00:21:09 --> 00:21:11
suffering and devastation will be
appalling

322
00:21:11 --> 00:21:15
rescuers will only be able to work when
there is no threat of radioactive

323
00:21:15 --> 00:21:15
fallout

324
00:21:15 --> 00:21:21
no one can guess how long it will be
before normal life resumes but some form

325
00:21:21 --> 00:21:24
of government will survive

326
00:21:24 --> 00:21:27
yeah

327
00:21:27 --> 00:21:33
there are two guards stationed
permanently outside an innocuous

328
00:21:33 --> 00:21:36
bungalow in the home counties are
building so secret we cannot show it

329
00:21:36 --> 00:21:39
yeah

330
00:21:39 --> 00:21:43
inside deep underground is the seat of
government for all of Greater London

331
00:21:43 --> 00:21:46
yeah

332
00:21:46 --> 00:21:48
yeah

333
00:21:48 --> 00:21:53
200 civil servants soldiers policemen
and engineers have been designated to

334
00:21:53 --> 00:21:56
come here in time of war after the
attack

335
00:21:56 --> 00:22:01
they attempt to carry on the business of
government for weeks possibly months in

336
00:22:01 --> 00:22:02
the planet jargon

337
00:22:02 --> 00:22:08
this is known as a sub regional control
nuclear war will shatter national

338
00:22:08 --> 00:22:12
government then the highest level of
government will be in the 17 so-called

339
00:22:12 --> 00:22:16
sub-regions in England and Wales three
and Scotland and one in Northern Ireland

340
00:22:16 --> 00:22:22
its hopes later to merge england and
wales into 10 regions each under the

341
00:22:22 --> 00:22:26
control of a cabinet minister but
however need the scheme

342
00:22:26 --> 00:22:30
two of these secret headquarters aren&#39;t
yet built and in north wales the Home

343
00:22:30 --> 00:22:34
Office hasn&#39;t even found a site around
which to plan in the existing

344
00:22:34 --> 00:22:39
sub-regional bunkers government will be
one man this is the only private

345
00:22:39 --> 00:22:43
accommodation in the place and I am
better desk a telephone

346
00:22:43 --> 00:22:47
it&#39;s the office of the man will be known
as the Commissioner will be a junior

347
00:22:47 --> 00:22:51
minister someone of the rank of Timothy
reznor reg Prentiss

348
00:22:51 --> 00:22:55
by the time this office is occupied
written maybe only hours away from

349
00:22:55 --> 00:22:57
nuclear attack from this desk

350
00:22:57 --> 00:23:02
the Commissioner backed up by a team of
Whitehall civil servants will attempt to

351
00:23:02 --> 00:23:06
control what&#39;s left of the population of
Greater London across the country

352
00:23:06 --> 00:23:09
there&#39;ll be another 16 such
commissioners all of them with

353
00:23:09 --> 00:23:12
theoretical control over the police and
the army

354
00:23:12 --> 00:23:15
all of them effectively with the power
of life or death

355
00:23:15 --> 00:23:19
for weeks the two hundred civil servants
will have to remain in the sub regional

356
00:23:19 --> 00:23:21
control working as best they can

357
00:23:21 --> 00:23:25
while there be provided with the basic
necessities a bed and food they&#39;ll be

358
00:23:25 --> 00:23:29
expected to work in the full knowledge
that their families on the surface have

359
00:23:29 --> 00:23:34
only the protection afforded them by
their hastily homemade shelters the

360
00:23:34 --> 00:23:37
situation there has been made the more
difficult because of those folks who

361
00:23:37 --> 00:23:41
have ignore government requesters to
stay in their homes and who were flooded

362
00:23:41 --> 00:23:47
into the counter and if we get but
central government plans may be wildly

363
00:23:47 --> 00:23:51
optimistic in the early stages after
nuclear attack the highest level of

364
00:23:51 --> 00:23:51
government

365
00:23:51 --> 00:23:55
maybe it no more than local authority
level in the humberside county council

366
00:23:55 --> 00:24:00
bunker just outside how local government
police and fire officers soldiers and

367
00:24:00 --> 00:24:05
ladies from the WR vs a brief by the
chief executive in wartime known as the

368
00:24:05 --> 00:24:07
controller today

369
00:24:07 --> 00:24:10
down here there&#39;s a war going on

370
00:24:10 --> 00:24:14
we because of whatever the government
the takedown things people have

371
00:24:14 --> 00:24:16
purchased food for 14 days

372
00:24:16 --> 00:24:21
I guess probably not more than 25 the
same token I from God there 14-day

373
00:24:21 --> 00:24:23
supplies the food shops are strict

374
00:24:23 --> 00:24:26
we&#39;re trying to get as much food as the
campus we can we have managed to

375
00:24:26 --> 00:24:31
provision an emergency headquarters and
stand by . for police and fire but these

376
00:24:31 --> 00:24:35
five orders straight jacket

377
00:24:35 --> 00:24:40
that good district have you got a
bearing on the bond stronger hell you

378
00:24:40 --> 00:24:42
have 81 degrees fine thank you

379
00:24:42 --> 00:24:48
another one 1981 there was more than one
surprise in this exercise in addition to

380
00:24:48 --> 00:24:52
the expected attack on the RAF base at
winningly there was a second strike

381
00:24:52 --> 00:24:57
against Hell itself a civilian target
but because of its port of strategic

382
00:24:57 --> 00:25:02
importance volunteer unpaid scientific
advisors are expected to produce

383
00:25:02 --> 00:25:08
information on which decisions can be
made by the cloud formation is about the

384
00:25:08 --> 00:25:10
left one militant sighs bomb

385
00:25:10 --> 00:25:12
ranbir sister

386
00:25:12 --> 00:25:18
yes so I think we should be complex in
the blast rings shortly to controller to

387
00:25:18 --> 00:25:23
explain this is very expensive damage
was to the inner city total City Hall i

388
00:25:23 --> 00:25:32
think would be demolished later songs
from what we know now and the fallout

389
00:25:32 --> 00:25:36
plume is going to go out towards the
east coast somewhere between on sea and

390
00:25:36 --> 00:25:39
women see as the main area of my mind

391
00:25:39 --> 00:25:44
high-risk fallout from the filling bombs
know what the wheels at the winter all

392
00:25:44 --> 00:25:46
blowing in that direction of the one
pending bomb

393
00:25:46 --> 00:25:49
well if it&#39;s spinning me we&#39;re not sure
yet we haven&#39;t got a cross-reference on

394
00:25:49 --> 00:25:51
there we haven&#39;t got a confirmation on
that but it&#39;s somewhere down the road

395
00:25:51 --> 00:25:54
and he&#39;s in this area yes certainly
another bomb down there somewhere

396
00:25:54 --> 00:25:58
what time when the fallout yes what we
have for me not close this didn&#39;t know

397
00:25:58 --> 00:26:01
anything about mr. ground bus for an
effort we don&#39;t we do we don&#39;t really

398
00:26:01 --> 00:26:05
know full details you obviously down
there we&#39;re just guessing that is

399
00:26:05 --> 00:26:08
fittingly at the moment pretty
conclusive but whole being a

400
00:26:08 --> 00:26:10
groundbreaking master controller because
outside

401
00:26:10 --> 00:26:15
I&#39;m sad to say to him but all our cars
or charcoal burning father and all our

402
00:26:15 --> 00:26:20
wind screens are gone and Jason housing
around the station is on fire

403
00:26:20 --> 00:26:24
isn&#39;t that multitude the trees I&#39;ve been
demolished so we&#39;re positive is a ground

404
00:26:24 --> 00:26:30
best weapon or mexican size is extreme
damage outside of this control station

405
00:26:30 --> 00:26:33
so it explained why he felt the station
shake at the time of the explosion

406
00:26:33 --> 00:26:37
and this would mean that there is very
little that one can do for horse

407
00:26:37 --> 00:26:42
residents in the end it comes down to
one man a man with more power than he

408
00:26:42 --> 00:26:45
could ever have imagined even in his
grossest dreams or nightmares

409
00:26:45 --> 00:26:50
Keith bridge of former accountant how
much power do you have as controller as

410
00:26:50 --> 00:26:52
soon as the bomb goes off total power

411
00:26:52 --> 00:26:56
theoretically that would include power
over the police fire brigade all that

412
00:26:56 --> 00:26:58
sort of thing in life and death

413
00:26:58 --> 00:27:03
power of life and death yes what does
that mean that if people were losing it

414
00:27:03 --> 00:27:06
would be within my competence to
instructor may be executed

415
00:27:06 --> 00:27:09
would you expect that kind of situation
to arise so I possible it&#39;s feasible

416
00:27:09 --> 00:27:13
does having that kind of power total
power were you

417
00:27:13 --> 00:27:16
no not at all

418
00:27:16 --> 00:27:21
if anyone dies while you are kept in
your fallout room

419
00:27:21 --> 00:27:26
move the body to another room in the
house label the body with name and

420
00:27:26 --> 00:27:31
address and cover it as tightly as
possible in polythene paper sheets or

421
00:27:31 --> 00:27:37
blankets tie a second card to the
covering the radio will advise you want

422
00:27:37 --> 00:27:39
to do about taking the body away for
burial

423
00:27:39 --> 00:27:47
if however you have had a body in the
house for more than five days and if it

424
00:27:47 --> 00:27:51
is safe to go outside then you should
bury the body for the time being in a

425
00:27:51 --> 00:27:55
trench or cover it with earth and marked
the spot of the burial

426
00:27:55 --> 00:28:00
you remember the start of the population
about it in the exercise at how it is

427
00:28:00 --> 00:28:03
now supposed to be 14 days since the
attack

428
00:28:03 --> 00:28:07
they of course the problem with the dead
is quite serious and as we are moving

429
00:28:07 --> 00:28:12
into the urban areas then of course
wearing their coverage under we are

430
00:28:12 --> 00:28:15
around opening up quite a lot of places
where in fact we&#39;re finding various

431
00:28:15 --> 00:28:15
bodies

432
00:28:15 --> 00:28:22
what are what we are doing is that we
are running a system of collection and

433
00:28:22 --> 00:28:27
anybody indeed who has relatives or
friends who are dead

434
00:28:27 --> 00:28:30
then what would ask them to do is to
place them at the side of the road that

435
00:28:30 --> 00:28:34
we&#39;ve cleared and twice a day we are
making a collection ground and then

436
00:28:34 --> 00:28:37
disposing of those bodies in mass graves

437
00:28:37 --> 00:28:40
by now law and order would be a serious
problem

438
00:28:40 --> 00:28:45
a message for the controller a group of
30 survivors is heading for his

439
00:28:45 --> 00:28:49
headquarters demanding food they&#39;d
already killed and looted and were

440
00:28:49 --> 00:28:50
heavily armed

441
00:28:50 --> 00:28:53
although four of their number had been
captured by police the police chief

442
00:28:53 --> 00:28:58
bringing their and I was concerned for
you know when the police chief gave his

443
00:28:58 --> 00:29:02
report he seemed a bit too competent to
me about law and order i thought the

444
00:29:02 --> 00:29:07
situation was probably not as steady as
we were given to believe you know this

445
00:29:07 --> 00:29:10
is typical of the sort of thing that can
blow up at any time we&#39;ll get going to

446
00:29:10 --> 00:29:12
be in a position to bed

447
00:29:12 --> 00:29:15
just ask the police to try and have them
off when using the military if they can

448
00:29:15 --> 00:29:17
this building must be secured so that
nobody can get in here and make a

449
00:29:17 --> 00:29:18
stumbling distance of themselves

450
00:29:18 --> 00:29:21
I think you&#39;ve got to be quite draconian
in whatever punishment you choose to

451
00:29:21 --> 00:29:24
meet answer and that may mean the
ultimate sanction at the end of the day

452
00:29:24 --> 00:29:27
you have to be advised by the police on
that we&#39;re coming up please chief have

453
00:29:27 --> 00:29:28
you seen this note

454
00:29:28 --> 00:29:31
you got a copy of it can you tell us
your give us your advice please as the

455
00:29:31 --> 00:29:32
way in which we all to respond

456
00:29:32 --> 00:29:37
yes with the if these bad obviously we
were going to involve the Army is we

457
00:29:37 --> 00:29:42
possibly can because if it means usually
went to the round of the army personally

458
00:29:42 --> 00:29:44
use the records in the persons in the we
have to do

459
00:29:44 --> 00:29:49
well mr. bridge how many army personnel
have we got in this facility I mean it

460
00:29:49 --> 00:29:51
was asked the major that said because
they have other duties than looking

461
00:29:51 --> 00:29:55
after us I think that&#39;s what i thought
surely each other this is an emergency

462
00:29:55 --> 00:29:59
thank you it isn&#39;t a usual what we have
on the ground moment

463
00:29:59 --> 00:30:01
and how do you make sure that sufficient
of the armed men are armed drill if need

464
00:30:01 --> 00:30:04
be they can take a sanction to the
circuit shown that they are your

465
00:30:04 --> 00:30:05
thoughts will be elected as well

466
00:30:05 --> 00:30:08
previous record this could escalate

467
00:30:08 --> 00:30:12
unless we stop it now this could
escalate and these 30 we can find to be

468
00:30:12 --> 00:30:16
a large a larger group by the time to
get to war because obviously survival is

469
00:30:16 --> 00:30:17
the big thing in their mind

470
00:30:17 --> 00:30:21
no I look great please get on with you
liaise with the collector with the army

471
00:30:21 --> 00:30:26
certain thinking what about the for that
you could have been arrested affected

472
00:30:26 --> 00:30:32
the police will solve that and they will
come back to me in in due season but i

473
00:30:32 --> 00:30:36
suspect that the that the conclusion
will be since that we have no effective

474
00:30:36 --> 00:30:38
means of restraining people in this
situation

475
00:30:38 --> 00:30:41
some of the views of Emergency Committee
I think we may impose the article

476
00:30:41 --> 00:30:42
section at the end of the day

477
00:30:42 --> 00:30:45
could I am watching yes

478
00:30:45 --> 00:30:50
each emergency control is equipped with
its own radio station maintained by the

479
00:30:50 --> 00:30:51
BBC

480
00:30:51 --> 00:30:58
after the war the BBC would become WTB s
wartime Broadcasting Service its job and

481
00:30:58 --> 00:31:01
the job of all the media to act as an
arm of government

482
00:31:01 --> 00:31:05
humberside Keith bridge I&#39;m speaking
from the county&#39;s main headquarters of

483
00:31:05 --> 00:31:05
born

484
00:31:05 --> 00:31:09
this is an official broadcast and i will
be telling you what you must do in the

485
00:31:09 --> 00:31:10
days ahead

486
00:31:10 --> 00:31:14
among the many dangers now facing us are
rumor and panic

487
00:31:14 --> 00:31:19
we can and we will survive but only if
you listen to these instructions and

488
00:31:19 --> 00:31:20
follow them to the letter

489
00:31:20 --> 00:31:28
first of all the war is over there will
be no more bombed how difficult position

490
00:31:28 --> 00:31:32
would it be for you to be in your
shelter here and know that your family

491
00:31:32 --> 00:31:36
were outside very difficult indeed I
shouldn&#39;t very divided loyalties

492
00:31:36 --> 00:31:39
which way would you jump

493
00:31:39 --> 00:31:42
I can&#39;t possibly else answer that until
the situation arises theoretically I

494
00:31:42 --> 00:31:45
should have no problems I should be here
with you and visit uses a problem as

495
00:31:45 --> 00:31:46
regards other stuff

496
00:31:46 --> 00:31:51
oh yes without a doubt what do you think
would happen that many of them wouldn&#39;t

497
00:31:51 --> 00:31:51
be him

498
00:31:51 --> 00:31:56
I think we can take some credit here so
even well-prepared local authorities

499
00:31:56 --> 00:32:00
like humberside might find themselves
unable to cope the highest level of

500
00:32:00 --> 00:32:04
organization then might be at no more
than street or perish

501
00:32:04 --> 00:32:07
and here there are hardly any plans and
no government money available

502
00:32:07 --> 00:32:12
the Home Office is relying on volunteers
taking as their model the warning

503
00:32:12 --> 00:32:19
organization the Royal observer call you
are in fact mobilizing 10,000 people

504
00:32:19 --> 00:32:24
although you&#39;ve only got a permanent
Carter of 75 full-time officers

505
00:32:24 --> 00:32:30
I think this is the way to go about
arranging our civil defense at least in

506
00:32:30 --> 00:32:33
time of peace but in time of war it may
be too late

507
00:32:33 --> 00:32:38
well it&#39;s when the unthinkable moment
may happen

508
00:32:38 --> 00:32:41
when a nuclear on set they come

509
00:32:41 --> 00:32:45
that it is then possible to get those
who are volunteers to spring into

510
00:32:45 --> 00:32:49
full-time action and let&#39;s face it we&#39;ve
seen this happen before and it can

511
00:32:49 --> 00:32:49
happen again

512
00:32:49 --> 00:32:58
this is the night wait survey radio
instrument to measure the radiation

513
00:32:58 --> 00:33:03
so in the end each local community will
have to help itself in Devon I

514
00:33:03 --> 00:33:07
volunteers are training in the use of
radiation meters spot on the zero

515
00:33:07 --> 00:33:10
doesn&#39;t sort of move it around a little
bit and bring it up to the zero position

516
00:33:10 --> 00:33:14
many of the Devon emergency volunteers
of former members of the Civil Defense

517
00:33:14 --> 00:33:17
Corps and bitterly regret its passing 0

518
00:33:17 --> 00:33:22
I really did believe in civil defense I
went round instructing people and

519
00:33:22 --> 00:33:25
persuading them to join civil defense
telling them that several depends was

520
00:33:25 --> 00:33:29
necessary and then suddenly civil
defense wasn&#39;t considered to be

521
00:33:29 --> 00:33:35
necessary and we&#39;ll have they&#39;re gonna
build walls to believe that this kind of

522
00:33:35 --> 00:33:37
organization is necessary now

523
00:33:37 --> 00:33:45
vital absolutely and the price of
freedom is eternal vigilance

524
00:33:45 --> 00:33:49
meet major Tony hibbett leader of his
own breakaway organization

525
00:33:49 --> 00:33:52
yeah

526
00:33:52 --> 00:34:01
it may not look like a World War 3
battlefield but today major hibbett dick

527
00:34:01 --> 00:34:05
George commander and Margaret are
preparing for a radiation cloud hitting

528
00:34:05 --> 00:34:08
a nearby Hamlet

529
00:34:08 --> 00:34:11
we are eating good

530
00:34:11 --> 00:34:14
I check for building

531
00:34:14 --> 00:34:18
ok good trip

532
00:34:18 --> 00:34:24
we&#39;re getting a reading a positive
reading all our arrival

533
00:34:24 --> 00:34:28
check time fallout arrival

534
00:34:28 --> 00:34:39
12:25 dick i want you too far the
Maroons now three whistles or bangs is

535
00:34:39 --> 00:34:42
the warning for radiation

536
00:34:42 --> 00:34:51
yeah

537
00:34:51 --> 00:35:00
Black Knight

538
00:35:00 --> 00:35:19
if this looks funny now remember after
an attack it may be all we have

539
00:35:19 --> 00:35:33
yeah

540
00:35:33 --> 00:35:39
fallout can kill though you cannot see
it feel it or smell it

541
00:35:39 --> 00:35:43
there is danger outside so don&#39;t go
outside

542
00:35:43 --> 00:35:48
stay in your fallout room until you are
told it is safe to come out

543
00:35:48 --> 00:35:52
this is the last kind of beans in
trouble

544
00:35:52 --> 00:35:55
what&#39;s there yeah

545
00:35:55 --> 00:36:02
for most the real world after the bomb
would be a grim business after two weeks

546
00:36:02 --> 00:36:07
food will be almost exhausted there are
over 100 government emergency food

547
00:36:07 --> 00:36:11
warehouses in Britain but although
stocked with essential food stuffs they

548
00:36:11 --> 00:36:14
don&#39;t add up to a balanced diet and it
might take three months to replenish

549
00:36:14 --> 00:36:15
them from elsewhere

550
00:36:15 --> 00:36:18
the world will be changed utterly

551
00:36:18 --> 00:36:23
in spite of the belief that mass bombing
would make war impossible or that it

552
00:36:23 --> 00:36:24
would end civilization

553
00:36:24 --> 00:36:28
by the time the Second World War began
there was a full-scale national

554
00:36:28 --> 00:36:30
organization dedicated to civil defense

555
00:36:30 --> 00:36:35
sometime after asking what to do where
to go

556
00:36:35 --> 00:36:39
no time for the training local edition

557
00:36:39 --> 00:36:41
trying to punish me

558
00:36:41 --> 00:36:47
40 years later we are far worse off
today civil defense in Britain is little

559
00:36:47 --> 00:36:49
more than a pile of paper

560
00:36:49 --> 00:36:53
there is no National Civil Defence Force
no evacuation plan

561
00:36:53 --> 00:36:58
no civilian shelters inadequate food
stocks general and preparedness and a

562
00:36:58 --> 00:37:01
feeling that civil defense is simply too
expensive

563
00:37:01 --> 00:37:06
if War were to break out between NATO
and the Warsaw Pact written would

564
00:37:06 --> 00:37:07
certainly be a target

565
00:37:07 --> 00:37:13
the government is currently considering
plans to spend five thousand million

566
00:37:13 --> 00:37:17
pounds developing new ways of delivering
nuclear weapons to the enemy

567
00:37:17 --> 00:37:22
last year we spent twenty millions
protecting the population in whose name

568
00:37:22 --> 00:37:25
the missiles will be fired

569
00:37:25 --> 00:37:30
if we are concerned to defend the values
that we have in this country we want to

570
00:37:30 --> 00:37:34
convince anyone who might wish to take
those things away from this at the real

571
00:37:34 --> 00:37:34
fight

572
00:37:34 --> 00:37:38
now if it there any alternative is to
new killer let&#39;s use nuclear weapons or

573
00:37:38 --> 00:37:39
lie down and sham dead

574
00:37:39 --> 00:37:42
that is is an uncomfortable tries if on
the other hand we&#39;ve shown that we&#39;re

575
00:37:42 --> 00:37:43
serious about

576
00:37:43 --> 00:37:47
I mean mean meaning to defend and civil
defense is a part of that that I think

577
00:37:47 --> 00:37:53
we should do it for that reason almost
alone as indicating will intention moral

578
00:37:53 --> 00:37:57
fiber call about your life because
otherwise people may not in the end

579
00:37:57 --> 00:37:58
believe the threats that we make

580
00:37:58 --> 00:38:01
it&#39;s extremely difficult to now

581
00:38:01 --> 00:38:07
to what extent you can increase the rate
of people surviving by an increase in

582
00:38:07 --> 00:38:13
the expenditure of money but if we are
considering spending something like five

583
00:38:13 --> 00:38:17
billion pounds on the next generation of
independent deterrent

584
00:38:17 --> 00:38:22
isn&#39;t it somewhat absurd to only spend
20 million pounds on protecting the

585
00:38:22 --> 00:38:25
people and whose name those missiles be
fine I look it is precisely because

586
00:38:25 --> 00:38:30
these questions are being asked and the
government realizes that answers must be

587
00:38:30 --> 00:38:35
provided that we&#39;re holding the reviewer
that we are at the moment it&#39;s were back

588
00:38:35 --> 00:38:43
to the old British system of ad hoc
curry rarely of hoping for the best and

589
00:38:43 --> 00:38:51
I i think in in in modern terms in terms
of modern weapons and we just cannot

590
00:38:51 --> 00:38:56
model through as we as we monitor in the
past it just won&#39;t work and our plans at

591
00:38:56 --> 00:39:01
the moment exists purely allowing us to
model through and nothing else and if we

592
00:39:01 --> 00:39:02
aren&#39;t able to muddle through

593
00:39:02 --> 00:39:06
if we aren&#39;t able to model sue them or
descending to complete and utter chaos

594
00:39:06 --> 00:39:09
and anarchy and that would be the end of
everything

595
00:39:09 --> 00:39:13
yeah

596
00:39:13 --> 00:39:16
yeah

597
00:39:16 --> 00:39:18
yeah

598
00:39:18 --> 00:39:29
yeah

599
00:39:29 --> 00:39:30
sitting around a bit happy whatever

00:00:00 --> 00:00:01
Greetings to our compatriots

3
00:00:01 --> 00:00:02
around China and overseas.

4
00:00:02 --> 00:00:03
Today

5
00:00:03 --> 00:00:04
is the 31st New Year&#39;s Day

6
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
since the founding of the Republic of China

7
00:00:06 --> 00:00:07
and the fifth

8
00:00:07 --> 00:00:07
New Year&#39;s Day

9
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
that we have spent

10
00:00:10 --> 00:00:11
at war.

11
00:00:11 --> 00:00:13
Since our declaration of war

12
00:00:13 --> 00:00:16
against Japan and the Axis powers

13
00:00:16 --> 00:00:19
on December 12 of last year,

14
00:00:19 --> 00:00:22
our war of resistance has entered a new phase

15
00:00:22 --> 00:00:23
and China&#39;s war with Japan

16
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
has become a world war.

17
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
The duty of China

18
00:00:27 --> 00:00:28
is now all the greater,

19
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
and the burden of our people and our army

20
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
is all the weightier.

21
00:00:32 --> 00:00:35
We must renew and redouble our efforts.

22
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
On this first day of the new year,

23
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
I will discuss with the public

24
00:00:39 --> 00:00:42
the past, present,

25
00:00:42 --> 00:00:43
and future of this war.

26
00:00:43 --> 00:00:45
Over the past half-year,

27
00:00:45 --> 00:00:47
and particularly the past month,

28
00:00:47 --> 00:00:51
our war of resistance has changed utterly.

29
00:00:51 --> 00:00:53
Before, ours was a solitary struggle

30
00:00:53 --> 00:00:54
within our own country

31
00:00:54 --> 00:00:55
against the Japanese invaders.

32
00:00:55 --> 00:00:58
Today, we have joined
Great Britain, the United States,

33
00:00:58 --> 00:00:59
and Soviet Union

34
00:00:59 --> 00:01:00
and other friendly nations

35
00:01:00 --> 00:01:01
in fighting side by side

36
00:01:01 --> 00:01:04
to rid the world of our common enemies.

37
00:01:04 --> 00:01:05
Our burden

38
00:01:05 --> 00:01:08
is the responsibility of the Republic of China

39
00:01:08 --> 00:01:11
to world civilization and morality.

40
00:01:11 --> 00:01:14
As long as the Japanese invaders

41
00:01:14 --> 00:01:15
and the Axis powers

42
00:01:15 --> 00:01:16
remain on this earth,

43
00:01:16 --> 00:01:17
as long as world civilization and morality

44
00:01:17 --> 00:01:18
remain under threat,

45
00:01:18 --> 00:01:19
we shall continue

46
00:01:19 --> 00:01:21
to shoulder this heavy burden.

47
00:01:21 --> 00:01:23
The outcome of this war

48
00:01:23 --> 00:01:25
will determine not only
the survival of our nation,

49
00:01:25 --> 00:01:27
but the future of all mankind.

50
00:01:27 --> 00:01:29
Victory for China

51
00:01:29 --> 00:01:31
will lay a strong foundation
for generations to come.

52
00:01:31 --> 00:01:32
Defeat

53
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
will push our people past the point of no return.

54
00:01:34 --> 00:01:35
My fellow countrymen...

55
00:01:35 --> 00:01:36
From the winter of 1942,

56
00:01:36 --> 00:01:37
to the spring of 1944,

57
00:01:37 --> 00:01:38
a terrible drought

58
00:01:38 --> 00:01:39
starved my home province

59
00:01:39 --> 00:01:40
of Henan.

60
00:01:40 --> 00:01:41
Meanwhile,

61
00:01:41 --> 00:01:44
in other places, other things were happening:

62
00:01:44 --> 00:01:45
the Battle of Stalingrad,

63
00:01:45 --> 00:01:46
Gandhi went on hunger strike.

64
00:01:46 --> 00:01:47
Soong May-ling visited the United States.

65
00:01:47 --> 00:01:48
Winston Churchill got a cold.

66
00:01:48 --> 00:01:49
Shuanzhu!

67
00:01:49 --> 00:01:49
Shuanzhu!

68
00:01:49 --> 00:01:50
Yes, sir?

69
00:01:50 --> 00:01:51
Did you feed the animals?

70
00:01:51 --> 00:01:52
I was just about to.

71
00:01:52 --> 00:01:53
When you&#39;re done that,

72
00:01:53 --> 00:01:54
go check the granary.

73
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
That&#39;s all the grain the village has left.

74
00:01:56 --> 00:01:57
Master Fan...

75
00:01:57 --> 00:01:58
there&#39;s someone in there now.

76
00:01:58 --> 00:01:58
Who?

77
00:01:58 --> 00:01:59
Huazhi.

78
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
Mister Fan... Sir...

79
00:02:01 --> 00:02:02
Huazhi.

80
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
I&#39;m just here to borrow some grain.

81
00:02:04 --> 00:02:05
I&#39;ll give you some...

82
00:02:05 --> 00:02:07
if I can borrow you for a little while.

83
00:02:07 --> 00:02:07
Mister Fan...

84
00:02:07 --> 00:02:08
Huazhi.

85
00:02:08 --> 00:02:09
My wife&#39;s pregnant

86
00:02:09 --> 00:02:10
and I haven&#39;t gotten a taste in months.

87
00:02:10 --> 00:02:11
Mister Fan!

88
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
At a time when people are starving to death...

89
00:02:13 --> 00:02:14
how could you?

90
00:02:14 --> 00:02:15
&lt;i&gt;$0&#39;?&lt;/i&gt;

91
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
If it weren&#39;t for the famine,
you wouldn&#39;t be asking either.

92
00:02:17 --> 00:02:17
Just one go

93
00:02:17 --> 00:02:17
and I&#39;ll give you two pints of millet.

94
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
How&#39;s that for fair?

95
00:02:19 --> 00:02:20
You animal!

96
00:02:20 --> 00:02:20
I&#39;ll scream.

97
00:02:20 --> 00:02:22
Don&#39;t! Don&#39;t!

98
00:02:22 --> 00:02:22
Huazhi...

99
00:02:22 --> 00:02:23
Take this walnut too.

100
00:02:23 --> 00:02:24
Your hair&#39;s losing its color.

101
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
Huazhi...

102
00:02:26 --> 00:02:28
The bandits are coming!

103
00:02:28 --> 00:02:30
Every man to the village walls!

104
00:02:30 --> 00:02:31
Bandits coming!

105
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
Every man to the village walls!

106
00:02:33 --> 00:02:34
Bandits coming!

107
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
Every man to the village walls!

108
00:02:36 --> 00:02:38
Bandits coming!

109
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
Every man to the village walls!

110
00:02:40 --> 00:02:41
It&#39;s Ciwei, right?

111
00:02:41 --> 00:02:42
When you were a pup,

112
00:02:42 --> 00:02:44
your mother did laundry for us.

113
00:02:44 --> 00:02:45
One time you pitched a fit

114
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
and I took you to go see a doctor.

115
00:02:47 --> 00:02:48
Did you forget?

116
00:02:48 --> 00:02:48
Sir,

117
00:02:48 --> 00:02:49
we don&#39;t want any trouble.

118
00:02:49 --> 00:02:50
We&#39;re starving.

119
00:02:50 --> 00:02:51
Just feed us.

120
00:02:51 --> 00:02:51
Xialu,

121
00:02:51 --> 00:02:52
I&#39;ll give every one of you two pints of millet

122
00:02:52 --> 00:02:53
to send them packing right now.

123
00:02:53 --> 00:02:54
Sir,

124
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
we would if we could,

125
00:02:55 --> 00:02:56
but we haven&#39;t eaten in days.

126
00:02:56 --> 00:02:57
There&#39;s no fight in us.

127
00:02:57 --> 00:02:58
Coward!

128
00:02:58 --> 00:02:59
Shuanzhu.

129
00:02:59 --> 00:03:00
What?

130
00:03:00 --> 00:03:01
Get a horse and go to the county seat.

131
00:03:01 --> 00:03:02
Alert the magistrate!

132
00:03:02 --> 00:03:03
I don&#39;t think I can, sir.

133
00:03:03 --> 00:03:04
Ask someone else.

134
00:03:04 --> 00:03:05
Three silver coins!

135
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
I&#39;m counting on you with my life!

136
00:03:07 --> 00:03:08
Hurry!

137
00:03:08 --> 00:03:08
Well...

138
00:03:08 --> 00:03:09
all right!

139
00:03:09 --> 00:03:10
Ciwei,

140
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
show a little respect.

141
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
I&#39;ll give you a bucket of millet.

142
00:03:14 --> 00:03:17
Go look for food somewhere else!

143
00:03:17 --> 00:03:17
Sir,

144
00:03:17 --> 00:03:18
we&#39;re already here,

145
00:03:18 --> 00:03:19
so let&#39;s not go back and forth over it.

146
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
Tonight, we eat with you.

147
00:03:21 --> 00:03:22
Whatever we eat,

148
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
we&#39;ll pay back after the drought.

149
00:03:25 --> 00:03:25
Come, come.

150
00:03:25 --> 00:03:26
Dig in, dig in!

151
00:03:26 --> 00:03:28
We&#39;ve waited long enough.

152
00:03:28 --> 00:03:29
Xialu.

153
00:03:29 --> 00:03:30
Young master.

154
00:03:30 --> 00:03:31
Take this.

155
00:03:31 --> 00:03:32
Call out the rest of the villagers

156
00:03:32 --> 00:03:33
to eat too.

157
00:03:33 --> 00:03:34
We can&#39;t let these bastards eat all of it.

158
00:03:34 --> 00:03:35
If they don&#39;t leave afterwards,

159
00:03:35 --> 00:03:36
we&#39;ll teach them a lesson.

160
00:03:36 --> 00:03:37
Yes, sir!

161
00:03:37 --> 00:03:38
Hurry.

162
00:03:38 --> 00:03:39
Quick, quick.

163
00:03:39 --> 00:03:40
Faster!

164
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
Everyone!

165
00:03:42 --> 00:03:43
Landlord Fan&#39;s son said

166
00:03:43 --> 00:03:44
we&#39;ll all eat together.

167
00:03:44 --> 00:03:44
Afte rwa rd s

168
00:03:44 --> 00:03:45
if the bastards don&#39;t leave,

169
00:03:45 --> 00:03:46
be ready for a fight!

170
00:03:46 --> 00:03:46
Eat up!

171
00:03:46 --> 00:03:47
Eat up!

172
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
We moved all the valuables and the ledgers

173
00:03:49 --> 00:03:50
to Mr. Ge&#39;s home in the west end of the village.

174
00:03:50 --> 00:03:50
No, no.

175
00:03:50 --> 00:03:51
We&#39;ll cart it all into the city tomorrow.

176
00:03:51 --> 00:03:52
Master!

177
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
Soldiers!

178
00:03:54 --> 00:03:55
Master!

179
00:03:55 --> 00:03:57
Soldiers!

180
00:03:57 --> 00:03:58
From the county seat?

181
00:03:58 --> 00:04:01
No! Japanese soldiers!

182
00:04:01 --> 00:04:01
What?

183
00:04:01 --> 00:04:01
The Japanese?

184
00:04:01 --> 00:04:02
Calm down, calm down. Slowly now.

185
00:04:02 --> 00:04:03
Well?

186
00:04:03 --> 00:04:04
No!

187
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
There were Japanese troops in the mountains,

188
00:04:06 --> 00:04:07
heading for Puyang.

189
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
I couldn&#39;t get through.

190
00:04:09 --> 00:04:13
Are you trying to get me killed, Shuanzhu?

191
00:04:13 --> 00:04:13
What?

192
00:04:13 --> 00:04:13
Sir!

193
00:04:13 --> 00:04:15
We come here to ask for a meal...

194
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
and you call in the troops?

195
00:04:17 --> 00:04:17
Ciwei.

196
00:04:17 --> 00:04:18
Sir,

197
00:04:18 --> 00:04:19
how dishonorable can a man be?

198
00:04:19 --> 00:04:20
A moment of weakness...

199
00:04:20 --> 00:04:21
I&#39;ll make it up to you.

200
00:04:21 --> 00:04:22
Eat up, my friends! Eat up!

201
00:04:22 --> 00:04:23
Eat your fill!

202
00:04:23 --> 00:04:23
Eat up?

203
00:04:23 --> 00:04:24
Eat this!

204
00:04:24 --> 00:04:25
Master Fan!

205
00:04:25 --> 00:04:26
Heaven preserve us!

206
00:04:26 --> 00:04:27
My goodness!

207
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
Three pints of millet each! Fight!

208
00:04:30 --> 00:04:31
Fight!

209
00:04:31 --> 00:04:32
My donkey!

210
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
Try me!

211
00:04:34 --> 00:04:35
Xialu!

212
00:04:35 --> 00:04:35
Xialu!

213
00:04:35 --> 00:04:35
Save me.

214
00:04:35 --> 00:04:35
Mister Fan?

215
00:04:35 --> 00:04:36
Xialu!

216
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
My heart...

217
00:04:38 --> 00:04:39
You thought I didn&#39;t know

218
00:04:39 --> 00:04:40
you were trying to screw my wife?

219
00:04:40 --> 00:04:41
Xialu?

220
00:04:41 --> 00:04:42
Where are you going?

221
00:04:42 --> 00:04:43
It&#39;s all gone crazy, boss.

222
00:04:43 --> 00:04:43
Your son is dead!

223
00:04:43 --> 00:04:48
My boy!

224
00:04:48 --> 00:04:49
My boy!

225
00:04:49 --> 00:04:50
Landlord Fan

226
00:04:50 --> 00:04:51
never had faith in the Lord.

227
00:04:51 --> 00:04:52
He was warned, and still he refused.

228
00:04:52 --> 00:04:53
And now, having lost the protection of the Lord,

229
00:04:53 --> 00:04:54
he has gotten his just deserts.

230
00:04:54 --> 00:04:54
You see?

231
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
What good did his wealth do him?

232
00:04:56 --> 00:04:57
His son dead,

233
00:04:57 --> 00:04:58
his home burnt to the ground,

234
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
nowhere to turn but the county seat.

235
00:05:00 --> 00:05:01
This is called

236
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
&quot;not shedding tears until one sees the coffin.&quot;

237
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
It must be a rude awakening.

238
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
Why do you all flee the famine?

239
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
Because you&#39;re all godless heathens!

240
00:05:09 --> 00:05:10
Running blindly away...

241
00:05:10 --> 00:05:11
you don&#39;t know what lies ahead of you.

242
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
Who can you turn to out there?

243
00:05:13 --> 00:05:14
Who?

244
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
Take refuge in the Lord!

245
00:05:16 --> 00:05:17
Carp with dry noodles,

246
00:05:17 --> 00:05:18
Yanjin-style.

247
00:05:18 --> 00:05:22
In a famine year? This is too much, my friend.

248
00:05:22 --> 00:05:23
Governor Li...

249
00:05:23 --> 00:05:25
There are 72 wealthy families in the county.

250
00:05:25 --> 00:05:26
All of them have been robbed.

251
00:05:26 --> 00:05:27
After they rob the rich men,

252
00:05:27 --> 00:05:28
they&#39;ll turn to the county government offices.

253
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
I&#39;m still new to this job.

254
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
I never would have imagined that a drought

255
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
could starve all of Henan!

256
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
The whole province is suffering

257
00:05:37 --> 00:05:38
and the national grain stores are empty.

258
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
Coming to Henan was like boarding a sinking ship.

259
00:05:42 --> 00:05:43
Governor Li...

260
00:05:43 --> 00:05:44
the whole province is suffering,

261
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
but you&#39;ve seen how bad it is in Yanjin.

262
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
When the time comes to distribute relief grain,

263
00:05:50 --> 00:05:52
I trust you will treat Yanjin county favorably.

264
00:05:52 --> 00:05:56
My friend... I&#39;m not here to
distribute relief grain.

265
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
Then why are you here?

266
00:05:57 --> 00:05:58
We&#39;re about to go to war.

267
00:05:58 --> 00:05:59
I&#39;ve come to collect grain for the army.

268
00:05:59 --> 00:05:59
Daddy,

269
00:05:59 --> 00:06:00
what does &quot;flee&quot; mean?

270
00:06:00 --> 00:06:01
There&#39;s no food.

271
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
Do you want to starve?

272
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
No.

273
00:06:03 --> 00:06:05
Then you have to go somewhere to look for food.

274
00:06:05 --> 00:06:06
That&#39;s &quot;fleeing.&quot;

275
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
Why are you wearing your wedding clothes?

276
00:06:08 --> 00:06:10
Are you planning to run from the famine in those?

277
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
It&#39;s for good luck on the road!

278
00:06:12 --> 00:06:13
Slut!

279
00:06:13 --> 00:06:14
You think fleeing is a lucky thing?

280
00:06:14 --> 00:06:15
Go change!

281
00:06:15 --> 00:06:16
It looks like these old bones

282
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
won&#39;t be buried with my ancestors.

283
00:06:18 --> 00:06:19
Your ancestors were all broke anyway.

284
00:06:19 --> 00:06:20
You little bastard.

285
00:06:20 --> 00:06:20
Liubao,

286
00:06:20 --> 00:06:21
don&#39;t forget to bring the ancestral tablets.

287
00:06:21 --> 00:06:21
OK.

288
00:06:21 --> 00:06:22
We&#39;re fleeing from a famine,

289
00:06:22 --> 00:06:23
not going to watch a show.

290
00:06:23 --> 00:06:24
Why are you taking that cat?

291
00:06:24 --> 00:06:26
I don&#39;t want to go, dad.

292
00:06:26 --> 00:06:27
What?

293
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
I want to go back and find my schoolmates.

294
00:06:29 --> 00:06:30
Where are they now?

295
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
Some went to the front to fight the Japanese.

296
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
Going to the front lines means going to war.

297
00:06:34 --> 00:06:35
Going to war means killing people.

298
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
A girl like you? Killing people?

299
00:06:37 --> 00:06:38
Then I&#39;ll go back to school

300
00:06:38 --> 00:06:39
and guard it with the others!

301
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
Shuanzhu! Stop!

302
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
Get back here!

303
00:06:44 --> 00:06:45
Out of the way!

304
00:06:45 --> 00:06:47
Why are you being difficult now? Let&#39;s go.

305
00:06:47 --> 00:06:48
Your brother got a bright idea too...

306
00:06:48 --> 00:06:49
and it cost him his life!

307
00:06:49 --> 00:06:50
Don&#39;t think about it.

308
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
My dowry from my parents

309
00:06:53 --> 00:06:57
and all of my money was in that jewelry box!

310
00:06:57 --> 00:06:59
Where did it go?

311
00:06:59 --> 00:07:00
We&#39;re not like them.

312
00:07:00 --> 00:07:01
They&#39;re running from the famine.

313
00:07:01 --> 00:07:02
We&#39;re temporarily avoiding the crisis.

314
00:07:02 --> 00:07:03
A month at most...

315
00:07:03 --> 00:07:04
maybe just two weeks...

316
00:07:04 --> 00:07:05
and then you can go back to school.

317
00:07:05 --> 00:07:08
Shuanzhu, didn&#39;t you see my jewelry box?

318
00:07:08 --> 00:07:09
How many times to I have to tell you?

319
00:07:09 --> 00:07:09
What are you trying to say?

320
00:07:09 --> 00:07:10
That I&#39;m a thief?

321
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
Search me then! Search!

322
00:07:12 --> 00:07:13
Shuanzhu.

323
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
Don&#39;t take it the wrong way
that&#39;s not what she meant.

324
00:07:15 --> 00:07:16
Master Fan!

325
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
Don&#39;t get upset. It&#39;s not good for the baby.

326
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
I&#39;m not leaving.

327
00:07:21 --> 00:07:22
Find someone else to drive your cart!

328
00:07:22 --> 00:07:23
What is it?

329
00:07:23 --> 00:07:24
In the 1931 famine

330
00:07:24 --> 00:07:24
my parents ran...

331
00:07:24 --> 00:07:26
and they starved to death on the road.

332
00:07:26 --> 00:07:27
We&#39;re dead either way.

333
00:07:27 --> 00:07:28
Don&#39;t be foolish.

334
00:07:28 --> 00:07:29
Look at all the grain we have with us.

335
00:07:29 --> 00:07:30
Nobody&#39;s going to starve.

336
00:07:30 --> 00:07:30
Go look.

337
00:07:30 --> 00:07:31
It&#39;s going to be rough going,

338
00:07:31 --> 00:07:32
and Xingxing is so young...

339
00:07:32 --> 00:07:34
I&#39;ll feel much better if you come along.

340
00:07:34 --> 00:07:35
Here.

341
00:07:35 --> 00:07:36
As long as I&#39;m here,

342
00:07:36 --> 00:07:37
noone&#39;ll dare lay a hand on you.

343
00:07:37 --> 00:07:37
Sorry to interrupt.

344
00:07:37 --> 00:07:38
Mr. Minister,

345
00:07:38 --> 00:07:39
allow me to introduce myself.

346
00:07:39 --> 00:07:43
I am Theodore White, I report for Time magazine.

347
00:07:43 --> 00:07:43
Mr. White

348
00:07:43 --> 00:07:43
Yes, sir

349
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
You have become famous in Chungking.

350
00:07:45 --> 00:07:45
Is that right?

351
00:07:45 --> 00:07:45
Yes.

352
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
I have read your reports on the battles

353
00:07:47 --> 00:07:48
in Changsha and the China-Burma highway.

354
00:07:48 --> 00:07:48
I don&#39;t mean to be rude,

355
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
But I am going to head back to the US next month

356
00:07:51 --> 00:07:52
can you spare a moment?

357
00:07:52 --> 00:07:53
Sure.

358
00:07:53 --> 00:07:54
Thanks a lot.

359
00:07:54 --> 00:07:58
There is a lot of talk in Chungking about the

360
00:07:58 --> 00:08:01
severity of the drought in Henan.

361
00:08:01 --> 00:08:05
I&#39;ve heard that many people
are starving to death every day.

362
00:08:05 --> 00:08:08
And there are many refugees fleeing to Shaanxi.

363
00:08:08 --> 00:08:09
This is true.

364
00:08:09 --> 00:08:10
But

365
00:08:10 --> 00:08:11
starvation is primarily

366
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
a problem in the occupied areas.

367
00:08:13 --> 00:08:14
The war has made this

368
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
natural disaster even worse.

369
00:08:16 --> 00:08:19
A large battle is imminent.

370
00:08:19 --> 00:08:20
If people are moving west,

371
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
it is also to avoid the war.

372
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
From the perspective of the Chinese people,

373
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
they can only have enough to eat

374
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
if the Japanese are wiped out.

375
00:08:28 --> 00:08:29
Do YOU agree?

376
00:08:29 --> 00:08:30
Shuanzhu!

377
00:08:30 --> 00:08:30
Master Fan!

378
00:08:30 --> 00:08:30
Xialu

379
00:08:30 --> 00:08:31
You&#39;re running too?

380
00:08:31 --> 00:08:32
Is the whole village leaving?

381
00:08:32 --> 00:08:33
Everyone.

382
00:08:33 --> 00:08:34
Let&#39;s go together.

383
00:08:34 --> 00:08:35
We&#39;ll look after each other.

384
00:08:35 --> 00:08:35
Let&#39;s go.

385
00:08:35 --> 00:08:35
We can take care of each other.

386
00:08:35 --> 00:08:36
Let&#39;s go.

387
00:08:36 --> 00:08:37
The drought can&#39;t be all bad

388
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
if it&#39;s making the Fans poor too.

389
00:08:39 --> 00:08:39
Poor, maybe.

390
00:08:39 --> 00:08:40
Still richer than us!

391
00:08:40 --> 00:08:43
As Commander Jiang prepares to
lead his forces to the front,

392
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
The 30 million people of Henan
greet your troops with food and drink.

393
00:08:46 --> 00:08:50
We wish you and your soldiers
a swift, decisive victory.

394
00:08:50 --> 00:08:50
Please!

395
00:08:50 --> 00:08:52
There&#39;s no need for all the courtesy, Governor.

396
00:08:52 --> 00:08:53
Let&#39;s get straight to the point.

397
00:08:53 --> 00:08:54
What can I do for you?

398
00:08:54 --> 00:08:55
Henan experienced a devastating drought this year.

399
00:08:55 --> 00:08:56
We also had locusts.

400
00:08:56 --> 00:08:57
The land is barren

401
00:08:57 --> 00:08:58
and the corpses of those
who have starved are everywhere.

402
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
750,000 tons of grain...

403
00:09:00 --> 00:09:02
...is more than the province can give.

404
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
Please, general - cancel the request.

405
00:09:05 --> 00:09:06
The people are suffering.

406
00:09:06 --> 00:09:07
You are quite right, governor.

407
00:09:07 --> 00:09:08
I agree.

408
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
Thank you, commander, for your kindness.

409
00:09:11 --> 00:09:16
The children of Henan will never
forget your compassion.

410
00:09:16 --> 00:09:17
But you need to do two things for me.

411
00:09:17 --> 00:09:20
Only two? I&#39;ll do twenty.

412
00:09:20 --> 00:09:20
First,

413
00:09:20 --> 00:09:21
go to the Japanese

414
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
and talk them out of attacking Henan.

415
00:09:23 --> 00:09:23
Second,

416
00:09:23 --> 00:09:24
go to the Generalissimo

417
00:09:24 --> 00:09:27
and get him to move
my troops back west to Shaanxi.

418
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
Do that, and we won&#39;t eat
a single kernel of your grain.

419
00:09:30 --> 00:09:34
Commander, it&#39;s not like that.

420
00:09:34 --> 00:09:36
Famine years are different.

421
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
There are millions of people starving to death.

422
00:09:38 --> 00:09:39
Governor Li,

423
00:09:39 --> 00:09:42
there are tens of millions of men
marching to the front.

424
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
Who knows how many of them
will live to next month?

425
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
If it&#39;s a matter of choosing who will starve...

426
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
...a dead refugee won&#39;t lose the war for us.

427
00:09:50 --> 00:09:52
A soldier starving to death

428
00:09:52 --> 00:09:54
is another matter entirely.

429
00:09:54 --> 00:09:55
Good day.

430
00:09:55 --> 00:09:56
Commander!

431
00:09:56 --> 00:09:57
That&#39;s not right!

432
00:09:57 --> 00:09:58
All gone.

433
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
We&#39;ll starve if we keep going.

434
00:10:00 --> 00:10:03
There&#39;s people going hungry and
you&#39;re feeding a cat?

435
00:10:03 --> 00:10:04
I&#39;m giving her my share.

436
00:10:04 --> 00:10:05
I just won&#39;t eat later,

437
00:10:05 --> 00:10:06
all right?

438
00:10:06 --> 00:10:06
You&#39;re eating for two.

439
00:10:06 --> 00:10:07
You can have more later.

440
00:10:07 --> 00:10:07
Master Fan...

441
00:10:07 --> 00:10:08
The donkey has the runs.

442
00:10:08 --> 00:10:09
Should I feed it?

443
00:10:09 --> 00:10:10
If we can get through this in a month,

444
00:10:10 --> 00:10:11
then yes.

445
00:10:11 --> 00:10:12
Then go ahead.

446
00:10:12 --> 00:10:13
If it takes longer,

447
00:10:13 --> 00:10:14
I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll be down to eating the donkey.

448
00:10:14 --> 00:10:14
Xialu!

449
00:10:14 --> 00:10:14
Xialu!

450
00:10:14 --> 00:10:14
Who is it?

451
00:10:14 --> 00:10:15
Wake up.

452
00:10:15 --> 00:10:16
Brother Sim,

453
00:10:16 --> 00:10:18
are you fleeing too?

454
00:10:18 --> 00:10:21
God had Moses lead the Israelites out of Egypt.

455
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
Now God wants me to lead you out of Henan.

456
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
So the war is about to start and
you&#39;re afraid of dying, eh?

457
00:10:27 --> 00:10:28
A favor to ask you.

458
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
Liang, the rich landlord from
Changyuan, was running.

459
00:10:30 --> 00:10:31
He just died of typhoid

460
00:10:31 --> 00:10:32
but his eyes are still open.

461
00:10:32 --> 00:10:33
Why do you think that is?

462
00:10:33 --> 00:10:34
Why?

463
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
Because he didn&#39;t believe in God.

464
00:10:36 --> 00:10:37
Now he&#39;s waiting for God.

465
00:10:37 --> 00:10:40
I want to say a mass for him.
Can you play the erhu?

466
00:10:40 --> 00:10:45
I&#39;m too weak. My ribs are practically
touching my backbone.

467
00:10:45 --> 00:10:46
What...

468
00:10:46 --> 00:10:50
trying to win converts with
the famine, Brother Sim?

469
00:10:50 --> 00:10:51
After the famine is over,

470
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
you&#39;ll see how great God is.

471
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
It&#39;ll work better if you play the erhu.

472
00:10:55 --> 00:10:56
People will see it&#39;s a serious thing.

473
00:10:56 --> 00:10:57
Give me my erhu.

474
00:10:57 --> 00:10:58
Hungry little devil!

475
00:10:58 --> 00:10:59
It&#39;s too late at night to be eating.

476
00:10:59 --> 00:11:00
Go to sleep!

477
00:11:00 --> 00:11:06
&quot;A long, hard month out on the road&quot;

478
00:11:06 --> 00:11:11
&quot;Braving illness, hunger, and cold&quot;

479
00:11:11 --> 00:11:16
&quot;Landlord Liang had piles of gold&quot;

480
00:11:16 --> 00:11:21
&quot;And a lonely death none could have foretold.&quot;

481
00:11:21 --> 00:11:26
&quot;His horrid end and tragic fate&quot;

482
00:11:26 --> 00:11:31
&quot;Resulted from his lack of faith.&quot;

483
00:11:31 --> 00:11:36
&quot;Lay down your burden, the time has come&quot;

484
00:11:36 --> 00:11:43
&quot;God is before you.&quot;

485
00:11:43 --> 00:11:47
&quot;Lay down your burden, the time has come&quot;

486
00:11:47 --> 00:11:51
&quot;God is before you.&quot;

487
00:11:51 --> 00:11:52
Bury him.

488
00:11:52 --> 00:11:54
This famine isn&#39;t all bad, eh Old Ma?

489
00:11:54 --> 00:11:56
If the government hadn&#39;t set up
a circuit court for the refugees,

490
00:11:56 --> 00:11:58
you&#39;d still be a cook at the yamen,

491
00:11:58 --> 00:11:59
instead of a judge!

492
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
They couldn&#39;t find anyone else to
take the job, is all.

493
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
Not enough people, and it&#39;s a shit job anyway.

494
00:12:04 --> 00:12:05
Who wants to deal with refugees?

495
00:12:05 --> 00:12:06
No profit in it.

496
00:12:06 --> 00:12:07
No one wants to do it.

497
00:12:07 --> 00:12:07
Sir.

498
00:12:07 --> 00:12:08
There&#39;s something I don&#39;t understand.

499
00:12:08 --> 00:12:08
So...

500
00:12:08 --> 00:12:09
if we&#39;re working with refugees,

501
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
how come we&#39;re the &quot;War Area Circuit Court&quot;

502
00:12:11 --> 00:12:14
instead of the &quot;Refugee Circuit Court?&quot;

503
00:12:14 --> 00:12:15
Don&#39;t be stupid.

504
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
&quot;War Area&quot; sounds like it&#39;s a big, proper court.

505
00:12:17 --> 00:12:19
&quot;Refugee Circuit Court&quot; just sounds bad.

506
00:12:19 --> 00:12:19
You see?

507
00:12:19 --> 00:12:20
That&#39;s right.

508
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
Stick with Old Ma, boys,

509
00:12:22 --> 00:12:25
and you&#39;ll be officials once the famine&#39;s over.

510
00:12:25 --> 00:12:26
Yes sir! We&#39;ll be good!

511
00:12:26 --> 00:12:27
Hear ye, hear ye!

512
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
The 9th Circuit Court of the 1st War Area

513
00:12:29 --> 00:12:30
is now in session!

514
00:12:30 --> 00:12:30
KneeH

515
00:12:30 --> 00:12:31
He was carrying a concealed gun

516
00:12:31 --> 00:12:32
in violation of wartime regulations.

517
00:12:32 --> 00:12:33
It&#39;s not mine...

518
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
my landlord bought it three years ago.

519
00:12:36 --> 00:12:39
We&#39;re at war. Do you understand?

520
00:12:39 --> 00:12:40
Old Ma,

521
00:12:40 --> 00:12:40
do what you like,

522
00:12:40 --> 00:12:41
but don&#39;t take the gun.

523
00:12:41 --> 00:12:43
We need it for protection on the road.

524
00:12:43 --> 00:12:43
Protection?

525
00:12:43 --> 00:12:43
L---

526
00:12:43 --> 00:12:44
From who?

527
00:12:44 --> 00:12:45
Chinese people?

528
00:12:45 --> 00:12:47
Why not use it on the Japanese, tough guy?

529
00:12:47 --> 00:12:48
Want to carry a gun?

530
00:12:48 --> 00:12:48
Okay.

531
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
Tie him to the cart and take him to the frontline.

532
00:12:50 --> 00:12:51
Master Fan! Master Fan!

533
00:12:51 --> 00:12:52
- Save me, Master Fan! - Old Ma.

534
00:12:52 --> 00:12:52
Sir! Sir!

535
00:12:52 --> 00:12:52
Old Ma.

536
00:12:52 --> 00:12:52
Old Ma.

537
00:12:52 --> 00:12:57
Three pints of flour for him and the gun. Deal?

538
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
We know each other.

539
00:12:59 --> 00:12:59
You can either donate money,

540
00:12:59 --> 00:13:00
or donate manpower.

541
00:13:00 --> 00:13:01
Everyone has to do their part.

542
00:13:01 --> 00:13:01
Thank you, sir.

543
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
Three pints of flour for him. We keep the gun.

544
00:13:03 --> 00:13:03
Fine.

545
00:13:03 --> 00:13:03
Release him.

546
00:13:03 --> 00:13:04
Leave the gun.

547
00:13:04 --> 00:13:04
Three pints of flour?

548
00:13:04 --> 00:13:05
Bread for lunch, boys!

549
00:13:05 --> 00:13:06
Dismissed!

550
00:13:06 --> 00:13:07
Peiji.

551
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
Generalissimo. Peiji...

552
00:13:09 --> 00:13:10
Governor Li.

553
00:13:10 --> 00:13:10
As for Burma,

554
00:13:10 --> 00:13:10
a telegram from LuoZhuoying:

555
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
We suffered heavy casualties
west of Mandalay yesterday.

556
00:13:12 --> 00:13:13
More than 800 men were killed

557
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
in a gas attack by the Japanese.

558
00:13:15 --> 00:13:16
I&#39;ve told Luo

559
00:13:16 --> 00:13:17
you&#39;ll be there today.

560
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
The Japanese led a stealth
attack on Yenangyaung last night.

561
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
More than 7,000 British troops
and trucks are trapped.

562
00:13:21 --> 00:13:22
Field Marshal Montgomery sent a telegram

563
00:13:22 --> 00:13:25
asking us to send troops from Mandalay
to rescue Yenangyaung.

564
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
President Roosevelt&#39;s private secretary
has arrived in Chungking.

565
00:13:27 --> 00:13:28
He asked to see you,

566
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
but I told him you&#39;d be going to Mandelay.

567
00:13:30 --> 00:13:30
As for Nanking,

568
00:13:30 --> 00:13:31
Zhou Fohai sent a secret envoy

569
00:13:31 --> 00:13:32
that he is setting up a covert
radio station at his home

570
00:13:32 --> 00:13:34
to evade Wang Jingwei.

571
00:13:34 --> 00:13:36
Dai Li met with the secret envoy yesterday.

572
00:13:36 --> 00:13:37
Please advise.

573
00:13:37 --> 00:13:37
As for India,

574
00:13:37 --> 00:13:38
Gandhi&#39;s hunger strike was successful.

575
00:13:38 --> 00:13:39
Hindu and Muslim

576
00:13:39 --> 00:13:40
leaders have agreed

577
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
to stop the bloody conflict and
are on a path of reconciliation.

578
00:13:42 --> 00:13:43
How long was the hunger strike?

579
00:13:43 --> 00:13:43
Seven days.

580
00:13:43 --> 00:13:44
Hitler and Mussolini met yesterday.

581
00:13:44 --> 00:13:44
They said that in three days

582
00:13:44 --> 00:13:46
the German army will occupy Stalingrad.

583
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
Our embassy in the Soviet Union, however,

584
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
says the outcome of the battle of Stalingrad
is far from clear.

585
00:13:49 --> 00:13:50
Please tell the British embassy

586
00:13:50 --> 00:13:51
that when I visit India next month

587
00:13:51 --> 00:13:52
I would like to meet Gandhi.

588
00:13:52 --> 00:13:53
As for northern Henan,

589
00:13:53 --> 00:13:54
General Jiang Dingwen sent a telegram yesterday.

590
00:13:54 --> 00:13:56
Most of our troops have crossed
the Yellow River and are in position,

591
00:13:56 --> 00:13:58
but the Japanese have not yet made a move.

592
00:13:58 --> 00:13:59
Tell Jiang Dingwen

593
00:13:59 --> 00:14:00
it&#39;s best to make the first move

594
00:14:00 --> 00:14:02
and get the upper hand.

595
00:14:02 --> 00:14:02
Generalissimo,

596
00:14:02 --> 00:14:04
your flight to Mandalay is ready to depart.

597
00:14:04 --> 00:14:05
Peiji,

598
00:14:05 --> 00:14:06
did you have enough to eat?

599
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
I did. I did.

600
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
What brings you to Chungking?

601
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
Nothing special.

602
00:14:12 --> 00:14:13
I heard there is a drought in Henan.

603
00:14:13 --> 00:14:14
Is it severe?

604
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
The province... will overcome it.

605
00:14:16 --> 00:14:17
We will overcome it.

606
00:14:17 --> 00:14:18
Peiji,

607
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20
Henan is in a difficult situation.

608
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
That&#39;s why I sent you there.

609
00:14:22 --> 00:14:23
Tell Director Chen

610
00:14:23 --> 00:14:24
Governor Li is tired.

611
00:14:24 --> 00:14:25
Please look after him for me.

612
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
Did you report the situation to the Generalissimo?

613
00:14:27 --> 00:14:29
Everything they reported to him

614
00:14:29 --> 00:14:30
was more important than what I had to say.

615
00:14:30 --> 00:14:32
I didn&#39;t know what to say.

616
00:14:32 --> 00:14:34
Looks like I came to Chungking for nothing.

617
00:14:34 --> 00:14:35
Governor Li...

618
00:14:35 --> 00:14:36
You missed your chance to tell him.

619
00:14:36 --> 00:14:37
Now things will be more difficult.

620
00:14:37 --> 00:14:38
Director Chen,

621
00:14:38 --> 00:14:41
It&#39;s all here in these documents.

622
00:14:41 --> 00:14:44
For the sake of the thirty million
starving people in Henan,

623
00:14:44 --> 00:14:45
help me find a way

624
00:14:45 --> 00:14:48
to ask the government for emergency relief.

625
00:14:48 --> 00:14:49
When the Generalissimo returns from Burma,

626
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
I&#39;ll find a chance to give these to him.

627
00:14:51 --> 00:14:51
Thank you.

628
00:14:51 --> 00:14:52
Anyone here?

629
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
I want to speak to Father Megan

630
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
Last time I was in Chungking,

631
00:14:56 --> 00:14:57
Father Coutie showed me

632
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
your articles in Time magzine.

633
00:14:59 --> 00:15:02
Thank you for telling the story of
the Chinese people.

634
00:15:02 --> 00:15:05
Father Coutie has been very helpful.

635
00:15:05 --> 00:15:06
Very kind.

636
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
He told me you know Henan very well.

637
00:15:08 --> 00:15:09
Well,

638
00:15:09 --> 00:15:11
I&#39;ve been in China for thirty years now.

639
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
For the first ten years,
I thought I knew this place,

640
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
But then I became more and more uncertain.

641
00:15:17 --> 00:15:17
When I left Chungking,

642
00:15:17 --> 00:15:18
I knew there was a famine.

643
00:15:18 --> 00:15:18
But I...

644
00:15:18 --> 00:15:19
I had no idea

645
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
how severe it would be.

646
00:15:21 --> 00:15:23
Every day people are dying.

647
00:15:23 --> 00:15:26
The dead alone don&#39;t sadden me.

648
00:15:26 --> 00:15:30
What saddens me is,

649
00:15:30 --> 00:15:33
I have no idea what&#39;s happening.

650
00:15:33 --> 00:15:36
The refugees trudge forward every day,

651
00:15:36 --> 00:15:37
And I can&#39;t see

652
00:15:37 --> 00:15:39
a government stepping in to assist them.

653
00:15:39 --> 00:15:41
We both do not understand

654
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
what is happening with the Chinese refugees.

655
00:15:43 --> 00:15:44
The government officials say

656
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
they can&#39;t help the refugees because of the war,

657
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
but they are not doing
so well in the battles either.

658
00:15:49 --> 00:15:50
Thank you.

659
00:15:50 --> 00:15:50
This...

660
00:15:50 --> 00:15:51
Before the famine,

661
00:15:51 --> 00:15:54
farmers used this to feed their pigs.

662
00:15:54 --> 00:15:55
Bon appetit!

663
00:15:55 --> 00:15:56
I actually like yams.

664
00:15:56 --> 00:15:57
Oh good

665
00:15:57 --> 00:15:59
The donkey is the best I can do for you.

666
00:15:59 --> 00:16:01
But I urge you to return to Chungking.

667
00:16:01 --> 00:16:03
I&#39;m glad to come to Henan.

668
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
There must be a reason behind what is happening.

669
00:16:05 --> 00:16:06
I want to know the truth.

670
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
Henan now belongs to the Japanese.

671
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
If you continue into the disaster area,

672
00:16:11 --> 00:16:12
there are two possible results:

673
00:16:12 --> 00:16:12
One,

674
00:16:12 --> 00:16:13
you win a Pulitzer Prize.

675
00:16:13 --> 00:16:14
Two,

676
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
you get taken prisoner by the Japanese.

677
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
I will pray for your Pulitzer.

678
00:16:18 --> 00:16:20
From your mouth to God&#39;s ears.

679
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
I will remember you, Father.

680
00:16:22 --> 00:16:22
Ma?

681
00:16:22 --> 00:16:23
How are you feeling?

682
00:16:23 --> 00:16:24
Getting worse.

683
00:16:24 --> 00:16:25
You&#39;re burning up.

684
00:16:25 --> 00:16:29
It&#39;s not so bad. At least I&#39;m warm.

685
00:16:29 --> 00:16:30
That&#39;s bad luck.

686
00:16:30 --> 00:16:31
Go, go.

687
00:16:31 --> 00:16:32
Quick, take her while she&#39;s asleep.

688
00:16:32 --> 00:16:33
Quick, take her while she&#39;s asleep.

689
00:16:33 --> 00:16:36
So small. You say she&#39;s ten?

690
00:16:36 --> 00:16:37
Let&#39;s talk over there.

691
00:16:37 --> 00:16:38
She looks only three or four.

692
00:16:38 --> 00:16:39
She&#39;s famished.

693
00:16:39 --> 00:16:40
Lack of food has made her small.

694
00:16:40 --> 00:16:41
Feed her something and she will grow.

695
00:16:41 --> 00:16:42
If we buy her as a child bride,

696
00:16:42 --> 00:16:43
we still need to feed her for a few years.

697
00:16:43 --> 00:16:44
We&#39;ve been on the road for a month.

698
00:16:44 --> 00:16:45
Nobody in our family

699
00:16:45 --> 00:16:46
has eaten anything in the last ten days

700
00:16:46 --> 00:16:47
except sticks and kindling.

701
00:16:47 --> 00:16:48
My mother&#39;s sick

702
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
and I don&#39;t know how long she&#39;ll last.

703
00:16:50 --> 00:16:51
Your wife?

704
00:16:51 --> 00:16:52
I&#39;d give you five pints of millet for her.

705
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
I couldn&#39;t sell her. She&#39;d sell me.

706
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
The boy looks alright. Three pints of millet.

707
00:16:57 --> 00:16:58
I need him to carry on the family name.

708
00:16:58 --> 00:16:59
Two and half pints of millet.

709
00:16:59 --> 00:17:00
Take her.

710
00:17:00 --> 00:17:00
Xialu!

711
00:17:00 --> 00:17:02
Fuck your ancestors!

712
00:17:02 --> 00:17:04
Trying to sell my daughter away?

713
00:17:04 --> 00:17:07
Give her back!

714
00:17:07 --> 00:17:10
Give her to me!

715
00:17:10 --> 00:17:11
You think I want to sell her?

716
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
Ma&#39;s at death&#39;s door, and we need medicine.

717
00:17:13 --> 00:17:13
Take her.

718
00:17:13 --> 00:17:14
Take her! I&#39;m still in charge of this family!

719
00:17:14 --> 00:17:16
I&#39;ll kill her myself

720
00:17:16 --> 00:17:17
No! Shuanzhu, stop her!

721
00:17:17 --> 00:17:20
Before I let you take her away!

722
00:17:20 --> 00:17:21
Give her to me.

723
00:17:21 --> 00:17:22
Give me back my child.

724
00:17:22 --> 00:17:23
Give her to me!

725
00:17:23 --> 00:17:24
Go to sleep!

726
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
If this is all for my sake

727
00:17:26 --> 00:17:29
I&#39;d rather hang myself this instant!

728
00:17:29 --> 00:17:30
Hang yourself?

729
00:17:30 --> 00:17:31
Where&#39;d you tie the rope?

730
00:17:31 --> 00:17:32
Bastard!

731
00:17:32 --> 00:17:36
They&#39;re putting the whole thing on for us to see.

732
00:17:36 --> 00:17:36
All these poor people.

733
00:17:36 --> 00:17:37
I can&#39;t save them all.

734
00:17:37 --> 00:17:37
Don&#39;t stand around. Go sleep.

735
00:17:37 --> 00:17:38
Don&#39;t stand around. Go sleep.

736
00:17:38 --> 00:17:39
Don&#39;t sell the girl.

737
00:17:39 --> 00:17:40
Make your mother some porridge.

738
00:17:40 --> 00:17:42
You can pay me back when this is over.

739
00:17:42 --> 00:17:43
Why not make it 10 pints?

740
00:17:43 --> 00:17:44
Then I won&#39;t have to keep begging.

741
00:17:44 --> 00:17:45
I&#39;ve got a family too.

742
00:17:45 --> 00:17:46
My son&#39;s wife is pregnant,

743
00:17:46 --> 00:17:47
and there&#39;s still a long way ahead of us.

744
00:17:47 --> 00:17:48
What&#39;s that?

745
00:17:48 --> 00:17:50
It&#39;s the army. They&#39;re fighting the Japanese.

746
00:17:50 --> 00:17:53
Fuck their war!

747
00:17:53 --> 00:17:54
Don&#39;t they know we&#39;re starving here?

748
00:17:54 --> 00:17:55
I hope we win.

749
00:17:55 --> 00:17:56
If we win,

750
00:17:56 --> 00:17:57
then we can go back home.

751
00:17:57 --> 00:17:58
9th Army Headquarters.

752
00:17:58 --> 00:18:00
We might lose Changyuan.

753
00:18:00 --> 00:18:02
There have been a lot of bayonet skirmishes.

754
00:18:02 --> 00:18:03
800 casualties for the Japanese...

755
00:18:03 --> 00:18:04
but more than 5,000 for our side.

756
00:18:04 --> 00:18:05
Order the 15th Army and 28th Army

757
00:18:05 --> 00:18:09
to surround Tangyin and Anyang by tomorrow morning

758
00:18:09 --> 00:18:10
and attack by noon.

759
00:18:10 --> 00:18:12
Telegram from the Generalissimo, sir.

760
00:18:12 --> 00:18:13
Leave the room.

761
00:18:13 --> 00:18:14
What&#39;s wrong?

762
00:18:14 --> 00:18:16
The Generalissimo sent a telegram
from the front in Burma

763
00:18:16 --> 00:18:18
ordering us to retreat from Henan.

764
00:18:18 --> 00:18:19
Are you sure?

765
00:18:19 --> 00:18:21
Why singlehandedly give Henan to the Japanese?

766
00:18:21 --> 00:18:22
Sir,

767
00:18:22 --> 00:18:24
there are so many refugees in Henan.

768
00:18:24 --> 00:18:25
If we retreat,

769
00:18:25 --> 00:18:27
we&#39;ll be abandoning them to the Japanese.

770
00:18:27 --> 00:18:29
Maybe that&#39;s exactly why

771
00:18:29 --> 00:18:30
the Generalissimo made his decision.

772
00:18:30 --> 00:18:32
Our country is poor.

773
00:18:32 --> 00:18:35
The only way to survive
is to cast off our burdens.

774
00:18:35 --> 00:18:35
Get away!

775
00:18:35 --> 00:18:35
Get away!

776
00:18:35 --> 00:18:36
Back up!

777
00:18:36 --> 00:18:36
Get away!

778
00:18:36 --> 00:18:38
Why aren&#39;t we moving forward?

779
00:18:38 --> 00:18:39
It&#39;s jammed.

780
00:18:39 --> 00:18:39
Get away.

781
00:18:39 --> 00:18:39
Sir!

782
00:18:39 --> 00:18:41
Sir, did we win or lose?

783
00:18:41 --> 00:18:42
We won, of course!

784
00:18:42 --> 00:18:44
Then why are you retreating?

785
00:18:44 --> 00:18:45
It&#39;s a retrograde maneuver!

786
00:18:45 --> 00:18:45
Everyone back!

787
00:18:45 --> 00:18:47
Sir! Sir!

788
00:18:47 --> 00:18:49
You can&#39;t take this cart.

789
00:18:49 --> 00:18:52
We&#39;ve been risking our lives,

790
00:18:52 --> 00:18:53
Japanese mortar shells flying back and forth,

791
00:18:53 --> 00:18:54
and you&#39;re upset about a cart?

792
00:18:54 --> 00:18:54
Scram!

793
00:18:54 --> 00:18:55
It&#39;s not a cart, sir!

794
00:18:55 --> 00:18:57
It&#39;s a national circuit court!

795
00:18:57 --> 00:18:58
Then we&#39;re doing you a favor!

796
00:18:58 --> 00:19:00
After we leave, the Japanese will come.

797
00:19:00 --> 00:19:02
You going to hold court for them?

798
00:19:02 --> 00:19:04
This court is now an ambulance.

799
00:19:04 --> 00:19:04
Scram!

800
00:19:04 --> 00:19:07
There are slightly more troops than
civilians in the crowd.

801
00:19:07 --> 00:19:09
If the troops are in the majority,
we should bomb them.

802
00:19:09 --> 00:19:09
Yes, sir!

803
00:19:09 --> 00:19:13
Three, two, one. Launch!

804
00:19:13 --> 00:19:14
Get off!

805
00:19:14 --> 00:19:14
Morn!

806
00:19:14 --> 00:19:15
Xingxing, this way!

807
00:19:15 --> 00:19:15
Daddy!

808
00:19:15 --> 00:19:16
Where is everyone?

809
00:19:16 --> 00:19:17
Xingxing?

810
00:19:17 --> 00:19:18
Where are you?

811
00:19:18 --> 00:19:20
Sir! Sir! My cart!

812
00:19:20 --> 00:19:23
My money! sir!

813
00:19:23 --> 00:19:25
Sir, my food! For pity&#39;s sake!

814
00:19:25 --> 00:19:27
Dad...

815
00:19:27 --> 00:19:28
Dad...

816
00:19:28 --> 00:19:29
Sir.

817
00:19:29 --> 00:19:32
Shuanzhu! Save me!

818
00:19:32 --> 00:19:33
Let go of me!

819
00:19:33 --> 00:19:34
Let go!

820
00:19:34 --> 00:19:34
Xingxing!

821
00:19:34 --> 00:19:35
Mom, are you all right?

822
00:19:35 --> 00:19:36
Stay here!

823
00:19:36 --> 00:19:38
Mommy!

824
00:19:38 --> 00:19:39
Mommy!

825
00:19:39 --> 00:19:40
Mommy!

826
00:19:40 --> 00:19:41
Mommy!

827
00:19:41 --> 00:19:42
Father Sim!

828
00:19:42 --> 00:19:43
Ma!

829
00:19:43 --> 00:19:44
Ma!

830
00:19:44 --> 00:19:45
Granny?

831
00:19:45 --> 00:19:47
Mom.

832
00:19:47 --> 00:19:50
Mother!

833
00:19:50 --> 00:19:51
She&#39;s dead?

834
00:19:51 --> 00:19:52
Are you happy now?

835
00:19:52 --> 00:19:53
She&#39;s lucky.

836
00:19:53 --> 00:19:54
We&#39;d be better off dead.

837
00:19:54 --> 00:19:55
I wish they&#39;d dropped a bomb on me too!

838
00:19:55 --> 00:19:57
I&#39;ll kill you, you stinking bitch!

839
00:19:57 --> 00:20:00
This is no time to be fighting.

840
00:20:00 --> 00:20:01
It&#39;s all gone.

841
00:20:01 --> 00:20:04
I should&#39;ve lent you some of that millet.

842
00:20:04 --> 00:20:06
Hurry, now. Dig a hole for her.

843
00:20:06 --> 00:20:07
Morn!

844
00:20:07 --> 00:20:08
Morn!

845
00:20:08 --> 00:20:09
Help!

846
00:20:09 --> 00:20:10
It&#39;s nothing.

847
00:20:10 --> 00:20:11
Just a scratch.

848
00:20:11 --> 00:20:14
I never knew you had it in you!

849
00:20:14 --> 00:20:15
I dare them!

850
00:20:15 --> 00:20:15
Where&#39;s your cat?

851
00:20:15 --> 00:20:16
Kitty?

852
00:20:16 --> 00:20:17
Kitty!

853
00:20:17 --> 00:20:18
Kitty!

854
00:20:18 --> 00:20:19
Kitty!

855
00:20:19 --> 00:20:21
Don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s fine.

856
00:20:21 --> 00:20:22
Master Fan?

857
00:20:22 --> 00:20:22
Master Fan?

858
00:20:22 --> 00:20:23
Are you alright?

859
00:20:23 --> 00:20:24
I&#39;m not master of anything now.

860
00:20:24 --> 00:20:25
It&#39;s all gone.

861
00:20:25 --> 00:20:26
Call it fate.

862
00:20:26 --> 00:20:28
We said this would just be temporary.

863
00:20:28 --> 00:20:32
Now we&#39;re refugees, just like the rest of them.

864
00:20:32 --> 00:20:33
No different from anyone else.

865
00:20:33 --> 00:20:34
Xialu, Xialu.

866
00:20:34 --> 00:20:34
Wait a moment.

867
00:20:34 --> 00:20:35
Master Fan?

868
00:20:35 --> 00:20:35
Can you do me a favor?

869
00:20:35 --> 00:20:36
What?

870
00:20:36 --> 00:20:37
You&#39;ve got a cart

871
00:20:37 --> 00:20:38
and we don&#39;t anymore.

872
00:20:38 --> 00:20:39
My daughter-in-law is pregnant.

873
00:20:39 --> 00:20:40
Let her ride on your cart.

874
00:20:40 --> 00:20:41
If you let her ride,

875
00:20:41 --> 00:20:42
we&#39;ll forget all about

876
00:20:42 --> 00:20:43
the millet you borrowed.

877
00:20:43 --> 00:20:44
How does that sound?

878
00:20:44 --> 00:20:45
We&#39;re all neighbors here.

879
00:20:45 --> 00:20:46
Get on.

880
00:20:46 --> 00:20:47
Sure then.

881
00:20:47 --> 00:20:48
Great.

882
00:20:48 --> 00:20:49
It&#39;s a deal.

883
00:20:49 --> 00:20:50
She can sit.

884
00:20:50 --> 00:20:52
Shuanzhu, go pull the cart.

885
00:20:52 --> 00:20:53
Master Fan begging us?

886
00:20:53 --> 00:20:54
Feels good!

887
00:20:54 --> 00:20:55
Father Sim,

888
00:20:55 --> 00:20:56
you did well

889
00:20:56 --> 00:20:57
to stay with the refugees,

890
00:20:57 --> 00:21:00
preaching and doing the work of the Lord.

891
00:21:00 --> 00:21:02
You will certainly make a difference.

892
00:21:02 --> 00:21:03
Father,

893
00:21:03 --> 00:21:04
I&#39;m a deserter.

894
00:21:04 --> 00:21:05
I came back here

895
00:21:05 --> 00:21:07
on a truck with the defeated soldiers.

896
00:21:07 --> 00:21:08
You need to rest.

897
00:21:08 --> 00:21:09
You must not starve to death.

898
00:21:09 --> 00:21:11
A dead priest cannot preach.

899
00:21:11 --> 00:21:13
I want to ask you one question.

900
00:21:13 --> 00:21:16
The Lord knows what&#39;s happening here?

901
00:21:16 --> 00:21:17
Yes.

902
00:21:17 --> 00:21:18
If He knows,

903
00:21:18 --> 00:21:20
why doesn&#39;t He do anything?

904
00:21:20 --> 00:21:21
Everything in this world

905
00:21:21 --> 00:21:23
because of the Lord&#39;s wishes.

906
00:21:23 --> 00:21:24
This is not

907
00:21:24 --> 00:21:25
the wishes of the Lord.

908
00:21:25 --> 00:21:26
This is caused by the Devil.

909
00:21:26 --> 00:21:26
Why?

910
00:21:26 --> 00:21:28
Why the Devil always win?

911
00:21:28 --> 00:21:29
If the Lord can&#39;t win,

912
00:21:29 --> 00:21:30
why believe?

913
00:21:30 --> 00:21:31
Father Sim,

914
00:21:31 --> 00:21:32
you&#39;re tired.

915
00:21:32 --> 00:21:33
You mustn&#39;t doubt the Lord.

916
00:21:33 --> 00:21:33
Father,

917
00:21:33 --> 00:21:38
I also feel the Devil has entered my body.

918
00:21:38 --> 00:21:39
Jesus Christ.

919
00:21:39 --> 00:21:40
Push harder.

920
00:21:40 --> 00:21:41
Harder!

921
00:21:41 --> 00:21:43
I can&#39;t, Mommy.

922
00:21:43 --> 00:21:44
I have to pick it out every day.

923
00:21:44 --> 00:21:45
I should just let you clog up.

924
00:21:45 --> 00:21:46
Small wonder she can&#39;t poop.

925
00:21:46 --> 00:21:47
We&#39;ve had nothing but tree bark to eat.

926
00:21:47 --> 00:21:49
Makes my breath smell bitter.

927
00:21:49 --> 00:21:51
My breath used to smell like dumplings.

928
00:21:51 --> 00:21:52
Hello.

929
00:21:52 --> 00:21:54
Stop following me.

930
00:21:54 --> 00:21:55
I want to take a picture though.

931
00:21:55 --> 00:21:56
Hold on.

932
00:21:56 --> 00:21:58
Okay.

933
00:21:58 --> 00:21:59
Give me one.

934
00:21:59 --> 00:22:00
Stop following.

935
00:22:00 --> 00:22:00
Hey, look.

936
00:22:00 --> 00:22:01
A foreigner.

937
00:22:01 --> 00:22:02
Give me one.

938
00:22:02 --> 00:22:02
Come here.

939
00:22:02 --> 00:22:03
Hungry?

940
00:22:03 --> 00:22:04
Quiet!

941
00:22:04 --> 00:22:05
Xialu,

942
00:22:05 --> 00:22:06
you go take his donkey.

943
00:22:06 --> 00:22:06
Okay.

944
00:22:06 --> 00:22:06
Shuanzhu,

945
00:22:06 --> 00:22:07
You keep an eye on him.

946
00:22:07 --> 00:22:08
Don&#39;t wake him up.

947
00:22:08 --> 00:22:09
Ssssh!

948
00:22:09 --> 00:22:10
Where should I take it?

949
00:22:10 --> 00:22:10
Keep going.

950
00:22:10 --> 00:22:12
Kill it. Cook it. Eat it.

951
00:22:12 --> 00:22:13
Stop, Stop!

952
00:22:13 --> 00:22:13
Stop, Stop!

953
00:22:13 --> 00:22:14
Run!

954
00:22:14 --> 00:22:15
S&#39;[0p

955
00:22:15 --> 00:22:16
The crackers

956
00:22:16 --> 00:22:16
and the donkey

957
00:22:16 --> 00:22:16
are yours.

958
00:22:16 --> 00:22:17
You can&#39;t eat the camera.

959
00:22:17 --> 00:22:17
Give it to me.

960
00:22:17 --> 00:22:18
OK

961
00:22:18 --> 00:22:18
Shuanzhu, stop.

962
00:22:18 --> 00:22:19
Give it to him.

963
00:22:19 --> 00:22:20
Here.

964
00:22:20 --> 00:22:20
Thank you.

965
00:22:20 --> 00:22:21
Friends.

966
00:22:21 --> 00:22:21
Brothers.

967
00:22:21 --> 00:22:21
Brothers.

968
00:22:21 --> 00:22:21
Sure, sure.

969
00:22:21 --> 00:22:22
What are you waiting for?

970
00:22:22 --> 00:22:23
Go find Xialu and the donkey.

971
00:22:23 --> 00:22:24
Go on!

972
00:22:24 --> 00:22:25
Xialu!

973
00:22:25 --> 00:22:25
Xialu!

974
00:22:25 --> 00:22:25
Shuanzhu!

975
00:22:25 --> 00:22:25
Where&#39;s the donkey?

976
00:22:25 --> 00:22:26
It ran off.

977
00:22:26 --> 00:22:27
You moron!

978
00:22:27 --> 00:22:28
Can&#39;t even handle a donkey!

979
00:22:28 --> 00:22:29
I wanted it to run faster,

980
00:22:29 --> 00:22:30
so I smacked its rump.

981
00:22:30 --> 00:22:31
But it got startled.

982
00:22:31 --> 00:22:32
Which way did it go?

983
00:22:32 --> 00:22:32
It was too dark.

984
00:22:32 --> 00:22:33
I couldn&#39;t see.

985
00:22:33 --> 00:22:34
You go that way.

986
00:22:34 --> 00:22:34
I&#39;ll go this way.

987
00:22:34 --> 00:22:34
Okay?

988
00:22:34 --> 00:22:34
Okay.

989
00:22:34 --> 00:22:35
You killed my donkey?

990
00:22:35 --> 00:22:35
Fuck off!

991
00:22:35 --> 00:22:36
Your donkey?

992
00:22:36 --> 00:22:37
You&#39;re just a refugee.

993
00:22:37 --> 00:22:38
If you had a donkey,

994
00:22:38 --> 00:22:39
your eyes wouldn&#39;t be caving in.

995
00:22:39 --> 00:22:40
If you&#39;re going to keep it,

996
00:22:40 --> 00:22:41
at least give me a piece of meat!

997
00:22:41 --> 00:22:42
You couldn&#39;t push him somewhere else?

998
00:22:42 --> 00:22:43
It&#39;s been three days.

999
00:22:43 --> 00:22:44
We can&#39;t keep waiting.

1000
00:22:44 --> 00:22:45
If we don&#39;t leave,

1001
00:22:45 --> 00:22:46
we&#39;ll starve right here.

1002
00:22:46 --> 00:22:47
Where&#39;d Xialu go?

1003
00:22:47 --> 00:22:48
We&#39;ve looked everywhere,

1004
00:22:48 --> 00:22:49
but there&#39;s no trace of him.

1005
00:22:49 --> 00:22:50
You were going to steal a donkey!

1006
00:22:50 --> 00:22:51
There&#39;s no donkey and now no Xialu.

1007
00:22:51 --> 00:22:52
You&#39;ve got to make it right.

1008
00:22:52 --> 00:22:53
People have been dying every day on this road.

1009
00:22:53 --> 00:22:54
What&#39;s so strange about that?

1010
00:22:54 --> 00:22:55
At least they leave bodies behind.

1011
00:22:55 --> 00:22:56
What about Xialu?

1012
00:22:56 --> 00:22:57
We haven&#39;t found a live body or a dead one!

1013
00:22:57 --> 00:22:58
You don&#39;t even care!

1014
00:22:58 --> 00:22:59
Xialu!

1015
00:22:59 --> 00:23:00
Xialu!

1016
00:23:00 --> 00:23:03
Where did you go?

1017
00:23:03 --> 00:23:04
We&#39;re all alone and
they&#39;re taking advantage of us!

1018
00:23:04 --> 00:23:07
Why don&#39;t you do anything?

1019
00:23:07 --> 00:23:08
Where are you?

1020
00:23:08 --> 00:23:10
Xialu!

1021
00:23:10 --> 00:23:11
They all lost their parents in the war.

1022
00:23:11 --> 00:23:12
It&#39;s a new group,

1023
00:23:12 --> 00:23:13
so they haven&#39;t rehearsed yet.

1024
00:23:13 --> 00:23:14
They&#39;re good.

1025
00:23:14 --> 00:23:15
Very good.

1026
00:23:15 --> 00:23:17
The girl holding the flag

1027
00:23:17 --> 00:23:19
is the daughter of General Sun Fangwu.

1028
00:23:19 --> 00:23:21
General Sun led Division 96.

1029
00:23:21 --> 00:23:23
He died in Burma last month.

1030
00:23:23 --> 00:23:27
Your father was a great soldier.

1031
00:23:27 --> 00:23:28
You come visit us

1032
00:23:28 --> 00:23:29
at Chinese New Year

1033
00:23:29 --> 00:23:30
and I&#39;ll give you a nice present.

1034
00:23:30 --> 00:23:31
All right?

1035
00:23:31 --> 00:23:32
Your fathers

1036
00:23:32 --> 00:23:33
were all great soldiers.

1037
00:23:33 --> 00:23:34
Why is everybody heading west?

1038
00:23:34 --> 00:23:36
Well, habit, I think.

1039
00:23:36 --> 00:23:40
People in Henan always go west to Shaanxi
when there is a disaster.

1040
00:23:40 --> 00:23:42
Just like people in Shandong go to the Northeast.

1041
00:23:42 --> 00:23:44
How can a drought produce such a disaster,

1042
00:23:44 --> 00:23:46
there are so many displaced people here.

1043
00:23:46 --> 00:23:46
Locusts.

1044
00:23:46 --> 00:23:47
It&#39;s mainly because of locusts.

1045
00:23:47 --> 00:23:48
Can&#39;t be fucking locusts.

1046
00:23:48 --> 00:23:49
Get down.

1047
00:23:49 --> 00:23:49
Get down.

1048
00:23:49 --> 00:23:50
Stop it!

1049
00:23:50 --> 00:23:51
Fuck!

1050
00:23:51 --> 00:23:51
Fuck!

1051
00:23:51 --> 00:23:52
Now,

1052
00:23:52 --> 00:23:54
Everyone watch for my hand signal!

1053
00:23:54 --> 00:23:55
Be careful

1054
00:23:55 --> 00:23:56
you don&#39;t shout too early

1055
00:23:56 --> 00:23:57
or too late.

1056
00:23:57 --> 00:23:58
Wait until the foreigners

1057
00:23:58 --> 00:24:01
are 50 meters away.

1058
00:24:01 --> 00:24:02
Does everyone understand?

1059
00:24:02 --> 00:24:03
Understood.

1060
00:24:03 --> 00:24:05
Louder! Understand?

1061
00:24:05 --> 00:24:07
Understood!

1062
00:24:07 --> 00:24:09
Then let&#39;s give it a try and see

1063
00:24:09 --> 00:24:10
if all the factories,

1064
00:24:10 --> 00:24:11
schools,

1065
00:24:11 --> 00:24:12
work units,

1066
00:24:12 --> 00:24:13
and stores

1067
00:24:13 --> 00:24:14
are well-rehearsed!

1068
00:24:14 --> 00:24:15
Attention!

1069
00:24:15 --> 00:24:17
The cars are coming!

1070
00:24:17 --> 00:24:19
Now they are 50 meters away!

1071
00:24:19 --> 00:24:20
Shouﬂ

1072
00:24:20 --> 00:24:25
Welcome!

1073
00:24:25 --> 00:24:27
Together now! Louder!

1074
00:24:27 --> 00:24:27
Welcome!

1075
00:24:27 --> 00:24:28
Together now!

1076
00:24:28 --> 00:24:29
No, this is not acceptable!

1077
00:24:29 --> 00:24:30
They are still not shouting in unison!

1078
00:24:30 --> 00:24:31
Is this what you call organization
here in Chungking?

1079
00:24:31 --> 00:24:33
What if we didn&#39;t have them speaking English?

1080
00:24:33 --> 00:24:34
How about &quot;huanying?&quot;

1081
00:24:34 --> 00:24:35
This isn&#39;t about what they shout.

1082
00:24:35 --> 00:24:36
This is a diplomatic issue!

1083
00:24:36 --> 00:24:37
Mr. Gaus. I need to talk to you.

1084
00:24:37 --> 00:24:37
I&#39;m on a tight schedule.

1085
00:24:37 --> 00:24:37
It&#39;s urgent.

1086
00:24:37 --> 00:24:39
I have to go to the airport to pick up
the president&#39;s special envoy.

1087
00:24:39 --> 00:24:39
Five minutes.

1088
00:24:39 --> 00:24:40
Give me five minutes. Okay?

1089
00:24:40 --> 00:24:41
Please.

1090
00:24:41 --> 00:24:42
Fine. Five minutes.

1091
00:24:42 --> 00:24:42
Your story

1092
00:24:42 --> 00:24:42
sounds made up.

1093
00:24:42 --> 00:24:43
No one is going to believe you.

1094
00:24:43 --> 00:24:45
If I hadn&#39;t run into several
Chinese communications troops,

1095
00:24:45 --> 00:24:47
I&#39;d have starved to death along with
the rest of those poor people.

1096
00:24:47 --> 00:24:49
If you report this in Time Magazine,

1097
00:24:49 --> 00:24:50
it will be explosive news.

1098
00:24:50 --> 00:24:54
I want to tell the Chinese government about
what&#39;s happening in Henan.

1099
00:24:54 --> 00:24:54
Please.

1100
00:24:54 --> 00:24:56
But this is China&#39;s war.

1101
00:24:56 --> 00:24:57
For God&#39;s sake.

1102
00:24:57 --> 00:24:58
It&#39;s out of my hands.

1103
00:24:58 --> 00:24:59
Troublemaker.

1104
00:24:59 --> 00:25:00
Before I went to Henan,

1105
00:25:00 --> 00:25:02
it was easy for me to meet with
government officials.

1106
00:25:02 --> 00:25:05
I don&#39;t know, now that I have returned,

1107
00:25:05 --> 00:25:06
it&#39;s like I have a contagious disease.

1108
00:25:06 --> 00:25:08
I can no longer meet with Minister Song Ziwen

1109
00:25:08 --> 00:25:11
I can not longer meet with Minister Zhang Daofan,

1110
00:25:11 --> 00:25:13
and Ambassador Gaus can&#39;t help either.

1111
00:25:13 --> 00:25:15
With the assistance of Xie Weisi
at the U.S. Embassy

1112
00:25:15 --> 00:25:17
I was able to see the Chairman of
Sichuan Province.

1113
00:25:17 --> 00:25:18
He told me he has no control over Henan.

1114
00:25:18 --> 00:25:19
He introduced me to Sun Ke,

1115
00:25:19 --> 00:25:20
president of the Court.

1116
00:25:20 --> 00:25:22
He told me that only General Chiang
can make any changes.

1117
00:25:22 --> 00:25:25
Lastly I met with Yu Youren.

1118
00:25:25 --> 00:25:28
He says I had to sit with you

1119
00:25:28 --> 00:25:30
and that perhaps you can help me

1120
00:25:30 --> 00:25:31
meet with Generalissimo Chiang.

1121
00:25:31 --> 00:25:33
Well, I understand.

1122
00:25:33 --> 00:25:34
He is very busy.

1123
00:25:34 --> 00:25:35
But don&#39;t worry.

1124
00:25:35 --> 00:25:36
I Will call him.

1125
00:25:36 --> 00:25:37
How long shall I wait?

1126
00:25:37 --> 00:25:38
Five days,

1127
00:25:38 --> 00:25:39
or ten days.

1128
00:25:39 --> 00:25:41
Or maybe you won&#39;t see him at all.

1129
00:25:41 --> 00:25:42
What?

1130
00:25:42 --> 00:25:43
Want some?

1131
00:25:43 --> 00:25:44
Give me a kiss.

1132
00:25:44 --> 00:25:44
After this is over.

1133
00:25:44 --> 00:25:46
I can&#39;t wait any longer!

1134
00:25:46 --> 00:25:47
Didn&#39;t work?

1135
00:25:47 --> 00:25:48
I&#39;m telling you,

1136
00:25:48 --> 00:25:51
a girl gets a little education and
she thinks she&#39;s special.

1137
00:25:51 --> 00:25:52
I&#39;ll sleep with you for the crackers.

1138
00:25:52 --> 00:25:52
I don&#39;t have any crackers.

1139
00:25:52 --> 00:25:53
- Give them to me. - I don&#39;t have any!

1140
00:25:53 --> 00:25:53
Give it to me!

1141
00:25:53 --> 00:25:55
You and Master Fan got Xialu killed.

1142
00:25:55 --> 00:25:56
You&#39;ve got to make that right!

1143
00:25:56 --> 00:25:57
One life

1144
00:25:57 --> 00:25:58
is worth two crackers.

1145
00:25:58 --> 00:25:58
Good!

1146
00:25:58 --> 00:25:58
There&#39;s the head!

1147
00:25:58 --> 00:25:59
Good!

1148
00:25:59 --> 00:25:59
Push.

1149
00:25:59 --> 00:26:00
I&#39;m dying.

1150
00:26:00 --> 00:26:01
I don&#39;t have the strength.

1151
00:26:01 --> 00:26:02
Push.

1152
00:26:02 --> 00:26:03
Keep on pushing.

1153
00:26:03 --> 00:26:04
There it comes!

1154
00:26:04 --> 00:26:05
Here, the scissors.

1155
00:26:05 --> 00:26:06
She did it.

1156
00:26:06 --> 00:26:06
L&#39;t&#39;S a boy!

1157
00:26:06 --> 00:26:06
Alive!

1158
00:26:06 --> 00:26:07
Hurry! Hurry! Faster!

1159
00:26:07 --> 00:26:08
Ancestors bless us.

1160
00:26:08 --> 00:26:09
Ancestors be praised.

1161
00:26:09 --> 00:26:10
Master Fan!

1162
00:26:10 --> 00:26:11
Come give the boy a name!

1163
00:26:11 --> 00:26:12
With a name, he&#39;ll have a better chance of living.

1164
00:26:12 --> 00:26:12
Sure.

1165
00:26:12 --> 00:26:14
Call him Liucheng - a good, auspicious name.

1166
00:26:14 --> 00:26:16
Just kill him.

1167
00:26:16 --> 00:26:17
Back on the road,

1168
00:26:17 --> 00:26:19
I won&#39;t have any milk for him.

1169
00:26:19 --> 00:26:20
He won&#39;t make it.

1170
00:26:20 --> 00:26:21
Don&#39;t say that!

1171
00:26:21 --> 00:26:22
Kill a healthy baby like this one?

1172
00:26:22 --> 00:26:23
We can&#39;t kill him!

1173
00:26:23 --> 00:26:23
Look,

1174
00:26:23 --> 00:26:24
I&#39;ll sell my coat

1175
00:26:24 --> 00:26:25
and make a nice hot soup for you.

1176
00:26:25 --> 00:26:25
Sweetheart,

1177
00:26:25 --> 00:26:26
I&#39;m sorry.

1178
00:26:26 --> 00:26:27
You brought that cat all this way

1179
00:26:27 --> 00:26:28
and today we had to

1180
00:26:28 --> 00:26:29
kill it.

1181
00:26:29 --> 00:26:30
Dad...

1182
00:26:30 --> 00:26:31
I want some soup too.

1183
00:26:31 --> 00:26:32
Lisheng.

1184
00:26:32 --> 00:26:34
You are in charge of the press, are you not?

1185
00:26:34 --> 00:26:35
Yes.

1186
00:26:35 --> 00:26:37
This is an editorial about the situation in Henan.

1187
00:26:37 --> 00:26:37
Readit

1188
00:26:37 --> 00:26:39
Our readers will have seen yesterday&#39;s report

1189
00:26:39 --> 00:26:40
about the disaster in Henan.

1190
00:26:40 --> 00:26:42
Who could have imagined
30 million of our countrymen

1191
00:26:42 --> 00:26:45
were doomed to the hellish fate of starvation?

1192
00:26:45 --> 00:26:46
This is all my fault.

1193
00:26:46 --> 00:26:47
I just got back from Guangxi yesterday.

1194
00:26:47 --> 00:26:48
This Wang Yunsheng,

1195
00:26:48 --> 00:26:49
he&#39;s the editor of Ta Kung Pao?

1196
00:26:49 --> 00:26:49
Yes.

1197
00:26:49 --> 00:26:50
Poisoning people&#39;s minds.

1198
00:26:50 --> 00:26:50
Shut his paper down!

1199
00:26:50 --> 00:26:51
Shut his paper down!

1200
00:26:51 --> 00:26:51
But

1201
00:26:51 --> 00:26:51
Wang Yunsheng

1202
00:26:51 --> 00:26:53
has been invited by
the U.S. Office of Strategic Services.

1203
00:26:53 --> 00:26:54
He will leave for America in a few days.

1204
00:26:54 --> 00:26:54
At this...

1205
00:26:54 --> 00:26:55
I don&#39;t think he should go.

1206
00:26:55 --> 00:26:56
Even more people

1207
00:26:56 --> 00:26:57
are talking about the war in Henan.

1208
00:26:57 --> 00:26:58
They&#39;re say we&#39;re abandoning Henan

1209
00:26:58 --> 00:26:59
and leaving the refugees to the Japanese.

1210
00:26:59 --> 00:26:59
It&#39;s an open secret.

1211
00:26:59 --> 00:27:01
When did we say we were giving up on Henan?

1212
00:27:01 --> 00:27:02
Set the record straight with an editorial

1213
00:27:02 --> 00:27:03
Set the record straight with an editorial

1214
00:27:03 --> 00:27:04
in the Central Daily News.

1215
00:27:04 --> 00:27:04
Yes sir.

1216
00:27:04 --> 00:27:05
Right away.

1217
00:27:05 --> 00:27:07
The Generalissimo will see
Mr. Wilkie off at the airport.

1218
00:27:07 --> 00:27:09
You only have fifteen minutes.

1219
00:27:09 --> 00:27:10
You understand Chinese, right?

1220
00:27:10 --> 00:27:10
Yes.

1221
00:27:10 --> 00:27:11
Then I won&#39;t have to translate for you.

1222
00:27:11 --> 00:27:12
But I am going to have to speak English, okay?

1223
00:27:12 --> 00:27:12
Okay.

1224
00:27:12 --> 00:27:13
Generalissimo,

1225
00:27:13 --> 00:27:14
This is Mr. White.

1226
00:27:14 --> 00:27:15
Mr. White,

1227
00:27:15 --> 00:27:16
I&#39;ve heard of you.

1228
00:27:16 --> 00:27:17
Nice to see you.

1229
00:27:17 --> 00:27:18
Honorable Generalissimo,

1230
00:27:18 --> 00:27:21
It grieves me to report to you

1231
00:27:21 --> 00:27:23
that thirty million people in Henan

1232
00:27:23 --> 00:27:24
don&#39;t have enough food to eat.

1233
00:27:24 --> 00:27:27
Each day an increasing number of refugees
are starving to death.

1234
00:27:27 --> 00:27:29
He is reporting on the situation in Henan.

1235
00:27:29 --> 00:27:29
He says many people are starving.

1236
00:27:29 --> 00:27:31
It&#39;s been explained to me by some officials

1237
00:27:31 --> 00:27:33
it is because there is a war going on,

1238
00:27:33 --> 00:27:34
but I was there

1239
00:27:34 --> 00:27:38
and it appears as if the Japanese
haven&#39;t started an attack on Henan.

1240
00:27:38 --> 00:27:40
He says the government must not
know what&#39;s happening.

1241
00:27:40 --> 00:27:42
Officials say it&#39;s because of the war,

1242
00:27:42 --> 00:27:44
but the Japanese haven&#39;t started attacking Henan.

1243
00:27:44 --> 00:27:45
There is indeed a famine,

1244
00:27:45 --> 00:27:47
but it&#39;s not as severe as you say.

1245
00:27:47 --> 00:27:50
With all due respect, Generalissimo,

1246
00:27:50 --> 00:27:52
I&#39;ve heard that people are now
resorted to eating each other.

1247
00:27:52 --> 00:27:54
He heard there&#39;s been cannibalism.

1248
00:27:54 --> 00:27:55
Impossible.

1249
00:27:55 --> 00:27:57
Something like that could never happen in China.

1250
00:27:57 --> 00:27:59
I&#39;ve seen dogs eating people.

1251
00:27:59 --> 00:28:00
I&#39;ve seen it.

1252
00:28:00 --> 00:28:01
I&#39;ve seen it, Sir.

1253
00:28:01 --> 00:28:02
He saw it himself.

1254
00:28:02 --> 00:28:03
I&#39;ve seen it, Sir.

1255
00:28:03 --> 00:28:04
Please.

1256
00:28:04 --> 00:28:05
I never imagined

1257
00:28:05 --> 00:28:06
things could be so bad.

1258
00:28:06 --> 00:28:08
If the famine is indeed as severe as you say

1259
00:28:08 --> 00:28:09
then the government

1260
00:28:09 --> 00:28:10
will surely take action!

1261
00:28:10 --> 00:28:11
These self-satisfied Americans.

1262
00:28:11 --> 00:28:12
They&#39;re nothing but trouble!

1263
00:28:12 --> 00:28:14
If those pictures get published,

1264
00:28:14 --> 00:28:15
they&#39;ll call me the Generalissimo

1265
00:28:15 --> 00:28:17
who sat by while his people suffered.

1266
00:28:17 --> 00:28:18
A heartless despot.

1267
00:28:18 --> 00:28:23
Farewell!

1268
00:28:23 --> 00:28:24
Farewell!

1269
00:28:24 --> 00:28:34
Farewell!

1270
00:28:34 --> 00:28:37
Farewell!

1271
00:28:37 --> 00:28:38
White&#39;s article about the Henan famine

1272
00:28:38 --> 00:28:40
has been published in Time.

1273
00:28:40 --> 00:28:43
Should I confiscate
all the copies of Time in China?

1274
00:28:43 --> 00:28:43
No.

1275
00:28:43 --> 00:28:44
Buy as many copies as possible.

1276
00:28:44 --> 00:28:46
Have the Foreign Ministry
translate it into Chinese.

1277
00:28:46 --> 00:28:49
Send a copy to every minister
and provincial governor.

1278
00:28:49 --> 00:28:52
Add Li Peiji&#39;s reports at the end.

1279
00:28:52 --> 00:28:55
We need to send relief
as soon as the Japanese leave.

1280
00:28:55 --> 00:28:56
Otherwise, what will the rest of the world think?

1281
00:28:56 --> 00:28:58
We&#39;d be as corrupt as they say we are.

1282
00:28:58 --> 00:28:59
Contact Yan Xishan

1283
00:28:59 --> 00:29:03
Have them immediately send supplies
to the disaster area.

1284
00:29:03 --> 00:29:04
Then,

1285
00:29:04 --> 00:29:05
tell Zhang Lisheng

1286
00:29:05 --> 00:29:06
to mobilize all of China to raise
relief funds for the refugees.

1287
00:29:06 --> 00:29:07
There are times

1288
00:29:07 --> 00:29:09
when I miss the old Northern Expedition days.

1289
00:29:09 --> 00:29:10
All I had to do was give the order,

1290
00:29:10 --> 00:29:11
and my men would leap into action.

1291
00:29:11 --> 00:29:14
I had no burdens

1292
00:29:14 --> 00:29:18
keeping me from standing with the people.

1293
00:29:18 --> 00:29:19
How is she?

1294
00:29:19 --> 00:29:21
She lost a lot of blood, and with the cold

1295
00:29:21 --> 00:29:23
her pulse is very weak.

1296
00:29:23 --> 00:29:24
You&#39;ve got to do something.

1297
00:29:24 --> 00:29:25
If you save her,

1298
00:29:25 --> 00:29:27
I&#39;ll give you two acres of land when this is over.

1299
00:29:27 --> 00:29:28
Master Fan,

1300
00:29:28 --> 00:29:30
the cure is very simple.

1301
00:29:30 --> 00:29:32
Just give her some food.

1302
00:29:32 --> 00:29:33
If you want to know,

1303
00:29:33 --> 00:29:39
my mother and my grandchildren

1304
00:29:39 --> 00:29:41
died of hunger on the road these past two days.

1305
00:29:41 --> 00:29:44
I&#39;m so hungry I can&#39;t walk straight.

1306
00:29:44 --> 00:29:45
Master Fan!

1307
00:29:45 --> 00:29:46
Master Fan, hurry!

1308
00:29:46 --> 00:29:47
What is it?

1309
00:29:47 --> 00:29:48
She stopped breathing.

1310
00:29:48 --> 00:29:50
She was a good daughter-in-law.

1311
00:29:50 --> 00:29:51
I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll tell her family,

1312
00:29:51 --> 00:29:52
letting her die like this.

1313
00:29:52 --> 00:29:53
What are you doing?

1314
00:29:53 --> 00:29:54
Give the baby some milk

1315
00:29:54 --> 00:29:55
while her body is still warm.

1316
00:29:55 --> 00:29:57
My god!

1317
00:29:57 --> 00:29:58
What?

1318
00:29:58 --> 00:30:00
She hasn&#39;t eaten in five days!

1319
00:30:00 --> 00:30:01
She is as thin as a stick.

1320
00:30:01 --> 00:30:02
How can she have milk?

1321
00:30:02 --> 00:30:03
Gentlemen,

1322
00:30:03 --> 00:30:07
After urgent appeals from
the provincial government,

1323
00:30:07 --> 00:30:10
the central government has started
providing relief aid to Henan.

1324
00:30:10 --> 00:30:11
Starting this month,

1325
00:30:11 --> 00:30:12
the central government

1326
00:30:12 --> 00:30:15
will provide 80 million pounds of grain

1327
00:30:15 --> 00:30:18
from the military provisions.

1328
00:30:18 --> 00:30:18
Gentlemen,

1329
00:30:18 --> 00:30:20
Governor Li&#39;s deep concern for the public welfare

1330
00:30:20 --> 00:30:22
and fearless dedication have finally paid off.

1331
00:30:22 --> 00:30:23
He not only went to Chungking,

1332
00:30:23 --> 00:30:24
but he also submitted six reports.

1333
00:30:24 --> 00:30:25
Future generations of Henanese

1334
00:30:25 --> 00:30:27
will remember Governor Li&#39;s kindness.

1335
00:30:27 --> 00:30:31
Let&#39;s discuss the matter of
delivering the relief grain.

1336
00:30:31 --> 00:30:31
Yes,Sir

1337
00:30:31 --> 00:30:32
How can we have this meeting?

1338
00:30:32 --> 00:30:34
The heads of the grain and account departments

1339
00:30:34 --> 00:30:35
are both absent.

1340
00:30:35 --> 00:30:35
That&#39;s not right.

1341
00:30:35 --> 00:30:37
Mr. Lu and Mr. Peng have gone to

1342
00:30:37 --> 00:30:38
Luoyang to inspect the disaster.

1343
00:30:38 --> 00:30:40
We can&#39;t delay relief efforts by another moment.

1344
00:30:40 --> 00:30:41
After all our begging,

1345
00:30:41 --> 00:30:42
they&#39;re only offering 80 million pounds?

1346
00:30:42 --> 00:30:43
When there was a famine in Hubei last year

1347
00:30:43 --> 00:30:45
the government gave more than 200 million pounds.

1348
00:30:45 --> 00:30:47
Do we sell ourselves so cheaply in Henan?

1349
00:30:47 --> 00:30:48
Is 80 million pounds enough?

1350
00:30:48 --> 00:30:49
We have 30 million people.

1351
00:30:49 --> 00:30:50
Each person only gets two and half pounds.

1352
00:30:50 --> 00:30:51
That&#39;s enough for three days!

1353
00:30:51 --> 00:30:53
What happens after that?

1354
00:30:53 --> 00:30:53
Mr. Fang,

1355
00:30:53 --> 00:30:54
getting 80 million pounds

1356
00:30:54 --> 00:30:56
is better than having to give 80 million pounds.

1357
00:30:56 --> 00:30:57
After we get this,

1358
00:30:57 --> 00:30:58
we can ask for more.

1359
00:30:58 --> 00:31:01
80 million is enough to
take care of the emergency.

1360
00:31:01 --> 00:31:02
It may even save

1361
00:31:02 --> 00:31:04
a few hundred thousand people.

1362
00:31:04 --> 00:31:05
Am I right?

1363
00:31:05 --> 00:31:06
Today,

1364
00:31:06 --> 00:31:07
the main task

1365
00:31:07 --> 00:31:08
is to define the disaster areas.

1366
00:31:08 --> 00:31:09
Define the disaster areas?

1367
00:31:09 --> 00:31:11
The entire province is a disaster area.

1368
00:31:11 --> 00:31:11
Mr. Fang,

1369
00:31:11 --> 00:31:13
It is precisely because there is
not enough to go around

1370
00:31:13 --> 00:31:14
that we can&#39;t distribute grain at random.

1371
00:31:14 --> 00:31:15
We have to focus on the worst areas.

1372
00:31:15 --> 00:31:16
I agree that we should focus our efforts.

1373
00:31:16 --> 00:31:17
But in the past

1374
00:31:17 --> 00:31:19
we&#39;ve concentrated on rural areas

1375
00:31:19 --> 00:31:20
and neglected the cities.

1376
00:31:20 --> 00:31:23
And it&#39;s in the cities that we see the problems.

1377
00:31:23 --> 00:31:25
I&#39;m not saying this just because cities

1378
00:31:25 --> 00:31:26
are my jurisdiction.

1379
00:31:26 --> 00:31:27
But remember when the Yellow River flooded

1380
00:31:27 --> 00:31:30
and the provincial government was attacked.

1381
00:31:30 --> 00:31:31
When choosing our focus,

1382
00:31:31 --> 00:31:32
We should consider certain professions.

1383
00:31:32 --> 00:31:34
I&#39;m not saying this because
I&#39;m in charge of education,

1384
00:31:34 --> 00:31:35
but education is our future.

1385
00:31:35 --> 00:31:37
The Generalissimo has always said so.

1386
00:31:37 --> 00:31:38
We mustn&#39;t focus on the refugees

1387
00:31:38 --> 00:31:39
at the expense of other groups.

1388
00:31:39 --> 00:31:41
If our teachers and students starve to death

1389
00:31:41 --> 00:31:42
we&#39;ll have no future to save.

1390
00:31:42 --> 00:31:43
So far as focus goes,

1391
00:31:43 --> 00:31:44
as the captain of police,

1392
00:31:44 --> 00:31:47
I need to speak up for the hundreds of
thousands of police who are also frightened.

1393
00:31:47 --> 00:31:49
Because they&#39;re busy in our areas of focus.

1394
00:31:49 --> 00:31:49
Wherever there&#39;s trouble,

1395
00:31:49 --> 00:31:50
they&#39;re there to keep order.

1396
00:31:50 --> 00:31:51
I dare say

1397
00:31:51 --> 00:31:52
if it weren&#39;t for the thousands of police braving

1398
00:31:52 --> 00:31:54
hunger and enforcing law and order,

1399
00:31:54 --> 00:31:56
we would already have had a revolution in Henan.

1400
00:31:56 --> 00:31:57
80 million pounds is not enough for anything.

1401
00:31:57 --> 00:31:59
The police are among the refugees.

1402
00:31:59 --> 00:32:00
What are you arguing for?

1403
00:32:00 --> 00:32:00
What are you arguing for?

1404
00:32:00 --> 00:32:01
Before we got this aid,

1405
00:32:01 --> 00:32:03
you were constantly complaining about it.

1406
00:32:03 --> 00:32:04
Now that we&#39;ve got it,

1407
00:32:04 --> 00:32:07
you&#39;re tearing each other to pieces over it.

1408
00:32:07 --> 00:32:07
If I&#39;d known,

1409
00:32:07 --> 00:32:09
I never would have asked.

1410
00:32:09 --> 00:32:11
It&#39;s still not too late to send the grain back!

1411
00:32:11 --> 00:32:11
Gentlemen,

1412
00:32:11 --> 00:32:13
Each department is focused on its own problems.

1413
00:32:13 --> 00:32:14
You all have good reasons.

1414
00:32:14 --> 00:32:15
As for how we define who&#39;s a refugee.

1415
00:32:15 --> 00:32:16
And who isn&#39;t,

1416
00:32:16 --> 00:32:17
we can discuss that later.

1417
00:32:17 --> 00:32:18
I must emphasize that

1418
00:32:18 --> 00:32:18
in distributing this relief grain,

1419
00:32:18 --> 00:32:19
we cannot be selfish.

1420
00:32:19 --> 00:32:21
We must act under the leadership of
the provincial government.

1421
00:32:21 --> 00:32:21
If that&#39;s how it is,

1422
00:32:21 --> 00:32:23
why bother having this meeting?

1423
00:32:23 --> 00:32:25
Can&#39;t the two of you just decide
between yourselves?

1424
00:32:25 --> 00:32:25
Fang,

1425
00:32:25 --> 00:32:29
what are you trying to say?

1426
00:32:29 --> 00:32:30
Telegram, Mr. Governor.

1427
00:32:30 --> 00:32:32
What&#39;s going on today?

1428
00:32:32 --> 00:32:32
Governor...

1429
00:32:32 --> 00:32:33
What now?

1430
00:32:33 --> 00:32:34
Does the government want to take it back?

1431
00:32:34 --> 00:32:36
The government doesn&#39;t want it back.

1432
00:32:36 --> 00:32:39
We&#39;ve been ambushed by Jiang Dingwen.

1433
00:32:39 --> 00:32:43
Remember the 30 million pounds of grain he wanted?

1434
00:32:43 --> 00:32:46
He&#39;s detained the head of
the grain department, Lao Lu,

1435
00:32:46 --> 00:32:47
and the head of the accounts department, Lao Peng.

1436
00:32:47 --> 00:32:48
They are both with Jiang.

1437
00:32:48 --> 00:32:50
He&#39;ll release them in exchange for grain.

1438
00:32:50 --> 00:32:52
You all like arguing so much?

1439
00:32:52 --> 00:32:55
Why don&#39;t you go argue with Jiang Dingwen?

1440
00:32:55 --> 00:32:56
In a famine year,

1441
00:32:56 --> 00:32:59
giving Jiang Dingwen a &quot;gift&quot; like this...

1442
00:32:59 --> 00:33:01
I&#39;m no better than the rest of them.

1443
00:33:01 --> 00:33:03
Jiang Dingwen will take bribes.

1444
00:33:03 --> 00:33:04
A &quot;gift&quot; of 3 million pounds of grain

1445
00:33:04 --> 00:33:05
will not only get us our &quot;hostages&quot; back,

1446
00:33:05 --> 00:33:08
but it might even change his mind
about the 30 million pounds.

1447
00:33:08 --> 00:33:11
That would be in Henan&#39;s best interests, too.

1448
00:33:11 --> 00:33:12
Governor Li,

1449
00:33:12 --> 00:33:13
When I exchanged gold bars,

1450
00:33:13 --> 00:33:15
I bought an extra 500,000 pounds of grain.

1451
00:33:15 --> 00:33:16
What?

1452
00:33:16 --> 00:33:17
Why didn&#39;t you tell me?

1453
00:33:17 --> 00:33:19
You were at the meeting.

1454
00:33:19 --> 00:33:21
No one will think you&#39;re right

1455
00:33:21 --> 00:33:22
if you allocate all of the grain as planned.

1456
00:33:22 --> 00:33:24
It&#39;ll only cause more problems.

1457
00:33:24 --> 00:33:25
Old Fang

1458
00:33:25 --> 00:33:26
is always making trouble at meetings.

1459
00:33:26 --> 00:33:27
I don&#39;t know what he wants.

1460
00:33:27 --> 00:33:29
He headed up the civil affairs department
for a long time.

1461
00:33:29 --> 00:33:29
Before you came,

1462
00:33:29 --> 00:33:32
he was the top choice to be governor.

1463
00:33:32 --> 00:33:34
Then Generalissimo Chiang changed his mind.

1464
00:33:34 --> 00:33:36
I can contact Generalissimo Chiang
immediately and resign.

1465
00:33:36 --> 00:33:37
He can take over!

1466
00:33:37 --> 00:33:39
He can go speak to Jiang Dingwen!

1467
00:33:39 --> 00:33:41
500,000 pounds is not very much.

1468
00:33:41 --> 00:33:43
If you want the central government
to give you more,

1469
00:33:43 --> 00:33:45
then don&#39;t you need to &quot;pay visits&quot; to others?

1470
00:33:45 --> 00:33:48
I can&#39;t stay on as an official.

1471
00:33:48 --> 00:33:50
I should retire and go home.

1472
00:33:50 --> 00:33:50
Governor Li,

1473
00:33:50 --> 00:33:52
If we&#39;d retired,

1474
00:33:52 --> 00:33:54
we&#39;d probably be refugees now, too.

1475
00:33:54 --> 00:33:56
This is a broadcast from

1476
00:33:56 --> 00:33:57
the first military district&#39;s political department

1477
00:33:57 --> 00:34:00
and the Luoyang municipal government.

1478
00:34:00 --> 00:34:01
To support the war effort

1479
00:34:01 --> 00:34:02
and safeguard military supplies,

1480
00:34:02 --> 00:34:05
and to keep out traitors and maintain civic order,

1481
00:34:05 --> 00:34:08
only residents of Luoyang
will be permitted into the city.

1482
00:34:08 --> 00:34:09
Those who willfully disobey will be prosecuted

1483
00:34:09 --> 00:34:12
under Section Nine, Article Three

1484
00:34:12 --> 00:34:16
of the Wartime City Management Regulations.

1485
00:34:16 --> 00:34:17
Go.

1486
00:34:17 --> 00:34:18
You want to die?

1487
00:34:18 --> 00:34:19
Sir?

1488
00:34:19 --> 00:34:21
Isn&#39;t the government providing relief aid?

1489
00:34:21 --> 00:34:22
Where can we get food?

1490
00:34:22 --> 00:34:25
The government has identified two disaster areas,
northern and southern Henan.

1491
00:34:25 --> 00:34:26
Now that you&#39;re in Luoyang,

1492
00:34:26 --> 00:34:27
you&#39;re no longer considered a refugee.

1493
00:34:27 --> 00:34:30
Then how can I become a refugee?

1494
00:34:30 --> 00:34:32
Turn around and walk a few hundred miles.

1495
00:34:32 --> 00:34:35
North or south, it doesn&#39;t matter.

1496
00:34:35 --> 00:34:35
Mom?

1497
00:34:35 --> 00:34:36
Mom?

1498
00:34:36 --> 00:34:36
Morn!

1499
00:34:36 --> 00:34:37
Dad!

1500
00:34:37 --> 00:34:37
What?

1501
00:34:37 --> 00:34:38
What&#39;s wrong with Mom?

1502
00:34:38 --> 00:34:38
Mom?

1503
00:34:38 --> 00:34:38
Morn!

1504
00:34:38 --> 00:34:39
Dead.

1505
00:34:39 --> 00:34:40
Morn!

1506
00:34:40 --> 00:34:41
Dead is good.

1507
00:34:41 --> 00:34:42
No more suffering.

1508
00:34:42 --> 00:34:43
She can move on to her next life.

1509
00:34:43 --> 00:34:44
In your next life,

1510
00:34:44 --> 00:34:46
don&#39;t come back here.

1511
00:34:46 --> 00:34:48
Our commander is deeply concerned
for the common people,

1512
00:34:48 --> 00:34:49
so he is allocating some military grain

1513
00:34:49 --> 00:34:50
to be sold to refugees at a low price

1514
00:34:50 --> 00:34:51
to help them with their difficulties.

1515
00:34:51 --> 00:34:52
I give this responsibility to you.

1516
00:34:52 --> 00:34:53
Act prudently, whatever you do!

1517
00:34:53 --> 00:34:54
The country&#39;s fate hangs in the balance.

1518
00:34:54 --> 00:34:55
You must not act out of self-interest.

1519
00:34:55 --> 00:34:56
Trust me, sir.

1520
00:34:56 --> 00:34:57
I may be a businessman,

1521
00:34:57 --> 00:35:00
but I&#39;ve got more of a heart than
those corrupt officials.

1522
00:35:00 --> 00:35:02
If I were you I&#39;d take your share

1523
00:35:02 --> 00:35:04
and use it to buy land.

1524
00:35:04 --> 00:35:06
You can get half an acre for
ten pints of millet these days.

1525
00:35:06 --> 00:35:07
You can sell it after the famine.

1526
00:35:07 --> 00:35:08
I&#39;ve got no head for business.

1527
00:35:08 --> 00:35:09
You take care of it.

1528
00:35:09 --> 00:35:10
Quiet!

1529
00:35:10 --> 00:35:11
Quiet!

1530
00:35:11 --> 00:35:13
Listen to our boss on the truck.

1531
00:35:13 --> 00:35:14
Everyone listen up!

1532
00:35:14 --> 00:35:16
I&#39;m the manager of a bedding factory in Luoyang.

1533
00:35:16 --> 00:35:20
I&#39;m looking for workers. Young ones. Girls.

1534
00:35:20 --> 00:35:22
If I pick you, I&#39;ll give you food and shelter,

1535
00:35:22 --> 00:35:24
and I&#39;ll give your family five pints of millet.

1536
00:35:24 --> 00:35:26
Line up here if you&#39;re interested.

1537
00:35:26 --> 00:35:27
You&#39;ll all get your turn.

1538
00:35:27 --> 00:35:32
As the judge for the 1st War Area Circuit Court,

1539
00:35:32 --> 00:35:33
I never thought I&#39;d be selling people.

1540
00:35:33 --> 00:35:35
Don&#39;t say that.

1541
00:35:35 --> 00:35:38
You&#39;re answering the government&#39;s
call to save the refugees.

1542
00:35:38 --> 00:35:40
If we want to help them survive,

1543
00:35:40 --> 00:35:41
we should pick as many as we can.

1544
00:35:41 --> 00:35:42
Give them a better life.

1545
00:35:42 --> 00:35:43
Dad?

1546
00:35:43 --> 00:35:43
What?

1547
00:35:43 --> 00:35:44
Sell me.

1548
00:35:44 --> 00:35:45
What are you talking about?

1549
00:35:45 --> 00:35:46
If we have to die, we&#39;ll die together.

1550
00:35:46 --> 00:35:47
The Fan family doesn&#39;t sell people.

1551
00:35:47 --> 00:35:48
We buy them.

1552
00:35:48 --> 00:35:48
Dad,

1553
00:35:48 --> 00:35:50
I can&#39;t take it anymore.

1554
00:35:50 --> 00:35:52
We don&#39;t even have any firewood left to eat.

1555
00:35:52 --> 00:35:54
Let me live.

1556
00:35:54 --> 00:35:54
Liubao,

1557
00:35:54 --> 00:35:54
Let&#39;s go.

1558
00:35:54 --> 00:35:56
Don&#39;t push!

1559
00:35:56 --> 00:35:57
Go.

1560
00:35:57 --> 00:35:58
Go back.

1561
00:35:58 --> 00:35:58
What are you doing?

1562
00:35:58 --> 00:35:58
Get away!

1563
00:35:58 --> 00:35:58
Don&#39;t let me see you again.

1564
00:35:58 --> 00:35:58
Go!

1565
00:35:58 --> 00:35:58
Mom.

1566
00:35:58 --> 00:35:59
What&#39;s this?

1567
00:35:59 --> 00:36:01
Buy a big one and you get two small ones.

1568
00:36:01 --> 00:36:02
It&#39;s a bargain, mister.

1569
00:36:02 --> 00:36:03
A bargain?

1570
00:36:03 --> 00:36:05
I&#39;m buying one mouth to feed, not three.

1571
00:36:05 --> 00:36:06
You think I&#39;m stupid?

1572
00:36:06 --> 00:36:08
Get out of my sight!

1573
00:36:08 --> 00:36:09
I&#39;ve gone to school.

1574
00:36:09 --> 00:36:09
I can read.

1575
00:36:09 --> 00:36:11
She&#39;s the daughter of a landlord.

1576
00:36:11 --> 00:36:11
Good.

1577
00:36:11 --> 00:36:12
Go ahead.

1578
00:36:12 --> 00:36:14
What would my ancestors say?

1579
00:36:14 --> 00:36:17
It&#39;s New Year&#39;s Eve, Dad.

1580
00:36:17 --> 00:36:18
Ineverthought

1581
00:36:18 --> 00:36:21
I&#39;d be selling my daughter on New Year&#39;s Eve.

1582
00:36:21 --> 00:36:21
Dad...

1583
00:36:21 --> 00:36:22
Forget about me.

1584
00:36:22 --> 00:36:24
Just pretend you strangled me to death

1585
00:36:24 --> 00:36:25
when I was born.

1586
00:36:25 --> 00:36:29
You said she&#39;d be with me.

1587
00:36:29 --> 00:36:31
Of course I wanted you to be together,

1588
00:36:31 --> 00:36:32
but she&#39;d starve if she stayed.

1589
00:36:32 --> 00:36:33
I want to kill someone!

1590
00:36:33 --> 00:36:34
Shuanzhu,

1591
00:36:34 --> 00:36:35
I&#39;ll marry you.

1592
00:36:35 --> 00:36:37
So you can have a wife before you die.

1593
00:36:37 --> 00:36:39
We got a few new girls today.

1594
00:36:39 --> 00:36:40
I saved the best one

1595
00:36:40 --> 00:36:41
for you.

1596
00:36:41 --> 00:36:42
You think I don&#39;t know?

1597
00:36:42 --> 00:36:43
They are all refugees.

1598
00:36:43 --> 00:36:44
With the famine, how can we do this?

1599
00:36:44 --> 00:36:45
It&#39;s too much!

1600
00:36:45 --> 00:36:46
It&#39;s our way of helping the refugees

1601
00:36:46 --> 00:36:47
with some relief funds.

1602
00:36:47 --> 00:36:47
Right?

1603
00:36:47 --> 00:36:48
Of course.

1604
00:36:48 --> 00:36:49
I chose a student for you.

1605
00:36:49 --> 00:36:50
Let&#39;s go.

1606
00:36:50 --> 00:36:51
Did you wash yourself?

1607
00:36:51 --> 00:36:52
How old are you?

1608
00:36:52 --> 00:36:53
Seventeen.

1609
00:36:53 --> 00:36:54
Seventeen.

1610
00:36:54 --> 00:36:55
A good age.

1611
00:36:55 --> 00:36:56
Put down the basin

1612
00:36:56 --> 00:36:57
and give me a massage.

1613
00:36:57 --> 00:37:00
My dad washes his feet before he goes to bed.

1614
00:37:00 --> 00:37:01
All right...

1615
00:37:01 --> 00:37:03
wash my feet first, then.

1616
00:37:03 --> 00:37:03
All right...

1617
00:37:03 --> 00:37:03
Enough bowing.

1618
00:37:03 --> 00:37:04
Put down the basin.

1619
00:37:04 --> 00:37:04
What?

1620
00:37:04 --> 00:37:05
Don&#39;t want to serve me?

1621
00:37:05 --> 00:37:06
No,

1622
00:37:06 --> 00:37:06
mister,

1623
00:37:06 --> 00:37:07
I want to.

1624
00:37:07 --> 00:37:09
It&#39;s just that I ate too much

1625
00:37:09 --> 00:37:11
and I can&#39;t bend over.

1626
00:37:11 --> 00:37:13
It&#39;s good you two are together...

1627
00:37:13 --> 00:37:14
you can take care of each other.

1628
00:37:14 --> 00:37:15
Your parents are gone,

1629
00:37:15 --> 00:37:16
so we might as well celebrate

1630
00:37:16 --> 00:37:17
during the New Year&#39;s fireworks.

1631
00:37:17 --> 00:37:18
Bow before Heaven and Earth.

1632
00:37:18 --> 00:37:19
And then to each other.

1633
00:37:19 --> 00:37:21
Do you know why I married you?

1634
00:37:21 --> 00:37:22
Didn&#39;t Master Fan say why?

1635
00:37:22 --> 00:37:23
So we can take care of each other.

1636
00:37:23 --> 00:37:24
If you have a wife,

1637
00:37:24 --> 00:37:26
then tomorrow you can sell your wife.

1638
00:37:26 --> 00:37:28
I&#39;ve only had a wife for one day.

1639
00:37:28 --> 00:37:29
I can&#39;t sell her.

1640
00:37:29 --> 00:37:30
Sell me.

1641
00:37:30 --> 00:37:32
You can get a few pints of grain.

1642
00:37:32 --> 00:37:32
I&#39;ll live,

1643
00:37:32 --> 00:37:33
and you will, too.

1644
00:37:33 --> 00:37:35
Nobody would buy me with the kids.

1645
00:37:35 --> 00:37:37
Now they have a father

1646
00:37:37 --> 00:37:38
and I won&#39;t have to worry.

1647
00:37:38 --> 00:37:38
Mommy.

1648
00:37:38 --> 00:37:38
Mommy?

1649
00:37:38 --> 00:37:39
Three pints.

1650
00:37:39 --> 00:37:40
You must be joking.

1651
00:37:40 --> 00:37:42
Yesterday someone offered five and I didn&#39;t sell.

1652
00:37:42 --> 00:37:43
Who is she?

1653
00:37:43 --> 00:37:44
It&#39;s embarrassing,

1654
00:37:44 --> 00:37:45
but she&#39;s my daughter.

1655
00:37:45 --> 00:37:48
If your daughter was 16,
then I could give you five quarts.

1656
00:37:48 --> 00:37:50
Don&#39;t you see how old she is?

1657
00:37:50 --> 00:37:51
Never mind, then.

1658
00:37:51 --> 00:37:52
If you buy me,

1659
00:37:52 --> 00:37:53
where will you send me to?

1660
00:37:53 --> 00:37:54
It&#39;s not like that.

1661
00:37:54 --> 00:37:55
I don&#39;t sell people,

1662
00:37:55 --> 00:37:56
I sell cattle.

1663
00:37:56 --> 00:37:58
I&#39;m just trying to help.

1664
00:37:58 --> 00:37:59
Well...

1665
00:37:59 --> 00:38:00
If I buy you,

1666
00:38:00 --> 00:38:00
If you are nice to me,

1667
00:38:00 --> 00:38:01
I won&#39;t sell you.

1668
00:38:01 --> 00:38:02
I&#39;ll keep you as my wife.

1669
00:38:02 --> 00:38:03
How does that sound?

1670
00:38:03 --> 00:38:04
Four quarts

1671
00:38:04 --> 00:38:05
and I&#39;ll go with you!

1672
00:38:05 --> 00:38:06
Remember,

1673
00:38:06 --> 00:38:08
your hometown is Yanjin.

1674
00:38:08 --> 00:38:09
Don&#39;t cry.

1675
00:38:09 --> 00:38:10
Lingd-Eng

1676
00:38:10 --> 00:38:11
See this?

1677
00:38:11 --> 00:38:13
This is to remember your daddy by.

1678
00:38:13 --> 00:38:14
Don&#39;t lose it.

1679
00:38:14 --> 00:38:15
Mommy, don&#39;t go.

1680
00:38:15 --> 00:38:16
Can you stop? I have something to say.

1681
00:38:16 --> 00:38:16
What?

1682
00:38:16 --> 00:38:17
Shuanzhu,

1683
00:38:17 --> 00:38:18
Come here.

1684
00:38:18 --> 00:38:19
After I&#39;m gone,

1685
00:38:19 --> 00:38:21
don&#39;t sell the children, no matter what.

1686
00:38:21 --> 00:38:22
Okay?

1687
00:38:22 --> 00:38:24
My pants are less tattered.

1688
00:38:24 --> 00:38:25
Let&#39;s switch.

1689
00:38:25 --> 00:38:28
I&#39;m honored that the Generalissimo has found time

1690
00:38:28 --> 00:38:30
to visit my humble abode

1691
00:38:30 --> 00:38:31
on his trip to Xi&#39;an.

1692
00:38:31 --> 00:38:32
I didn&#39;t come here to see you.

1693
00:38:32 --> 00:38:33
I came to see your mother.

1694
00:38:33 --> 00:38:34
Please.

1695
00:38:34 --> 00:38:35
Madame,

1696
00:38:35 --> 00:38:37
Last year when I saw you,

1697
00:38:37 --> 00:38:38
you were having your eyes treated.

1698
00:38:38 --> 00:38:39
Are they better?

1699
00:38:39 --> 00:38:42
My sight is blurry,

1700
00:38:42 --> 00:38:43
but I can still weave.

1701
00:38:43 --> 00:38:46
This is where I&#39;m having problems now.

1702
00:38:46 --> 00:38:48
They don&#39;t even want to talk to me anymore.

1703
00:38:48 --> 00:38:50
When my mother was alive,

1704
00:38:50 --> 00:38:51
her eyesight wasn&#39;t so good either.

1705
00:38:51 --> 00:38:52
She would weave with her eyes closed.

1706
00:38:52 --> 00:38:53
How&#39;s your appetite?

1707
00:38:53 --> 00:38:54
I can eat two steamed buns each meal.

1708
00:38:54 --> 00:38:55
I won&#39;t die in the next few days.

1709
00:38:55 --> 00:38:56
They still have to put up with me for a while.

1710
00:38:56 --> 00:38:57
Generalissimo,

1711
00:38:57 --> 00:38:58
I&#39;m an old woman.

1712
00:38:58 --> 00:38:59
There is something that I want to ask you.

1713
00:38:59 --> 00:39:00
I don&#39;t know if I should.

1714
00:39:00 --> 00:39:01
Please.

1715
00:39:01 --> 00:39:02
I&#39;m from Henan.

1716
00:39:02 --> 00:39:04
I heard about the famine there.

1717
00:39:04 --> 00:39:05
Lots of people died.

1718
00:39:05 --> 00:39:08
The government is sending aid.

1719
00:39:08 --> 00:39:10
Trains are transporting grain to the disaster area

1720
00:39:10 --> 00:39:12
and transporting refugees to Shaanxi.

1721
00:39:12 --> 00:39:13
Amitabha.

1722
00:39:13 --> 00:39:16
My fellow people can be saved.

1723
00:39:16 --> 00:39:17
Old friend,

1724
00:39:17 --> 00:39:19
This time I&#39;ve come, because I&#39;d like to
borrow something from you.

1725
00:39:19 --> 00:39:20
You are not here to take my head away, are you?

1726
00:39:20 --> 00:39:21
Here is the thing.

1727
00:39:21 --> 00:39:23
War is going to break out again in Henan.

1728
00:39:23 --> 00:39:25
Generalissimo Chiang would like to
borrow grain from you.

1729
00:39:25 --> 00:39:26
The battle in northern Henan

1730
00:39:26 --> 00:39:27
is very special.

1731
00:39:27 --> 00:39:28
The Americans, British, and Soviets

1732
00:39:28 --> 00:39:30
are meeting secretly

1733
00:39:30 --> 00:39:33
to discuss arrangements for after the war.

1734
00:39:33 --> 00:39:34
I understand.

1735
00:39:34 --> 00:39:35
At this key moment,

1736
00:39:35 --> 00:39:36
we need to show the world what we can do.

1737
00:39:36 --> 00:39:38
Since last week,

1738
00:39:38 --> 00:39:40
the Generalissimo has cut back on meals

1739
00:39:40 --> 00:39:41
in support of the war effort.

1740
00:39:41 --> 00:39:44
I may not agree with the Generalissimo&#39;s politics,

1741
00:39:44 --> 00:39:46
but at this time of national crisis,

1742
00:39:46 --> 00:39:48
I will donate half of my assets

1743
00:39:48 --> 00:39:49
to support the war in Henan.

1744
00:39:49 --> 00:39:50
Old friend,

1745
00:39:50 --> 00:39:53
You set a good example for industrialists
and business leaders alike.

1746
00:39:53 --> 00:39:56
This will make Lisheng&#39;s job easier too.

1747
00:39:56 --> 00:39:57
I&#39;m just worried that whatever I give

1748
00:39:57 --> 00:39:59
will be siphoned away by corrupt officials.

1749
00:39:59 --> 00:40:00
You can trust us.

1750
00:40:00 --> 00:40:02
I have already ordered investigations

1751
00:40:02 --> 00:40:03
in the disaster areas.

1752
00:40:03 --> 00:40:03
This time,

1753
00:40:03 --> 00:40:04
I am going to imprison some

1754
00:40:04 --> 00:40:05
and execute the rest.

1755
00:40:05 --> 00:40:06
Dong Jiayao.

1756
00:40:06 --> 00:40:06
Male.

1757
00:40:06 --> 00:40:07
Forty years old.

1758
00:40:07 --> 00:40:11
Former colonel of
the 1st War Area&#39;s supply office.

1759
00:40:11 --> 00:40:12
During his term,

1760
00:40:12 --> 00:40:14
he neglected the war

1761
00:40:14 --> 00:40:16
and efforts to provide relief aid.

1762
00:40:16 --> 00:40:17
Through hoarding

1763
00:40:17 --> 00:40:18
and embezzlement,

1764
00:40:18 --> 00:40:19
he amassed great personal wealth.

1765
00:40:19 --> 00:40:20
To uphold the people&#39;s justice,

1766
00:40:20 --> 00:40:22
he is sentenced to death,

1767
00:40:22 --> 00:40:23
effective immediately.

1768
00:40:23 --> 00:40:23
Director Lin,

1769
00:40:23 --> 00:40:24
Shall we start?

1770
00:40:24 --> 00:40:26
The citizens already saw them,

1771
00:40:26 --> 00:40:28
but I&#39;d like the refugees to see them too.

1772
00:40:28 --> 00:40:30
The audience is too small.

1773
00:40:30 --> 00:40:32
Is this what you call
organization here in Luoyang?

1774
00:40:32 --> 00:40:33
The refugees are busy boarding the train.

1775
00:40:33 --> 00:40:34
It&#39;s hard to get them together.

1776
00:40:34 --> 00:40:36
One or two representatives will suffice.

1777
00:40:36 --> 00:40:38
It&#39;s not about the size of the audience,

1778
00:40:38 --> 00:40:39
it&#39;s about corruption being strictly punished.

1779
00:40:39 --> 00:40:40
You don&#39;t think the public cares about that?

1780
00:40:40 --> 00:40:41
Yes, sir!

1781
00:40:41 --> 00:40:42
Execute!

1782
00:40:42 --> 00:40:42
Ready?

1783
00:40:42 --> 00:40:42
Fire.

1784
00:40:42 --> 00:40:43
It&#39;s OK.

1785
00:40:43 --> 00:40:44
Master Fan,

1786
00:40:44 --> 00:40:45
they&#39;re executing people.

1787
00:40:45 --> 00:40:46
Maybe we&#39;ve been rescued

1788
00:40:46 --> 00:40:47
and we don&#39;t have to go to Shaanxi.

1789
00:40:47 --> 00:40:49
I don&#39;t believe anything they say.

1790
00:40:49 --> 00:40:50
There are soldiers on the road,

1791
00:40:50 --> 00:40:52
and that means Henan is still at war.

1792
00:40:52 --> 00:40:52
Shuanzhu,

1793
00:40:52 --> 00:40:55
we&#39;ve had nothing but bad luck at every turn.

1794
00:40:55 --> 00:40:56
We must go to Shaanxi.

1795
00:40:56 --> 00:40:57
Let&#39;s go.

1796
00:40:57 --> 00:40:59
Once we get back on our feet in Shaanxi,

1797
00:40:59 --> 00:41:00
things will get better.

1798
00:41:00 --> 00:41:01
Let&#39;s go.

1799
00:41:01 --> 00:41:02
I know

1800
00:41:02 --> 00:41:05
how to go from rags to riches

1801
00:41:05 --> 00:41:06
in less than ten years.

1802
00:41:06 --> 00:41:07
I&#39;ll be a landlord again,

1803
00:41:07 --> 00:41:09
and we can come back

1804
00:41:09 --> 00:41:11
for Xingxing and Huazhi.

1805
00:41:11 --> 00:41:11
Master Fan,

1806
00:41:11 --> 00:41:13
I&#39;ll be your hired hand again.

1807
00:41:13 --> 00:41:15
Fast-acting hunger relief pills.

1808
00:41:15 --> 00:41:17
Eat one, and you won&#39;t be hungry for a day.

1809
00:41:17 --> 00:41:19
These are longer-lasting.

1810
00:41:19 --> 00:41:21
Eat one and you&#39;re not hungry for seven days.

1811
00:41:21 --> 00:41:23
Mr. Han spent long days

1812
00:41:23 --> 00:41:26
researching these two pills to cure hunger.

1813
00:41:26 --> 00:41:30
We hope the government will fund
production and promotion.

1814
00:41:30 --> 00:41:32
These have the potential to rescue every one

1815
00:41:32 --> 00:41:34
of the people in Henan now at death&#39;s door.

1816
00:41:34 --> 00:41:37
What are these things made of?

1817
00:41:37 --> 00:41:37
Family secret.

1818
00:41:37 --> 00:41:39
They&#39;re made according to a secret family recipe.

1819
00:41:39 --> 00:41:42
If people&#39;s family secrets worked,

1820
00:41:42 --> 00:41:44
then no Chinese person would have starved

1821
00:41:44 --> 00:41:46
in the past two millennia.

1822
00:41:46 --> 00:41:48
The war is upon us.

1823
00:41:48 --> 00:41:49
Let&#39;s leave your hunger pills

1824
00:41:49 --> 00:41:50
for another day.

1825
00:41:50 --> 00:41:50
Governor Li,

1826
00:41:50 --> 00:41:50
The main reason I came today

1827
00:41:50 --> 00:41:52
wasn&#39;t to talk about the pills.

1828
00:41:52 --> 00:41:53
Troops have gathered in northern Henan.

1829
00:41:53 --> 00:41:56
Nine out of ten people are
on the verge of starvation.

1830
00:41:56 --> 00:41:58
I honestly can&#39;t go on in this position.

1831
00:41:58 --> 00:41:58
Ihoped

1832
00:41:58 --> 00:42:00
you might consider transferring me
to southern Henan.

1833
00:42:00 --> 00:42:01
My friend,

1834
00:42:01 --> 00:42:02
war is imminent.

1835
00:42:02 --> 00:42:04
The provincial government is about to move away.

1836
00:42:04 --> 00:42:08
The only way the county and
provincial governments will survive

1837
00:42:08 --> 00:42:12
is if we are victorious in this war.

1838
00:42:12 --> 00:42:13
Gentlemen,

1839
00:42:13 --> 00:42:13
please.

1840
00:42:13 --> 00:42:16
This is a message from the Jiangsu-Gansu Railway.

1841
00:42:16 --> 00:42:18
To support the war effort,

1842
00:42:18 --> 00:42:20
safeguard railway administration,

1843
00:42:20 --> 00:42:21
and prevent treason and espionage,

1844
00:42:21 --> 00:42:23
all refugees must register at the train station

1845
00:42:23 --> 00:42:25
You can only board the train for free

1846
00:42:25 --> 00:42:27
by showing your identification

1847
00:42:27 --> 00:42:31
Violators who willfully disobey
this regulation and board the train

1848
00:42:31 --> 00:42:33
will be prosecuted under wartime

1849
00:42:33 --> 00:42:36
Regulation Five, Article Eight.

1850
00:42:36 --> 00:42:36
Listen up.

1851
00:42:36 --> 00:42:39
There&#39;s not much room.

1852
00:42:39 --> 00:42:43
You can&#39;t bring anything onto the train.

1853
00:42:43 --> 00:42:45
Nothing.

1854
00:42:45 --> 00:42:48
We sold people for this food.

1855
00:42:48 --> 00:42:50
We can&#39;t just throw it away.

1856
00:42:50 --> 00:42:52
Then how will we get to Shaanxi?

1857
00:42:52 --> 00:42:52
Hold on to me, Liubao.

1858
00:42:52 --> 00:42:53
We&#39;ll think of something.

1859
00:42:53 --> 00:42:54
Let&#39;s go.

1860
00:42:54 --> 00:42:54
Turn back.

1861
00:42:54 --> 00:42:56
Why hasn&#39;t the train left yet?

1862
00:42:56 --> 00:42:58
Is the air raid alert still going?

1863
00:42:58 --> 00:42:58
Hurry. Hurry!

1864
00:42:58 --> 00:42:59
I need help here.

1865
00:42:59 --> 00:43:00
What?

1866
00:43:00 --> 00:43:02
I lost my pinwheel!

1867
00:43:02 --> 00:43:03
Shuanzhu!

1868
00:43:03 --> 00:43:03
Shuanzhu!

1869
00:43:03 --> 00:43:03
Shuanzhu!

1870
00:43:03 --> 00:43:03
Landlord!

1871
00:43:03 --> 00:43:04
Shuanzhu!

1872
00:43:04 --> 00:43:06
Go!

1873
00:43:06 --> 00:43:07
Hold tight.

1874
00:43:07 --> 00:43:08
Give me the tablets!

1875
00:43:08 --> 00:43:09
Hold tight, Lingdang!

1876
00:43:09 --> 00:43:10
Hold tight.

1877
00:43:10 --> 00:43:12
Climb up.

1878
00:43:12 --> 00:43:12
Liubao?

1879
00:43:12 --> 00:43:13
Liubao?

1880
00:43:13 --> 00:43:14
Lingdang?

1881
00:43:14 --> 00:43:15
Lingdang?

1882
00:43:15 --> 00:43:16
Liubao!

1883
00:43:16 --> 00:43:17
Lingdang!

1884
00:43:17 --> 00:43:18
Liubao!

1885
00:43:18 --> 00:43:18
Lingdang!

1886
00:43:18 --> 00:43:19
Lingdang!

1887
00:43:19 --> 00:43:20
Liubao!

1888
00:43:20 --> 00:43:21
Lingdang!

1889
00:43:21 --> 00:43:22
Liubao!

1890
00:43:22 --> 00:43:23
Lingdang!

1891
00:43:23 --> 00:43:24
Liubao!

1892
00:43:24 --> 00:43:25
Shuanzhu?

1893
00:43:25 --> 00:43:26
What&#39;s wrong?

1894
00:43:26 --> 00:43:26
Master Fan!

1895
00:43:26 --> 00:43:26
Master Fan!

1896
00:43:26 --> 00:43:28
Did you see Liubao and Lingdang?

1897
00:43:28 --> 00:43:31
Aren&#39;t they with you?

1898
00:43:31 --> 00:43:32
Damn it!

1899
00:43:32 --> 00:43:33
They must have gone to sleep

1900
00:43:33 --> 00:43:34
and fallen off!

1901
00:43:34 --> 00:43:35
I have to go find them!

1902
00:43:35 --> 00:43:36
Don&#39;t jump... you&#39;ll be hurt!

1903
00:43:36 --> 00:43:37
Shuanzhu.

1904
00:43:37 --> 00:43:38
Shuanzhu.

1905
00:43:38 --> 00:43:39
My millet.

1906
00:43:39 --> 00:43:40
My millet!

1907
00:43:40 --> 00:43:44
I sold my wife for that millet!

1908
00:43:44 --> 00:43:45
Train!

1909
00:43:45 --> 00:43:48
Fuck you!

1910
00:43:48 --> 00:43:49
Shaanxi at last...

1911
00:43:49 --> 00:43:51
even if it&#39;s just the two of us.

1912
00:43:51 --> 00:43:51
What&#39;s wrong?

1913
00:43:51 --> 00:43:52
Turn back.

1914
00:43:52 --> 00:43:52
Sir...

1915
00:43:52 --> 00:43:55
I have orders to take the refugees to Shaanxi.

1916
00:43:55 --> 00:43:56
I have orders too!

1917
00:43:56 --> 00:43:56
There are already millions

1918
00:43:56 --> 00:43:57
of refugees in Shaanxi.

1919
00:43:57 --> 00:43:58
If we let more in,

1920
00:43:58 --> 00:43:59
Shaanxi will be a disaster zone too.

1921
00:43:59 --> 00:43:59
Turn around!

1922
00:43:59 --> 00:43:59
I can&#39;t.

1923
00:43:59 --> 00:44:01
If I go back, I&#39;ll be executed.

1924
00:44:01 --> 00:44:03
I&#39;ll kill you now if you don&#39;t!

1925
00:44:03 --> 00:44:04
Turn back!

1926
00:44:04 --> 00:44:04
Faster!

1927
00:44:04 --> 00:44:04
Fire!

1928
00:44:04 --> 00:44:05
Aim above the train!

1929
00:44:05 --> 00:44:07
The rails are blocked! Everyone get off! Run!

1930
00:44:07 --> 00:44:08
Liucheng?

1931
00:44:08 --> 00:44:09
Liucheng?

1932
00:44:09 --> 00:44:12
After all we went through to get here

1933
00:44:12 --> 00:44:13
lneverthought

1934
00:44:13 --> 00:44:16
I&#39;d smother you to death.

1935
00:44:16 --> 00:44:18
There&#39;s nobody else left now.

1936
00:44:18 --> 00:44:20
God...

1937
00:44:20 --> 00:44:22
Why me?

1938
00:44:22 --> 00:44:23
Takahashi - san

1939
00:44:23 --> 00:44:25
how many troops do you have?

1940
00:44:25 --> 00:44:32
Three divisions were joined by five more,
so I have about 60,000 men.

1941
00:44:32 --> 00:44:35
How many Chinese troops have assembled in Henan?

1942
00:44:35 --> 00:44:40
Jiang Dingwen has eight divisions.

1943
00:44:40 --> 00:44:42
400,000 men in all.

1944
00:44:42 --> 00:44:45
I&#39;ll raise new forces for you.

1945
00:44:45 --> 00:44:46
Grain.

1946
00:44:46 --> 00:44:47
Grain?

1947
00:44:47 --> 00:44:50
Henan is suffering from a drought.
People are dying every day.

1948
00:44:50 --> 00:44:53
The Chinese government is helpless.

1949
00:44:53 --> 00:44:58
Your men are advancing along the same path

1950
00:44:58 --> 00:45:02
as the Chinese who are fleeing the famine.

1951
00:45:02 --> 00:45:05
How do you think they&#39;ll feel?

1952
00:45:05 --> 00:45:06
Because of your assistance,

1953
00:45:06 --> 00:45:08
they will either help on the frontline

1954
00:45:08 --> 00:45:11
or help to destroy the war
supplies of the Chinese army.

1955
00:45:11 --> 00:45:15
But they are Chinese.

1956
00:45:15 --> 00:45:18
No. More than anything, they&#39;re human.

1957
00:45:18 --> 00:45:21
In April that year,

1958
00:45:21 --> 00:45:23
the Japanese initiated the battle of Henan.

1959
00:45:23 --> 00:45:26
They encountered the stubborn resistance of
the Nationalist Army.

1960
00:45:26 --> 00:45:30
The Japanese army, with 60,000 soldiers,

1961
00:45:30 --> 00:45:33
consecutively captured twenty-eight cities,

1962
00:45:33 --> 00:45:36
including Zhengzhou, Xuchang, Luohe,

1963
00:45:36 --> 00:45:38
Zhumadian, Nanyang, Gongyi, and Luoyang

1964
00:45:38 --> 00:45:40
The Kuomintang forces
sustained 300,000 casualties.

1965
00:45:40 --> 00:45:44
Hurry. Hurry!

1966
00:45:44 --> 00:45:47
Hurry. Hurry!

1967
00:45:47 --> 00:45:48
Faster!

1968
00:45:48 --> 00:45:49
Go!

1969
00:45:49 --> 00:45:50
Move!

1970
00:45:50 --> 00:45:52
Move!

1971
00:45:52 --> 00:45:55
Sir, reporting. We captured a Chinese soldier.

1972
00:45:55 --> 00:45:56
That isn&#39;t mine.

1973
00:45:56 --> 00:45:56
Ifoundit

1974
00:45:56 --> 00:45:56
lfoundit

1975
00:45:56 --> 00:45:57
What?

1976
00:45:57 --> 00:45:58
I picked it up on the road.

1977
00:45:58 --> 00:45:58
Not mine.

1978
00:45:58 --> 00:45:58
Shuanzhu?

1979
00:45:58 --> 00:45:58
Old Ma?

1980
00:45:58 --> 00:45:59
What are you doing here?

1981
00:45:59 --> 00:46:01
Staying alive.

1982
00:46:01 --> 00:46:01
Do you know each other?

1983
00:46:01 --> 00:46:04
Is he a soldier?

1984
00:46:04 --> 00:46:05
No, he&#39;s not a soldier.

1985
00:46:05 --> 00:46:06
He feeds livestock.

1986
00:46:06 --> 00:46:06
He&#39;s a good citizen!

1987
00:46:06 --> 00:46:09
He drives the cart.

1988
00:46:09 --> 00:46:09
Like this!

1989
00:46:09 --> 00:46:09
Cart.

1990
00:46:09 --> 00:46:10
Great.

1991
00:46:10 --> 00:46:12
He can stay and help with the horses.

1992
00:46:12 --> 00:46:15
He can stay

1993
00:46:15 --> 00:46:16
and help us with the horses.

1994
00:46:16 --> 00:46:19
You can stay.

1995
00:46:19 --> 00:46:20
We can stick together.

1996
00:46:20 --> 00:46:22
We are friends.

1997
00:46:22 --> 00:46:23
I have to find my kids.

1998
00:46:23 --> 00:46:24
You have to survive.

1999
00:46:24 --> 00:46:25
What a clever little thing.

2000
00:46:25 --> 00:46:25
Give it to him.

2001
00:46:25 --> 00:46:26
Not a chance.

2002
00:46:26 --> 00:46:27
What if I can&#39;t find the kids?

2003
00:46:27 --> 00:46:28
It&#39;s all I have to remember them.

2004
00:46:28 --> 00:46:28
Here...

2005
00:46:28 --> 00:46:30
Give me the pinwheel.

2006
00:46:30 --> 00:46:32
Let&#39;s trade.

2007
00:46:32 --> 00:46:34
Trade.

2008
00:46:34 --> 00:46:36
No!

2009
00:46:36 --> 00:46:38
Give it back to me.

2010
00:46:38 --> 00:46:40
My pinwheel.

2011
00:46:40 --> 00:46:42
Eat it.

2012
00:46:42 --> 00:46:43
Eat it, Shuanzhu,

2013
00:46:43 --> 00:46:43
so you can live.

2014
00:46:43 --> 00:46:44
Eat it.

2015
00:46:44 --> 00:46:45
Burn my daughter&#39;s pinwheel?

2016
00:46:45 --> 00:46:46
Fuck your mother!

2017
00:46:46 --> 00:46:46
Ma.

2018
00:46:46 --> 00:46:46
Ma.

2019
00:46:46 --> 00:46:46
Come here.

2020
00:46:46 --> 00:46:47
Eat this.

2021
00:46:47 --> 00:46:49
Eat this.

2022
00:46:49 --> 00:46:49
Taste good?

2023
00:46:49 --> 00:46:50
Spicy.

2024
00:46:50 --> 00:46:50
Peiji,

2025
00:46:50 --> 00:46:52
I knew I could trust you.

2026
00:46:52 --> 00:46:53
That&#39;s why I sent you to Henan.

2027
00:46:53 --> 00:46:54
It seems now

2028
00:46:54 --> 00:46:55
that I wasn&#39;t doing you a favor.

2029
00:46:55 --> 00:46:57
I let you down, Generalissimo.

2030
00:46:57 --> 00:47:00
Those treacherous Japanese.

2031
00:47:00 --> 00:47:01
Giving grain to starving people?

2032
00:47:01 --> 00:47:02
I never would have imagined it.

2033
00:47:02 --> 00:47:02
I&#39;ve heard

2034
00:47:02 --> 00:47:05
some of the refugees went over to the Japanese

2035
00:47:05 --> 00:47:06
after eating their food.

2036
00:47:06 --> 00:47:07
Is that true?

2037
00:47:07 --> 00:47:08
This must be a rumor.

2038
00:47:08 --> 00:47:09
Pure sedition!

2039
00:47:09 --> 00:47:10
The majority of the people

2040
00:47:10 --> 00:47:12
support the government.

2041
00:47:12 --> 00:47:13
The ones causing problems

2042
00:47:13 --> 00:47:14
are from Wang Jingwei&#39;s clique.

2043
00:47:14 --> 00:47:14
Peiji,

2044
00:47:14 --> 00:47:16
How many people died in Henan?

2045
00:47:16 --> 00:47:17
Our figures say...

2046
00:47:17 --> 00:47:19
1,062 people.

2047
00:47:19 --> 00:47:20
And the real number?

2048
00:47:20 --> 00:47:21
About...

2049
00:47:21 --> 00:47:22
...3 million people.

2050
00:47:22 --> 00:47:23
Minister Soong wants to see you urgently.

2051
00:47:23 --> 00:47:25
It&#39;s about the summit with the other leaders.

2052
00:47:25 --> 00:47:28
Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin
planned to meet in Cairo

2053
00:47:28 --> 00:47:29
to discuss the world order after the war.

2054
00:47:29 --> 00:47:31
But President Roosevelt just sent a telegram

2055
00:47:31 --> 00:47:33
saying Churchill and Stalin
don&#39;t want us to attend.

2056
00:47:33 --> 00:47:35
After all we sacrificed for this war.

2057
00:47:35 --> 00:47:36
Why can&#39;t we have a voice in

2058
00:47:36 --> 00:47:37
discussing post-war affairs?

2059
00:47:37 --> 00:47:39
But Minister Soong is still working on it.

2060
00:47:39 --> 00:47:40
What about the Japanese?

2061
00:47:40 --> 00:47:41
Approaching the Henan-Shaanxi border.

2062
00:47:41 --> 00:47:42
Tell He Yingqin

2063
00:47:42 --> 00:47:43
he must hold the Tongguan pass.

2064
00:47:43 --> 00:47:45
If the Japanese take Shaanxi

2065
00:47:45 --> 00:47:46
I won&#39;t go to Cairo

2066
00:47:46 --> 00:47:47
even if they ask me.

2067
00:47:47 --> 00:47:47
Mister!

2068
00:47:47 --> 00:47:48
Are you coming from Shaanxi?

2069
00:47:48 --> 00:47:49
Why are you walking back?

2070
00:47:49 --> 00:47:50
There&#39;s no hope there either?

2071
00:47:50 --> 00:47:51
There&#39;s hope in Shaanxi,

2072
00:47:51 --> 00:47:53
but not for me.

2073
00:47:53 --> 00:47:55
You&#39;ll die if you turn back.

2074
00:47:55 --> 00:47:57
I don&#39;t want to keep living.

2075
00:47:57 --> 00:47:59
I just want to die closer to home.

2076
00:47:59 --> 00:48:00
Mommy!

2077
00:48:00 --> 00:48:01
Mommy!

2078
00:48:01 --> 00:48:02
Mommy!

2079
00:48:02 --> 00:48:02
Sweetie...

2080
00:48:02 --> 00:48:03
She&#39;s already cold.

2081
00:48:03 --> 00:48:04
Don&#39;t cry, now.

2082
00:48:04 --> 00:48:06
Everyone in my family has died.

2083
00:48:06 --> 00:48:08
I don&#39;t know anyone anymore.

2084
00:48:08 --> 00:48:09
Sweetie.

2085
00:48:09 --> 00:48:11
You can call me Grandpa.

2086
00:48:11 --> 00:48:12
And we&#39;ll know each other then.

2087
00:48:12 --> 00:48:13
Grandpa.

2088
00:48:13 --> 00:48:13
Granddaughter,

2089
00:48:13 --> 00:48:13
Let&#39;s go.

2090
00:48:13 --> 00:48:14
Fifteen years later,

2091
00:48:14 --> 00:48:16
this little girl became my mother.

2092
00:48:16 --> 00:48:17
As long as I can remember,

2093
00:48:17 --> 00:48:18
she never shed a tear

2094
00:48:18 --> 00:48:19
or ate meat.

2095
00:48:19 --> 00:48:20
Seventy years later,

2096
00:48:20 --> 00:48:24
I interviewed her about the year 1942.

2097
00:48:24 --> 00:48:25
She stared at me blankly.

2098
00:48:25 --> 00:48:28
I left all that misery behind me long ago.

2099
00:48:28 --> 00:48:29
Why bring it up again now?

2100
00:48:29 --> 00:48:30
Why bring it up again now?

2101
00:48:30 --> 00:48:33
&quot;Sixteen years later, Liubao
found Huazhi in Luoyang.&quot;

2102
00:48:33 --> 00:48:37
&quot;Lingdang&#39;s whereabouts are still unknown.&quot;

2103
00:48:37 --> 00:48:41
&quot;Twenty years later, someone saw Xingxing at Baoji.&quot;

2104
00:48:41 --> 00:48:44
&quot;She sent money home,&quot;

2105
00:48:44 --> 00:48:49
&quot;but had no wish to return home
or see anyone she used to know.&quot;

2106
00:48:49 --> 00:48:52
&quot;After returning to the United States,&quot;

2107
00:48:52 --> 00:48:54
&quot;Theodore White lost his job in the
Red Scare of Joseph McCarthy.&quot;

2108
00:48:54 --> 00:48:56
&quot;He won the Pulitzer Prize in 1964,&quot;

2109
00:48:56 --> 00:48:58
&quot;and died in New York in 1986.&quot;

2110
00:48:58 --> 00:49:05
&quot;In 1949, Chiang Kai-shek lost
mainland China and retreated to Taiwan.&quot;

2111
00:49:05 --> 00:49:11
&quot;More than ten million people fled Henan
in the famine of 1942.&quot;

2112
00:49:11 --> 00:49:17
&quot;Three million starved to death.&quot;

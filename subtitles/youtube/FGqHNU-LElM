20
00:01:14 --> 00:01:16

21
00:01:16 --> 00:01:18

22
00:01:18 --> 00:01:21

23
00:01:21 --> 00:01:22

24
00:01:22 --> 00:01:25
yeah

25
00:01:25 --> 00:01:28
yeah

26
00:01:28 --> 00:01:31
and then

27
00:01:31 --> 00:01:53
but you seem to fit the bill young man
wasn&#39;t the kind of strong stranger eyes

28
00:01:53 --> 00:01:56
that I needed in the bullet and I put up
in the supermarket

29
00:01:56 --> 00:01:59
you&#39;re a little older brother one I had
tacked up downstairs

30
00:01:59 --> 00:02:02

I&#39;m here

32
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11

33
00:02:11 --> 00:02:15
I suppose you&#39;re wondering what goes
where is that it

34
00:02:15 --> 00:02:19
yes that&#39;s it well it really doesn&#39;t
matter

35
00:02:19 --> 00:02:25
it all has to be backed away 27 years of
clutter so it doesn&#39;t matter where it

36
00:02:25 --> 00:02:26
goes as long as it goes

37
00:02:26 --> 00:02:30
you could start filling the boxes and be
sure to get everything because i&#39;m

39
00:02:30 --> 00:02:39

kept putting it off

42
00:02:46 --> 00:02:51

faculty ladies nine friends but come and

43
00:02:51 --> 00:02:51

44
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54

I&#39;m sorry I can talking in riddles

49
00:03:10 --> 00:03:14

while you know the place where English

50
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
with teachers are supposed to go when
they die

51
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
hey I wonder if this works

52
00:03:19 --> 00:03:22
oh now that&#39;s bad luck

53
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
well just don&#39;t tell anybody no there&#39;s
no way to tell

54
00:03:26 --> 00:03:29

55
00:03:29 --> 00:03:36
no no just leave those and this little
book and I&#39;m gonna leave this here

56
00:03:36 --> 00:03:41
that&#39;s what about such an examination
but i rang up a big sense

57
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
how come you guys like a maniac like
that escaped we don&#39;t know he&#39;s a maniac

58
00:03:45 --> 00:03:47
mr. and if you&#39;ve got a complaint

59
00:03:47 --> 00:03:50

60
00:03:50 --> 00:03:53
guys like that really bug me

61
00:03:53 --> 00:03:57
you know with mental patients even if
they are present they don&#39;t like to use

62
00:03:57 --> 00:03:58
the word escape

63
00:03:58 --> 00:04:02
half the time these people just wander
off you know what this guy&#39;s you seem to

64
00:04:02 --> 00:04:03
know where he was going

65
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
I mean yesterday he comes directly to
this town and there&#39;s one of the

66
00:04:06 --> 00:04:13
hospital and then right to hear the
first stationary story hit a mystic

67
00:04:13 --> 00:04:16
are you sure he didn&#39;t say anything
about where he might have gone from here

68
00:04:16 --> 00:04:20
I told you all he said was he needed an
example and had to go someplace to take

69
00:04:20 --> 00:04:20
a test

70
00:04:20 --> 00:04:26
oh and thank you that I do remember you
know what a weirdo

71
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
that guy struck me as being very polite

72
00:04:29 --> 00:04:33
excuse me ma&#39;am are you saying something
nothing mantis

73
00:04:33 --> 00:04:37
I was just asking if that twine i bought
is all right if it&#39;s strong enough and

74
00:04:37 --> 00:04:38
if these things will get all the way to
England

75
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41

76
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44

77
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47

00:09:55 --> 00:09:58

but you&#39;re in need and your charm right

166
00:10:13 --> 00:10:15

change your last name

167
00:10:15 --> 00:10:19
you know you mean it&#39;s a lovely occasion
for me

168
00:10:19 --> 00:10:22

170
00:10:23 --> 00:10:26
the bases in this week&#39;s behind the desk

171
00:10:26 --> 00:10:29
it&#39;s just not the same

172
00:10:29 --> 00:10:30
well

173
00:10:30 --> 00:10:33
you give a lady a going away party and
and you give her some gifts and

174
00:10:33 --> 00:10:36
too much to drink and you&#39;ve got to hear
what&#39;s on her mind

175
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
I was on my mind

176
00:10:39 --> 00:10:41
that&#39;s not very decidedly more

177
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
isn&#39;t that something has happened to our
kids

178
00:10:44 --> 00:10:45
place it

179
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
they&#39;re not reaching out for us like
they used to

180
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
like you used to

181
00:10:50 --> 00:10:53
oh I know what these ferocious hostile
times I suppose that it is not the same

182
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
and it is nice

183
00:10:55 --> 00:10:58
has been going on for a heck of a long
time anybody probably noticed it&#39;s

184
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
almost 10 years

185
00:11:01 --> 00:11:04

186
00:11:04 --> 00:11:08

another 10 years

188
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
yeah

189
00:11:13 --> 00:11:17

190
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19

191
00:11:19 --> 00:11:22

00:11:28 --> 00:11:30

00:11:30 --> 00:11:33
quite a conversation stop

196
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35

197
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37

of a great decisions i decide i remember

and someone clearly with a problem so
vulnerable

watch this stuff for years now about it
really doesn&#39;t matter because in 10

263
00:15:15 --> 00:15:19
murders and attempted murder but it all
started on such a trivial thing they&#39;re

264
00:15:19 --> 00:15:22
writing about what president was elected
in what you can you believe it

265
00:15:22 --> 00:15:27
and then this this man of yours he got
mad at something and he almost killed it

266
00:15:27 --> 00:15:31
so the motions you know we put their
chips in the calendar

267
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
I asked me like you after the
examination under which way it was gonna

268
00:15:33 --> 00:15:34
go

269
00:15:34 --> 00:15:39
he was remanded to the state mental
facilities funding for the determination

270
00:15:39 --> 00:15:42
of the defendants mental capability to
stand trial

271
00:15:42 --> 00:15:48
and that&#39;s why I stayed until the day
before yesterday or whatever it was

272
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
that&#39;s what it was you didn&#39;t mention
any previous record

00:16:14 --> 00:16:19
I went out to the hospital day for a
wire not long enough to really do the

279
00:16:19 --> 00:16:24
job but i did find out that they had
diagnosed it as a parent like delusions

280
00:16:24 --> 00:16:28
of persecution usually accompanied by
potential violence concerning maybe some

281
00:16:28 --> 00:16:32
teacher you once said at least the
doctors thought they got that far

282
00:16:32 --> 00:16:36
a woman they figure middle-aged maybe I
could apply to that woman at the bar and

283
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
a couple of other women at the hospital
though they told me he was

284
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
dasol most of the time as a matter of
fact is but a lot of time in the library

285
00:16:42 --> 00:16:46
which by the way was the last place
anybody saw him before he took off

286
00:16:46 --> 00:16:50
I missed connections with the library of
the day out check her out in the morning

287

00:18:12 --> 00:18:15
it has to be today

311
00:18:15 --> 00:18:20
well for one thing he was allowed to do
what we are doing right now - to walk

312
00:18:20 --> 00:18:22
from the main building to the library

313
00:18:22 --> 00:18:27
you see we hate to tie them down we we
tried to let them do what they want is

314
00:18:27 --> 00:18:32
how they like to grow a beard to have an
identity in order to hide one

315
00:18:32 --> 00:18:37
he certainly was hiding something and I
certainly didn&#39;t find out what you can&#39;t

316
00:18:37 --> 00:18:41
win them all dark twisted brain talking
about winning

317
00:18:41 --> 00:18:47
as far as i can tell he never won
anything ever in his whole life

318
00:18:47 --> 00:18:51
not even the right to walk around loose
yes I usually kept an eye on him all

319
00:18:51 --> 00:18:51
right

320
00:18:51 --> 00:18:54
it&#39;s hard not to have a patient decides
to hate you

321
00:18:54 --> 00:18:58
you mean it got violent how he was
always very polite too polite

322
00:18:58 --> 00:18:59

the surface

324
00:19:02 --> 00:19:07

the records to see what sort of books he

325
00:19:07 --> 00:19:08

you really believe that it&#39;s still 10 or
15 years ago

418
00:24:37 --> 00:24:42
what is it aren&#39;t the girls giggling as
much when you tease them between classes

419
00:24:42 --> 00:24:48
up their mind I&#39;m sorry about that you
had nothing to do with my lead

420
00:24:48 --> 00:24:51
this is what I&#39;m running away from

421
00:24:51 --> 00:24:56
maybe it started with you but before you
or after you

422
00:24:56 --> 00:25:04
what really mattered to me was I wanted
to be a teacher and I failed at being a

423
00:25:04 --> 00:25:07
teacher for too long

424
00:25:07 --> 00:25:12

00:26:57 --> 00:27:02
that&#39;s right I needed a 70 still one
failed test

448
00:27:02 --> 00:27:05
they&#39;re usually ways of repeating the
course

449
00:27:05 --> 00:27:10
Raymond please give me upon getting too
personal

450
00:27:10 --> 00:27:13
I was just talking to you as if you were
one of my students

451
00:27:13 --> 00:27:21
you&#39;re not very old you could be in one
of my classes I was living with my aunt

452
00:27:21 --> 00:27:24
on my hand kind of an orphan

453
00:27:24 --> 00:27:28
I never got to know anything about my
mother I always kept asking why wouldn&#39;t

454
00:27:28 --> 00:27:29
you

455
00:27:29 --> 00:27:32
Oh your uncle is that your mother&#39;s
brother

456
00:27:32 --> 00:27:35
we moved a lot a lot of different states

457
00:27:35 --> 00:27:38
so I never went long anyone school I
mean

458
00:27:38 --> 00:27:41
well at least he made it possible for
you to go

459
00:27:41 --> 00:27:49
no that was on account of the welfare
money where my uncle went to talk to

460
00:27:49 --> 00:27:51
these welfare people and tell them that
he had a nephew living with him going to

461
00:27:51 --> 00:27:51
school

462
00:27:51 --> 00:28:00
that&#39;s how he got the welfare money so I
just packed my clothes and cleared out I

463
00:28:00 --> 00:28:03
didn&#39;t need all that hollering and get
all the time

464
00:28:03 --> 00:28:08
i&#39;m talking about the time when I didn&#39;t
get a 70 on that makeup test

465
00:28:08 --> 00:28:15
it wasn&#39;t just that one course I didn&#39;t
do so hot on the other principal he

466
00:28:15 --> 00:28:20
never liked me in the first place so i
just dropped out of school I kept my

467
00:28:20 --> 00:28:21
clothes were paired out

468
00:28:21 --> 00:28:30
I told you that already done yes yes you
did but my uncle would have kicked me

469
00:28:30 --> 00:28:36
out anyway on account of losing the
wealth term so I wrote him a couple of

470
00:28:36 --> 00:28:38
times

471
00:28:38 --> 00:28:41
greeting cards that i bought in the PX I
thought maybe my

472
00:28:41 --> 00:28:46
and would like a little bit better maybe
should be sorry because you always call

473
00:28:46 --> 00:28:46
me dumb

474
00:28:46 --> 00:28:50
you said the PX were you in the army

475
00:28:50 --> 00:28:56
there was a lot of rotten people are to
not only in the Army everywhere since

476
00:28:56 --> 00:29:03
I could have gone on to school but it
was just that one test just that one

477
00:29:03 --> 00:29:07
what is that you have a textbook

478
00:29:07 --> 00:29:10

480
00:29:19 --> 00:29:22

585
00:35:46 --> 00:35:49
ok

586
00:35:49 --> 00:35:50
there they are

587
00:35:50 --> 00:35:54
the last two questions those the ones i
didn&#39;t have to answer because you

588
00:35:54 --> 00:35:55
wouldn&#39;t give the instructions to me

589
00:35:55 --> 00:35:59
Raymond how did you remember these last
two questions when you didn&#39;t get around

590
00:35:59 --> 00:36:02
to the last time

591
00:36:02 --> 00:36:04
yeah

592
00:36:04 --> 00:36:07
I didn&#39;t remember them but I read the
book

593
00:36:07 --> 00:36:12
believe me i read that whole book and
the whole point is that this time I knew

594
00:36:12 --> 00:36:15
that they weren&#39;t optional and there
they are both both answers

595
00:36:15 --> 00:36:21
The Rime of the Ancient Mariner was a
poem written by Robert Browning it was

596
00:36:21 --> 00:36:24
told by a wedding guests who stopped to
talk to this wholesaler

597
00:36:24 --> 00:36:28
it&#39;s about a curse that was put on the
ship the wedding guests once sailed upon

598
00:36:28 --> 00:36:31
because somebody killed something

599
00:36:31 --> 00:36:35
Charles and Mary Lou lamb wrote many
plays that were put on by Shakespeare in

600
00:36:35 --> 00:36:40
his Theatre to answer Part B
Shakespeare&#39;s Romeo and Juliet was about

601
00:36:40 --> 00:36:42
a boy and a girl who loved each other

602
00:36:42 --> 00:36:45
the girl was very nice

603
00:36:45 --> 00:36:48
the two of them only wanted to be
together

604
00:36:48 --> 00:36:54
nobody understood that they were just
happy together so they ran away to some

605
00:36:54 --> 00:36:57
place that was like cave

606
00:36:57 --> 00:37:04
that&#39;s where they got killed ok now you
finish miss bloom quest i get 5 points

607
00:37:04 --> 00:37:07

one and then I can add that on what I

705
00:42:37 --> 00:42:39

00:42:39 --> 00:42:42
I don&#39;t need to sit down

707
00:42:42 --> 00:42:45
why should I listen to what you say this
blue inquest

708
00:42:45 --> 00:42:51
listen to me when I raised by hand then
ask you for instructions about what was

709
00:42:51 --> 00:42:55
optional of what wasn&#39;t and I had a
right to know you didn&#39;t listen to me

710
00:42:55 --> 00:42:58
you&#39;re right I didn&#39;t listen and you
deserve an explanation

711
00:42:58 --> 00:43:02
I had a friend rating a man and that
they just before the test

712
00:43:02 --> 00:43:06
I broke off with him when you raise your
hands are just looking out the door

713
00:43:06 --> 00:43:09
I was feeling very sorry for myself one

714
00:43:09 --> 00:43:15
I tell you again that the answers you
gave on the tests were wrong but I was

715
00:43:15 --> 00:43:15
wrong

716
00:43:15 --> 00:43:18
- because I didn&#39;t give you a chance to
understand what she was supposed to do

717
00:43:18 --> 00:43:20
the wrong

718
00:43:20 --> 00:43:26
my wrong was the worst one because I&#39;m
the teacher and you&#39;re the student and

719
00:43:26 --> 00:43:31
I&#39;m an adult and you&#39;re just avoid it
isn&#39;t too late you can still pass that

720
00:43:31 --> 00:43:31
test

721
00:43:31 --> 00:43:35
I&#39;ll teach you everything you have to
know right now please go to your state

722
00:43:35 --> 00:43:37

723
00:43:37 --> 00:43:40
yeah

724
00:43:40 --> 00:43:43
go to your seat

725
00:43:43 --> 00:43:46
hmm

726
00:43:46 --> 00:43:49
yeah

727
00:43:49 --> 00:43:51
yeah

728
00:43:51 --> 00:44:04
focus we saw like you see a plastic in
session now if you don&#39;t mind as a

729
00:44:04 --> 00:44:04
beginning

730
00:44:04 --> 00:44:10
let&#39;s start with the first question you
missed the rime of the ancient mariner

731
00:44:10 --> 00:44:24
was written by samuel taylor coleridge
the all else

732
00:44:24 --> 00:44:27
g

733
00:44:27 --> 00:44:32
now there are a couple of very
interesting things about mr. Coleridge

734
00:44:32 --> 00:44:40
he was a very famous man a very
important man and he was worth study and

735
00:44:40 --> 00:44:46
one of the things that i think is very
interesting is that Coleridge never

736
00:44:46 --> 00:44:49
finished school

737
00:44:49 --> 00:44:56
and another thing after a while he went
to live with a doctor because he was

738
00:44:56 --> 00:44:57
very troubled about things

739
00:44:57 --> 00:45:00
terribly mixed up am I going too fast

740
00:45:00 --> 00:45:03
no it&#39;s not you man

741
00:45:03 --> 00:45:10
to tell you the truth I&#39;m kinda slow
getting things i always get him sooner

742
00:45:10 --> 00:45:10
or later

743
00:45:10 --> 00:45:16
of course we only have to get a start
tonight and then I&#39;ll come and teach you

744
00:45:16 --> 00:45:19
with that i will that place where you
live

745
00:45:19 --> 00:45:22
well you might have to come a lot
because like I say

746
00:45:22 --> 00:45:25
I&#39;m a little slow I&#39;ll make you promise

747
00:45:25 --> 00:45:28
I&#39;ll come and teach you every day it&#39;s
necessary

748
00:45:28 --> 00:45:33
that is until sep tember and then I want
to be able to come on the weekends

749
00:45:33 --> 00:45:37
because you see I might change my mind
about retiring

750
00:45:37 --> 00:45:44
of course then i&#39;d have to be here
monday through friday teaching but to

751
00:45:44 --> 00:45:49
complete the thought on mr. Coleridge he
felt that people were really helpless in

752
00:45:49 --> 00:45:53
trying to fix their own lives but as I
always tell my students

753
00:45:53 --> 00:45:56
I don&#39;t agree with that idea

754
00:45:56 --> 00:45:59
yeah

755
00:45:59 --> 00:45:59
yeah

00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
THE DEVILS

3
00:00:04 --> 00:00:07
A painting is always
quite moral when it is tragic

4
00:00:07 --> 00:00:10
and it presents the horror
of the things it depicts.

5
00:00:10 --> 00:00:11
Barbey d&#39;Aurevilly.

6
00:00:11 --> 00:00:14
DELASSALLE BOARDING SCHOOL

7
00:00:14 --> 00:00:15
- Monsieur Delassalle.
- Yes.

8
00:00:15 --> 00:00:16
It&#39;s time I rang the bell.

9
00:00:16 --> 00:00:19
Go ahead. I&#39;ll manage
unloading the car myself.

10
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
- Your salads are rotten!
- You aren&#39;t paying for them.

11
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
Line up, please.
And be quiet.

12
00:00:24 --> 00:00:25
Oh, what a pain.

13
00:00:25 --> 00:00:26
Lovely kids!

14
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
Can&#39;t wait to flee this place.

15
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
Get out!

16
00:00:29 --> 00:00:32
Do your eyes hurt, dear colleague?

17
00:00:32 --> 00:00:34
I hurt myself getting up.

18
00:00:34 --> 00:00:35
You&#39;re up early.

19
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
Last night, I was doing
my rounds about 4:00 a.m.

20
00:00:37 --> 00:00:39
and I heard screams
coming out of your room.

21
00:00:39 --> 00:00:43
The chaste woman loves to
contemplate dawn, doesn&#39;t she?

22
00:00:43 --> 00:00:45
You spent too much time
with the Jesuits, M. Drain.

23
00:00:45 --> 00:00:48
Not everyone can be thrown out
of the school system.

24
00:00:48 --> 00:00:48
Jerk!

25
00:00:48 --> 00:00:50
- Tiene, Senora.
- Thank you, darling.

26
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
Oh, it&#39;s so nice!

27
00:00:52 --> 00:00:54
We all need a vacation.

28
00:00:54 --> 00:00:56
The body needs to eliminate its toxins.

29
00:00:56 --> 00:00:57
Tomorrow, mademoiselle,
I&#39;Il be all naked.

30
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
And you, how did you plan
this long weekend?

31
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01
I&#39;ll be home, in Niort.
Deux Sevres. Î—eard of it?

32
00:01:01 --> 00:01:03
Sous-Prefecture Maine,
Bressuire and Partenay.

33
00:01:03 --> 00:01:05
Getting some fresh air?

34
00:01:05 --> 00:01:07
It warms my heart, M. Drain.

35
00:01:07 --> 00:01:09
It still has the smell
of the country, mitierra.

36
00:01:09 --> 00:01:11
A graceful instrument,
but with all the rains,

37
00:01:11 --> 00:01:13
I prefer my old umbrella.

38
00:01:13 --> 00:01:15
In my country, instead of
your ugly black umbrella,

39
00:01:15 --> 00:01:17
you&#39;d wear a straw sombrero

40
00:01:17 --> 00:01:19
and spend your breaks in a hammock.

41
00:01:19 --> 00:01:20
Perdon, senora.

42
00:01:20 --> 00:01:23
It&#39;s such a frivolous thing
to give an educator.

43
00:01:23 --> 00:01:26
Does your teacher
really look that way, Jose?

44
00:01:26 --> 00:01:28
Yes, sir. And he used to come
to school on a horse.

45
00:01:28 --> 00:01:30
I&#39;ll never get used to it.

46
00:01:30 --> 00:01:32
I told him it was a horse
to please him.

47
00:01:32 --> 00:01:33
It was only a mule.

48
00:01:33 --> 00:01:34
Go play, Joselito.

49
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
- What&#39;s the matter?
- Look.

50
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
- Miguel.
- Of course, Michel.

51
00:01:38 --> 00:01:39
Who else?

52
00:01:39 --> 00:01:41
- Did you have another fight?
- He came back at 3:00 a. m.

53
00:01:41 --> 00:01:43
How have you stood him for so long?

54
00:01:43 --> 00:01:44
He wasn&#39;t always that way.

55
00:01:44 --> 00:01:46
At the beginning,
he really made me happy.

56
00:01:46 --> 00:01:47
It was for your money.

57
00:01:47 --> 00:01:48
Why are you trying to be nasty?

58
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
Don&#39;t you think life
is hard enough for us?

59
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
I may be a bit old-fashioned,

60
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
but this is absolutely astounding.

61
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
The legal wife consoling the mistress.

62
00:01:57 --> 00:01:58
No, no and no.

63
00:01:58 --> 00:01:59
I should go.

64
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
It&#39;s my turn to be at recess today.

65
00:02:01 --> 00:02:02
Tidy yourself up.

66
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
With your heart condition,
you should let the others work.

67
00:02:04 --> 00:02:05
Excuse me, madame.

68
00:02:05 --> 00:02:08
Come.
I have something to show you.

69
00:02:08 --> 00:02:09
What?

70
00:02:09 --> 00:02:10
Something.

71
00:02:10 --> 00:02:12
What the hell
are you both doing here?

72
00:02:12 --> 00:02:13
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

73
00:02:13 --> 00:02:14
Like kids. Nothing.

74
00:02:14 --> 00:02:15
Come on and kiss me!

75
00:02:15 --> 00:02:17
- Did you look at me?
- Are you still angry?

76
00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
What about you, Cricri?
Got a kiss for your husband?

77
00:02:20 --> 00:02:21
Come here.

78
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
Aren&#39;t you supposed to be
at recess today?

79
00:02:24 --> 00:02:25
I told her to stay.

80
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
Don&#39;t you see how she looks?
- Exactly. She needs air.

81
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
And her shoes.
Did you see the soles?

82
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
I&#39;ve always told her to buy
heavy shoes, real clodhoppers.

83
00:02:32 --> 00:02:33
A sick person shouldn&#39;t worry
about her appearance.

84
00:02:33 --> 00:02:34
I&#39;m not sick.

85
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
- She&#39;s delicate, you know it.
- Delicate?

86
00:02:36 --> 00:02:38
Yes, when she came from Caracas.

87
00:02:38 --> 00:02:39
Today, she&#39;s a cute little ruin.

88
00:02:39 --> 00:02:42
She doesn&#39;t risk anything.
Ruins are indestructible.

89
00:02:42 --> 00:02:45
She&#39;Il bury us all.
Won&#39;t you, my little ruin?

90
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
That&#39;s enough.
Go out and play, both of you.

91
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
Yes, a dark little bottle.

92
00:02:49 --> 00:02:52
She smelled it like that,
and it wasn&#39;t perfume.

93
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
I can tell you, they drink.

94
00:02:54 --> 00:02:55
That&#39;s why they&#39;re always together.

95
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
- What was in the bottle?
- Whiskey, idiot!

96
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
Please, I don&#39;t want to hear
about that anymore.

97
00:03:00 --> 00:03:02
Patard, if you want
to spend your vacation here,

98
00:03:02 --> 00:03:03
you&#39;Il have lots of time to draw.

99
00:03:03 --> 00:03:06
M. Patard, you heard.

100
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
No vacation for you.

101
00:03:08 --> 00:03:09
Go on.

102
00:03:09 --> 00:03:10
Miguel.

103
00:03:10 --> 00:03:11
Miguel, what&#39;s the matter with you?

104
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
I didn&#39;t want to punish him.
- So don&#39;t threaten him.

105
00:03:13 --> 00:03:16
Patard did very well
on his English quiz.

106
00:03:16 --> 00:03:18
That&#39;s no reason to degrade school grounds.

107
00:03:18 --> 00:03:19
I won&#39;t have any regrets.

108
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
No. I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t.

109
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
I didn&#39;t even have the courage
to divorce him.

110
00:03:23 --> 00:03:25
Do you still love him?

111
00:03:25 --> 00:03:26
Of course not.
You can&#39;t understand.

112
00:03:26 --> 00:03:27
Am I stupid?

113
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
- Divorce is a deadly sin.
- Really!

114
00:03:29 --> 00:03:30
See?

115
00:03:30 --> 00:03:32
And what about the knife
you carried around for a month?

116
00:03:32 --> 00:03:33
Wasn&#39;t that a deadly sin?

117
00:03:33 --> 00:03:35
I was jealous. I was mad.

118
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
But to concoct this thing... No.

119
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
As you wish. But think about it.

120
00:03:40 --> 00:03:41
We&#39;ll never find a better opportunity.

121
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
And we have just three days.

122
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
Everyone knows I&#39;m leaving for Niort.
You&#39;ll come and rest.

123
00:03:45 --> 00:03:47
Don&#39;t you believe in hell?

124
00:03:47 --> 00:03:48
Not since I was seven.

125
00:03:48 --> 00:03:49
I do.

126
00:03:49 --> 00:03:50
- Fish again?
- Not fish again.

127
00:03:50 --> 00:03:51
It&#39;s the same fish as last night.

128
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
- Make me two fried eggs.
- You&#39;re not gonna start, are you?

129
00:03:53 --> 00:03:54
I put in a quart of vinegar
and two pounds of onions.

130
00:03:54 --> 00:03:56
I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s bad.
But, you can smell that it&#39;s fish.

131
00:03:56 --> 00:03:57
It stinks.

132
00:03:57 --> 00:03:58
Yes, yes, later, later.

133
00:03:58 --> 00:03:59
No, thank you.

134
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
- Help yourself.
- I&#39;m not hungry.

135
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
You must set an example.
My liver doesn&#39;t allow me fat.

136
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
M. Delassalle, may I ask
for a glass of wine?

137
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
- You already had two.
- Only one.

138
00:04:09 --> 00:04:10
Only one.

139
00:04:10 --> 00:04:11
Well.

140
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
&quot;Bonum vinum laetificat cor hominis. &quot;

141
00:04:14 --> 00:04:17
- What is it? A bone?
- I told you I wasn&#39;t hungry.

142
00:04:17 --> 00:04:18
I&#39;m asking you to eat.

143
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
- Swallow!
- I can&#39;t help it. I just can&#39;t.

144
00:04:21 --> 00:04:22
Swallow.

145
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
- Delicious fish, M. Raymond?
- Perfect. Perfect.

146
00:04:26 --> 00:04:27
It seems extremely...

147
00:04:27 --> 00:04:28
extremely nutritious.

148
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
You should serve these lads
some mad cow.

149
00:04:30 --> 00:04:32
Be quiet or I&#39;ll keep you all
here this weekend. Swallow.

150
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
Everyone is looking at you.
Swallow.

151
00:04:34 --> 00:04:35
- It&#39;s disgusting.
- Sorry?

152
00:04:35 --> 00:04:37
Some things are hard to swallow.
I&#39;m not talking about the fish.

153
00:04:37 --> 00:04:38
We want food!

154
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
M. Drain, throw
these hooligans out of here.

155
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
What is this supposed to be?

156
00:04:43 --> 00:04:45
You&#39;re going to eat your fish.
And quietly.

157
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
- I told you to throw them out.
- Yes, sir.

158
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
We want food!

159
00:04:50 --> 00:04:54
- M. Raymond, go help your colleague.
- Right away, sir.

160
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
Get out, everybody. What is this?

161
00:04:56 --> 00:05:01
Get out and be careful.

162
00:05:01 --> 00:05:03
What kind of a supper is it
for these growing boys?

163
00:05:03 --> 00:05:05
A slice of sausage and
two spoons of mashed potatoes?

164
00:05:05 --> 00:05:06
They should&#39;ve eaten
what they were served.

165
00:05:06 --> 00:05:07
In the army...

166
00:05:07 --> 00:05:08
You&#39;re not an adjutant
But a soup merchant.

167
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
- I can&#39;t buy coalfish for 3000 francs.
- You&#39;d rather make them sick.

168
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
As a kid, we used to buy whiting.

169
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
Coalfish was too expensive.

170
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
They need expensive fish. I buy it,
but at a price that I can afford.

171
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
It&#39;s a mistake to buy on sale.

172
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
The fish vendor&#39;s smarter than us.
You get what you pay for.

173
00:05:22 --> 00:05:24
It&#39;s not his money. It&#39;s mine.

174
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
I&#39;m paying for everything here.

175
00:05:26 --> 00:05:28
I&#39;m paying for the doorkeeper.
And M. Drain.

176
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
I even paid Germaine,
Sabine, Therese.

177
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
I&#39;m paying you too, Nicole.
I accept it. I keep quiet.

178
00:05:33 --> 00:05:36
But when he attacks the kids,
it disgusts me.

179
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
I can&#39;t stand it.

180
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
Calm down. It&#39;s not good for you.

181
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
I&#39;d like to die,
and not see him anymore.

182
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
Die, my sweet.
Die quickly.

183
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
We&#39;ll have a nice funeral for you,
and we&#39;ll finally be rid of you.

184
00:05:47 --> 00:05:48
The school won&#39;t suffer...

185
00:05:48 --> 00:05:50
and I&#39;ll feel much better.

186
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
Well, children, have fun.

187
00:05:53 --> 00:05:56
I have to wake up early.
I&#39;Il go and pack.

188
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
Well, so...

189
00:05:57 --> 00:05:58
I&#39;m leaving at 7:00 a. m.

190
00:05:58 --> 00:05:59
Have a nice vacation, darling.
Take care.

191
00:05:59 --> 00:06:00
Good night, you.

192
00:06:00 --> 00:06:01
What a great vacation...

193
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
A three-day honeymoon.

194
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
No, no...

195
00:06:03 --> 00:06:10
Nicole!

196
00:06:10 --> 00:06:12
I&#39;m up here.
I&#39;m coming down.

197
00:06:12 --> 00:06:13
What are you doing?

198
00:06:13 --> 00:06:14
Watch out! Stand back!

199
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
Those riding the bus,
raise your hands.

200
00:06:17 --> 00:06:18
Will your sister still be
in the bathroom?

201
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
If we get there before 10:00.
You&#39;ll see, I made a hole.

202
00:06:20 --> 00:06:22
- Give me the pack back!
- You&#39;ll see my sister naked.

203
00:06:22 --> 00:06:24
- It&#39;s worth a pack a cigarettes.
- No! Give them back!

204
00:06:24 --> 00:06:26
Soudieu, aren&#39;t you part of our group?

205
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
No. We&#39;ll share a cab, the four of us.

206
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
Money is pouring out of your pockets.

207
00:06:30 --> 00:06:31
Don&#39;t you have a suitcase,
de Gasquet?

208
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
The chauffeur will take it.
That&#39;s what we pay him for.

209
00:06:33 --> 00:06:36
Our personal chauffeurs don&#39;t
do their job right, dear friend.

210
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
- Have a nice vacation, sir.
- Nice vacation, sir.

211
00:06:39 --> 00:06:40
Thank you.

212
00:06:40 --> 00:06:40
Plantiveau.

213
00:06:40 --> 00:06:41
Did madame come down?

214
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
I was ringing the bell when they
drove through the gate. I opened it.

215
00:06:44 --> 00:06:45
Both of them?

216
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
Mme. Delassalle and Mlle. Horner.
They took the truck.

217
00:06:48 --> 00:06:50
I thought you knew.

218
00:06:50 --> 00:06:51
Of course, I knew.

219
00:06:51 --> 00:06:52
I just forgot.

220
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
Except that it&#39;s a problem.

221
00:06:54 --> 00:06:56
Especially for these gentlemen.

222
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
One of you must stay
to watch those on detention.

223
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
You must feel strange
coming back to Niort.

224
00:07:00 --> 00:07:00
Why?

225
00:07:00 --> 00:07:02
Didn&#39;t you get into trouble
in high school?

226
00:07:02 --> 00:07:03
Trouble...

227
00:07:03 --> 00:07:05
I resigned, that&#39;s all.

228
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
- Do you still have your parents?
- No.

229
00:07:07 --> 00:07:11
I&#39;ve got a couple of teachers
living upstairs.

230
00:07:11 --> 00:07:12
What?
There are people in the house?

231
00:07:12 --> 00:07:14
I thought about it.
I thought about everything.

232
00:07:14 --> 00:07:15
I promise there&#39;s nothing to worry about.

233
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
Are you tired?
Do you need me to drive?

234
00:07:17 --> 00:07:18
You can&#39;t drive.

235
00:07:18 --> 00:07:19
I could never afford a car.

236
00:07:19 --> 00:07:20
This way, I cannot think.

237
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
Good. So keep driving.
Keep your nerves for tomorrow.

238
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
- We&#39;ll never have the courage.
- You don&#39;t know me.

239
00:07:24 --> 00:07:25
Yes, I know you.

240
00:07:25 --> 00:07:26
Very well.

241
00:07:26 --> 00:07:29
You can wish someone&#39;s death,
but kill...

242
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
You probably wished me dead at times...

243
00:07:31 --> 00:07:32
I didn&#39;t. But he did.

244
00:07:32 --> 00:07:33
He would say to me,
&quot;Don&#39;t worry.

245
00:07:33 --> 00:07:34
With her heart condition,
it won&#39;t take long.

246
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
After she dies,
we&#39;ll share the school. &quot;

247
00:07:36 --> 00:07:38
- It&#39;s horrible!
- Don&#39;t you believe me?

248
00:07:38 --> 00:07:40
What did you answer?

249
00:07:40 --> 00:07:42
- Do you want me to be honest?
- If you can.

250
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
I didn&#39;t know you that well...

251
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
I&#39;d rather not know.

252
00:07:47 --> 00:07:48
Watch your step.

253
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
Mlle. Horner!
What a surprise!

254
00:07:51 --> 00:07:52
Don&#39;t bother.

255
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
What a huge trunk.

256
00:07:54 --> 00:07:57
It always upsets M. Herboux
when I take more than a suitcase.

257
00:07:57 --> 00:07:58
Good evening.

258
00:07:58 --> 00:08:02
Mme. Herboux, M.A. in grammar.
Mme. Delassalle, my principal.

259
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

260
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
I haven&#39;t received the rent.

261
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
Don&#39;t torture me.
I&#39;m so embarrassed.

262
00:08:08 --> 00:08:10
I thought of giving it to you
tomorrow or the day after.

263
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
But we didn&#39;t get paid for
the examinations in Vausson.

264
00:08:13 --> 00:08:14
We were counting on that money.

265
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
But don&#39;t worry, I&#39;Il come tonight.

266
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
No need. I&#39;ll come up tomorrow.

267
00:08:18 --> 00:08:19
We&#39;re a little tired tonight.

268
00:08:19 --> 00:08:21
Yes, she looks sick.

269
00:08:21 --> 00:08:22
Make yourself at home.

270
00:08:22 --> 00:08:24
Home, sweet home.

271
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
Turn off the light. It&#39;s a waste.

272
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
- Already?
- Let&#39;s do it now and forget about it.

273
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
Hello, operator.
I&#39;d like a line to St. Cloud.

274
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
The number is Molitor 27.45.
Thank you.

275
00:08:34 --> 00:08:35
I like to have my feet free.

276
00:08:35 --> 00:08:38
When it&#39;s cold, I put on ski socks
instead of slippers.

277
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
Go ahead.

278
00:08:39 --> 00:08:40
What are you waiting for?

279
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
You see, it doesn&#39;t bite.
And it doesn&#39;t hit.

280
00:08:42 --> 00:08:43
Hello? Who is it?

281
00:08:43 --> 00:08:44
Answer, for God&#39;s sake!

282
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
It&#39;s you!

283
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
From Niort. My compliments!

284
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
You think I can afford a weekend
in the Poitou for you?

285
00:08:50 --> 00:08:53
What about the gas?
What are you talking about?

286
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
I&#39;m telling you that
we need to separate.

287
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
Yes, I want a divorce.

288
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
You are young, you are strong.

289
00:09:00 --> 00:09:01
You can make a nice living.

290
00:09:01 --> 00:09:05
The school was part of my dowry,
so I&#39;ll take it back.

291
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
We&#39;ll start the proceedings
right after the holidays.

292
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
- What?
- Don&#39;t give me that crap. I&#39;m coming.

293
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
I&#39;Il take a train tomorrow.
I&#39;Il meet you at Nicole&#39;s.

294
00:09:12 --> 00:09:13
So?

295
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
He&#39;s coming tomorrow
on the evening train.

296
00:09:16 --> 00:09:17
Well, Germaine?

297
00:09:17 --> 00:09:20
- You&#39;re nuts. You&#39;ll catch cold.
- I&#39;m not cold. I&#39;m suffocating.

298
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
- You&#39;ve got a fever.
- No, I&#39;m just hot.

299
00:09:23 --> 00:09:24
I thought you&#39;d never come back.

300
00:09:24 --> 00:09:25
That he&#39;d get here before you.

301
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
It doesn&#39;t always go as you want it to.
That&#39;s life. Everything was closed.

302
00:09:28 --> 00:09:29
Did you buy a tablecloth?

303
00:09:29 --> 00:09:33
Yes, a nylon, waterproof one.

304
00:09:33 --> 00:09:34
It&#39;s too big!

305
00:09:34 --> 00:09:35
Not too big for him.

306
00:09:35 --> 00:09:36
See that?

307
00:09:36 --> 00:09:39
Guess how much.
2500 francs.

308
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
They aren&#39;t losing money on this.

309
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
Let&#39;s open it.

310
00:09:42 --> 00:09:43
That way it won&#39;t look weird.

311
00:09:43 --> 00:09:44
Well, let&#39;s not waste it.

312
00:09:44 --> 00:09:48
- Here, it will cheer you up.
- No.

313
00:09:48 --> 00:09:50
You should, it&#39;s not bad at all.
I&#39;ve never had it before.

314
00:09:50 --> 00:09:52
- You&#39;re supposed to put water in it.
- It would be a waste.

315
00:09:52 --> 00:09:53
Hand me the small bottle.

316
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
- Won&#39;t he notice anything?
- Not a thing.

317
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
He&#39;ll sleep like a log.

318
00:09:58 --> 00:10:01
- You&#39;re sure it won&#39;t Leave traces?
- None.

319
00:10:01 --> 00:10:03
It&#39;s a sedative. He&#39;Il digest it.

320
00:10:03 --> 00:10:04
I&#39;m sure he won&#39;t come.

321
00:10:04 --> 00:10:05
That&#39;s him.

322
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
That&#39;s his train passing
the Ackerman bridge.

323
00:10:07 --> 00:10:08
Put that over there.

324
00:10:08 --> 00:10:09
Stop.

325
00:10:09 --> 00:10:10
Please, stop.

326
00:10:10 --> 00:10:11
It&#39;s too awful.

327
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
- We must fill it up.
- I can&#39;t do it.

328
00:10:13 --> 00:10:15
I can&#39;t do it, not today.

329
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
We must do it,
and you know it as well as I do.

330
00:10:17 --> 00:10:18
It&#39;s either today or never.

331
00:10:18 --> 00:10:19
Then never!

332
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
Let&#39;s forget about it.
I can&#39;t handle this.

333
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
As you wish.
But I must warn you.

334
00:10:23 --> 00:10:25
If you miss your chance,
he won&#39;t miss his.

335
00:10:25 --> 00:10:27
Not after your phone call.

336
00:10:27 --> 00:10:28
I don&#39;t know.

337
00:10:28 --> 00:10:29
I just don&#39;t know anymore.

338
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
Nicole, please, help me.

339
00:10:32 --> 00:10:34
What for?
You can&#39;t handle it anyway.

340
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
I should never have trusted you.

341
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
I got involved too,
and you abandoned me.

342
00:10:39 --> 00:10:41
Yes, you&#39;re right.
I&#39;m not worth anything.

343
00:10:41 --> 00:10:44
I&#39;m just a ruin, a little ruin.

344
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
That&#39;s what he said.

345
00:10:46 --> 00:10:47
But...

346
00:10:47 --> 00:10:49
the littLe ruin
will get her revenge.

347
00:10:49 --> 00:10:50
She&#39;ll find the strength.

348
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
Even if she collapses afterward.

349
00:10:52 --> 00:10:53
My only regret

350
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
is that he&#39;ll never know
that I killed him.

351
00:10:55 --> 00:10:56
Come on.

352
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
Before you were giving up,
now you&#39;re excited.

353
00:10:58 --> 00:11:01
What you need is to relax.

354
00:11:01 --> 00:11:02
Relax a lot.

355
00:11:02 --> 00:11:03
You must keep cool.

356
00:11:03 --> 00:11:04
I will.

357
00:11:04 --> 00:11:05
I swear that I will.

358
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
I must go upstairs and see them.

359
00:11:07 --> 00:11:08
Can&#39;t you stay with me?

360
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
If the Herbouxes look out the window
and see him come in...

361
00:11:12 --> 00:11:13
You&#39;ll come right away, won&#39;t you?

362
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
As fast as I can, I promise.

363
00:11:15 --> 00:11:19
Be brave. In half an hour,
it will all be over.

364
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
I&#39;Il find her a husband.
I&#39;ll redeem myself.

365
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
She&#39;s young, she&#39;ll be rich
and she&#39;Il be happy.

366
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
Please, God, do not do this!
- Miss Horner.

367
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
I wasn&#39;t expecting you tonight.

368
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
Mme. Delassalle is resting
and I&#39;m not tired.

369
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
- May I come in?
- PLease, do.

370
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
We were listening to the radio as
we finished our dinner.

371
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37
The drama show is over.

372
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
ZapiMax starts in 35 seconds.

373
00:11:40 --> 00:11:42
Dear listeners, you&#39;ve just heard...

374
00:11:42 --> 00:11:46
&quot;Don&#39;t Trifle with Love&quot;
by Alfred de Musset.

375
00:11:46 --> 00:11:47
My God!

376
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
- Good evening, Michel.
- Good evening.

377
00:11:49 --> 00:11:50
Come in.

378
00:11:50 --> 00:11:51
So, are you proud of yourself?

379
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
Not so loud, the neighbors.

380
00:11:53 --> 00:11:54
Don&#39;t worry.

381
00:11:54 --> 00:11:55
I don&#39;t want to be noticed.

382
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
A man who runs after his wife
is ridiculous enough.

383
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
I Left the school like a thief.

384
00:11:59 --> 00:12:02
I had to hide from Plantiveau.

385
00:12:02 --> 00:12:03
Hiding from my own porter!

386
00:12:03 --> 00:12:04
It&#39;s humiliating.

387
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
I couldn&#39;t tell him where I was going!

388
00:12:06 --> 00:12:09
You have forced me to come,
what are you waiting for?

389
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
- What?
- Pack your bags.

390
00:12:11 --> 00:12:12
- No.
- What?

391
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
- I&#39;m staying.
- Are you refusing to come?

392
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
I thought that was cLear.

393
00:12:16 --> 00:12:17
I&#39;ll come back after our divorce.

394
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
You have decided to divorce?

395
00:12:20 --> 00:12:21
Yes.

396
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
With your religious beliefs?

397
00:12:23 --> 00:12:25
I won&#39;t get married again, that&#39;s all.

398
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
But getting a divorce
is like getting married,

399
00:12:27 --> 00:12:29
we must both agree.

400
00:12:29 --> 00:12:30
My lawyer doesn&#39;t think so.

401
00:12:30 --> 00:12:31
You have a lawyer?

402
00:12:31 --> 00:12:34
- Attorney Berthoux, 64 Victor Hugo.
- Berthoux?

403
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
You can check in the phone book.

404
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
I went to see him this morning...

405
00:12:38 --> 00:12:41
and he assured me that I&#39;d get
the legal separation quickly.

406
00:12:41 --> 00:12:43
He told you that?
Free of charge?

407
00:12:43 --> 00:12:44
Funny lawyer!

408
00:12:44 --> 00:12:45
Of course, I told him -

409
00:12:45 --> 00:12:46
You told him...

410
00:12:46 --> 00:12:47
all of our secrets
about our private life.

411
00:12:47 --> 00:12:50
You told everything to a stranger?
An animal who enjoyed every word of it?

412
00:12:50 --> 00:12:53
To think you grew up in a convent!

413
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
You know what? It&#39;s disgusting!

414
00:12:56 --> 00:12:59
Didn&#39;t you talk about us
to your lovers?

415
00:12:59 --> 00:13:01
Do we still have secrets?

416
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
Is there anything that Nicole
doesn&#39;t know?

417
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
If you believe her!
Two words, three lies.

418
00:13:06 --> 00:13:07
There are details that
she couldn&#39;t have invented.

419
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
She can invent anything!

420
00:13:09 --> 00:13:11
God knows what she told the lawyer!

421
00:13:11 --> 00:13:12
- I&#39;Il go see him, and put things straight.
- No!

422
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
- You won&#39;t stop me.
- No, later. Tomorrow.

423
00:13:14 --> 00:13:16
- He&#39;s probably having supper now.
- Well, I didn&#39;t eat.

424
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
- He won&#39;t see you.
- When he hears I came up from Paris -

425
00:13:18 --> 00:13:19
Don&#39;t.

426
00:13:19 --> 00:13:22
I didn&#39;t see a lawyer.
I lied to you.

427
00:13:22 --> 00:13:23
You too?

428
00:13:23 --> 00:13:24
It&#39;s contagious.

429
00:13:24 --> 00:13:28
So, what about the divorce,
was that a lie too?

430
00:13:28 --> 00:13:31
No, I really want the divorce.

431
00:13:31 --> 00:13:33
It&#39;s the only way.

432
00:13:33 --> 00:13:34
For your sake as well, Michel.

433
00:13:34 --> 00:13:37
It will be better for both of us.

434
00:13:37 --> 00:13:39
Come on, Cricri.
You can&#39;t be serious.

435
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
Do you know the price of a divorce?

436
00:13:41 --> 00:13:43
And what about the scandal?

437
00:13:43 --> 00:13:44
What scandal?

438
00:13:44 --> 00:13:47
I&#39;ll have to take a lawyer
to defend myself.

439
00:13:47 --> 00:13:50
And lawyers never stop talking.

440
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
If you think parents will continue
to send you their kids.

441
00:13:52 --> 00:13:53
They&#39;Il take the students
away from me?

442
00:13:53 --> 00:13:54
Of course. You&#39;ll go bankrupt.

443
00:13:54 --> 00:13:57
Not that I care much. If it were up to me,
I would have sold it a long time ago.

444
00:13:57 --> 00:13:59
With your money and my contacts

445
00:13:59 --> 00:14:00
I&#39;d have gone into business.

446
00:14:00 --> 00:14:04
We could have lived comfortably.

447
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
But you wanted this kid business.
I gave in.

448
00:14:06 --> 00:14:07
It was security.

449
00:14:07 --> 00:14:08
Some deal!

450
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
We traded in the big car
for a small one.

451
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
I gave up my training.

452
00:14:12 --> 00:14:13
I wear decrepit suits.

453
00:14:13 --> 00:14:15
We are rich and we live
like poor people.

454
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
Do you know how I paid for my trip?

455
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
I sold my Larousse dictionary,
my main work tool.

456
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
I did it all for you.

457
00:14:22 --> 00:14:24
I don&#39;t regret it.

458
00:14:24 --> 00:14:25
But when you throw me out,

459
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
it upsets me, Cricri.

460
00:14:27 --> 00:14:28
It really upsets me.

461
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
You know, you made me miserable.

462
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
We used to fight,
like every other couple.

463
00:14:34 --> 00:14:37
What have we got here?
Not too shabby.

464
00:14:37 --> 00:14:38
Wait.

465
00:14:38 --> 00:14:39
Don&#39;t lie.

466
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
You mustn&#39;t lie now.

467
00:14:41 --> 00:14:43
You&#39;ve made me very unhappy.

468
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
You might not have been aware of it,

469
00:14:45 --> 00:14:46
but it&#39;s the truth.

470
00:14:46 --> 00:14:47
Ask Nicole.

471
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
Please, don&#39;t talk about that bitch.
She&#39;s setting you up against me.

472
00:14:49 --> 00:14:51
She exploits the fact that you&#39;re sick.
Nice way of thinking!

473
00:14:51 --> 00:14:52
Yes.

474
00:14:52 --> 00:14:54
She&#39;s got knowLedge, taste...

475
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
- Taste?
- Yes, but a bad attitude.

476
00:14:56 --> 00:14:57
That&#39;s it. I&#39;m firing her right away.

477
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
We&#39;ll replace her with a man.
A good, honest, old man.

478
00:14:59 --> 00:14:59
Michel!

479
00:14:59 --> 00:15:00
For God&#39;s sake!
My Prince of Wales suit!

480
00:15:00 --> 00:15:01
You idiot!

481
00:15:01 --> 00:15:02
Go get a handkerchief, a towel!

482
00:15:02 --> 00:15:03
It will stain and I&#39;ll reek of alcohol.

483
00:15:03 --> 00:15:04
Go!

484
00:15:04 --> 00:15:05
Here and here.

485
00:15:05 --> 00:15:06
There!

486
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
It doesn&#39;t pay to be nice to you.

487
00:15:08 --> 00:15:09
I&#39;ll train you, girl.

488
00:15:09 --> 00:15:10
Well, what are you waiting for?

489
00:15:10 --> 00:15:11
Get some hot water, damn it!

490
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
We&#39;re leaving now and we&#39;Il get back
tomorrow morning.

491
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
How long did you have to drive?
Ten, twelve hours?

492
00:15:17 --> 00:15:18
Well, answer!

493
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
Can&#39;t you talk?

494
00:15:20 --> 00:15:22
Hey, Mrs. Worldly!

495
00:15:22 --> 00:15:23
How about another glass?

496
00:15:23 --> 00:15:25
I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong.
I&#39;m dizzy.

497
00:15:25 --> 00:15:26
You forget how to pour?

498
00:15:26 --> 00:15:27
That&#39;s enough.

499
00:15:27 --> 00:15:28
Nice color.

500
00:15:28 --> 00:15:30
Stop looking at me
with your insane eyes.

501
00:15:30 --> 00:15:32
It&#39;s all expenses paid, isn&#39;t it?

502
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
By the way, where is our host?
Is she scared? Hiding?

503
00:15:36 --> 00:15:38
She&#39;s upstairs visiting the tenants.

504
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
Mademoiselle has tenants.
She never told me that.

505
00:15:41 --> 00:15:42
I&#39;m exhausted.

506
00:15:42 --> 00:15:43
It&#39;s the train.

507
00:15:43 --> 00:15:44
Just lie down.

508
00:15:44 --> 00:15:47
- Whose bed is this? Hers or yours?
- Ours.

509
00:15:47 --> 00:15:48
Funny.

510
00:15:48 --> 00:15:50
Shoes. Take off my shoes.

511
00:15:50 --> 00:15:51
What&#39;s the matter with me tonight?

512
00:15:51 --> 00:15:55
I don&#39;t want to sleep.

513
00:15:55 --> 00:15:57
We have to Leave.

514
00:15:57 --> 00:15:59
What are you doing?

515
00:15:59 --> 00:16:00
Just sleep.

516
00:16:00 --> 00:16:01
Why did you turn off the light?

517
00:16:01 --> 00:16:02
I&#39;m so tired!

518
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
What&#39;s the matter?

519
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
Nothing. Go to sleep.

520
00:16:07 --> 00:16:08
How did you get in?

521
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
I came through this door.

522
00:16:10 --> 00:16:11
How many drinks did he have?

523
00:16:11 --> 00:16:12
Three.

524
00:16:12 --> 00:16:13
He was very good.

525
00:16:13 --> 00:16:14
He&#39;s dreaming.

526
00:16:14 --> 00:16:15
He&#39;s ready. We can take him.

527
00:16:15 --> 00:16:16
Take off his shoes.

528
00:16:16 --> 00:16:17
What the hell is she doing?

529
00:16:17 --> 00:16:18
She&#39;s taking a bath.

530
00:16:18 --> 00:16:20
At 10:00 p. m.? Funny habits.

531
00:16:20 --> 00:16:21
What a pest!

532
00:16:21 --> 00:16:25
Tell me, sir, where are
the Straits of Mozambique?

533
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
Between Madagascar and Africa!

534
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
It is precisely located between
Madagascar and the Coast of Africa.

535
00:16:29 --> 00:16:30
Bravo, sir!

536
00:16:30 --> 00:16:33
- 32,000 francs!
- 32,000 francs!

537
00:16:33 --> 00:16:37
I must ask you now,
do you stop or do you carry on?

538
00:16:37 --> 00:16:38
- I will go on.
- Of course, I carry on.

539
00:16:38 --> 00:16:39
He will go on!

540
00:16:39 --> 00:16:40
I can&#39;t hear a thing!

541
00:16:40 --> 00:16:41
Right when I&#39;m winning 32,000 francs!

542
00:16:41 --> 00:16:42
Poor baby!

543
00:16:42 --> 00:16:44
Bitches! Bitches!
Daughters of bitches!

544
00:16:44 --> 00:16:47
- Only six seconds remaining.
- I didn&#39;t even hear the question!

545
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
Midnight baths!
The decline of Rome!

546
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
She&#39;s interfering with my enjoyment!

547
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
I have the right to send her
a registered Letter.

548
00:16:54 --> 00:16:56
And I&#39;m not saying that I won&#39;t do it.

549
00:16:56 --> 00:17:02
The 17th at 10:05- 06 p. m.

550
00:17:02 --> 00:17:03
What are you looking for?

551
00:17:03 --> 00:17:04
His return ticket.

552
00:17:04 --> 00:17:05
Here it is.

553
00:17:05 --> 00:17:07
With the restaurant bill.

554
00:17:07 --> 00:17:07
Burn it.

555
00:17:07 --> 00:17:08
Let&#39;s go.

556
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
You take the feet. It&#39;s lighter.

557
00:17:10 --> 00:17:11
Together.

558
00:17:11 --> 00:17:12
The statue.

559
00:17:12 --> 00:17:14
The statue on the mantel.

560
00:17:14 --> 00:17:15
Give it to me.

561
00:17:15 --> 00:17:16
Now, the tablecloth.

562
00:17:16 --> 00:17:17
The tablecloth.

563
00:17:17 --> 00:17:18
It&#39;s over.

564
00:17:18 --> 00:17:19
Did he suffer?

565
00:17:19 --> 00:17:21
He didn&#39;t feel anything.

566
00:17:21 --> 00:17:24
Let&#39;s go right away
and bring him back tonight.

567
00:17:24 --> 00:17:25
What about our alibi?

568
00:17:25 --> 00:17:27
When they find him,
we&#39;ll have to be abLe to prove

569
00:17:27 --> 00:17:28
that we were here the day he died.

570
00:17:28 --> 00:17:29
That&#39;s why I&#39;m using
the idiots upstairs.

571
00:17:29 --> 00:17:31
She still hasn&#39;t emptied the tub.

572
00:17:31 --> 00:17:33
- So what?
- So I can&#39;t go to sleep.

573
00:17:33 --> 00:17:35
When she opens the drain,
the noise will start again.

574
00:17:35 --> 00:17:36
It won&#39;t fall on your bed.

575
00:17:36 --> 00:17:38
I can&#39;t sleep near Niagara Falls.

576
00:17:38 --> 00:17:40
Are you planning to stay up all night?

577
00:17:40 --> 00:17:41
I&#39;m sitting down.

578
00:17:41 --> 00:17:42
I&#39;ll give her until midnight.

579
00:17:42 --> 00:17:43
Here they are!

580
00:17:43 --> 00:17:44
They took their time.

581
00:17:44 --> 00:17:47
When I passed by the cafe at 12:00,
they were already there.

582
00:17:47 --> 00:17:48
They must know
how much it costs them.

583
00:17:48 --> 00:17:50
If you were a landlord,
and I a school principal...

584
00:17:50 --> 00:17:51
Sure.

585
00:17:51 --> 00:17:53
We could also afford good meals.

586
00:17:53 --> 00:17:54
Well, I&#39;m going to take a nap.

587
00:17:54 --> 00:17:56
Here we go, the flood!

588
00:17:56 --> 00:17:58
- What&#39;s the matter?
- He&#39;s so ugly!

589
00:17:58 --> 00:17:59
I&#39;ve had it!

590
00:17:59 --> 00:18:00
I can&#39;t wait for them to Leave!

591
00:18:00 --> 00:18:02
Too bad you&#39;re leaving us so soon.

592
00:18:02 --> 00:18:03
It was so nice to have company.

593
00:18:03 --> 00:18:06
You know, school starts tomorrow.

594
00:18:06 --> 00:18:08
For us as well as for you.

595
00:18:08 --> 00:18:10
I just came to get my dishes.

596
00:18:10 --> 00:18:11
It&#39;s quite heavy.

597
00:18:11 --> 00:18:12
Wait a minute.
Would you have a piece of string?

598
00:18:12 --> 00:18:14
A piece of string? No.

599
00:18:14 --> 00:18:17
Wait. This might help you.

600
00:18:17 --> 00:18:18
I&#39;ll try, yes.

601
00:18:18 --> 00:18:20
Let me do it.
It&#39;ll be easier for you.

602
00:18:20 --> 00:18:22
It won&#39;t work.
Your trunk is crammed too full.

603
00:18:22 --> 00:18:24
- Let&#39;s take some things out.
- No, no.

604
00:18:24 --> 00:18:26
Yes. I&#39;ll bring you the old tin trunk.

605
00:18:26 --> 00:18:28
It&#39;s very strong.
It went through the 1940 retreat.

606
00:18:28 --> 00:18:31
Start emptying the basket!
- No, it&#39;ll be fine.

607
00:18:31 --> 00:18:34
- We&#39;re already late, aren&#39;t we, Nicole?
- That&#39;s what I told them.

608
00:18:34 --> 00:18:37
Anyway, it&#39;s fine now.
We can load.

609
00:18:37 --> 00:18:38
Watch out! Clear the way!

610
00:18:38 --> 00:18:39
On my command.

611
00:18:39 --> 00:18:40
One, two!

612
00:18:40 --> 00:18:42
Now, it&#39;ll be easy.
A little kick in the ass.

613
00:18:42 --> 00:18:43
I&#39;ll start the engine.

614
00:18:43 --> 00:18:45
- That&#39;s it!
- As you say!

615
00:18:45 --> 00:18:47
M. Herboux, thank you for your help.

616
00:18:47 --> 00:18:50
- Don&#39;t mention it.
- All the same...

617
00:18:50 --> 00:18:53
- Here, this is for the road.
- Thank you, madame.

618
00:18:53 --> 00:18:55
Drive carefully,
the roads are dangerous.

619
00:18:55 --> 00:18:56
They have mobilized 1500 policemen.

620
00:18:56 --> 00:18:57
You&#39;ll find one at every crossroad.

621
00:18:57 --> 00:18:59
Good-bye, madame.
And thank you again.

622
00:18:59 --> 00:19:00
- Have a good trip.
- See you soon!

623
00:19:00 --> 00:19:01
We&#39;re scot-free this time.

624
00:19:01 --> 00:19:04
- Sooner or later...
- Great.

625
00:19:04 --> 00:19:05
There is only one possible end.

626
00:19:05 --> 00:19:08
We are monsters.
I don&#39;t like monsters.

627
00:19:08 --> 00:19:10
If it&#39;s only him, I feel better.

628
00:19:10 --> 00:19:12
I&#39;ll save the grain of sand
falling from the hands of providence

629
00:19:12 --> 00:19:13
for my morality lessons.

630
00:19:13 --> 00:19:14
You jerk!

631
00:19:14 --> 00:19:16
It is about time!
All the gas stations were empty!

632
00:19:16 --> 00:19:18
No wonder! It was crazy today.

633
00:19:18 --> 00:19:19
Wait.

634
00:19:19 --> 00:19:21
There is always some
left in the bottom.

635
00:19:21 --> 00:19:22
963 francs.

636
00:19:22 --> 00:19:23
I only have a 5,000 franc bill.

637
00:19:23 --> 00:19:24
Come with me.
I&#39;ll get some change.

638
00:19:24 --> 00:19:27
- Are you going to Tours?
- No, I&#39;m not.

639
00:19:27 --> 00:19:30
Could you give me a lift?

640
00:19:30 --> 00:19:33
The bus driver wouldn&#39;t take me.

641
00:19:33 --> 00:19:36
He&#39;s anti-militarist, like me.

642
00:19:36 --> 00:19:38
We are already two.
Can&#39;t you see there&#39;s no room?

643
00:19:38 --> 00:19:41
I won&#39;t take room.
A second class soldier.

644
00:19:41 --> 00:19:44
If I don&#39;t report,
they&#39;Il throw me in the slammer.

645
00:19:44 --> 00:19:46
Have some pity for a soldier.

646
00:19:46 --> 00:19:47
Leave me alone. You&#39;re drunk.

647
00:19:47 --> 00:19:50
Me? Hey, you!

648
00:19:50 --> 00:19:51
I&#39;m being polite.

649
00:19:51 --> 00:19:52
And if that&#39;s the way it is,

650
00:19:52 --> 00:19:53
I&#39;ll just get into your car.

651
00:19:53 --> 00:19:56
I won&#39;t let you. Do you hear me?

652
00:19:56 --> 00:19:57
Nicole!

653
00:19:57 --> 00:19:58
Would you get out!

654
00:19:58 --> 00:20:00
- What is it?
- Don&#39;t worry.

655
00:20:00 --> 00:20:02
He&#39;s drunk. I know him.
He&#39;s not a bad guy.

656
00:20:02 --> 00:20:03
You should be ashamed
of yourself, Robert.

657
00:20:03 --> 00:20:05
Get out of here,
or I&#39;Il push you out myself.

658
00:20:05 --> 00:20:06
The pig. What did he do?

659
00:20:06 --> 00:20:08
The floor is all wet.
I&#39;ll cLean it.

660
00:20:08 --> 00:20:11
No, no need.
We&#39;re in a hurry. Thank you.

661
00:20:11 --> 00:20:13
Start the car.
There&#39;s a hole in the nylon!

662
00:20:13 --> 00:20:14
Did you hear that?

663
00:20:14 --> 00:20:17
- It sounds like the boss.
- He decided to come back.

664
00:20:17 --> 00:20:18
It&#39;s about time!

665
00:20:18 --> 00:20:20
Isn&#39;t it too late
to make all this racket?

666
00:20:20 --> 00:20:22
If we only ring,
Plantiveau won&#39;t open.

667
00:20:22 --> 00:20:24
Three short strokes,
that&#39;s Michel&#39;s signal.

668
00:20:24 --> 00:20:25
Plantiveau is a heavy sleeper.

669
00:20:25 --> 00:20:27
I&#39;ll wake him up!

670
00:20:27 --> 00:20:29
Come on, Plantiveau!

671
00:20:29 --> 00:20:31
It&#39;s you?
I thought it was M. Delassalle.

672
00:20:31 --> 00:20:33
What? Isn&#39;t he here?

673
00:20:33 --> 00:20:35
How should I know?
Ask him when you see him.

674
00:20:35 --> 00:20:38
- You look tired.
- Are you surprised?

675
00:20:38 --> 00:20:39
You can go.

676
00:20:39 --> 00:20:41
Sorry to wake you.
Good night.

677
00:20:41 --> 00:20:42
Good night.

678
00:20:42 --> 00:20:44
Turn off the headlights.
No need to parade our little number.

679
00:20:44 --> 00:20:45
No music either then!

680
00:20:45 --> 00:20:47
Not now.

681
00:20:47 --> 00:20:48
Go around.

682
00:20:48 --> 00:20:50
That&#39;s the bathroom light

683
00:20:50 --> 00:20:51
It&#39;s Pascual.

684
00:20:51 --> 00:20:53
I heard he gets up every night.

685
00:20:53 --> 00:20:54
He might look out the window.

686
00:20:54 --> 00:20:55
Come on, quick.

687
00:20:55 --> 00:20:56
Come on.

688
00:20:56 --> 00:20:58
- Can you see him from here?
- No.

689
00:20:58 --> 00:21:00
Either the water is too dirty,
or we&#39;re too far away.

690
00:21:00 --> 00:21:02
I&#39;m telling you
that you can&#39;t see anything.

691
00:21:02 --> 00:21:03
What&#39;s the point in staying here?

692
00:21:03 --> 00:21:05
We&#39;re not supposed
to discover the body.

693
00:21:05 --> 00:21:08
- Close the window. It&#39;s freezing.
- Shut up. It stinks in here.

694
00:21:08 --> 00:21:09
Good news.
The principal didn&#39;t come back.

695
00:21:09 --> 00:21:10
He&#39;s in heat.

696
00:21:10 --> 00:21:11
He&#39;s already got two chicks.
Isn&#39;t that enough?

697
00:21:11 --> 00:21:13
Of course not.
When I grow up, I&#39;ll have a lot.

698
00:21:13 --> 00:21:15
Look at Napoleon and Louis XIV.

699
00:21:15 --> 00:21:16
All the big men used to
have a lot of chicks.

700
00:21:16 --> 00:21:19
- Do you think you&#39;re Napoleon?
- I&#39;m Falcon Eye.

701
00:21:19 --> 00:21:21
M. Moinet, stop playing the fool.

702
00:21:21 --> 00:21:22
I&#39;m not a fool. I am an Indian.

703
00:21:22 --> 00:21:23
Very well, you&#39;ll write 20 times:

704
00:21:23 --> 00:21:26
&quot;I provoke my comrades&#39; frivolity
with my absurd comments. &quot;

705
00:21:26 --> 00:21:30
What do I hear?
The principal is missing?

706
00:21:30 --> 00:21:32
This is the third time, dear friend,

707
00:21:32 --> 00:21:34
that I drink my wine,
chemically pure.

708
00:21:34 --> 00:21:36
- Where is he?
- Well...

709
00:21:36 --> 00:21:38
I saw him the day before
yesterday around 8:00.

710
00:21:38 --> 00:21:40
By 12:00, he was already gone.

711
00:21:40 --> 00:21:42
And he didn&#39;t show up again?

712
00:21:42 --> 00:21:43
Strange.

713
00:21:43 --> 00:21:45
That&#39;s not like him.

714
00:21:45 --> 00:21:49
Poor Mme. Delassalle.
She has enough troubLes already.

715
00:21:49 --> 00:21:52
If she&#39;s no more worried than I am,
he can stay where he is.

716
00:21:52 --> 00:21:55
But believe me,
he&#39;ll be back soon.

717
00:21:55 --> 00:21:58
- And we&#39;ll go back to drinking bad wine.
- You said it.

718
00:21:58 --> 00:21:59
Did you notice?

719
00:21:59 --> 00:22:01
This afternoon it seemed that
he pretended not to see the body.

720
00:22:01 --> 00:22:02
The body was at the bottom.

721
00:22:02 --> 00:22:04
- Do you think it will rise?
- It has to.

722
00:22:04 --> 00:22:06
- When?
- How should I know?

723
00:22:06 --> 00:22:07
Tonight. Tomorrow morning.

724
00:22:07 --> 00:22:08
I can&#39;t wait that long.

725
00:22:08 --> 00:22:11
We cannot ask to empty the pool.
Try to understand.

726
00:22:11 --> 00:22:13
It&#39;s natural to empty a pool
when the water is dirty.

727
00:22:13 --> 00:22:15
What we find inside
won&#39;t be natural at all.

728
00:22:15 --> 00:22:16
And if I took responsibility for it?

729
00:22:16 --> 00:22:18
To take responsibilities,
you must be an adult.

730
00:22:18 --> 00:22:19
You think like a child.

731
00:22:19 --> 00:22:21
Not worth more than an F!

732
00:22:21 --> 00:22:23
I don&#39;t know how you can
grade papers now.

733
00:22:23 --> 00:22:25
By mistake I just wrote
complete nonsense.

734
00:22:25 --> 00:22:26
Well, erase it.

735
00:22:26 --> 00:22:27
I don&#39;t have an eraser.

736
00:22:27 --> 00:22:28
Here.

737
00:22:28 --> 00:22:29
Listen.

738
00:22:29 --> 00:22:32
If his body doesn&#39;t come up by tomorrow,
I&#39;ll manage to have the pool emptied.

739
00:22:32 --> 00:22:33
And I hope we won&#39;t regret it.

740
00:22:33 --> 00:22:34
Don&#39;t bite your nails.

741
00:22:34 --> 00:22:36
I was offside? Which team are you on?

742
00:22:36 --> 00:22:39
- Look!
- I was waiting for that.

743
00:22:39 --> 00:22:41
Don&#39;t call attention to it.

744
00:22:41 --> 00:22:42
I told you not to look.

745
00:22:42 --> 00:22:44
Do something!
My heart is about to explode.

746
00:22:44 --> 00:22:45
You promised yesterday.

747
00:22:45 --> 00:22:46
Give me the keys.

748
00:22:46 --> 00:22:48
Let&#39;s move things along.

749
00:22:48 --> 00:22:50
Now we can&#39;t play after lunch.

750
00:22:50 --> 00:22:53
That was clever.
Go and bring the pole.

751
00:22:53 --> 00:22:54
Me! Me! Me!

752
00:22:54 --> 00:22:55
Soudieu!

753
00:22:55 --> 00:22:56
Let&#39;s test you on a 100 meters.

754
00:22:56 --> 00:22:59
As for you, you need
some training in the shot put.

755
00:22:59 --> 00:23:01
You&#39;re lucky.
You have a champion skin diver here.

756
00:23:01 --> 00:23:04
- Soudieu! I forbid you!
- Let him! He&#39;s a champion!

757
00:23:04 --> 00:23:07
- What&#39;s happening?
- It&#39;s taking him too long.

758
00:23:07 --> 00:23:09
- He might be drowning.
- Did you see the bubbLes?

759
00:23:09 --> 00:23:11
Did you get them?
Say something!

760
00:23:11 --> 00:23:14
- I saw this shining in the mud.
- It looks like M. Delassalle&#39;s lighter.

761
00:23:14 --> 00:23:16
- And you didn&#39;t see -
- The keys!

762
00:23:16 --> 00:23:17
It&#39;s chocolate soup at the bottom.

763
00:23:17 --> 00:23:20
Go get dressed. Don&#39;t catch cold.
We&#39;ll manage.

764
00:23:20 --> 00:23:23
I think we&#39;ll have to empty the pool.

765
00:23:23 --> 00:23:26
Yes. Have it emptied.

766
00:23:26 --> 00:23:27
Send Plantiveau over.

767
00:23:27 --> 00:23:29
You heard the bell.
What are you waiting for?

768
00:23:29 --> 00:23:30
Go on.

769
00:23:30 --> 00:23:31
Plantiveau...

770
00:23:31 --> 00:23:33
It&#39;s deep right here.

771
00:23:33 --> 00:23:34
It&#39;s all right. I can swim.

772
00:23:34 --> 00:23:36
So what? A lot of people
who can swim drown.

773
00:23:36 --> 00:23:38
Because the ones who can&#39;t
stay away from the edge.

774
00:23:38 --> 00:23:40
I want you to empty the pool.

775
00:23:40 --> 00:23:41
Right now?

776
00:23:41 --> 00:23:44
I&#39;m not dressed for it.
I was going to the barber.

777
00:23:44 --> 00:23:48
Do it now, Plantiveau.
It&#39;s urgent. Do it for me.

778
00:23:48 --> 00:23:49
All right. The fish will wait.

779
00:23:49 --> 00:23:51
Only to empty the pool
will take an hour.

780
00:23:51 --> 00:23:52
Madame Delassalle.

781
00:23:52 --> 00:23:54
She&#39;s upset. Be cool.

782
00:23:54 --> 00:23:57
Why are you staring at me?
What&#39;s the matter?

783
00:23:57 --> 00:23:58
Let&#39;s resume.

784
00:23:58 --> 00:23:59
The surface of a hexagon...

785
00:23:59 --> 00:24:01
in relation to the radius
of the circumference?

786
00:24:01 --> 00:24:03
Well, I&#39;m waiting.

787
00:24:03 --> 00:24:04
I&#39;m waiting...

788
00:24:04 --> 00:24:06
6 AB x 1/2 OH.

789
00:24:06 --> 00:24:08
Thank you. Good.
Go back to your seat.

790
00:24:08 --> 00:24:09
Take out your notebooks.

791
00:24:09 --> 00:24:11
Wait a minute. I&#39;Il be right back.

792
00:24:11 --> 00:24:12
M. Plantiveau!

793
00:24:12 --> 00:24:13
What happened to her?

794
00:24:13 --> 00:24:15
It can&#39;t be true.
It&#39;s impossible!

795
00:24:15 --> 00:24:16
I didn&#39;t see well!

796
00:24:16 --> 00:24:18
You saw very well!

797
00:24:18 --> 00:24:21
- He isn&#39;t there anymore?
- No, he isn&#39;t.

798
00:24:21 --> 00:24:22
Come in.

799
00:24:22 --> 00:24:24
- What is it?
- It&#39;s the doctor, mademoiselle.

800
00:24:24 --> 00:24:27
I think it comes from
the open space, the empty pool.

801
00:24:27 --> 00:24:30
She suffers from agoraphobia,
and she got dizzy.

802
00:24:30 --> 00:24:33
- It&#39;s possibLe.
- Nature abhors a vacuum.

803
00:24:33 --> 00:24:37
An empty pool isn&#39;t worth
a full bottle, Plantiveau.

804
00:24:37 --> 00:24:39
Is she feeling any better,
dear colleague?

805
00:24:39 --> 00:24:41
Dr. Loisy is with her.

806
00:24:41 --> 00:24:43
You&#39;Il take her pupils
for study hall, M. Raymond...

807
00:24:43 --> 00:24:46
and you, M. Drain,
watch my class for a few minutes.

808
00:24:46 --> 00:24:48
Madame Delassalle
might still need me.

809
00:24:48 --> 00:24:49
- Thank you.
- Of course.

810
00:24:49 --> 00:24:51
Did you notice?
She gives the orders now.

811
00:24:51 --> 00:24:52
Well, Doctor?

812
00:24:52 --> 00:24:55
We&#39;ll all get there one day.
When it&#39;s worn down, it just is.

813
00:24:55 --> 00:24:56
Where is the husband?
- Good question.

814
00:24:56 --> 00:24:57
He needs to hurry back.

815
00:24:57 --> 00:25:00
In the meantime,
no emotions, no vexations.

816
00:25:00 --> 00:25:01
Spare her.

817
00:25:01 --> 00:25:03
Don&#39;t you think a specialist...

818
00:25:03 --> 00:25:05
If you want, I&#39;Il call Bridoux.

819
00:25:05 --> 00:25:07
He&#39;s 60 years old,
but he&#39;s got the best ear in Paris.

820
00:25:07 --> 00:25:09
And he&#39;s the finest gourmet!
For him a meal is a meal.

821
00:25:09 --> 00:25:10
Anyway, give her some digitalis.

822
00:25:10 --> 00:25:13
- The doctor said...
- I don&#39;t care. Close the shutters and go.

823
00:25:13 --> 00:25:16
No. That would be too easy.
Much too easy.

824
00:25:16 --> 00:25:18
Does a corpse that disappears
seem natural to you?

825
00:25:18 --> 00:25:19
Not to me.

826
00:25:19 --> 00:25:21
If he&#39;s not in the pool,
someone took him out.

827
00:25:21 --> 00:25:23
I asked Plantiveau if he opened the door
for anyone. He said no one.

828
00:25:23 --> 00:25:26
- Why would he lie?
- I didn&#39;t say he did!

829
00:25:26 --> 00:25:28
If no one went out,

830
00:25:28 --> 00:25:30
the body should be around here.

831
00:25:30 --> 00:25:31
I&#39;ve searched everywhere.

832
00:25:31 --> 00:25:33
The attic, the basements,
the garden. There&#39;s nothing.

833
00:25:33 --> 00:25:36
No fresh dirt, no footsteps. Nothing!

834
00:25:36 --> 00:25:38
My head is about to explode.

835
00:25:38 --> 00:25:39
This is just insane.

836
00:25:39 --> 00:25:40
It&#39;s been insane since the beginning.

837
00:25:40 --> 00:25:42
Actually, it&#39;s a kids&#39; game.

838
00:25:42 --> 00:25:43
You took one of your word problems

839
00:25:43 --> 00:25:44
with leaking taps,

840
00:25:44 --> 00:25:46
and tanks that fill up and empty

841
00:25:46 --> 00:25:47
and you planned a murder from it.

842
00:25:47 --> 00:25:49
In real life,
this kind of thing does not exist.

843
00:25:49 --> 00:25:51
Taps that you open
while closing another.

844
00:25:51 --> 00:25:54
Bathtubs that fill up,
and swimming pools that empty.

845
00:25:54 --> 00:25:57
That&#39;s insane.
And I was insane to listen to you.

846
00:25:57 --> 00:25:58
Come in!

847
00:25:58 --> 00:26:00
Monsieur&#39;s suit has been delivered.

848
00:26:00 --> 00:26:02
The one he&#39;s been wearing lately.

849
00:26:02 --> 00:26:05
- The Prince of Wales.
- Who brought it back?

850
00:26:05 --> 00:26:07
- The dry-cLeaner.
- What dry-cLeaner?

851
00:26:07 --> 00:26:10
I don&#39;t know.
He came on a bicycle.

852
00:26:10 --> 00:26:11
He looked at the street name

853
00:26:11 --> 00:26:13
and asked again
if it was the right address.

854
00:26:13 --> 00:26:15
A very conscientious littLe guy.
- Get to the point.

855
00:26:15 --> 00:26:18
He said it was from M. Delassalle.

856
00:26:18 --> 00:26:21
So I asked him,
&quot;Did you see M. Delassalle? Where?&quot;

857
00:26:21 --> 00:26:22
So he said, &quot;I didn&#39;t see him. &quot;

858
00:26:22 --> 00:26:24
But he asked me to bring
the suit home, urgently.

859
00:26:24 --> 00:26:26
Well, should I hang it up
in the closet?

860
00:26:26 --> 00:26:28
No. Leave it here.

861
00:26:28 --> 00:26:29
It is his suit.

862
00:26:29 --> 00:26:30
That&#39;s completely insane!

863
00:26:30 --> 00:26:31
Wait.

864
00:26:31 --> 00:26:32
Rue St. Ferdinand.

865
00:26:32 --> 00:26:34
- Good morning.
- Excuse me.

866
00:26:34 --> 00:26:37
Did you deliver a suit
this morning in St. Cloud?

867
00:26:37 --> 00:26:39
- What&#39;s the name?
- Mme. Delassalle.

868
00:26:39 --> 00:26:40
Was there a problem?

869
00:26:40 --> 00:26:44
No. We just want to know who brought
this suit to you, a Prince of Wales.

870
00:26:44 --> 00:26:46
We see so many of them!

871
00:26:46 --> 00:26:47
Yes, I do remember.

872
00:26:47 --> 00:26:49
It was a tall thin man, dark hair...

873
00:26:49 --> 00:26:51
with a bamboo cigarette holder.

874
00:26:51 --> 00:26:52
Wait, there&#39;s a check mark.

875
00:26:52 --> 00:26:55
The kid forgot something this morning.

876
00:26:55 --> 00:26:56
This was in his pocket.

877
00:26:56 --> 00:26:57
Eden Hotel.

878
00:26:57 --> 00:26:58
Room nine.

879
00:26:58 --> 00:27:01
Well, your husband seems
to be leading some life!

880
00:27:01 --> 00:27:04
I can have the kid bring
the key, if you wish.

881
00:27:04 --> 00:27:05
Do you know this hotel, madam?

882
00:27:05 --> 00:27:08
It&#39;s a residential hotel.
Very fancy.

883
00:27:08 --> 00:27:08
Come on!

884
00:27:08 --> 00:27:10
First street on the right.
Number 27.

885
00:27:10 --> 00:27:11
- I&#39;Il go.
- What if they ask you something?

886
00:27:11 --> 00:27:12
It looks like they don&#39;t
ask questions here.

887
00:27:12 --> 00:27:15
Don&#39;t go, it&#39;s a trap.
Someone wants to blackmail us.

888
00:27:15 --> 00:27:17
At Least we&#39;ll know
who we&#39;re dealing with.

889
00:27:17 --> 00:27:19
What are you doing here?

890
00:27:19 --> 00:27:22
I&#39;m looking for M. Delassalle.

891
00:27:22 --> 00:27:24
He&#39;s never here during the day.

892
00:27:24 --> 00:27:27
When does he come back?

893
00:27:27 --> 00:27:28
Who knows if he comes back at all.

894
00:27:28 --> 00:27:30
His bed is always neat.

895
00:27:30 --> 00:27:35
See, no belongings, no bags.

896
00:27:35 --> 00:27:36
Nothing.

897
00:27:36 --> 00:27:37
He&#39;s a strange customer.

898
00:27:37 --> 00:27:40
- Have you ever seen him?
- Never, neither has the night watchman.

899
00:27:40 --> 00:27:43
He must come after I Leave and
before the other guy starts his shift.

900
00:27:43 --> 00:27:45
But, why all these questions?

901
00:27:45 --> 00:27:47
He&#39;s my husband.
I am Mme. Delassalle.

902
00:27:47 --> 00:27:48
Poor lady!

903
00:27:48 --> 00:27:50
This isn&#39;t where
you should look for him.

904
00:27:50 --> 00:27:53
You can trust me.
His life is somewhere else.

905
00:27:53 --> 00:27:55
It&#39;s scary.
What&#39;s happening to us?

906
00:27:55 --> 00:27:57
I don&#39;t know.
No one knows.

907
00:27:57 --> 00:27:58
It doesn&#39;t make any sense.

908
00:27:58 --> 00:28:00
80,000 francs. Shower repair.

909
00:28:00 --> 00:28:01
It&#39;s from two years ago.

910
00:28:01 --> 00:28:03
This time, the marshal
could come for us.

911
00:28:03 --> 00:28:06
Pay them half.
It&#39;s already something.

912
00:28:06 --> 00:28:08
He was really dead, wasn&#39;t he?

913
00:28:08 --> 00:28:10
You should know.

914
00:28:10 --> 00:28:11
Why do you say that?

915
00:28:11 --> 00:28:12
Because...

916
00:28:12 --> 00:28:14
you killed him.
- Me?

917
00:28:14 --> 00:28:17
Look, you&#39;re the one
who planned the whole thing.

918
00:28:17 --> 00:28:19
I&#39;m sorry, we planned it...

919
00:28:19 --> 00:28:20
and you made the phone call.

920
00:28:20 --> 00:28:23
You bought the tablecloth to wrap him,
the drug to put him to sleep.

921
00:28:23 --> 00:28:25
I could never have done that.
- You managed to make him drink.

922
00:28:25 --> 00:28:28
You liar! I didn&#39;t want to!
You know I didn&#39;t want to!

923
00:28:28 --> 00:28:30
You could&#39;ve let him sleep his whiskey off
instead of carrying him to the tub.

924
00:28:30 --> 00:28:33
Who filled the tub?
Who pushed him underwater?

925
00:28:33 --> 00:28:35
And who brought the statue
from the mantel?

926
00:28:35 --> 00:28:36
It&#39;s too easy.

927
00:28:36 --> 00:28:37
You&#39;ll see who the court
will hold responsibLe.

928
00:28:37 --> 00:28:39
You&#39;ll see.
- The court doesn&#39;t scare me.

929
00:28:39 --> 00:28:40
We&#39;ll get what we deserve.

930
00:28:40 --> 00:28:43
Well, suit yourself!
Go to the police! Go!

931
00:28:43 --> 00:28:46
- I already thought of that.
- To pin the whole thing on me.

932
00:28:46 --> 00:28:47
I won&#39;t let that happen.

933
00:28:47 --> 00:28:49
I&#39;ll call the cops first!

934
00:28:49 --> 00:28:50
Go ahead.

935
00:28:50 --> 00:28:52
But I&#39;m warning you,
I&#39;ll tell them everything.

936
00:28:52 --> 00:28:53
I have nothing to hide.

937
00:28:53 --> 00:28:55
You were jealous, and killed him.

938
00:28:55 --> 00:28:57
And I helped you
because I felt pity for you.

939
00:28:57 --> 00:28:58
You were the jealous one

940
00:28:58 --> 00:29:00
because it was over
between you two.

941
00:29:00 --> 00:29:02
You killed him,
and you know it!

942
00:29:02 --> 00:29:03
Well,

943
00:29:03 --> 00:29:05
what are you waiting for?

944
00:29:05 --> 00:29:06
- Do you have my newspapers?
- Yes.

945
00:29:06 --> 00:29:08
Be careful not to get dirty.
The ink is still wet.

946
00:29:08 --> 00:29:09
Christina!

947
00:29:09 --> 00:29:10
I have nothing to say to you.

948
00:29:10 --> 00:29:12
- Where are you going?
- To confession. Do you mind?

949
00:29:12 --> 00:29:14
Do you think you&#39;Il get absolution
if you don&#39;t turn yourself in?

950
00:29:14 --> 00:29:15
So I&#39;Il turn myself in.

951
00:29:15 --> 00:29:18
- What about me?
- I can&#39;t keep this up.

952
00:29:18 --> 00:29:20
Come on, don&#39;t worry.
It&#39;s all over.

953
00:29:20 --> 00:29:21
They found the body.

954
00:29:21 --> 00:29:23
Here. Read this.

955
00:29:23 --> 00:29:24
A NAKED CORPSE IN THE SEINE

956
00:29:24 --> 00:29:26
- Why in the Seine?
- Good question.

957
00:29:26 --> 00:29:27
What counts is that they found him.

958
00:29:27 --> 00:29:28
Everything fits.

959
00:29:28 --> 00:29:31
The description, the Bois de Boulogne
bridge which is very close,

960
00:29:31 --> 00:29:32
a three-day-old death.

961
00:29:32 --> 00:29:33
Our alibi is holding up.

962
00:29:33 --> 00:29:34
They brought him to the morgue.

963
00:29:34 --> 00:29:35
Excuse me, sir.

964
00:29:35 --> 00:29:38
I read this,
and I think it&#39;s my husband.

965
00:29:38 --> 00:29:39
Identity card.

966
00:29:39 --> 00:29:41
Could you describe
M. Delassalle?

967
00:29:41 --> 00:29:45
Dark hair, thin, dark eyes.

968
00:29:45 --> 00:29:48
All this has already been written
in the paper. It&#39;s too easy.

969
00:29:48 --> 00:29:49
Give me specific details.

970
00:29:49 --> 00:29:50
What do you want to know?

971
00:29:50 --> 00:29:52
I don&#39;t know. You tell me.

972
00:29:52 --> 00:29:54
If you tell me he had
an appendectomy, that&#39;s a detail.

973
00:29:54 --> 00:29:55
He&#39;s had the operation.

974
00:29:55 --> 00:29:58
- Okay, dental. How many teeth?
- All of them, I think.

975
00:29:58 --> 00:29:59
Any fillings?

976
00:29:59 --> 00:30:02
- Maybe one or two.
- One or two?

977
00:30:02 --> 00:30:03
Two.

978
00:30:03 --> 00:30:05
- Beauty marks?
- Yes.

979
00:30:05 --> 00:30:06
- Where?
- On his shoulder.

980
00:30:06 --> 00:30:08
Why didn&#39;t you tell me
he had a bracelet?

981
00:30:08 --> 00:30:11
- He never had one.
- Really?

982
00:30:11 --> 00:30:12
What do you see on his right thigh?

983
00:30:12 --> 00:30:13
Nothing.

984
00:30:13 --> 00:30:15
Try to think, above the knee.

985
00:30:15 --> 00:30:19
I can&#39;t see anything.
So it must be a mistake.

986
00:30:19 --> 00:30:21
Bring up number 4702.

987
00:30:21 --> 00:30:24
You were right. No bracelet
and nothing above the knee.

988
00:30:24 --> 00:30:26
PLease, follow me
to the identification room.

989
00:30:26 --> 00:30:28
- It&#39;s not him.
- Are you sure?

990
00:30:28 --> 00:30:29
Yes.

991
00:30:29 --> 00:30:31
I&#39;m sorry, madame.
This rarely happens.

992
00:30:31 --> 00:30:31
Taxi!

993
00:30:31 --> 00:30:33
- To St. Cloud!
- St. Cloud? Now?

994
00:30:33 --> 00:30:34
Are you out of your mind?

995
00:30:34 --> 00:30:36
I don&#39;t want to have supper
on a merry-go-round!

996
00:30:36 --> 00:30:37
Excuse me.

997
00:30:37 --> 00:30:38
Here we go!

998
00:30:38 --> 00:30:39
Aren&#39;t you feeling well, lady?

999
00:30:39 --> 00:30:40
There&#39;s a bit of a shock afterward.

1000
00:30:40 --> 00:30:41
It takes the legs out from under you.

1001
00:30:41 --> 00:30:42
Come, get in.

1002
00:30:42 --> 00:30:45
You should feel better
since it&#39;s not him.

1003
00:30:45 --> 00:30:46
Drive.

1004
00:30:46 --> 00:30:47
Do you feel better?

1005
00:30:47 --> 00:30:48
Let me introduce myself.

1006
00:30:48 --> 00:30:50
Alfred Fichet,
retired police commissioner.

1007
00:30:50 --> 00:30:52
But I didn&#39;t ask the police
for anything!

1008
00:30:52 --> 00:30:55
Didn&#39;t you inform
the police commissioner?

1009
00:30:55 --> 00:30:59
It was a mistake.
That&#39;s what they are for.

1010
00:30:59 --> 00:31:02
I didn&#39;t think about it.
I&#39;ll do it.

1011
00:31:02 --> 00:31:06
I&#39;Il do it myself.
Just out of principle.

1012
00:31:06 --> 00:31:09
One should not expect too much
from the regular police.

1013
00:31:09 --> 00:31:11
The police are too busy.

1014
00:31:11 --> 00:31:15
No. If you&#39;d like, we are both
going to find your husband.

1015
00:31:15 --> 00:31:18
40 years on the job,
it&#39;s not to be ignored.

1016
00:31:18 --> 00:31:19
Now, I have plenty of time.

1017
00:31:19 --> 00:31:22
- No. Really, it&#39;s not necessary.
- What do you risk?

1018
00:31:22 --> 00:31:24
If I don&#39;t find anything,
you won&#39;t pay me anything.

1019
00:31:24 --> 00:31:27
And if I do find something,
well, you&#39;ll judge for yourself.

1020
00:31:27 --> 00:31:28
You can&#39;t ask for a better deal.

1021
00:31:28 --> 00:31:31
Let&#39;s see.
You&#39;ve been married for how long?

1022
00:31:31 --> 00:31:32
Eight years.

1023
00:31:32 --> 00:31:33
I don&#39;t understand what -

1024
00:31:33 --> 00:31:35
Leave it to me. I&#39;m used to this.

1025
00:31:35 --> 00:31:37
We said, eight years.

1026
00:31:37 --> 00:31:38
It&#39;s boiling, mademoiselle.

1027
00:31:38 --> 00:31:40
- How long do you think it can boil?
- Five minutes.

1028
00:31:40 --> 00:31:42
How do I know?
He had his own keys.

1029
00:31:42 --> 00:31:45
He would go in, and out.
He was the boss.

1030
00:31:45 --> 00:31:46
And it was vacation anyway.

1031
00:31:46 --> 00:31:51
- Was he a little low-spirited?
- It was not his styLe.

1032
00:31:51 --> 00:31:53
It was more in his nature
to complicate his life.

1033
00:31:53 --> 00:31:55
- Maybe he was feeling sick.
- Are you joking?

1034
00:31:55 --> 00:31:57
The man was very strong.

1035
00:31:57 --> 00:31:59
When he was younger,
he was a tennis champion.

1036
00:31:59 --> 00:32:02
Did he get a telegram on Sunday?

1037
00:32:02 --> 00:32:03
A phone call?

1038
00:32:03 --> 00:32:05
Sometimes,
people leave after a phone call.

1039
00:32:05 --> 00:32:09
I can&#39;t tell you, sir. On Sunday,
I took my wife to the park.

1040
00:32:09 --> 00:32:11
When the school is closed,
we seize the opportunity.

1041
00:32:11 --> 00:32:13
There could have been an accident.

1042
00:32:13 --> 00:32:17
How does M. Delassalle drive?
Fast, very fast?

1043
00:32:17 --> 00:32:19
He didn&#39;t have the car.
The ladies took it to Niort.

1044
00:32:19 --> 00:32:20
That&#39;s right.

1045
00:32:20 --> 00:32:22
Don&#39;t you think
he could&#39;ve drowned?

1046
00:32:22 --> 00:32:24
Drowned?

1047
00:32:24 --> 00:32:25
He was a real fish.

1048
00:32:25 --> 00:32:27
This man could swim.

1049
00:32:27 --> 00:32:29
I see.

1050
00:32:29 --> 00:32:30
Well, thank you.

1051
00:32:30 --> 00:32:34
The Alps separate Italy
from France in the southeast.

1052
00:32:34 --> 00:32:37
The Alps are very high mountains.

1053
00:32:37 --> 00:32:41
There is Mont-Blanc,
the highest mountain in Europe.

1054
00:32:41 --> 00:32:43
In the east, there is the Jura...

1055
00:32:43 --> 00:32:45
That is quite reassuring.

1056
00:32:45 --> 00:32:47
I think you worried
a little bit too early.

1057
00:32:47 --> 00:32:49
On Saturday,
your husband was still here.

1058
00:32:49 --> 00:32:50
It&#39;s only been five days,

1059
00:32:50 --> 00:32:52
and you go look for him
at the morgue.

1060
00:32:52 --> 00:32:54
The article in the paper upset me.

1061
00:32:54 --> 00:32:57
A 30-year-old man,
one meter seventy...

1062
00:32:57 --> 00:33:02
Dear madame, there are 100,000 men
in Paris who fit this description.

1063
00:33:02 --> 00:33:04
And that&#39;s not including the tourists.

1064
00:33:04 --> 00:33:08
I guess you were thinking of suicide.

1065
00:33:08 --> 00:33:10
Yes. Well, I don&#39;t know.

1066
00:33:10 --> 00:33:13
To commit suicide in the Seine,
one doesn&#39;t need to undress.

1067
00:33:13 --> 00:33:18
My hypothesis is much less tragic.

1068
00:33:18 --> 00:33:20
When I say hypothesis, I mean...

1069
00:33:20 --> 00:33:21
A woman!

1070
00:33:21 --> 00:33:23
Of course, you&#39;re right.

1071
00:33:23 --> 00:33:25
I was stupid to worry
and to bother you.

1072
00:33:25 --> 00:33:26
Take this.
- No, no.

1073
00:33:26 --> 00:33:27
I won&#39;t steal your money.

1074
00:33:27 --> 00:33:28
Remember our agreement.

1075
00:33:28 --> 00:33:30
If I don&#39;t find anything,
you don&#39;t owe me anything.

1076
00:33:30 --> 00:33:32
But, don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll find him.

1077
00:33:32 --> 00:33:34
I haven&#39;t been
in a school for a long time.

1078
00:33:34 --> 00:33:36
In my days, it was the local school.
Charonne.

1079
00:33:36 --> 00:33:37
Less fancy. Much Less fancy.

1080
00:33:37 --> 00:33:39
Ah, it was really different.

1081
00:33:39 --> 00:33:41
You emptied the pool.

1082
00:33:41 --> 00:33:43
You thought about this too.

1083
00:33:43 --> 00:33:46
- Not at all!
- Why not at all?

1084
00:33:46 --> 00:33:49
I dropped my keys in the pool.
So in order to get them back -

1085
00:33:49 --> 00:33:51
- When was that?
- Yesterday morning.

1086
00:33:51 --> 00:33:53
Commissioner Fichet.

1087
00:33:53 --> 00:33:56
Mlle. Horner,
our most devoted associate.

1088
00:33:56 --> 00:33:57
Delighted, miss.

1089
00:33:57 --> 00:34:00
It was pure coincidence.

1090
00:34:00 --> 00:34:04
Really, the keys in the pool,
the husband in the morgue.

1091
00:34:04 --> 00:34:07
You dream too much
about water in this house!

1092
00:34:07 --> 00:34:11
May I look at his mail?
- You&#39;ll never find him.

1093
00:34:11 --> 00:34:13
How do you know anyway?

1094
00:34:13 --> 00:34:17
- I see he has a typewriter.
- Yes, for the accounts.

1095
00:34:17 --> 00:34:20
You&#39;re right. M. Delassalle
is not a literary man.

1096
00:34:20 --> 00:34:22
Perhaps he doesn&#39;t trust his spelling.

1097
00:34:22 --> 00:34:23
May I?

1098
00:34:23 --> 00:34:26
I really can&#39;t imagine him
being suicidal.

1099
00:34:26 --> 00:34:28
Okay, Let&#39;s do this methodically.

1100
00:34:28 --> 00:34:29
So we&#39;re saying...

1101
00:34:29 --> 00:34:31
Delassalle, Michel,

1102
00:34:31 --> 00:34:32
34 years old.

1103
00:34:32 --> 00:34:33
- Height.
- One meter seventy.

1104
00:34:33 --> 00:34:35
Yes, I know.

1105
00:34:35 --> 00:34:37
Dark hair.

1106
00:34:37 --> 00:34:38
Eyes?

1107
00:34:38 --> 00:34:40
Brown.

1108
00:34:40 --> 00:34:41
Nose...

1109
00:34:41 --> 00:34:42
average.

1110
00:34:42 --> 00:34:43
Ears: folded in.

1111
00:34:43 --> 00:34:46
How to find someone
with this description?

1112
00:34:46 --> 00:34:47
Well, we&#39;ll find him.

1113
00:34:47 --> 00:34:49
These detectives are really smart.

1114
00:34:49 --> 00:34:51
What was he wearing
the day he disappeared?

1115
00:34:51 --> 00:34:52
We were away that day, sir.

1116
00:34:52 --> 00:34:55
Of course! How stupid of me.

1117
00:34:55 --> 00:34:57
Here&#39;s what we&#39;ll do.

1118
00:34:57 --> 00:34:59
We&#39;ll look into his wardrobe

1119
00:34:59 --> 00:35:00
and we&#39;ll see what is missing.

1120
00:35:00 --> 00:35:03
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1121
00:35:03 --> 00:35:04
Six.

1122
00:35:04 --> 00:35:06
What did the 7th pair look like?

1123
00:35:06 --> 00:35:07
Brown suede.

1124
00:35:07 --> 00:35:08
Tie?

1125
00:35:08 --> 00:35:10
Red, with a white stripe.

1126
00:35:10 --> 00:35:13
You&#39;re sharp-eyed.
He&#39;s got at Least 25 ties.

1127
00:35:13 --> 00:35:14
So, suit?

1128
00:35:14 --> 00:35:15
Suit!

1129
00:35:15 --> 00:35:18
So you know his ties
better than his suits.

1130
00:35:18 --> 00:35:21
I think it&#39;s a gray Prince of Wales.

1131
00:35:21 --> 00:35:23
Prince of Wales, gray.

1132
00:35:23 --> 00:35:24
Like this one?

1133
00:35:24 --> 00:35:25
Yes.

1134
00:35:25 --> 00:35:26
Just a moment.

1135
00:35:26 --> 00:35:27
Is something wrong?

1136
00:35:27 --> 00:35:29
Mme. Delassalle has a heart condition.
We must spare her.

1137
00:35:29 --> 00:35:32
You should have told me.
It&#39;s not that urgent.

1138
00:35:32 --> 00:35:34
I&#39;ve got enough
to keep myself busy.

1139
00:35:34 --> 00:35:35
Take care of yourself.

1140
00:35:35 --> 00:35:37
I&#39;ll go visit downtown.

1141
00:35:37 --> 00:35:39
I still have friends there.

1142
00:35:39 --> 00:35:42
And don&#39;t worry. I&#39;Il be back.

1143
00:35:42 --> 00:35:44
Plantiveau said he&#39;s a detective.

1144
00:35:44 --> 00:35:47
A private one.
Everybody to the firing squad!

1145
00:35:47 --> 00:35:48
Heberge.

1146
00:35:48 --> 00:35:52
If you&#39;re done with your work,
I&#39;ll find something else for you to do.

1147
00:35:52 --> 00:35:54
First, Latin.

1148
00:35:54 --> 00:35:57
When the MiddLe Ages lost everything,
they still knew Latin.

1149
00:35:57 --> 00:36:01
The Church understood it.
The last village priest knew Latin.

1150
00:36:01 --> 00:36:04
I don&#39;t think that
the average priest is that clever.

1151
00:36:04 --> 00:36:06
It&#39;s not his job.

1152
00:36:06 --> 00:36:08
In spite of that, Let me tell you...

1153
00:36:08 --> 00:36:09
Excuse me.

1154
00:36:09 --> 00:36:11
M. Moinet,
what are you doing here?

1155
00:36:11 --> 00:36:12
Aren&#39;t you supposed to be studying?

1156
00:36:12 --> 00:36:14
- The principal punished me.
- Who?

1157
00:36:14 --> 00:36:17
- The principal.
- What are you talking about?

1158
00:36:17 --> 00:36:20
- It&#39;s the truth.
- What did you do?

1159
00:36:20 --> 00:36:22
I broke a window.

1160
00:36:22 --> 00:36:25
- Maybe the principal came back.
- Don&#39;t be silly.

1161
00:36:25 --> 00:36:27
I&#39;ve had enough of your stories!

1162
00:36:27 --> 00:36:28
Tell me the truth, now.

1163
00:36:28 --> 00:36:30
Who punished you?
- The principal.

1164
00:36:30 --> 00:36:32
- That&#39;s for lying!
- I&#39;m not Iying.

1165
00:36:32 --> 00:36:34
Let me handle this.
You&#39;re scaring him.

1166
00:36:34 --> 00:36:37
Listen, Moinet.
Tell me your story again.

1167
00:36:37 --> 00:36:39
If you tell everything,
I&#39;ll lift your punishment.

1168
00:36:39 --> 00:36:40
Yes, madame.

1169
00:36:40 --> 00:36:42
- How did you break the window?
- With my slingshot.

1170
00:36:42 --> 00:36:43
Then what happened?

1171
00:36:43 --> 00:36:46
The principal opened the door
and told me to go to bed right away...

1172
00:36:46 --> 00:36:48
without picking up the dead leaves.

1173
00:36:48 --> 00:36:50
It can&#39;t be him.
It&#39;s impossible.

1174
00:36:50 --> 00:36:52
You know he&#39;s not here.

1175
00:36:52 --> 00:36:54
You forget that this kid
is a pathological liar.

1176
00:36:54 --> 00:36:57
Last week, he told his friends
he had a fight with a lion at the fair.

1177
00:36:57 --> 00:36:58
With a lion!

1178
00:36:58 --> 00:36:59
He&#39;s a mythomaniac.

1179
00:36:59 --> 00:37:01
I just asked the other kids.
Nobody saw the principal.

1180
00:37:01 --> 00:37:04
However, there really is
a broken window in the corridor.

1181
00:37:04 --> 00:37:06
I doubt he punished himself
and made up this story.

1182
00:37:06 --> 00:37:10
Who knows? Obviously, this is a case
of self-induced hallucination.

1183
00:37:10 --> 00:37:11
The kid broke a window

1184
00:37:11 --> 00:37:14
and in his subconscious,
he generated the idea of punishment

1185
00:37:14 --> 00:37:16
to match the principal&#39;s.

1186
00:37:16 --> 00:37:17
Darkness did the rest.

1187
00:37:17 --> 00:37:18
Do you really think so?

1188
00:37:18 --> 00:37:21
The kid saw himself being punished
in the literal sense of the word.

1189
00:37:21 --> 00:37:23
I think he&#39;s messing with us

1190
00:37:23 --> 00:37:25
in the literal sense of the word.

1191
00:37:25 --> 00:37:28
- Give me your slingshot.
- The principal took it.

1192
00:37:28 --> 00:37:32
Young Moinet, don&#39;t you think
you&#39;re going a little too far?

1193
00:37:32 --> 00:37:35
I feel tired.
I&#39;m going to sleep.

1194
00:37:35 --> 00:37:37
But of course, madame.

1195
00:37:37 --> 00:37:38
- Good night.
- Good night.

1196
00:37:38 --> 00:37:41
Go get some rest.
We&#39;ll handle this matter.

1197
00:37:41 --> 00:37:42
M. Moinet.

1198
00:37:42 --> 00:37:44
We&#39;ve been patient enough.

1199
00:37:44 --> 00:37:47
If you want to be stubborn,
go straight to the corner.

1200
00:37:47 --> 00:37:50
You&#39;ll get out
only after you tell the truth.

1201
00:37:50 --> 00:37:53
We&#39;ll see who gets tired first.

1202
00:37:53 --> 00:37:54
I saw him.

1203
00:37:54 --> 00:37:55
I know I saw him.

1204
00:37:55 --> 00:37:56
This slingshot...

1205
00:37:56 --> 00:37:58
Moinet couldn&#39;t have brought it here.

1206
00:37:58 --> 00:37:59
Certainly not.

1207
00:37:59 --> 00:38:00
Who was it?

1208
00:38:00 --> 00:38:02
I don&#39;t know.
It could be anyone.

1209
00:38:02 --> 00:38:05
- By coincidence?
- Yes, by coincidence.

1210
00:38:05 --> 00:38:08
And Fichet was at the morgue
by coincidence.

1211
00:38:08 --> 00:38:12
And the suit, and the hotel,
and now the students.

1212
00:38:12 --> 00:38:14
Is it a coincidence that
it&#39;s getting closer each time?

1213
00:38:14 --> 00:38:17
Please, calm down.
My nerves aren&#39;t made of steel either.

1214
00:38:17 --> 00:38:20
It&#39;s all getting clear.
There are no miracLes in life.

1215
00:38:20 --> 00:38:21
Unfortunately.

1216
00:38:21 --> 00:38:23
Each time I close my eyes...

1217
00:38:23 --> 00:38:24
it seems that I&#39;m going to see him.

1218
00:38:24 --> 00:38:25
Stop talking!

1219
00:38:25 --> 00:38:27
He must not be a pretty sight.

1220
00:38:27 --> 00:38:30
Yes, if he&#39;s dead.

1221
00:38:30 --> 00:38:33
Listen, Christina.
I&#39;ve seen dead people in my life.

1222
00:38:33 --> 00:38:35
Believe me, Michel is dead.
Really dead.

1223
00:38:35 --> 00:38:36
Lie down and try not
to think of anything.

1224
00:38:36 --> 00:38:38
With all I have on my mind...

1225
00:38:38 --> 00:38:40
If you don&#39;t get any sleep,
you won&#39;t last three days.

1226
00:38:40 --> 00:38:41
Dr. Loisy is very worried.

1227
00:38:41 --> 00:38:43
He asked Prof. Bridoux
to come tomorrow.

1228
00:38:43 --> 00:38:44
There you are.

1229
00:38:44 --> 00:38:47
What&#39;s the point?
I&#39;m finished now.

1230
00:38:47 --> 00:38:49
- Stop that.
- Give me back my marbLes.

1231
00:38:49 --> 00:38:50
- I don&#39;t have them.
- You took them, I know.

1232
00:38:50 --> 00:38:51
- I&#39;m going to break your neck!
- Leave me alone!

1233
00:38:51 --> 00:38:52
- Give him back his marbLes.
- Leave me alone.

1234
00:38:52 --> 00:38:53
I haven&#39;t got them. Stop it!

1235
00:38:53 --> 00:38:55
Come on, come on!

1236
00:38:55 --> 00:38:57
You can fight if you want,
but don&#39;t scream.

1237
00:38:57 --> 00:38:59
Mme. Delassalle is very sick.

1238
00:38:59 --> 00:39:00
Go on.

1239
00:39:00 --> 00:39:01
Moinet,

1240
00:39:01 --> 00:39:03
your punishment is lifted...

1241
00:39:03 --> 00:39:04
for now.

1242
00:39:04 --> 00:39:06
Go for your picture.
- Thank you, sir.

1243
00:39:06 --> 00:39:09
A picture without the principals
is not a school picture.

1244
00:39:09 --> 00:39:11
We&#39;ll do better next year.
Come on, children.

1245
00:39:11 --> 00:39:12
Should we put the bench
in front of the window?

1246
00:39:12 --> 00:39:14
- Why not in front of the door?
- What about the car?

1247
00:39:14 --> 00:39:17
There is a professor
from the university upstairs.

1248
00:39:17 --> 00:39:19
I must go. It&#39;s part of the job.

1249
00:39:19 --> 00:39:22
I&#39;ll show the professor out,
and I&#39;ll call you.

1250
00:39:22 --> 00:39:24
You overdid it.

1251
00:39:24 --> 00:39:27
You should really have a good rest.

1252
00:39:27 --> 00:39:30
- Will I be able to get up?
- We&#39;ll talk about this later.

1253
00:39:30 --> 00:39:31
You will be fine here.

1254
00:39:31 --> 00:39:34
Could I go out into the yard?
Is that too much for me?

1255
00:39:34 --> 00:39:35
Until the doctors say so,

1256
00:39:35 --> 00:39:37
moving about is strictly forbidden.

1257
00:39:37 --> 00:39:38
Get in position.

1258
00:39:38 --> 00:39:40
Look at my hand.
Don&#39;t move.

1259
00:39:40 --> 00:39:42
One, two. Thank you.

1260
00:39:42 --> 00:39:43
One minute.
I&#39;ll take another one.

1261
00:39:43 --> 00:39:44
You can go through.

1262
00:39:44 --> 00:39:46
Taking her to my clinic
would have been too expensive.

1263
00:39:46 --> 00:39:47
Between you and me,
there are no heirs.

1264
00:39:47 --> 00:39:50
I know. But people dying in the clinic,
the hearse in front of the door,

1265
00:39:50 --> 00:39:51
I don&#39;t like that.

1266
00:39:51 --> 00:39:52
Neither do the patients.

1267
00:39:52 --> 00:39:54
Let me see!

1268
00:39:54 --> 00:39:57
Be careful, kids.
It&#39;s still wet.

1269
00:39:57 --> 00:39:59
Great. Nobody moved.

1270
00:39:59 --> 00:40:01
Please. I came out fine.

1271
00:40:01 --> 00:40:03
This is the first time
I&#39;ve had the position of honor.

1272
00:40:03 --> 00:40:06
When I show the picture,
they&#39;Il think I&#39;m the principal.

1273
00:40:06 --> 00:40:08
- What&#39;s that behind the window?
- Looks like the boss.

1274
00:40:08 --> 00:40:10
- You&#39;re nuts!
- Wait! Let me put my monocle on.

1275
00:40:10 --> 00:40:12
- Let me see, mademoiselle!
- Leave me alone!

1276
00:40:12 --> 00:40:13
I didn&#39;t see anything.

1277
00:40:13 --> 00:40:16
You didn&#39;t miss anything.
It&#39;s some kind of shot-silk effect.

1278
00:40:16 --> 00:40:18
The refLection of a cloud
or some spot on the window...

1279
00:40:18 --> 00:40:19
that reminds us of
the principal&#39;s features.

1280
00:40:19 --> 00:40:20
Maybe it&#39;s him.

1281
00:40:20 --> 00:40:22
He didn&#39;t want to interrupt us

1282
00:40:22 --> 00:40:25
or this was just an innocent joke.

1283
00:40:25 --> 00:40:27
I can&#39;t see Delassalle
playing hide-and-seek.

1284
00:40:27 --> 00:40:30
But you were facing us.
Didn&#39;t you see anything?

1285
00:40:30 --> 00:40:32
I was looking at the group,
being sure to see everybody.

1286
00:40:32 --> 00:40:33
Let&#39;s settle this once and for all.

1287
00:40:33 --> 00:40:34
Moinet.

1288
00:40:34 --> 00:40:37
You&#39;re such a great observer.
Did you see the principal?

1289
00:40:37 --> 00:40:40
No thanks. I&#39;ve had enough
with six hours in the corner.

1290
00:40:40 --> 00:40:42
The case is closed.
There wasn&#39;t anyone.

1291
00:40:42 --> 00:40:43
Thankfully. Really.

1292
00:40:43 --> 00:40:45
To hear that people come and go
without my knowing it

1293
00:40:45 --> 00:40:46
is offensive for a watchman.

1294
00:40:46 --> 00:40:48
- I&#39;m afraid.
- Me too.

1295
00:40:48 --> 00:40:49
We must go now.

1296
00:40:49 --> 00:40:50
Here, get dressed!

1297
00:40:50 --> 00:40:52
The doctors forbid me to move.

1298
00:40:52 --> 00:40:55
Where would we go, anyway?

1299
00:40:55 --> 00:40:56
To my place.

1300
00:40:56 --> 00:40:57
In Niort?

1301
00:40:57 --> 00:40:58
Don&#39;t you think
he might be there as well?

1302
00:40:58 --> 00:41:00
He&#39;s more certainly there,
than anywhere else.

1303
00:41:00 --> 00:41:02
So we&#39;ll travel.
We&#39;ll go anywhere.

1304
00:41:02 --> 00:41:05
It&#39;s not possible.
There&#39;s no point.

1305
00:41:05 --> 00:41:08
- I can&#39;t stay here anymore.
- So just go.

1306
00:41:08 --> 00:41:10
What about you?
I can&#39;t leave you here.

1307
00:41:10 --> 00:41:11
Yes. You&#39;ll see.

1308
00:41:11 --> 00:41:13
You&#39;ll get used to managing without me.

1309
00:41:13 --> 00:41:15
Besides, I don&#39;t want
to see you anymore.

1310
00:41:15 --> 00:41:17
For all that&#39;s about to happen...

1311
00:41:17 --> 00:41:19
for all that will eventually happen...

1312
00:41:19 --> 00:41:20
I&#39;d rather be on my own.

1313
00:41:20 --> 00:41:21
No, no, please!

1314
00:41:21 --> 00:41:22
You hate me, don&#39;t you?

1315
00:41:22 --> 00:41:23
Not at all.

1316
00:41:23 --> 00:41:25
Where is the littLe red
suitcase I gave you?

1317
00:41:25 --> 00:41:28
On the floor, by the closet.

1318
00:41:28 --> 00:41:31
So you really think it&#39;s time
for us to separate?

1319
00:41:31 --> 00:41:33
Yes, it&#39;ll be better that way.

1320
00:41:33 --> 00:41:35
I hope you succeed and forget.

1321
00:41:35 --> 00:41:36
Farewell, Christina.

1322
00:41:36 --> 00:41:39
&quot;Tremble, she told me,
a girI worthy of me.

1323
00:41:39 --> 00:41:42
The cruel God of the Jews
is stronger than you.

1324
00:41:42 --> 00:41:44
I pity you for falling
in his fearsome hands. &quot;

1325
00:41:44 --> 00:41:46
What are you doing here?

1326
00:41:46 --> 00:41:47
I was just looking at you.

1327
00:41:47 --> 00:41:50
I came to make my report.
That&#39;s what I&#39;m paid for.

1328
00:41:50 --> 00:41:53
But you were sleeping so deeply...

1329
00:41:53 --> 00:41:54
Leave me alone.

1330
00:41:54 --> 00:41:56
I&#39;m sick, very sick.

1331
00:41:56 --> 00:41:58
You&#39;ll feel better very soon.

1332
00:41:58 --> 00:42:00
Everything is fine.

1333
00:42:00 --> 00:42:04
Can&#39;t you have some pity for me
and Let me croak in peace?

1334
00:42:04 --> 00:42:05
Do you think I&#39;m not dying
fast enough?

1335
00:42:05 --> 00:42:07
What&#39;s the matter with you?

1336
00:42:07 --> 00:42:09
It&#39;s not the time to die.

1337
00:42:09 --> 00:42:11
I found him.

1338
00:42:11 --> 00:42:12
He&#39;ll be here very shortly.

1339
00:42:12 --> 00:42:14
It&#39;s wrong, and you know it.

1340
00:42:14 --> 00:42:16
- You know he can&#39;t come back.
- Why?

1341
00:42:16 --> 00:42:17
Because I killed him.

1342
00:42:17 --> 00:42:18
This afternoon?

1343
00:42:18 --> 00:42:20
Five days ago.

1344
00:42:20 --> 00:42:21
Five...

1345
00:42:21 --> 00:42:23
So we mustn&#39;t be talking
about the same one.

1346
00:42:23 --> 00:42:24
Five days ago in Niort.

1347
00:42:24 --> 00:42:25
And you went to the morgue?

1348
00:42:25 --> 00:42:26
His body disappeared.

1349
00:42:26 --> 00:42:28
- From Niort?
- No, from here!

1350
00:42:28 --> 00:42:30
We brought him back in the truck

1351
00:42:30 --> 00:42:31
in a wicker trunk.

1352
00:42:31 --> 00:42:33
When we got here,
we threw him in the swimming pool.

1353
00:42:33 --> 00:42:34
Yes, yes.

1354
00:42:34 --> 00:42:36
But you weren&#39;t alone in Niort.

1355
00:42:36 --> 00:42:38
- You were with mademoiselle...
- Horner.

1356
00:42:38 --> 00:42:40
Horner, yes.

1357
00:42:40 --> 00:42:42
And didn&#39;t she notice anything?

1358
00:42:42 --> 00:42:44
She was his mistress.

1359
00:42:44 --> 00:42:45
She helped me.

1360
00:42:45 --> 00:42:47
I see.

1361
00:42:47 --> 00:42:49
She was his mistress
and she helped you.

1362
00:42:49 --> 00:42:50
Well...

1363
00:42:50 --> 00:42:52
I wouldn&#39;t mind hearing
what she&#39;s got to say.

1364
00:42:52 --> 00:42:54
She got scared, and she left.

1365
00:42:54 --> 00:42:55
I kind of figured that.

1366
00:42:55 --> 00:42:57
It won&#39;t work. It&#39;s Michel&#39;s.

1367
00:42:57 --> 00:42:59
It was underwater a whole day.

1368
00:42:59 --> 00:43:00
Well, well...

1369
00:43:00 --> 00:43:01
Aren&#39;t you charging me?

1370
00:43:01 --> 00:43:05
You should stop charging your nerves.

1371
00:43:05 --> 00:43:07
You need a strong sedative.

1372
00:43:07 --> 00:43:08
Good night.

1373
00:43:08 --> 00:43:09
Let me turn the light off.

1374
00:43:09 --> 00:43:11
Tomorrow morning,
you&#39;Il wake up acquitted.

1375
00:43:11 --> 00:43:13
He&#39;s disappeared. She&#39;s cracked up.

1376
00:43:13 --> 00:43:15
On top of that, Nicole runs away.

1377
00:43:15 --> 00:43:17
What do you think it means?
- Better sign up for unemployment.

1378
00:43:17 --> 00:43:18
I&#39;m afraid so.

1379
00:43:18 --> 00:43:19
Here&#39;s the cop.

1380
00:43:19 --> 00:43:21
I found it under the diving board.

1381
00:43:21 --> 00:43:24
- Isn&#39;t there a wicker trunk around here?
- Yes, sir.

1382
00:43:24 --> 00:43:25
Above the garage.

1383
00:43:25 --> 00:43:26
Above the garage?

1384
00:43:26 --> 00:43:27
Well, let&#39;s go.

1385
00:43:27 --> 00:43:28
It&#39;s starting to stink.

1386
00:43:28 --> 00:43:31
You wonder if anything
happened to Delassalle.

1387
00:43:31 --> 00:43:32
You&#39;re a witness
that I didn&#39;t know anything.

1388
00:43:32 --> 00:43:34
Me either, dear colleague.

1389
00:43:34 --> 00:43:35
Right. Let him manage alone.

1390
00:43:35 --> 00:43:38
- I don&#39;t know why, but...
- You think we screwed up.

1391
00:43:38 --> 00:43:39
Me too.

1392
00:43:39 --> 00:43:40
M. Pacard.

1393
00:43:40 --> 00:43:41
Moinet.

1394
00:43:41 --> 00:43:43
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

1395
00:43:43 --> 00:43:44
Who&#39;s there?

1396
00:43:44 --> 00:43:45
Is it over?

1397
00:43:45 --> 00:43:46
She was tough.

1398
00:43:46 --> 00:43:47
The bitch.

1399
00:43:47 --> 00:43:49
She used to say that
she had a weak heart.

1400
00:43:49 --> 00:43:52
My poor darling. You&#39;re all wet.
Go change your clothes.

1401
00:43:52 --> 00:43:54
In the bathroom,

1402
00:43:54 --> 00:43:57
it took me more than an hour to get
out of the tub without making noise.

1403
00:43:57 --> 00:44:00
You must&#39;ve suffered
during the trip in the trunk.

1404
00:44:00 --> 00:44:02
What about the dive in the pool
in the middle of the night?

1405
00:44:02 --> 00:44:03
She put us through a lot.

1406
00:44:03 --> 00:44:04
I got scared more than four times.

1407
00:44:04 --> 00:44:05
Wasn&#39;t it worth it?

1408
00:44:05 --> 00:44:07
Now, we&#39;re rich.

1409
00:44:07 --> 00:44:08
Just by selling the school,
we&#39;Il get a lot.

1410
00:44:08 --> 00:44:10
Between 15 and 20 years in jail.

1411
00:44:10 --> 00:44:11
It&#39;ll depend on the judge.

1412
00:44:11 --> 00:44:14
Moinet!

1413
00:44:14 --> 00:44:15
Wait a moment.

1414
00:44:15 --> 00:44:17
You again, Moinet.

1415
00:44:17 --> 00:44:18
You should be ashamed of yourself.

1416
00:44:18 --> 00:44:20
On the day we&#39;re closing the school.

1417
00:44:20 --> 00:44:22
- Who gave you this slingshot?
- Mme. Delassalle.

1418
00:44:22 --> 00:44:24
- Who?
- Mme. Delassalle.

1419
00:44:24 --> 00:44:27
She opened her door.
She gave me back my slingshot.

1420
00:44:27 --> 00:44:29
She said, &quot;This is for you, Moinet.
Have fun. &quot;

1421
00:44:29 --> 00:44:31
You&#39;re impossible.

1422
00:44:31 --> 00:44:35
You know that she&#39;s dead.
Her body was taken away today.

1423
00:44:35 --> 00:44:37
She&#39;s not dead. She came back.

1424
00:44:37 --> 00:44:40
M. Moinet, go to the corner.

1425
00:44:40 --> 00:44:41
I saw her.

1426
00:44:41 --> 00:44:42
I know I saw her.

1427
00:44:42 --> 00:44:43
Don&#39;t be devils!

1428
00:44:43 --> 00:44:47
Don&#39;t ruin the interest
your friends could take in this film.

1429
00:44:47 --> 00:44:50
Don&#39;t tell them what you saw.

1430
00:44:50 --> 00:44:52
Thank you for them.

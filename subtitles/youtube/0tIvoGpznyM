415
00:24:19 --> 00:24:22
me

416
00:24:22 --> 00:24:23
it&#39;s an interesting

417
00:24:23 --> 00:24:26
what did you find anything interesting

418
00:24:26 --> 00:24:34
I don&#39;t know Peterson was reading up
about a certain dr. Freud steam turn of

419
00:24:34 --> 00:24:38
the century surgeon who had a pension
for illegal experiments

420
00:24:38 --> 00:24:41
what does that have to do with
historical research

421
00:24:41 --> 00:24:44
nothing nothing at all

422
00:24:44 --> 00:24:50
the best guess i can come up with that
Peterson was already going off the deep

423
00:24:50 --> 00:24:53
end

424
00:24:53 --> 00:24:56
honey yeah

425
00:24:56 --> 00:25:00
that&#39;s why I have to take a trip to New
York today

426
00:25:00 --> 00:25:03
yeah

427
00:25:03 --> 00:25:06
I need meal is ok to follow up a hunch

428
00:25:06 --> 00:25:10
which is that Peterson suicide was
somehow connected with his research on

429
00:25:10 --> 00:25:13
the surgeon Floyd steam

430
00:25:13 --> 00:25:16
yeah

431
00:25:16 --> 00:25:18
ok

432
00:25:18 --> 00:25:21

00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:26,382
(rock music)

2
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:35,145
- Dennis.

3
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:36,020
Dennis!

4
00:00:39,782 --> 00:00:41,067
- Hey, what gives?

5
00:00:42,702 --> 00:00:44,488
- You're being paidto work around here!

6
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:47,241
Not to sit around andblast your eardrums.

7
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,037
- Hey, hey, hey, take it easy.

8
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:50,034
I can do both.

9
00:00:50,376 --> 00:00:53,083
(phone ringing)

10
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:54,957
(dial tone)- Hello?

11
00:00:55,297 --> 00:00:55,831
Hello?

12
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:03,051
Didn't you hearthe phone ringing?

13
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:04,504
- No, I didn't.

14
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:07,465
- [McCreedy] They'vealready hung up!

15
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:08,720
- Well then it couldn'thave been too important.

16
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:11,347
- Don't you have anysense of responsibility?

17
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:13,395
That could have beena very important call.

18
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:15,519
- [Dennis] At this hour?

19
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,100
- In the future wouldyou just answer the phone

20
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:19,606
no matter what hour it is, andnot make your own decisions

21
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:22,859
about what's importantand what isn't?

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,610
- Yeah, yeah, right, right.

23
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:27,034
- It's time for our rounds.

24
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:56,806
(eerie music)

25
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:36,228
Did I ever tell youwhat the studio was like

26
00:02:36,565 --> 00:02:37,975
when I first started here?

27
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:39,397
- Yeah, more than once.

28
00:02:39,735 --> 00:02:42,772
- Oh, it used to be one ofthe busiest lots in town.

29
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:46,605
- It's a real thrivingmetropolis now.

30
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:48,737
Hey wait a minute,what's this down here?

31
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:52,036
- Oh, it's justan old film vault,

32
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:53,328
there's nothing down there.

33
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,122
- Yeah, but why don'twe check it anyway?

34
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:57,700
- I'm telling you there'snothing down there,

35
00:02:58,045 --> 00:03:02,209
and I'm not going to wastemy time checking it out.

36
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,335
- [Voiceover] McCreedy.

37
00:03:03,676 --> 00:03:04,461
- What is it now?

38
00:03:04,802 --> 00:03:05,962
- [Voiceover] I needto talk to you now.

39
00:03:06,303 --> 00:03:07,668
- Well I can't right now.

40
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:10,425
- [Voiceover] Now, I mean it.

41
00:03:10,766 --> 00:03:12,427
- Finish the rounds.

42
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,305
And remember what I said.

43
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:17,477
- Whatever you say, Pops.

44
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:32,368
(faint rock music in headphones)

45
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:46,590
(intense music)

46
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:05,316
- What took you so long?

47
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:06,814
- I made it asquickly as I could,

48
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:08,566
I was clear across the lot.

49
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:11,149
- You're not as youngas you used to be.

50
00:04:11,493 --> 00:04:13,449
I tried calling you atthe main gate before,

51
00:04:13,787 --> 00:04:15,652
why didn't you answer the phone?

52
00:04:15,998 --> 00:04:18,114
- I must have caughtit just as you hung up.

53
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:21,326
- Well let's be a littlemore efficient from now on.

54
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,501
How's the new boy doing?

55
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,329
- Fine, fine.

56
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:26,834
But I really need to get back.

57
00:04:27,176 --> 00:04:29,508
- Just a minute, I wanttalk to you about these

58
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:32,587
beer cans I foundin the front gate.

59
00:04:34,892 --> 00:04:37,599
(ominous music)

60
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,266
- So there's nothing down here.

61
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:53,904
I wonder what they keep in here.

62
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,244
Yoohoo, Mr. McCreedy?

63
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,957
(growling)

64
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,310
Is somebody there?

65
00:06:07,651 --> 00:06:09,687
(growling)

66
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:19,694
Is somebody there?

67
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:24,031
(radio static)

68
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:29,920
- I'll give you areport in the morning.

69
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,398
(feedback squealing)

70
00:06:53,864 --> 00:06:56,822
(crowd cheering)

71
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:59,445
(rock music)

72
00:07:36,198 --> 00:07:38,484
(cries out)

73
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:45,620
(creepy music)

74
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:10,729
(door slams shut)

75
00:08:25,414 --> 00:08:27,951
(eerie music)

76
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,693
- Another one quit?!

77
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:48,406
What was the problem this time?

78
00:09:48,747 --> 00:09:50,658
- I'm not sure whatthe problem was, sir.

79
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:52,830
- It wasn't somethingyou said to him, was it?

80
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:54,032
- [McCreedy] It could have been.

81
00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:56,710
- I'm holding you responsiblefor this, McCreedy.

82
00:09:57,047 --> 00:09:59,038
Every time we hire anew guard he only lasts

83
00:09:59,383 --> 00:10:01,669
for a couple ofweeks, then he's gone.

84
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,296
How many is it now, three, four?

85
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:06,503
- It's three, and Ireally don't think

86
00:10:06,848 --> 00:10:08,713
you need to hire anyone else.

87
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:10,845
I can run the post myself.

88
00:10:11,186 --> 00:10:13,177
- Look, you've beenhere for a long time.

89
00:10:13,522 --> 00:10:15,558
You know as well as Ido that we need to have

90
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:17,730
a second guard ready sohe can fill in for you

91
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:20,184
if you can't makeit here some night.

92
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:23,066
- But I've never missed anight since I've been here!

93
00:10:23,407 --> 00:10:25,363
- You're not as young asyou used to be, we need

94
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:26,781
to be prepared.

95
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:28,780
Do you know that if somethingwere to happen to this studio

96
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:33,205
while no one was on duty,our insurance is voided?

97
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:35,373
- This place has beendeserted for almost 30 years.

98
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:37,702
- Stop making excuses.

99
00:10:38,046 --> 00:10:40,503
I want you to hire a new guard,

100
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:43,833
and this time hire one whowill stick around for a while.

101
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,963
Or else I'll hire two.

102
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,261
- So, Kevin, is this thefirst time that you've worked

103
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:54,558
as a security guard?

104
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:57,763
- Yes sir, but I'm a veryfast learner, and I promise

105
00:10:58,108 --> 00:10:59,848
to try extra hard.

106
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,899
And I really need the job.

107
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:07,402
- Well you sound verymature for your age.

108
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:10,485
You don't own one of thoseportable radios with headphones,

109
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:11,363
do you?

110
00:11:12,497 --> 00:11:13,202
- No sir.

111
00:11:13,915 --> 00:11:17,373
- That's good, I thinkwe'll get along just fine.

112
00:11:18,628 --> 00:11:21,370
Now, are you ready foryour first tour of the lot?

113
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:24,790
- Oh, oh yes sir, evenprepared to take notes.

114
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:29,173
- It's not that complicated.

115
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:45,352
You've never been on astudio lot like this before,

116
00:11:45,697 --> 00:11:46,527
have you?

117
00:11:46,865 --> 00:11:47,854
- No sir.

118
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,610
- Well, it's not thatdifficult to keep track of.

119
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:52,693
Now there isn't muchgoes on here anymore.

120
00:11:53,038 --> 00:11:54,278
- How long have youbeen working here?

121
00:11:54,623 --> 00:11:56,705
- Oh, quite a while.

122
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:58,907
About 30 years, actually.

123
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,833
And I've never misseda day and had to have

124
00:12:01,171 --> 00:12:03,287
someone fill in for me.

125
00:12:03,632 --> 00:12:05,714
- 30 years, that's amazing.

126
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:07,040
- Well, not really.

127
00:12:07,386 --> 00:12:09,126
You know, timebecomes sort of a blur

128
00:12:09,471 --> 00:12:11,462
when you reach a certain age.

129
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:13,297
Sometime I'll tell youwhat this place was like

130
00:12:13,642 --> 00:12:16,099
when it was still afunctioning studio.

131
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,802
- I'd like to hear about that.

132
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:23,561
(mysterious music)

133
00:12:27,864 --> 00:12:29,820
- Now Kevin, if I toldyou that something

134
00:12:30,158 --> 00:12:32,820
was very important, you'dlisten to me, wouldn't you?

135
00:12:33,161 --> 00:12:33,946
- Of course.

136
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,276
- Good.

137
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:36,987
Now there is a part ofthis lot that I want you

138
00:12:37,332 --> 00:12:38,788
to stay away from.

139
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:42,038
I don't want to have toexplain all the details to you,

140
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:45,166
I just want you to promiseto stay clear of it.

141
00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:47,043
- I understand.

142
00:12:47,384 --> 00:12:51,047
- Now this is the partI was telling you about.

143
00:12:55,434 --> 00:12:56,594
- What's down there?

144
00:12:56,935 --> 00:12:58,846
- It's just a lot ofdangerous machinery.

145
00:12:59,187 --> 00:13:01,018
Now don't go in there andtake the chance of injuring

146
00:13:01,356 --> 00:13:02,266
yourself, do you understand?

147
00:13:03,233 --> 00:13:03,938
- Yeah.

148
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:07,525
- Good, now I don'twant to have to

149
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:09,694
remind you a second time.

150
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:13,319
Just stay clear of this area.

151
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:25,043
- So is there anything elseI need to be made aware of?

152
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,166
- There is one other thing.

153
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:38,257
This is what I wastelling you about.

154
00:13:39,728 --> 00:13:42,060
Oh, but don't worry, I'venever had to use it.

155
00:13:42,397 --> 00:13:43,386
- Really?

156
00:13:43,732 --> 00:13:46,144
- That's right, not in allthe years I've been here.

157
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,193
But I would like to show youhow to use it sometime though,

158
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,567
you never know whenyou might need it.

159
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:56,241
(ominous music)

160
00:14:24,314 --> 00:14:25,349
- Hi.

161
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,851
- Not now, yourfriends are here.

162
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,735
- Hey, how's it going?

163
00:14:36,117 --> 00:14:37,357
- What'd you bring,some new music?

164
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:39,784
- No, I just rented avideotape that Amy and I

165
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:41,110
were gonna watch.

166
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:42,536
- Well that was very nice.

167
00:14:42,874 --> 00:14:44,535
- Let me see what you got.

168
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:46,116
What?

169
00:14:46,461 --> 00:14:47,917
Don't you ever get any tapesfrom the adult section?

170
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,495
My boyfriend wouldnever bring me a tape

171
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,501
that didn't have atleast a single X rating.

172
00:14:52,842 --> 00:14:54,082
- Well Kevin isn't like that.

173
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:57,214
He would never want me to seeanything that was rated X.

174
00:14:57,556 --> 00:14:58,386
Would you?

175
00:14:58,723 --> 00:14:59,963
- No, I wouldn't.

176
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,016
(horn beeps)

177
00:15:13,071 --> 00:15:15,403
- Oh right man, I'drecognize that horn anywhere,

178
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,695
that's my Nick.

179
00:15:17,033 --> 00:15:18,364
Back from two monthsof army training,

180
00:15:18,702 --> 00:15:20,693
and you know what a manwants when he's been away

189
00:15:54,362 --> 00:15:55,147
- No, no.

190
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,913

192
00:16:09,586 --> 00:16:11,747

193

00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,054
something and knowing how to use it.

203
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:33,264

204
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,225

00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:47,154
- What else did youdo with the gun?

210
00:16:47,582 --> 00:16:49,994

Yet.

215
00:17:01,763 --> 00:17:03,719

238
00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:37,684

- What's the matter, Kevin?

294
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,583

- I've got all thetime in the world.

296
00:23:13,551 --> 00:23:17,635
- What do you do about someonewho you can never make happy?

297
00:23:19,724 --> 00:23:22,716

308
00:23:53,883 --> 00:23:54,542
Uh-oh.

Looks like we've got company.

310
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:01,137
(ominous music)

311
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:07,681

318
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:10,623
- Get away from him.

319
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,956
- Who's this, your grandson?

320
00:25:14,297 --> 00:25:15,833

00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:20,125
- I said, get away from him.

322
00:25:22,263 --> 00:25:23,469
- Who are you kidding?

323
00:25:23,806 --> 00:25:26,013
You don't know how to use that.

324
00:25:30,688 --> 00:25:32,770
(gunshot)

325
00:25:35,026 --> 00:25:37,017
(coughing)

326
00:25:37,361 --> 00:25:38,350
- Are you okay?

327
00:25:38,696 --> 00:25:39,310
Do you want me tocall an ambulance?

328
00:25:39,655 --> 00:25:41,020
- No no, I'm fine.

329
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:42,605
- Damn.

330
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,860
- What's the matter?

331
00:25:44,202 --> 00:25:45,066
- I just wish Amycould've been here to see

332
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,571
what I just did.

333
00:25:49,165 --> 00:25:50,280
- He's still on the lot.

334
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:51,705
- What do we do now?

335
00:25:52,043 --> 00:25:53,123
- I'm going to call the police.

336
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:56,123
Try to locate where he is,but keep a distance from him.

337
00:25:56,464 --> 00:25:58,125
Don't try to be a hero.

338
00:26:10,811 --> 00:26:13,678
(suspenseful music)

339
00:26:48,891 --> 00:26:50,051
- Mr. McCreedy?

340
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:55,057
I'm going down that hallwaywhere all the machinery is.

341
00:26:55,398 --> 00:26:56,729
I think he went down there.

342
00:26:57,066 --> 00:26:59,557
I'm going in for a closer look.

343
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,576
- Good God, the vault!

344
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,407

348
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,680

(growling)

350
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:00,561
- We're too late!

351
00:29:00,898 --> 00:29:02,684
Kevin, why did you go in there?

352
00:29:03,025 --> 00:29:04,936
Why didn't you listen to me?

353
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:25,999

354
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,002

00:30:06,464 --> 00:30:07,829
- I don't understand!

358
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:09,664

360
00:30:13,095 --> 00:30:15,837
Those creatures,the vault, I tried.

361
00:30:19,435 --> 00:30:22,848
All my work, 30 years I'vebeen trying to prevent this

362
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:24,599
from happening.

363
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,056
- To prevent whatfrom happening?

364
00:30:27,401 --> 00:30:28,686
- Those creatures.

365
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:33,522
Why do you think I spent thelast 30 years of my life here?

366
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:36,323
I was keeping themfrom escaping.

367
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,158
I was young when Ibegan to work here,

368
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:44,536
and the studio wasbusy and prosperous.

369
00:30:48,255 --> 00:30:51,418
I'll always remember thenight that it happened.

370
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:55,092
It was late, there washardly anyone around.

371
00:30:58,015 --> 00:30:59,880
I didn't even knowwhat it was at first.

372
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:02,387
It was all so fast,just a flash of light

373
00:31:02,728 --> 00:31:04,309
and then a sudden explosion.

374
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,016
I stepped out tosee what it was,

375
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:10,691
but there was no oneelse there except for me.

376
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:17,027
It was right in themiddle of the lot.

377
00:31:17,368 --> 00:31:19,859
Had it been daytime, itprobably would have been crushed

378
00:31:20,204 --> 00:31:21,410
in all the traffic.

379
00:31:23,123 --> 00:31:26,206
I just stared atit for a long time.

380
00:31:26,544 --> 00:31:29,126
I didn't know whatto make of it.

381
00:31:29,463 --> 00:31:31,374
And then suddenly it moved.

382
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:34,878
And out from the top of thedisc came this small creature,

383
00:31:35,219 --> 00:31:36,550
a sort of hobgoblin.

384
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,593
It looked around and thenit stared right at me.

385
00:31:43,352 --> 00:31:46,640
I didn't move, I justkept watching him.

386
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:50,856
Looked so friendly at first.

387
00:31:52,361 --> 00:31:55,068
If only I'd knownwhat lay ahead.

388
00:31:58,701 --> 00:32:01,238
- But I still don't understand.

389
00:32:01,579 --> 00:32:06,073
- I let the creatures liveon the lot, it was my secret.

390
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:08,499
And then I learned ofthe power they had.

391
00:32:08,836 --> 00:32:10,246
I still don't knowif they figured

392
00:32:10,588 --> 00:32:14,206
they were doing goodfor people or not.

393
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:18,964
They slowly began todestroy everyone on the lot.

394
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:21,762
They would find a person,tap into his brain,

395
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:25,341
and then create hiswildest fantasy.

396
00:32:25,686 --> 00:32:28,644
It seemed harmless at first,I mean, watching everyone

397
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:32,940
around me becoming rich orfamous, but for most people

398
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:38,479
what they really want inlife can be very dangerous.

399
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:42,112
In fact, the creatures woundup destroying everyone,

400
00:32:42,453 --> 00:32:45,115
everyone they camein contact with.

401
00:32:46,749 --> 00:32:48,865
They're, they're, they're loosein the city now.

402
00:32:49,209 --> 00:32:50,995
- But you could warn everyone.

403
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:53,168
They'd listen to your story.

404
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:54,585
- Would they?

405
00:32:54,923 --> 00:32:58,006
No one believed me 30 years ago.

406
00:32:58,344 --> 00:32:59,424
I went straight tothe head of the studio

407
00:32:59,762 --> 00:33:01,047
and tried to explain it to him.

408
00:33:01,388 --> 00:33:02,377
He didn't believeme, no one did.

409
00:33:02,723 --> 00:33:06,511
I just watched helplesslyas people around me

410
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:08,843
were destroyed, one by one.

411
00:33:09,563 --> 00:33:11,269
- Then what can we do?

412
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:16,229
- I'm too old to catchup with them now,

413
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,606
but you might stillhave a chance.

414
00:33:18,947 --> 00:33:22,280
There aren't very many ofthem, but they move quickly.

415
00:33:22,618 --> 00:33:25,451
Just remember, they'reattracted to bright lights,

416
00:33:25,788 --> 00:33:28,495
that's how you can fight them.

417
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,198
Watch everyone around you.

418
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:33,329
When a person beginsto act strangely,

419
00:33:33,671 --> 00:33:35,081
it means that oneof the creatures

420
00:33:35,422 --> 00:33:37,788
have tapped into his mind.

421
00:33:38,133 --> 00:33:39,839
When this happens, thecreature is never far away.

422
00:33:40,177 --> 00:33:42,213
Find it and kill itbefore it's too late.

423
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:45,591
Because when the creaturedies, the fantasy ends

424
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,764
and the victim is safe.

425
00:33:48,102 --> 00:33:52,266
Now remember, they're onlyattracted to bright light.

426
00:33:52,606 --> 00:33:54,221
That's how you find them.

427
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:57,148
But you must destroythem all before dawn

428
00:33:57,486 --> 00:33:59,351
because once it'sdaylight, it's too late.

429
00:33:59,697 --> 00:34:00,686
- Okay.

430
00:34:01,031 --> 00:34:03,818
- You'll never beable to stop them.

431
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,445
(ominous music)

432
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:17,039
(record scratch)

433
00:34:17,381 --> 00:34:19,497
(dance music)

434
00:34:24,388 --> 00:34:25,298
- Alright!

435
00:34:40,362 --> 00:34:42,318
(growling)

436
00:34:49,705 --> 00:34:52,538
Come on Amy, wouldyou get with it?

437
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:59,585
(growling)

438
00:35:09,558 --> 00:35:11,970
(horn beeps)

439
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:15,348
That car horn, I'drecognize it anywhere!

440
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:20,103
(horn beeps)

441
00:35:21,904 --> 00:35:23,269
See you guys later.

442
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:25,653
Much later.

443
00:35:29,453 --> 00:35:30,408
That's weird.

444
00:35:31,789 --> 00:35:35,373
Maybe he's circlingthe block or something.

445
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,035
- I brought your jacket.

446
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,745
I thought you mightbe cold out here.

447
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,921
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

448
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:45,248
- Where's Nick?

449
00:35:45,594 --> 00:35:47,050
I thought I heardhis horn before.

450
00:35:47,387 --> 00:35:48,046
- So did I.

451
00:35:49,473 --> 00:35:51,338
- Well maybe you should waitinside until you see him.

452
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:53,219
- He's just lookingfor a place to park,

453
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,925
now would you goback in the house?

454
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,101
- There's plenty of parkingin front, maybe it wasn't

455
00:35:57,439 --> 00:35:58,349
his horn?

456
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,850
- Look, I'm positive it was.

457
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:01,477
Maybe the policejust pulled him over

458
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:02,934
for all his warrantsor something.

459
00:36:03,278 --> 00:36:04,267
Now would you justgo back in the house?

460
00:36:04,613 --> 00:36:05,523
- Fine, I get the message.

461
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:08,947
- Just take thisstupid jacket with you.

462
00:36:13,956 --> 00:36:15,947
Damnit Nick, wherethe hell are you?

463
00:36:30,514 --> 00:36:31,799
(growling)

464
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,630
Amy, would you justgo back in the house

465
00:36:33,976 --> 00:36:35,307
and leave me alone?

466
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:40,770
And would you stopbreathing all over me?

467
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:42,222
(growls)

468
00:36:42,568 --> 00:36:44,479
(screaming)

469
00:36:49,283 --> 00:36:52,150
- Sounds like Nickfinally got here.

470
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:02,497
- Get the fuck off me!

471
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:05,461
- She must be happy to see him.

472
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:18,391
- Take that, you little bastard!

473
00:37:38,498 --> 00:37:40,614
- Honestly, couldn't Nick wait?

474
00:37:42,252 --> 00:37:45,039
(screaming)

475
00:37:47,049 --> 00:37:49,791
(growling)

476
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,786
Go on, grab it!

477
00:38:20,791 --> 00:38:22,702
- It's like a new dance.

478
00:38:27,381 --> 00:38:29,042
Looks pretty kinky.

479
00:38:30,217 --> 00:38:31,582
Hey guys!

480
00:38:31,927 --> 00:38:33,258
- Nick, thank God you're here!

481
00:38:33,637 --> 00:38:35,173
Something wild came out of the woodsand attacked us!

482
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:36,629
- I know I'm here to take ya out.

483
00:38:36,974 --> 00:38:38,714
- Oh it's those rabid animals!

484
00:38:44,731 --> 00:38:47,017
(screaming)

485
00:38:47,985 --> 00:38:50,226
(growling)

486
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:18,253
I knew I'd find a use for this.

487
00:39:22,352 --> 00:39:24,638
Just open the doorand stand back.

488
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,390
- Oh my God, whatdo you call that?

489
00:39:26,815 --> 00:39:27,895
- Urban renewal.

490
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:39,987
- Wait!

491
00:39:49,296 --> 00:39:50,456
No, put that out!

492
00:39:56,887 --> 00:39:59,128
(growling)

493
00:40:04,061 --> 00:40:05,517
You guys okay?

494
00:40:05,854 --> 00:40:07,594
- Yeah, I'm just peachy.

495
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:09,520
- I had everythingunder control.

496
00:40:09,858 --> 00:40:12,850
- Good, then you canfinish off your van.

497
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,992
- I don't understand,what were those things?

498
00:40:30,337 --> 00:40:31,577
- It's a long story.

499
00:40:31,922 --> 00:40:33,458
What they do to yourbody is nothing compared

500
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:35,255
to what they do to your mind.

501
00:40:35,592 --> 00:40:37,503
- Don't have toworry about that.

502
00:40:37,844 --> 00:40:39,334
- You sure you're all okay?

503
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:42,386
I mean, you don't feelanything different, do you?

504
00:40:42,724 --> 00:40:44,589
- I think I wet my pants.

505
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:47,968
Hey, I was only kidding.

506
00:40:49,439 --> 00:40:51,930
- And none of you havea desire to do anything

507
00:40:52,275 --> 00:40:54,561
you've never done before, right?

508
00:40:54,903 --> 00:40:55,813
- I don't thinkthere's anything left

509
00:40:56,154 --> 00:40:57,690
that we haven't done before.

510
00:40:58,031 --> 00:40:59,487
- How 'bout you, Amy?

511
00:40:59,825 --> 00:41:01,486
- Well actually I dowanna try this new Chinese

512
00:41:01,827 --> 00:41:04,284
restaurant that I heard about.

513
00:41:04,621 --> 00:41:05,155
- Kyle?

514
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,700
- Could I use yourtelephone again?

515
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:09,497
I wanna call my girlfriend.

516
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:11,575
- We still haven't metthis mystery girl of yours,

517
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,911
what kind of relationshipdo the two of you have?

518
00:41:14,256 --> 00:41:17,999
- I guess you'd say it'sa fantasy relationship.

519
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,105
(ominous music)

520
00:41:53,128 --> 00:41:55,289
(growling)

521
00:42:12,022 --> 00:42:14,479
(phone ringing)

522
00:42:14,816 --> 00:42:16,556
- Hi, it's me, Fantasia.

523
00:42:17,527 --> 00:42:18,983
Thanks for calling.

524
00:42:19,321 --> 00:42:21,607
I need a new house petto impress my friends.

525
00:42:21,948 --> 00:42:23,779
Now hurry beforethe zookeeper comes,

526
00:42:24,117 --> 00:42:26,779
help me hide thisiguana on my body.

527
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,236
Uh, can I help you, miss?

528
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:33,665
Oh yes Mr. Beastmaster,something just crawled up my leg.

529
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:36,709
Oh, see if you can find it.

530
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:41,665
I think you'd better comeback to my office with me.

531
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,672
Now wait a minute, areyou sure your office

532
00:42:45,013 --> 00:42:47,299
is in the baboon pit?

533
00:42:47,641 --> 00:42:51,600
Mister zookeeper, what doyou think you're doing?

534
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:55,145
This isn't thechildren's petting zoo.

535
00:42:55,482 --> 00:42:59,441
I have a new house pet foryou, miss, ha ha ha ha ha.

536
00:43:00,862 --> 00:43:03,604
Oh, mister zookeeper, Icould never take a cockatoo

537
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:04,483
that size.

538
00:43:06,868 --> 00:43:08,608
(record scratch)

539
00:43:08,954 --> 00:43:11,696
Now stop wasting yourmoney calling me.

540
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,201
I'm right outside your door.

541
00:43:15,502 --> 00:43:18,118

So I've heard.

00:45:31,304 --> 00:45:32,293

564
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:34,300

565
00:45:34,641 --> 00:45:36,177
I've gotta go acrosstown and get Kyle.

Don't make a moveor do anything.

00:45:39,521 --> 00:45:43,059
And above all, don'tfantasize about anything!

569
00:45:58,998 --> 00:46:03,082
- You know, girls, I couldthink of a fantasy right now.

570
00:46:04,045 --> 00:46:06,707
It's involving the number three.

571
00:46:31,156 --> 00:46:33,863
- Oh Fantasia, you'remy ideal woman.

572
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,782
You're intelligent, you'vegot a wonderful personality,

573
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,451

Will you marry me?

576
00:46:43,209 --> 00:46:46,918
- Skip the ceremony, we'regoing straight to the honeymoon.

577
00:46:53,178 --> 00:46:56,420
Oh Fantasia, baby I couldwatch you all night long.

578
00:46:57,557 --> 00:46:59,297

579
00:46:59,642 --> 00:47:00,802
all night long.

580
00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:03,476
Now hurry, I know a shortcut.

581
00:47:40,975 --> 00:47:42,465
Oh, don't park here.

582
00:47:44,145 --> 00:47:45,055
- Why not?

583
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:48,267
- You have to park near the edge

584
00:47:48,608 --> 00:47:50,974
if you want to go all the way.

585
00:47:52,237 --> 00:47:53,522
- Oh yeah, sure.

586
00:48:04,207 --> 00:48:04,992
How's that?

587
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:07,873
- Perfect.

588
00:48:08,211 --> 00:48:09,496
- That was someshortcut you knew about.

589
00:48:09,837 --> 00:48:10,667
I never knew therewas a road through

590
00:48:11,005 --> 00:48:12,961
the children's playground.

591
00:48:14,342 --> 00:48:15,252
- There isn't.

592
00:48:15,593 --> 00:48:18,005
(laughs)

593
00:48:18,346 --> 00:48:20,803
Well, what are you waiting for?

594
00:48:30,817 --> 00:48:34,059
- Fantasia, where are you going?

595
00:48:34,404 --> 00:48:37,020
- I wanted a betterview of the city.

596
00:48:39,242 --> 00:48:41,403
You can see it all from here.

597
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,781
Now, isn't that a lovely view?

598
00:48:49,877 --> 00:48:51,242
- Oh, it sure is.

599
00:48:52,755 --> 00:48:54,666
Where are you going now?

600
00:48:56,426 --> 00:48:58,667
- Just wait a second.

601
00:48:59,012 --> 00:49:01,128
You just keep watching the view.

602
00:49:01,472 --> 00:49:05,431
Just hold tight and get readyfor the ride of your life.

603
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:08,350
- Do it to me.

604
00:49:12,275 --> 00:49:14,482
(groaning)

605
00:49:24,245 --> 00:49:25,906
You need any help?

606
00:49:26,247 --> 00:49:28,158
- Would you get backinside and wait for me?

607
00:49:28,499 --> 00:49:30,160
This time don't move!

608
00:49:36,215 --> 00:49:37,045
We're almost there.

609
00:49:37,383 --> 00:49:40,671
Just think nastythoughts while you wait.

610
00:49:42,221 --> 00:49:45,088
(suspenseful music)

611
00:49:58,446 --> 00:50:00,653
(groaning)

612
00:50:11,292 --> 00:50:13,283
(growling)

613
00:50:31,604 --> 00:50:33,310
- Do it do me, baby.

614
00:50:36,651 --> 00:50:37,936
- You damn fool!

615
00:50:38,903 --> 00:50:41,110
What are you doing here?

616
00:50:41,447 --> 00:50:42,812
- I want you tomeet my girlfriend.

617
00:50:43,157 --> 00:50:43,896
Wait 'til you see her.

618
00:50:44,242 --> 00:50:45,027

619
00:50:45,368 --> 00:50:46,107
Honey?

620
00:50:46,452 --> 00:50:47,191
- Kyle, there's no girl.

621
00:50:47,537 --> 00:50:49,073
She was a figmentof your imagination.

622
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:51,120
- No she's not, she'sjust hiding somewhere.

623
00:50:51,457 --> 00:50:52,947
I told you, she's a shy girl.

624
00:50:53,292 --> 00:50:53,997
Sweetie?

625
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,290
- Shy girl?

626
00:50:55,628 --> 00:50:57,334
That bleached blondewitch almost killed you!

627
00:50:59,048 --> 00:51:01,960
She was back there trying topush your car over the cliff!

628
00:51:02,301 --> 00:51:03,256
Hey, come on!

629
00:51:06,681 --> 00:51:08,797

630
00:51:10,935 --> 00:51:13,221
(explosion)

631
00:51:23,698 --> 00:51:24,357
- Whoa.

632
00:51:25,908 --> 00:51:27,773
- Now do you believe me?

633
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:37,207
(ominous music)

634
00:51:50,516 --> 00:51:53,474
I'll discuss my phonebill with you later.

635
00:51:53,978 --> 00:51:54,933
Oh no.

636
00:51:57,774 --> 00:51:59,139
They're gone!

637
00:51:59,484 --> 00:52:03,443
(growling)(crying out)

638
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,160

640
00:52:26,803 --> 00:52:28,168
- Hit the creature!

641
00:52:38,564 --> 00:52:39,269
Idiot.

642
00:52:45,279 --> 00:52:48,817
The creatures brokeloose, are you guys okay?

643
00:52:49,158 --> 00:52:51,023
- We're doing just fine.

644
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:52,984
- What about Amy, where's she?

645
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:54,910
- She was acting kinda strange.

646
00:52:55,248 --> 00:52:56,158
- [Kevin] What?

647
00:52:56,499 --> 00:52:57,488

649
00:52:58,543 --> 00:52:59,453
- What?

650
00:52:59,794 --> 00:53:01,000
Why didn't you try to stop her?

651
00:53:01,337 --> 00:53:02,452
- What's the big deal?

652
00:53:02,797 --> 00:53:03,786
I've been there before.

653
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:05,120
- You guys, don'tyou understand?

654
00:53:05,466 --> 00:53:07,331
These creatures have a power.

655
00:53:07,677 --> 00:53:09,338
They can tap into yourbrain and sense the things

656
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:11,886
that you really wanna do.

657
00:53:12,223 --> 00:53:13,338
- What's wrong with that?

658
00:53:13,683 --> 00:53:15,048
- They also try to kill you.

659
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:17,258
I just chased Kyle across townand pulled him out of his car

660
00:53:17,603 --> 00:53:20,015
right before it rolledover a cliff and blew up.

661
00:53:20,356 --> 00:53:21,391
- It's still burning now.

662
00:53:21,732 --> 00:53:24,348
- You see what I'm tryingto tell you guys now?

663
00:53:24,694 --> 00:53:26,309
- What could happenat that nightclub?

664
00:53:26,654 --> 00:53:27,484
- Well there's a lot of bikers

665
00:53:27,822 --> 00:53:29,813
and people fighting everywhere,and I've seen people

666
00:53:30,157 --> 00:53:31,192
dealing drugs and knife fights.

667
00:53:31,534 --> 00:53:32,148
- What?

668
00:53:32,535 --> 00:53:33,650
Oh no, come on, we've gotta go.

669
00:53:34,036 --> 00:53:34,741
Come on!

670
00:53:36,122 --> 00:53:36,986
- And I've seen the policearresting people there

671
00:53:37,331 --> 00:53:38,821

672
00:53:39,709 --> 00:53:41,449
- Oh no, come on!

673
00:53:41,794 --> 00:53:44,035
(rock music)

674
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:07,896
Daphne, I think yougot this all wrong.

675
00:54:08,237 --> 00:54:10,523
Amy would never cometo a place like this.

676
00:54:10,865 --> 00:54:12,480
She won't even go through themall parking lot by herself.

677
00:54:12,867 --> 00:54:14,482
- Would you just listen to me.

678
00:54:14,827 --> 00:54:16,192
You guys have to have acertain kind of attitude

679
00:54:16,537 --> 00:54:17,652
when you're inthis part of town.

680
00:54:17,997 --> 00:54:19,953
You've gotta looklike you belong, okay?

681
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:21,827
- Yeah, I get it.

682
00:54:22,877 --> 00:54:24,367
- Look, would you just listento me and nothing will happen.

683
00:54:24,712 --> 00:54:26,293
Now look, I think one of usshould hold all the wallets

684
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:28,212
for safe-keeping.

685
00:54:28,549 --> 00:54:29,083
You.

686
00:54:32,511 --> 00:54:34,627
Now quiet and just be cool.

687
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,676
- Nick, Kevin, Daphne?

688
00:54:43,731 --> 00:54:44,516

01:12:56,823 --> 01:12:58,688
- Hey look, there's Amy!

904
01:13:02,704 --> 01:13:04,820
Amy, are you okay?

905
01:13:05,999 --> 01:13:07,159
- I'm not sure.

906
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,286
Why am I dressed likea rock video slut?

907
01:13:09,753 --> 01:13:11,289
- It's a long story,I'll explain later.

908
01:13:15,759 --> 01:13:16,919
- You there.

909
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:19,046
Name, rank, serial number.

910
01:13:19,387 --> 01:13:21,503
- Don't shoot me,I'm just an employee.

911
01:13:21,848 --> 01:13:24,385
I don't even bookthe talent here.

912
01:13:27,687 --> 01:13:29,348
- Sergeant, can't you stop him?

913
01:13:29,689 --> 01:13:30,599
- Why?

914
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:32,055
This is the besttraining he's ever had.

915
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:33,640
You could never getthis at boot camp.

916
01:13:33,985 --> 01:13:35,316
- You call that training?

917
01:13:35,653 --> 01:13:37,063
He could kill somebody.

918
01:13:37,405 --> 01:13:39,236
- War isn't pretty.

919
01:13:39,574 --> 01:13:40,529
- Daphne and Nickare still inside,

920
01:13:40,867 --> 01:13:42,653
we gotta try and help 'em.

921
01:13:42,994 --> 01:13:44,200
- Wait.

922
01:13:44,537 --> 01:13:46,448
I have a specialmission for you.

923
01:13:46,790 --> 01:13:47,620
- You do?

924
01:13:47,957 --> 01:13:48,616
- Yes.

925
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:52,450
Have you ever consideredjoining the USO?

926
01:13:52,796 --> 01:13:53,785
- The USO?

927
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:54,789
- Yes, think of it.

928
01:13:55,131 --> 01:13:56,211
Entertain thetroops, doing your part

929
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,461
for our country.

930
01:13:58,802 --> 01:14:00,542
A small but patriotic gesturethat would be appreciated

931
01:14:00,887 --> 01:14:04,379
by our boys off fightingaround the world.

932
01:14:04,724 --> 01:14:05,463
- I'll do it!

933
01:14:05,809 --> 01:14:06,639
- Good!

934
01:14:06,976 --> 01:14:08,466
You can start right away.

935
01:14:08,812 --> 01:14:11,474
I've got a truckload ofsoldiers out in the parking lot.

936
01:14:11,815 --> 01:14:14,522
If you start now you can befinished with them by morning.

937
01:14:14,859 --> 01:14:15,393
- What?

938
01:14:16,111 --> 01:14:17,567
Nick, do something, yourSergeant's after me.

939
01:14:18,196 --> 01:14:19,561
Just shoot him!

940
01:14:19,906 --> 01:14:21,521
- One more time, babe.

941
01:14:21,866 --> 01:14:23,652
Here, do it yourself.

942
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:24,982
- Stop wasting time.

943
01:14:25,328 --> 01:14:26,613
- Nick!

944
01:14:26,955 --> 01:14:28,570
- Maybe I should send Nick offto some third world country.

945
01:14:28,915 --> 01:14:30,906
That'll give you allthe time that you need.

946
01:14:31,251 --> 01:14:32,536
- Let go of me!

947
01:14:32,877 --> 01:14:33,662
- Or maybe I should get Nickout of the picture altogether.

948
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:36,836
Nick, this is yoursergeant speaking!

949
01:14:37,173 --> 01:14:38,333
Save the troops!

950
01:14:38,716 --> 01:14:40,206
That's an order!

951
01:14:40,552 --> 01:14:42,133
- Nick! No, don't do it!

952
01:14:45,682 --> 01:14:47,718
(explosion)

953
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:51,346
(screaming)

954
01:15:07,745 --> 01:15:09,906
- That truck of soldiersis waiting outside.

955
01:15:10,248 --> 01:15:12,330
It'll be a dream come true.

956
01:15:12,667 --> 01:15:14,783
(growling)

957
01:15:17,422 --> 01:15:20,209
- My dream can cometrue right now.

958
01:15:24,012 --> 01:15:26,298
(explosion)

959
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,306
I got the last of 'em.

960
01:15:42,197 --> 01:15:44,779
(magical chimes)

961
01:16:03,384 --> 01:16:06,296
- Must've been arowdy crowd tonight.

962
01:16:07,263 --> 01:16:09,675
- Hey, hey, hey Miss Sincere.

963
01:16:11,142 --> 01:16:12,973
You know I really liked thatshow you were doing inside.

964
01:16:13,311 --> 01:16:15,267
- Okay scumball, the showis over, why don't you just

965
01:16:15,605 --> 01:16:17,766
climb back under your rock?

966
01:16:18,107 --> 01:16:20,143
- Daphne, I could've done that.

967
01:16:20,485 --> 01:16:21,224
- Oh, sorry.

968
01:16:22,946 --> 01:16:26,404
- Amy, I want you to know thatI'll always be there for you.

969
01:16:26,741 --> 01:16:27,776
- Well you know, no one'sever really noticed me

970
01:16:28,117 --> 01:16:29,653
before like that.

971
01:16:29,994 --> 01:16:32,736
I mean, I've always just beenthought of as Daphne's friend.

972
01:16:33,081 --> 01:16:36,744
This is the first time somebodycame up to me like that.

973
01:16:37,085 --> 01:16:38,245
I kinda liked it.

974
01:16:38,586 --> 01:16:40,702
- Amy I meant what I said.

975
01:16:41,047 --> 01:16:42,753
I'm gonna prove it to you.

976
01:17:07,448 --> 01:17:08,563
- Where is he?

977
01:17:16,624 --> 01:17:17,989
Mr. Comstock, I wasn'tsure if you'd still

978
01:17:18,334 --> 01:17:19,540
be here this late.

979
01:17:19,877 --> 01:17:20,832
- I'm on my way out the door.

980
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:22,535
What do you want now?

981
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:24,336
- The creatureshave broken loose.

982
01:17:24,674 --> 01:17:25,754
The same ones I triedto warn you about

983
01:17:26,092 --> 01:17:27,832
when I first got my job here.

984
01:17:28,177 --> 01:17:28,916
- Are you gonna try totell me that same story

985
01:17:29,262 --> 01:17:31,628
about the hobgoblins again?

986
01:17:31,973 --> 01:17:32,507
- Yes sir.

987
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,636
I'm glad you stillremember about them.

988
01:17:35,977 --> 01:17:37,842
- How could I forgetthat nonsense?

989
01:17:38,187 --> 01:17:39,597
Now get outta hereand get back to work.

990
01:17:39,939 --> 01:17:41,224
- But you don't understand.

991
01:17:41,566 --> 01:17:44,148
They broke loose tonight,they're out there

992
01:17:44,485 --> 01:17:45,816
somewhere in the city!

993
01:17:46,154 --> 01:17:47,860
I already sent the otherguard out to try to find them.

994
01:17:48,197 --> 01:17:49,687
- What?

995
01:17:50,033 --> 01:17:52,069
You mean there's no one manningthe front gate right now?

996
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:53,115
- No sir.

997
01:17:53,453 --> 01:17:54,738
- This is preposterous.

998
01:17:55,079 --> 01:17:56,740
You do know that ifsomething were to happen

999
01:17:57,081 --> 01:17:58,742
to this studio whileno one was on duty,

1000
01:17:59,083 --> 01:18:01,199
our insurance willrefuse to pay off?

1001
01:18:01,544 --> 01:18:02,499
- Yes sir.

1002
01:18:02,837 --> 01:18:04,373
- Well then getback on your post.

1003
01:18:04,714 --> 01:18:05,954
- You're not listening!

1004
01:18:06,299 --> 01:18:07,709
I want to go out and find him.

1005
01:18:08,051 --> 01:18:09,416
He must need my help by now!

1006
01:18:09,761 --> 01:18:11,922
- You are not going toleave your job to go out

1007
01:18:12,263 --> 01:18:13,844
and chase some foolishness.

1008
01:18:14,182 --> 01:18:17,140
If you walk off thislot, you are fired.

1009
01:18:19,187 --> 01:18:20,097
- Well good.

1010
01:18:21,564 --> 01:18:24,146
Saves me thetrouble of quitting.

1011
01:18:48,633 --> 01:18:49,839
- Mr. McCreedy?

1012
01:18:53,179 --> 01:18:54,089
- Hey there.

1013
01:18:58,017 --> 01:18:59,723
We have a score to settle.

1014
01:19:00,061 --> 01:19:02,427
(intense music)

1015
01:19:10,154 --> 01:19:13,692
- Amy, this time I'mgonna make you proud.

1016
01:19:31,467 --> 01:19:33,708
(punching)

1017
01:19:34,971 --> 01:19:36,381
- Amy, I think Kevin'sproved his bravery to you,

1018
01:19:36,722 --> 01:19:38,929
would you tell him to stopbefore he kills himself?

1019
01:19:39,892 --> 01:19:42,850
- For God's sake Kevin,stop before he kills you!

1020
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:21,680
- Sometimes you win,sometimes you lose.

1021
01:20:29,442 --> 01:20:30,727
- No!

1022
01:20:31,068 --> 01:20:32,183
(gunshot)

1023
01:20:40,411 --> 01:20:42,493
(screams)

1024
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:48,741
(magical chimes)

1025
01:20:51,464 --> 01:20:53,580
- I'm sorry for sendingyou out on your own.

1026
01:20:53,925 --> 01:20:55,131
I should have known thecreatures would try to destroy

1027
01:20:55,468 --> 01:20:56,002
you, also.

1028
01:20:57,553 --> 01:20:59,043
- Where are they going now?

1029
01:20:59,388 --> 01:21:00,878
- Back to theirhome in the vault.

1030
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:03,089
Hurry, there isn'tmuch time left.

1031
01:21:03,434 --> 01:21:04,389
- Kevin, wait.

1032
01:21:05,937 --> 01:21:08,303
(sultry music)

1033
01:21:13,861 --> 01:21:15,021
Don't take too long.

1034
01:21:15,363 --> 01:21:16,398
I'll be waiting.

1035
01:21:19,158 --> 01:21:20,193
- Let's go!

1036
01:21:44,475 --> 01:21:47,387
(suspenseful music)

1037
01:21:55,069 --> 01:21:55,979
- Do you think--

1038
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:56,934
- Shhh.

1039
01:22:04,287 --> 01:22:05,527
I was right about them.

1040
01:22:05,871 --> 01:22:07,361
They're back inside.

1041
01:22:08,833 --> 01:22:10,573
- Well maybe weshould get closer

1042
01:22:10,918 --> 01:22:12,829
and lock them back inside again.

1043
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:15,707
- No, I've spent 30years guarding them,

1044
01:22:16,048 --> 01:22:18,130
and I was firedfrom my job tonight.

1045
01:22:18,467 --> 01:22:20,674
I won't be around hereto keep an eye on them.

1046
01:22:21,012 --> 01:22:22,092
- You were fired?

1047
01:22:23,347 --> 01:22:26,589
Well, maybe I couldguard them from now on.

1048
01:22:28,269 --> 01:22:30,134
- Oh no, I don't want youto throw your life away

1049
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:31,810
the way I had to.

1050
01:22:32,982 --> 01:22:34,643
There is a better way.

1051
01:22:38,529 --> 01:22:39,609
- Did you find them?

1052
01:22:39,947 --> 01:22:41,403
- Yeah, they're backinside the vault.

1053
01:22:41,741 --> 01:22:43,151
- What are you gonna do to them?

1054
01:22:43,492 --> 01:22:44,698
- I don't know.

1055
01:22:45,036 --> 01:22:46,071
- Kevin.

1056
01:22:46,412 --> 01:22:49,154
Did I ever tell youwhat I did in the war?

1057
01:22:49,498 --> 01:22:50,328
- No.

1058
01:22:51,584 --> 01:22:52,744
- Munitions.

1059
01:22:53,085 --> 01:22:54,200
(beeping)

1060
01:22:54,545 --> 01:22:56,456
(explosion)

1061
01:23:06,474 --> 01:23:08,760
Isn't it ironic that theyshould pick a movie studio

1062
01:23:09,101 --> 01:23:10,307
to land?

1063
01:23:10,645 --> 01:23:14,604
Unless they figured theybelonged in a dream factory.

1064
01:23:18,486 --> 01:23:20,693
- You were my hero tonight.

1065
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:26,065
- What?

1066
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:27,900
Are you sure?

1067
01:23:28,245 --> 01:23:29,280
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1068
01:23:36,253 --> 01:23:37,834
- Daphne?

1069
01:23:38,172 --> 01:23:38,911
- Yeah.

1070
01:23:39,256 --> 01:23:40,416
- This is for you.

1071
01:23:42,301 --> 01:23:43,211
- Really?

1072
01:23:44,303 --> 01:23:47,795
No one's ever givenme flowers before.

1073
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:49,425
- Oh, but there's lots ofthings I could show you

1074
01:23:49,767 --> 01:23:51,632
for the first time.

1075
01:23:51,977 --> 01:23:52,557
Nick.

1076
01:23:53,437 --> 01:23:54,677
- Nick?- [Amy] Nick?

1077
01:23:55,022 --> 01:23:55,852
- Nick!

1078
01:23:56,190 --> 01:23:57,430
- Daph, baby!

1079
01:23:58,901 --> 01:24:02,109
Told you guys I hadeverything under control.

1080
01:24:05,116 --> 01:24:05,775
Daphne.

1081
01:24:07,451 --> 01:24:08,361
- Nicky.

1082
01:24:09,578 --> 01:24:10,613
- [Both] Van!

1083
01:24:23,342 --> 01:24:25,378

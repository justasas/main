00:00:31 --> 00:00:32
this workshop she did, and

23
00:00:32 --> 00:00:33
she told me: &quot;Why do you want to write?&quot;

24
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
And I said, &quot;because no one ever listened to me all my

26
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
And she said, &quot;then why are you doing spoken word?

You must be in a band, because no one will stop to see

28
00:00:43 --> 00:00:45
spoken word, but people go to see bands.

95
00:03:11 --> 00:03:13
I was born in Portland, Oregon.

96
00:03:13 --> 00:03:14
My mother was a nurse.

97
00:03:14 --> 00:03:15
My father was a plumber.

98
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
My sister is four years older than me.

99
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
I already knew it would be a kind of artist.

100
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
I just did not know what kind.

101
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
My mother and I had a very specific relationship.

102
00:03:26 --> 00:03:30
She is totally sadistic and funny, and I say this with,

103
00:03:30 --> 00:03:34
as love and generosity with her in my heart.

104
00:03:34 --> 00:03:35
One of my first memories was great

105
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
my mother heard about this thing, the confidence game.

106
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
It&#39;s like a confidence building exercise, and she said, &quot;I will

107
00:03:39 --> 00:03:40

108
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42

fall back, and I&#39;ll catch you. &quot;

111
00:03:44 --> 00:03:47
Then she fell back, and, like, I held it

112
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
And then I fell back, and my

113
00:03:49 --> 00:03:53
mother out of the way and let me fall.

114
00:03:53 --> 00:03:54
And I looked up the carpet,

00:03:54 --> 00:03:57

119
00:04:02 --> 00:04:03
I moved around a lot as a child.

120
00:04:03 --> 00:04:05
We moved every three years, and

121
00:04:05 --> 00:04:09
when I was 14, we moved across the country, from

122
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
Maryland to the Pacific Northwest.

123
00:04:11 --> 00:04:17
I went to college at Evergreen State College,

124
00:04:17 --> 00:04:18
Olympia, Washington.

125
00:04:18 --> 00:04:22
And I studied photography.

126
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
That&#39;s when I met Kathleen Hanna.

127
00:04:24 --> 00:04:25
She literally made an entry,

128
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
Because I remember she was late for a class.

129
00:04:27 --> 00:04:28
I think my first impressions

130
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
were, she reminded me of a young Elizabeth Taylor.

131
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
Tammy rae was only the most punk thing I had ever seen and

132
00:04:33 --> 00:04:34
I had all these ideas and, like,

133
00:04:34 --> 00:04:35
He taught me about Sonic Youth and

134
00:04:35 --> 00:04:37
Pixies, things I did not know.

135
00:04:37 --> 00:04:39
We were all trying to do feminist work that was kind of

136
00:04:39 --> 00:04:41
inspired by Jenny Holzer and Barbara Kruger.

137
00:04:41 --> 00:04:45
We were taking these photography classes, and when we brought

138
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
our work, we were treated as if we were crazy.

139
00:04:47 --> 00:04:48
I work on sexism.

140
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
I took pictures of books found in the library.

141
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
So, I did this thing that juxtaposes images of

142
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
women and then this picture of

143
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
little girl, like,

144
00:04:58 --> 00:05:00
portrait, and he said, &quot;pretend

145
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02
you like it &quot;on it, and then

146
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
He said, &quot;believe that you like&quot; on housewives.

147
00:05:05 --> 00:05:09
Because my work censored college we started a

148
00:05:09 --> 00:05:13
art gallery, type in an old garage, and was called

149
00:05:13 --> 00:05:14
reko of muse, and was thus a

150
00:05:14 --> 00:05:18
feminist art space that I and my friends started.

151
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
I think we were going at a very high level

152
00:05:21 --> 00:05:22
consciousness in terms of feminism

153
00:05:22 --> 00:05:24
and sexist portrayal of women.

154
00:05:24 --> 00:05:28
One really clear memory I have of Kathleen showing me one

155
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
copy of a copy of an article

156
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
&lt;I&gt; Time magazine - feminism is dead &quot;&lt;/ i&gt;?

157
00:05:33 --> 00:05:34
We both were very emotional,

158
00:05:34 --> 00:05:37
We could not be dead, because we were living it.

159
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
We were doing this and thinking it and feeling.

160
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
You know, how could he be dead?

161
00:05:43 --> 00:05:44
I was working on a project,

162
00:05:44 --> 00:05:45
fashion show, where I did everything

163
00:05:45 --> 00:05:46
clothes for a fashion show,

164
00:05:46 --> 00:05:47
and I serigrafei all these

165
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
fabrics and other things, using photography.

166
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
And I was working late at night

167
00:05:51 --> 00:05:56
in the laboratory, and while I was at work, my best friend was

168
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
assaulted in our house.

169
00:05:57 --> 00:05:58
She went into her bedroom and fell

170
00:05:58 --> 00:06:00
asleep and she woke up, and he was standing on his doorstep.

171
00:06:00 --> 00:06:01
He grabbed her by the neck, and

172
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
he began to drag her up the stairs.

173
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
And he was saying shit,

174
00:06:03 --> 00:06:05
&quot;I will rape you, then I&#39;ll kill you.&quot;

175
00:06:05 --> 00:06:06
And she was actually a great song.

176
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
It was the first time she was writing his own symphony.

177
00:06:08 --> 00:06:09
And she told me that when she

178
00:06:09 --> 00:06:12
was on the stairs, she thought, &quot;I&#39;ll finish my symphony

179
00:06:12 --> 00:06:13
fucking, &quot;and she just turned

180
00:06:13 --> 00:06:16
out and just, like, she punched him and broke free and fled.

181
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
And I came home, and she was, like, everything hurt.

182
00:06:19 --> 00:06:23
I was like, &#39;I have to make sure that this will never happen again. &quot;

183
00:06:23 --> 00:06:24
I made a dress that said &quot;as he

184
00:06:24 --> 00:06:25
He carried her up to her neck. &quot;

185
00:06:25 --> 00:06:26
I do not even want to finish,

186
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
but she was like, &quot;you have to finish it.&quot;

187
00:06:28 --> 00:06:29
So I ended up doing - that

188
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
project was just about me being able to finish something.

189
00:06:32 --> 00:06:33
And then I realized the

190
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
Through it, it was not just about that.

191
00:06:35 --> 00:06:38
It was, I had to get this thing that had happened to my

192
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
friend - had affected me - and put it in my work.

193
00:06:41 --> 00:06:41
I could not keep it out.

194
00:06:41 --> 00:06:45
Type, it was just totally impossible for me to keep it out.

195
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
I mean, I remember the first time I saw her, it was like,

196
00:06:48 --> 00:06:49
&quot;Who is this person that she

197
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
only have, like, this commanding presence? &quot;

198
00:06:51 --> 00:06:52
She&#39;s just like, &quot;yeah, I&#39;m doing

199
00:06:52 --> 00:06:53
a fashion show in the library building. &quot;

200
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
You know what I mean?

201
00:06:54 --> 00:06:54
It was like, &quot;We have only 18&quot;

202
00:06:54 --> 00:06:55
like, you know what I mean?

203
00:06:55 --> 00:06:56
What are you doing?

204
00:06:56 --> 00:06:59
Kathleen and I, we were both going to

205
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
evergreen state college.

206
00:07:01 --> 00:07:04
Our friends had this idea that was, like, called &quot;the

207
00:07:04 --> 00:07:05
Girl revolutionary style now. &quot;

208
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
This was about our idea.

00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
&lt;I&gt; I read Jigsaw, fanzine Tobi. &lt;/ I&gt;

212
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
And she was one of the only girls I knew who was

213
00:07:15 --> 00:07:16
talking about feminism and

214
00:07:16 --> 00:07:17
punk rock in the same sentence.

215
00:07:17 --> 00:07:18
Tobi was like, &quot;Kathi, you

216
00:07:18 --> 00:07:20
You know how to play guitar or something? &quot;

217
00:07:20 --> 00:07:21
I was like, &quot;no.&quot;

218
00:07:21 --> 00:07:22
&quot;You know how to play bass?&quot;

219
00:07:22 --> 00:07:22
&quot;No.&quot;

220
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
She&#39;s like, &quot;You want to start a band?&quot;

221
00:07:25 --> 00:07:26
And I, &quot;all right.&quot;

222
00:07:26 --> 00:07:27
Tobi was like, &quot;I think we

223
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
we should ask for this girl Kathleen be the vocalist. &quot;

224
00:07:30 --> 00:07:32
And I, &quot;Yes, we should&quot;

225
00:07:32 --> 00:07:34
Because it is perfect to be a singer.

226
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
You could not have a better singer.

227
00:07:36 --> 00:07:38
You could not ask for a better person from the front.

228
00:07:38 --> 00:07:39
And we all got together and

229
00:07:39 --> 00:07:40
We started playing in their parents Tobi.

230
00:07:40 --> 00:07:43
It was just the three of us, like, months and months.

231
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
We wanted a girl guitarist, but just could not do it.

232
00:07:45 --> 00:07:47
We would have people come play with us.

233
00:07:47 --> 00:07:48
But it just did not work.

234
00:07:48 --> 00:07:49
And then Tobi was like,

235
00:07:49 --> 00:07:51
&quot;I think we should invite my friend Bill.&quot;

236
00:07:51 --> 00:07:53
And I, &quot;Oh, I think we can try.&quot;

237
00:07:53 --> 00:07:58
And then that was it.

238
00:07:58 --> 00:07:58
We are the Bikini Kill.

239
00:07:58 --> 00:08:01
We are the Bikini Kill, and we want the style.

240
00:08:01 --> 00:08:07
girl Revolucionario now!

241
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
Hey, girlfriend, I have a proposal.

242
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
It goes something like this.

243
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14

244
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16

249
00:08:23 --> 00:08:24

250
00:08:24 --> 00:08:25
What everyone says about us

251
00:08:25 --> 00:08:26
was that we could not play our

252
00:08:26 --> 00:08:30
instruments, and we said, &quot;and?&quot;

253
00:08:30 --> 00:08:34
We were a young band getting a ton of attention in a scene

254
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
where there was a ton of bands,

255
00:08:36 --> 00:08:38
and everyone wanted attention.

256
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
And we do not realize it in

257
00:08:39 --> 00:08:41
time because we do not really we were careerists.

258
00:08:41 --> 00:08:42
We do not give a damn.

259
00:08:42 --> 00:08:43
We were not making money.

260
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
We knew we never were going to make money, and it was really

261
00:08:45 --> 00:08:46
important that we made our music.

262
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
We were on a mission, and we were going to do what we did,

263
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
paying attention or not.

264
00:08:50 --> 00:08:51
We were spreading the message

265
00:08:51 --> 00:08:52
on the road at our shows, delivering

266
00:08:52 --> 00:08:54
fliers, telling people what we were doing.

267
00:08:54 --> 00:08:57
Our fanzines were all about feminism and political issues.

268
00:08:57 --> 00:08:58
We just try to take things

269
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
feminist who read the books and

270
00:09:00 --> 00:09:02
then filter it through a punk rock lens.

271
00:09:02 --> 00:09:03
Just wait.

272
00:09:03 --> 00:09:04
Zoom it.

273
00:09:04 --> 00:09:05
In a hundred years, this

274
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
filming will be worth some money - no.

275
00:09:07 --> 00:09:10
Fanzine about me, for me.

276
00:09:10 --> 00:09:11
3-d cover.

277
00:09:11 --> 00:09:12
It will be red.

278
00:09:12 --> 00:09:13
It will be red.

279
00:09:13 --> 00:09:14
Ooh!

280
00:09:14 --> 00:09:16
Giving me a brochure on a show,

281
00:09:16 --> 00:09:18
delivering and smiling at

282
00:09:18 --> 00:09:22
me, that was the way communicates when Kathleen

283
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
she is on stage, singing very powerful lyrics.

284
00:09:25 --> 00:09:25
It was so great, you know?

285
00:09:25 --> 00:09:27
She has just brought it all, like, &quot;kapow!

286
00:09:27 --> 00:09:30
Here I am, and I will talk like this, and I&#39;ll sound

287
00:09:30 --> 00:09:31
as a &quot;valey girl,&quot; and I

288
00:09:31 --> 00:09:32
I will say is actually fully

289
00:09:32 --> 00:09:34
bright, and you have to take me seriously. &quot;

290
00:09:34 --> 00:09:35
I have an accent &quot;valley girl&quot;

291
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
the &quot;valley girl manual&quot;

292
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
and me and my best friend, Angela Cheever, we lived in

293
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
Maryland, and desperately wanted to be the kind of girls

294
00:09:43 --> 00:09:44
I had credit cards.

295
00:09:44 --> 00:09:45
I think we thought it was in

296
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
sound, like, rich.

297
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
We thought it was kind an elegant accent.

298
00:09:50 --> 00:09:52
This will show that you can

299
00:09:52 --> 00:09:54
just be, like, you know, I do not know

300
00:09:54 --> 00:09:58
You know, a girl from the valley, and you can still be smart and have

301
00:09:58 --> 00:10:05
feminist ideas, and you should still be heard.

302
00:10:05 --> 00:10:06
It was an exciting time for

303
00:10:06 --> 00:10:07
a lot of young women especially.

304
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
She was talking to women and wanting to connect with women.

305
00:10:10 --> 00:10:11
And so I think that&#39;s why

306
00:10:11 --> 00:10:14
intervention Bikini Kill was really necessary.

307
00:10:14 --> 00:10:17
It was, like, basically I and Tobi and Kathi.

308
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
We was like, &quot;let&#39;s take

309

314
00:10:34 --> 00:10:35
But they had Billy.

315
00:10:35 --> 00:10:36
He was a boy.

316
00:10:36 --> 00:10:41
But he was like - all the boys around him were kind of -

317
00:10:41 --> 00:10:43
&quot;We kind of need you to do something.

318
00:10:43 --> 00:10:47

This is for all the sons of bitches.

325
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
She was screaming at the top of his lungs.

326

It was the first time I saw a woman in full stage

333
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
angry, aggressive, doing things

334
00:11:19 --> 00:11:24
you see the guys doing, and it was amazing.

335
00:11:24 --> 00:11:25
Someone had to be Bikini Kill.

336
00:11:25 --> 00:11:26
As it had to happen, or

337
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
we would have all died of cultural hunger.

338
00:11:29 --> 00:11:32
It had to happen, and there they were.

339
00:11:32 --> 00:11:33
Girls ahead - that is

340
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
the only thing that has never happened before.

341
00:11:35 --> 00:11:36
Men could be in the room, but

342
00:11:36 --> 00:11:37
could never dominate the room.

343
00:11:37 --> 00:11:41
It was a flip of the script that blew people&#39;s minds.

344
00:11:41 --> 00:11:46
All this incredibly rich material that did what was punk

345
00:11:46 --> 00:11:50
had just been punched by the boy mosh pit, you know?

346
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
Just as Bikini Kill started when grunde was,

347
00:11:53 --> 00:11:54
like, going off the hook and

348
00:11:54 --> 00:11:57
when Nirvana was exploding, it was a wild scene.

349
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
It was very physical,

350
00:11:59 --> 00:12:04
violent, as all mosh, all those things.

351
00:12:04 --> 00:12:05
These young people, who wanted

352
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
be a part of the scene, they wanted to physically go to

353
00:12:08 --> 00:12:09
show, wanted to enter this

354
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
punk rock scene, we were physically being run over

355
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
The problem with our show a lot of times, a lot of guys

356
00:12:13 --> 00:12:14
They would get too out of control

357
00:12:14 --> 00:12:15
and start, like, beat everyone.

358
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
The more girls in front, the better, and if someone is

359
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
fucking with you on this show because of certain reasons and

360
00:12:20 --> 00:12:21
you need to come in front, come

361
00:12:21 --> 00:12:24
in front and sit on stage and stay away from them and let

362
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
We know, because it should not be only one person in

363
00:12:27 --> 00:12:30
responsibility of the crowd to deal with the motherfuckers.

364
00:12:30 --> 00:12:33
Every show we did was like a war.

365
00:12:33 --> 00:12:35
Guys trying to beat us and stuff, you know?

366
00:12:35 --> 00:12:36
It was very violent, and we

367
00:12:36 --> 00:12:37
only we played in these crazy places,

368
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
as bowling alleys, and they

369
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
crowded, like, 600 people there and other things.

370
00:12:42 --> 00:12:42
You know, there is no security.

371
00:12:42 --> 00:12:43
We wanted to getting girls

372
00:12:43 --> 00:12:44
in front of our shows most of the time

373
00:12:44 --> 00:12:45
because we needed it.

374
00:12:45 --> 00:12:47
be protected, and I felt like there was a queue of girls

375
00:12:47 --> 00:12:49
front of them, I would be safe.

376
00:12:49 --> 00:12:50
Physically it was not

377
00:12:50 --> 00:12:52
space for young women are safe in these shows.

378
00:12:52 --> 00:12:53
And that was a big part of what

379
00:12:53 --> 00:12:57
Kathleen did was say that is unacceptable.

380
00:12:57 --> 00:12:58
&quot;Fuck.

381
00:12:58 --> 00:12:59
You will change now.

382
00:12:59 --> 00:13:00
And if you do not get the fuck

383
00:13:00 --> 00:13:01
the delicate suggestion, we will

384
00:13:01 --> 00:13:03
clearly direct you on what to do. &quot;

385
00:13:03 --> 00:13:04
It was shocking.

386
00:13:04 --> 00:13:07
They just did not expect this kind of orders coming

387
00:13:07 --> 00:13:08
a person of that size, that

388
00:13:08 --> 00:13:11
person of that kind in a fucking dress.

389
00:13:11 --> 00:13:15
When I started writing the book, the more I

390
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
researched, the more respect I had the good kind

391
00:13:19 --> 00:13:21
thinker Kathleen is.

392
00:13:21 --> 00:13:25
she was crystallizing a feeling widely held in a

393
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
artistic format really irresistible.

394
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
She would instruct people.

395
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
&quot;Here is a small excerpt of our fanzine.

396
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
Maybe if you could go to the bottom. &quot;

397
00:13:35 --> 00:13:39
Like, that was it - it was a kind of authorization and

398
00:13:39 --> 00:13:43
surreal experience because you were not really used to be

399
00:13:43 --> 00:13:47
I talked to the stage.

400
00:13:47 --> 00:13:48
Hi.

401
00:13:48 --> 00:13:49
It was like, &quot;Oh, the music is

402
00:13:49 --> 00:13:51
supposed to be escapist, &quot;and was not.

403
00:13:51 --> 00:13:52
He was immobilizing her.

404
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
He was making music a voice for

405
00:13:54 --> 00:13:58
a lot of people who had not been heard before.

406
00:13:58 --> 00:14:01
I remember the song &quot;feel blind.&quot;

407
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
&quot;All the doves go through

408
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05

00:14:05 --> 00:14:06

410
00:14:06 --> 00:14:06
Sit blind.

412
00:14:07 --> 00:14:09
This world has taught me anything. &quot;

413
00:14:09 --> 00:14:10
I mean, like, I&#39;m still, like,

414
00:14:10 --> 00:14:12
getting chills when I think about those words.

The way Kathleen delivered that line was so angry.

It was so out of reality

425
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46

430
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
They brought it into the open.

431
00:14:59 --> 00:15:00
She wanted to talk about these things.

432
00:15:00 --> 00:15:01
You know, you&#39;re objectifying women.

433

What does that mean?

443
00:15:21 --> 00:15:22
I mean, I remember thinking

444
00:15:22 --> 00:15:24
that everyone in the band was

445
00:15:24 --> 00:15:27
incredibly powerful and interesting to watch.

446
00:15:27 --> 00:15:30
And we were doing some dates with nirvana.

447
00:15:30 --> 00:15:33
I think Tobi was still involved with Kurt.

448
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
Kurt has a history with Bikini Kill.

449
00:15:35 --> 00:15:38
He is very attached to Kathleen and what she was doing.

450
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
Any good biography of Kurt Cobain now recognizes

451
00:15:41 --> 00:15:42
he did not leave

452
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
hesher rock in the Pacific Northwest.

453
00:15:44 --> 00:15:47
He left feminist art-punk, you know?

454
00:15:47 --> 00:15:50
He said that at that time.

455
00:15:50 --> 00:15:52
Kurt was a very charismatic person.

456
00:15:52 --> 00:15:53
I kind of started to leave

457
00:15:53 --> 00:15:55
with him, because I had a boyfriend who became a

458
00:15:55 --> 00:15:57
addicted to crack, and then it started, like, stalking me.

459
00:15:57 --> 00:15:58
And I was known as a feminist,

460
00:15:58 --> 00:15:59
and I felt I could not ask

461
00:15:59 --> 00:16:01
to help people, because I thought they think,

462
00:16:01 --> 00:16:02
&quot;She&#39;s making much of a big deal

463
00:16:02 --> 00:16:03
out of it, because she is a feminist. &quot;

464
00:16:03 --> 00:16:07
And the only person who believed in me was my friend Kurt.

465
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
I was his friend for life at that time.

466
00:16:10 --> 00:16:11
He stuck to me.

467
00:16:11 --> 00:16:14
He was, like, the only person who was for me.

468
00:16:14 --> 00:16:19
I wrote: &quot;Kurt smells like Teen Spirit&quot; on his wall

469
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
apartment after spray-painted

470
00:16:21 --> 00:16:24
the side of a fake abortion clinic.

471
00:16:24 --> 00:16:26
Kurt-painted spray, &quot;God is gay.&quot;

472
00:16:26 --> 00:16:32
We were so lost, so lost, super fucking wasted.

473
00:16:32 --> 00:16:34
And the next day, I swore off

474
00:16:34 --> 00:16:39
alcohol, and I did not drink for six years.

475
00:16:39 --> 00:16:41
Olympia is a great scenario in terms of community.

476
00:16:41 --> 00:16:44
But in terms of policy, it was kind of hard for us.

477
00:16:44 --> 00:16:46
We thought it would be cool if we moved to DC, where there

478
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
was already a precedent for bands like us - not really

479
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
women&#39;s bands, bands but at least they were interested in

480
00:16:50 --> 00:16:51
what was happening in the world.

481
00:16:51 --> 00:16:52
So, we moved with our friends

482
00:16:52 --> 00:16:55
Bratmobile the band, and that&#39;s where all the

483
00:16:55 --> 00:16:56
grrrl thing riot started really.

484
00:16:56 --> 00:16:57
There were all these things

485
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
in the late 80s and early 90s,

486
00:16:59 --> 00:17:00
as Anita Hill / Clarence Thomas,

487
00:17:00 --> 00:17:02
rape trial William Kennedy Smith.

488
00:17:02 --> 00:17:03
There were things that happened

489
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
all in a very quick succession

490
00:17:05 --> 00:17:06
that our generations of people,

491
00:17:06 --> 00:17:07
they were like, 18 and 19 in

492
00:17:07 --> 00:17:10
late 80s, tried it, and we knew they were wrong.

493
00:17:10 --> 00:17:11
There was absolute pandemonium

494
00:17:11 --> 00:17:12
in front of the university building,

495
00:17:12 --> 00:17:14
as ambulances carried away the wounded.

496
00:17:14 --> 00:17:18
Police have confirmed 14 dead students, all women.

497
00:17:18 --> 00:17:21
Dozens of people were injured, trapped in a turmoil

498
00:17:21 --> 00:17:22
witnesses called a human hunt,

499
00:17:22 --> 00:17:24
with the shooter shouting: &quot;I want women.&quot;

500
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
Our friend Jen Smith said: &quot;You know what we need?

501
00:17:26 --> 00:17:27
We need a bad girl. &quot;

502
00:17:27 --> 00:17:30
Tobi had talked about &quot;angry girl&quot; with many Rs.

503
00:17:30 --> 00:17:31
The combination of that

504
00:17:31 --> 00:17:34
Jen Smith and Tobi said became &quot;riot grrrl&quot;.

505
00:17:34 --> 00:17:37
&lt;I&gt; So we made a &#39;zine called grrrl shock. &lt;/ I&gt;

506
00:17:37 --> 00:17:38
&lt;I&gt; The grrrl original riot &lt;/ i&gt;

507
00:17:38 --> 00:17:40
zine, was mainly Kathleen Hanna, Allison Wolfe,

508
00:17:40 --> 00:17:43
and Molly Newman Bratmobile, Jen Smith and

509
00:17:43 --> 00:17:45
Tobi Vail, the drummer of Bikini Kill.

510
00:17:45 --> 00:17:46
Allison and I went to a punk

511
00:17:46 --> 00:17:47
show with a clipboard, and we

512
00:17:47 --> 00:17:48
just walked up to the girls, and we

513
00:17:48 --> 00:17:49
were like, &quot;We want to have a

514
00:17:49 --> 00:17:52
only girls against where we just talk maybe about starting a

515
00:17:52 --> 00:17:55
magazine or doing projects, playing punk music and starting

516
00:17:55 --> 00:17:56
a scene and kind of take over. &quot;

517
00:17:56 --> 00:17:57
We have to make the first

518
00:17:57 --> 00:18:01
meeting grrrl turmoil in the positive power house.

519
00:18:01 --> 00:18:02
Our first meeting was, like, he

520
00:18:02 --> 00:18:03
It was very intense, and, as

521
00:18:03 --> 00:18:04
it turned out, they just wanted

522
00:18:04 --> 00:18:06
go out and talk without men being there.

523
00:18:06 --> 00:18:07
They wanted to talk about sexual abuse.

524
00:18:07 --> 00:18:09
They wanted to talk about leaving and information and

525
00:18:09 --> 00:18:10
share information among themselves.

526
00:18:10 --> 00:18:13
In fact, I wrote a riot grrrl manifesto killing bikini

527
00:18:13 --> 00:18:14
fanzine called &quot;grrrl power&quot;.

528
00:18:14 --> 00:18:17
And I wrote what I dreamed riot grrrl could be and

529
00:18:17 --> 00:18:19
other girls and women encouraged

530
00:18:19 --> 00:18:20
to write their manifestos

531
00:18:20 --> 00:18:21
what they wanted grrrl be mutiny.

532
00:18:21 --> 00:18:24
The idea was that any woman anywhere can take that name

533
00:18:24 --> 00:18:26
and use it and create anything she wanted.

534
00:18:26 --> 00:18:28
We do not mark it or copyright or something.

535
00:18:28 --> 00:18:29
It belonged to everyone.

536
00:18:29 --> 00:18:30
We all felt like, &quot;look.

537
00:18:30 --> 00:18:31
Here are some ideas.

538
00:18:31 --> 00:18:32

00:18:38 --> 00:18:40
Feminism had been a kind of fear of pop-culture music.

542
00:18:40 --> 00:18:41
It was very good at protest

543
00:18:41 --> 00:18:42
that and it&#39;s not good to do so.

544
00:18:42 --> 00:18:43
And so grrrl riot was doing it.

545
00:18:43 --> 00:18:44
He was making &#39;zines, and was

546
00:18:44 --> 00:18:46
making rock bands, and was talking to people.

547
00:18:46 --> 00:18:51
And Kathleen was a great motivator than that.

548
00:18:51 --> 00:18:53
First wave of feminism began in

549
00:18:53 --> 00:18:55
1848 Seneca Falls conference.

550
00:18:55 --> 00:18:57
It was the first time that women

551
00:18:57 --> 00:18:59
organized on behalf of themselves.

552
00:18:59 --> 00:19:00
They all became abolitionists.

553
00:19:00 --> 00:19:01
They opposed slavery.

554
00:19:01 --> 00:19:04
It was a movement for human rights, but they were not equal

555
00:19:04 --> 00:19:05
Members of this movement.

556
00:19:05 --> 00:19:07
So they turned their consciousness awakened in themselves and

557
00:19:07 --> 00:19:09
their organizational skills to you and said, &quot;we need

558
00:19:09 --> 00:19:11
our own independent movement for our own rights. &quot;

559
00:19:11 --> 00:19:13
So, this first wave of the women&#39;s movement focused

560
00:19:13 --> 00:19:17
on citizenship, and this is more symbolized by the vote.

561
00:19:17 --> 00:19:19
There was a wave of new activism, leaving the

562
00:19:19 --> 00:19:20
the civil rights movement and

563
00:19:20 --> 00:19:22
the peace movement and the free movement of speech.

564
00:19:22 --> 00:19:23
Thus, women who were part of the

565
00:19:23 --> 00:19:25
these movements possibly turned their raised

566
00:19:25 --> 00:19:26
awareness of themselves and

567
00:19:26 --> 00:19:28
said, &quot;we need to have our own independent movement for our

568
00:19:28 --> 00:19:30
rights, equality, to be treated as full human beings. &quot;

569
00:19:30 --> 00:19:32
The main objective of the second wave was equal.

570
00:19:32 --> 00:19:36
That was the wave of activism that was the second wave.

571
00:19:36 --> 00:19:39
The article by Rebecca Walker &quot;become a third wave&quot; - ​​so,

572
00:19:39 --> 00:19:42
she used that term, and that&#39;s why she, her mother was

573
00:19:42 --> 00:19:45
Alice Walker, and she was a daughter of the second wave, and

574
00:19:45 --> 00:19:46
she was trying to find a way to

575
00:19:46 --> 00:19:49
say, &quot;We are different, but we are part of this story.&quot;

576
00:19:49 --> 00:19:51
Third Wave was founded in

577
00:19:51 --> 00:19:53
response to a feeling in college

578
00:19:53 --> 00:19:57
campuses in 1992, that feminism was, in a sense, dead

579
00:19:57 --> 00:20:02
irrelevant that women of my generation were apathetic, not

580
00:20:02 --> 00:20:08
willing to work on behalf of women&#39;s empowerment.

581
00:20:08 --> 00:20:09
You can not exaggerate your

582
00:20:09 --> 00:20:11
importance for feminism of the third wave.

583
00:20:11 --> 00:20:12
She was incredibly inspiring.

584
00:20:12 --> 00:20:13
It was a kind of first person

585
00:20:13 --> 00:20:16
to come and say, &quot;this is what feminism will look

A lot of the music has to DC

639
00:21:48 --> 00:21:50
monumental sound that may not

00:21:52 --> 00:21:53
It&#39;s like this great feeling

642
00:21:53 --> 00:21:54
it is very important that what

643
00:21:54 --> 00:21:55
we are doing is super-important.

644
00:21:55 --> 00:21:57
We are so close to the seat of power.

645
00:21:57 --> 00:22:00
And then these bands are doing this huge-sounding music, but

646
00:22:00 --> 00:22:02
on the material that is totally different than the

647
00:22:02 --> 00:22:02
politicians are doing.

&lt;I&gt; USA Today reporter came and &lt;/ i&gt;

659
00:22:31 --> 00:22:34
then he wrote this really condescending thing about it

660
00:22:34 --> 00:22:35
we were doing and focused on

661
00:22:35 --> 00:22:36
that our clothes looked and

662
00:22:36 --> 00:22:37
what our bodies looked.

663
00:22:37 --> 00:22:40
We should be all survivors of sexual abuse, because we are singing

664
00:22:40 --> 00:22:43
about rape, and therefore no one has any imagination or

665
00:22:43 --> 00:22:44
You know someone who had things

666
00:22:44 --> 00:22:45
We had things happen to them.

667
00:22:45 --> 00:22:47
Therefore, we should all have had such tragic stories.

668
00:22:47 --> 00:22:51
It was very frustrating for many of us, especially

669
00:22:51 --> 00:22:53
another woman would write

670
00:22:53 --> 00:22:56
something that we thought it was so stupid.

671
00:22:56 --> 00:22:58
So we just decided to stop thinking about it and talking

672
00:22:58 --> 00:22:59
about it and just do not answer

673
00:22:59 --> 00:23:01
the phone when reporters called.

674
00:23:01 --> 00:23:04
And that was what everyone called a press blackout.

675
00:23:04 --> 00:23:05
They&#39;re like, &quot;No, actually,

676
00:23:05 --> 00:23:06
you will not fuck co-op this bloody revolution.

677
00:23:06 --> 00:23:06
Fuck.

678
00:23:06 --> 00:23:08
It is not really going televised.

679
00:23:08 --> 00:23:08
That was great.

680
00:23:08 --> 00:23:10
It was very clear, and it was

681
00:23:10 --> 00:23:12
something he was thinking too much

682
00:23:12 --> 00:23:14
greater than many of us did.

683
00:23:14 --> 00:23:17
People involved with riot grrrl were reluctant to do

684
00:23:17 --> 00:23:18
interviews with dominant

685
00:23:18 --> 00:23:20
&lt;I&gt; press or rolling stone or people &lt;/ i&gt;

686
00:23:20 --> 00:23:23
who became interested and learned movement.

687
00:23:23 --> 00:23:24
It&#39;s hard to see

688
00:23:24 --> 00:23:26
written about or talked about

689
00:23:26 --> 00:23:28
a third person or some context removed.

690
00:23:28 --> 00:23:30
It is always only will seem wrong somehow.

691
00:23:30 --> 00:23:31
The facts are wrong.

692
00:23:31 --> 00:23:32
Something is wrong.

693
00:23:32 --> 00:23:32
It is always wrong.

694
00:23:32 --> 00:23:34
It was also for their own self-preservation and

695
00:23:34 --> 00:23:35
protection because people were

696
00:23:35 --> 00:23:36
just tearing her apart publicly

697
00:23:36 --> 00:23:38
and revealing a lot of personal

698
00:23:38 --> 00:23:41
things about her that she had not chosen to reveal.

699
00:23:41 --> 00:23:42
As things become so

700
00:23:42 --> 00:23:48
distorted and taken out of his hands.

701
00:23:48 --> 00:23:49
There was an article in

702
00:23:49 --> 00:23:51
&lt;I&gt; Washington Post, and &lt;/ i&gt;

703
00:23:51 --> 00:23:53
He said my father raped me.

704
00:23:53 --> 00:23:54
And I never talked to a reporter.

705
00:23:54 --> 00:23:55
I never said that.

706
00:23:55 --> 00:23:56
And I will say now about

707
00:23:56 --> 00:23:58
camera my father did not rape me.

708
00:23:58 --> 00:24:00
My father was sexually inappropriate.

709
00:24:00 --> 00:24:02
He was not a great father.

710
00:24:02 --> 00:24:06
He was physically and verbally abusive at times.

711
00:24:06 --> 00:24:11
But he did not rape me physically.

712
00:24:11 --> 00:24:14
I make a distinction between sexual inadequacy and

713
00:24:14 --> 00:24:20
abuse in my mind, because I know

714
00:24:20 --> 00:24:22
stories of other people who are

715
00:24:22 --> 00:24:26
super horrible, and as much more terrible than mine.

716
00:24:26 --> 00:24:28
And this is not just my story.

717
00:24:28 --> 00:24:30
And I was really upset when he said it.

718
00:24:30 --> 00:24:32
And it taught me a great lesson on how a lot of reporters

719
00:24:32 --> 00:24:33
non-fact check anything.

720
00:24:33 --> 00:24:34
Instead of being as sat

721
00:24:34 --> 00:24:35
around being upset about it, I

722
00:24:35 --> 00:24:38
I thought it was really important that I kept making music and

723
00:24:38 --> 00:24:39
I was on tour and

724
00:24:39 --> 00:24:45
other girls have to listen to what we were doing.

I had never seen killing bikini

747
00:25:33 --> 00:25:34
&quot;Summersault&quot; play up tour.

748
00:25:34 --> 00:25:37
Mike my band, he had a bikini kill 7 inches, and was

749
00:25:37 --> 00:25:38
one of those things like, &quot;oh,

750
00:25:38 --> 00:25:40
shoot, you have to listen to this album. &quot;

751
00:25:40 --> 00:25:41
And then his wife, tamra,

752
00:25:41 --> 00:25:43
who is a filmmaker, interviewed Kathleen.

753
00:25:43 --> 00:25:44
We were watching this thing

754
00:25:44 --> 00:25:47
she did, and she was shagging Kathleen being interviewed

755
00:25:47 --> 00:25:48
wearing a ski mask on, like, a

756
00:25:48 --> 00:25:49
stairwell somewhere, and I was

757
00:25:49 --> 00:25:50
like, &quot;what the hell is going on?

758
00:25:50 --> 00:25:51
This is serious. &quot;

759
00:25:51 --> 00:25:52
And so I was very interested.

760
00:25:52 --> 00:25:54
I made a video called &quot;no alternative girl&quot; and

761
00:25:54 --> 00:25:55
Kathleen Hanna was in it, and

762
00:25:55 --> 00:25:57
she was doing a media blackout at the time.

763
00:25:57 --> 00:25:58
So she said she would appear in

764
00:25:58 --> 00:25:59
the video, but she would not let her face be in it.

765
00:25:59 --> 00:26:00
Then she used the ski mask.

766
00:26:00 --> 00:26:03
And then I worked with her again with the sonic youth, when we

767
00:26:03 --> 00:26:07
He made the video &quot;bull in Heather.&quot;

768
00:26:07 --> 00:26:08
And so when Bikini Kill was

769
00:26:08 --> 00:26:09
tour, Kathleen was there, and

770
00:26:09 --> 00:26:11
Adam was going through this terrible separation.

771
00:26:11 --> 00:26:12
I was totally trying to get them

772
00:26:12 --> 00:26:13
together because I thought they

773
00:26:13 --> 00:26:14
It would be friends, at least, but

774
00:26:14 --> 00:26:16
Also, they had much in common, it seemed.

775
00:26:16 --> 00:26:17
And I thought it would be Kathleen

776
00:26:17 --> 00:26:19
someone really good for Adam to speak.

777
00:26:19 --> 00:26:22
So ... &gt;&gt; Yeah, that was interesting.

778
00:26:22 --> 00:26:29
I wanted to be encouraging, but I was also afraid.

779
00:26:29 --> 00:26:31
Bikini Kill was super punk rock, and then he remembered

780
00:26:31 --> 00:26:34
me, like, you know, when I was in a hardcore band when I

781
00:26:34 --> 00:26:35
was a child, this sense of fair,

782
00:26:35 --> 00:26:36
like, &quot;we will do everything

783
00:26:36 --> 00:26:38
will do, &quot;and it was amazing to see.

784
00:26:38 --> 00:26:40
To see this punk group, and

785
00:26:40 --> 00:26:42
It was all the girls in front, and all

786
00:26:42 --> 00:26:45
only girls just all on stage.

787
00:26:45 --> 00:26:47
And, you know, for the shows of the guys,

788
00:26:47 --> 00:26:50
it&#39;s like, &quot;get out of my stage.&quot;

789
00:26:50 --> 00:26:51
You know what I mean?

790
00:26:51 --> 00:26:55
And then, Kathleen was only a force, such as a full-on force.

791
00:26:55 --> 00:26:57
As a car accident - you can not look away.

792
00:26:57 --> 00:26:58
But you know what I mean.

793
00:26:58 --> 00:26:59
I mean, a good car accident.

794
00:26:59 --> 00:27:00
I did not mean that.

795
00:27:00 --> 00:27:03
You know, you&#39;re like, &quot;What the fuck?&quot;

796
00:27:03 --> 00:27:06
We skate one night in Adelaide.

797
00:27:06 --> 00:27:09
I did not realize - it was very sneaky, I guess.

798
00:27:09 --> 00:27:11
And she was like, &quot;hey, who wants to go skating?&quot;

799
00:27:11 --> 00:27:15
And I was like, &quot;uh, I&#39;ll skate.&quot;

800
00:27:15 --> 00:27:17
Hey, Kathleen.

801
00:27:17 --> 00:27:18
Hmm?

802
00:27:18 --> 00:27:19
Let&#39;s go.

803
00:27:19 --> 00:27:20
I dry myself.

804
00:27:20 --> 00:27:21
What is going on?

805
00:27:21 --> 00:27:22
I&#39;m not telling you.

806
00:27:22 --> 00:27:22
Dry up.

807
00:27:22 --> 00:27:23
Get - get out of here!

808
00:27:23 --> 00:27:23
Dry up.

809
00:27:23 --> 00:27:26
Initially, it was really difficult to make their worlds

810
00:27:26 --> 00:27:27
together, but not because they

811
00:27:27 --> 00:27:28
You do not have things in common, but

812
00:27:28 --> 00:27:30
just because the - which is

813
00:27:30 --> 00:27:32
my friends think or my community or something?

814
00:27:32 --> 00:27:33
I was dating someone,

815
00:27:33 --> 00:27:34
as he wrote &quot;Girls, girls, girls

816
00:27:34 --> 00:27:36
wash my clothes &quot;and shit like that in the 80s.

817
00:27:36 --> 00:27:37
So I was, like, &quot;What does this

818
00:27:37 --> 00:27:38
to say I am a feminist artist,

819
00:27:38 --> 00:27:40
and I&#39;m dating that person, and I&#39;m so in love with him? &quot;

820
00:27:40 --> 00:27:41
And as I realized that

821
00:27:41 --> 00:27:43
you can not legislate kind of who you fall in love.

822
00:27:43 --> 00:27:44
Like, I was totally in love with

823
00:27:44 --> 00:27:47
he, and there was no way I was not going out with him.

824
00:27:47 --> 00:27:49
I&#39;m sure you did a little exciting, and as,

825
00:27:49 --> 00:27:50
risky-feeling, but it only

826
00:27:50 --> 00:27:53
really opened my eyes that you kind of fall in love with who

827
00:27:53 --> 00:27:54
you fall in love.

828
00:27:54 --> 00:27:55
And I could not do anything about it.

829
00:27:55 --> 00:27:56
But I freaked out.

830
00:27:56 --> 00:28:00

836
00:28:16 --> 00:28:18
After all the tour took place, they had this

837
00:28:18 --> 00:28:20
long distance relationship, where they were only

838
00:28:20 --> 00:28:22
communicate via phone or write another.

839
00:28:22 --> 00:28:24
There was a period when they were not, as - we

840
00:28:24 --> 00:28:26
do things in public, and we were really private.

841
00:28:26 --> 00:28:28
But it was kind of both of our choices.

842
00:28:28 --> 00:28:29
So it was not really like us

843
00:28:29 --> 00:28:34
They were hiding, but I could see how it appeared so.

844
00:28:34 --> 00:28:38
The thing is about Bikini Kill - they were seen

845
00:28:38 --> 00:28:40
to and examined so closely

846
00:28:40 --> 00:28:43
and I had this certain level of celebrity.

847
00:28:43 --> 00:28:46
But they were still barely making rent.

848
00:28:46 --> 00:28:48
They were still in a fucking van

849
00:28:48 --> 00:28:50
that could easily break.

850
00:28:50 --> 00:28:53
They were still sleeping on strange ground.

851
00:28:53 --> 00:28:56
Bikini Kill was just, like, this strange disorder, and

852
00:28:56 --> 00:28:58
there was a lot of tension between us.

853
00:28:58 --> 00:29:00
You know, we all mixed up,

854
00:29:00 --> 00:29:02
as strange functions of whom were

855
00:29:02 --> 00:29:04
in the band, and it was kind of

856
00:29:04 --> 00:29:06
simply impossible to leave them.

857
00:29:06 --> 00:29:07
What is Bikini Kill?

858
00:29:07 --> 00:29:08
Bikini Kill is forever in flux,

859
00:29:08 --> 00:29:11
and it is quite impossible for us to discuss it, because

860
00:29:11 --> 00:29:12
it&#39;s always changing.

861
00:29:12 --> 00:29:15
And that&#39;s why it is very difficult for us to do interviews and

862
00:29:15 --> 00:29:18
also because all four of us do not agree on anything ever.

863
00:29:18 --> 00:29:19
And it&#39;s really hard

864
00:29:19 --> 00:29:21
separate what you can really say about it.

865
00:29:21 --> 00:29:24
Our relationships as four people disintegrated because we

866
00:29:24 --> 00:29:27
They were not always looking at each other and deal with

867
00:29:27 --> 00:29:29
problems that each of us had.

868
00:29:29 --> 00:29:31
I was in Bikini Kill, like, eight years.

869
00:29:31 --> 00:29:32
It&#39;s time for a girl band.

870
00:29:32 --> 00:29:33
And to be under the magnifying glass

871
00:29:33 --> 00:29:34
glass and kind of stuck wax

872
00:29:34 --> 00:29:36
as we were, it&#39;s a long, long time.

873
00:29:36 --> 00:29:37
His work seemed to make it

874
00:29:37 --> 00:29:38
feel isolated more, and as

875
00:29:38 --> 00:29:39
reaction to his band seemed

876
00:29:39 --> 00:29:40
make it feel like it was set

877
00:29:40 --> 00:29:43
in addition to his bandmates and set apart from the girls in

878
00:29:43 --> 00:29:44
grrrl riot and set apart from

879
00:29:44 --> 00:29:47
others in the punk scene, and at the same time, its

880
00:29:47 --> 00:29:51
music and art was to bring people together so much.

881
00:29:51 --> 00:29:52
I think Kathleen struggled

882
00:29:52 --> 00:29:54
with the leading role at times.

883
00:29:54 --> 00:29:57
She had a lot of responsibility that comes with it.

884
00:29:57 --> 00:30:00
She definitely struggled with it, the kind of implications

885
00:30:00 --> 00:30:06
that has both a person&#39;s reputation.

886
00:30:06 --> 00:30:08
You can ... &gt;&gt; Louder. I&#39;m having trouble.

887
00:30:08 --> 00:30:10
I did not want to be the leader or appointed.

888
00:30:10 --> 00:30:13
And, I mean, I&#39;m sure Gloria can sympathize with

889
00:30:13 --> 00:30:14
position of being, getting a

890
00:30:14 --> 00:30:16
very negative media attention.

891
00:30:16 --> 00:30:17
It looks like you&#39;re the type

892
00:30:17 --> 00:30:19
get kicked in the face by both sides.

893
00:30:19 --> 00:30:22
On the one hand, I was working in the media.

894
00:30:22 --> 00:30:26
On the other hand, I was trying to avoid being singled out.

895
00:30:26 --> 00:30:28
It is not always successful.

896
00:30:28 --> 00:30:31
It&#39;s not always under your control, but I think

897
00:30:31 --> 00:30:32
challenge is how

898
00:30:32 --> 00:30:34
to use it to transmit message come.

899
00:30:34 --> 00:30:37
I&#39;m not wiling to deal with the more mainstream when

900
00:30:37 --> 00:30:40
they are constantly asking me about sexual abuse,

901
00:30:40 --> 00:30:43
And if I have been a stripper, if I have not been a stripper,

902
00:30:43 --> 00:30:45
constantly shit just completely chauvinistic, where they are

903
00:30:45 --> 00:30:48
trying to call the band that I am or the projects I am

904
00:30:48 --> 00:30:50
involved with against other women who I respect in

905
00:30:50 --> 00:30:53
community, coming, you know, saying &quot;so and so said

906
00:30:53 --> 00:30:54
so and so about you &quot;to get you

907
00:30:54 --> 00:30:56
slag off another woman so they can print,

908
00:30:56 --> 00:30:58
&quot;Kathleen Hanna does not like PJ Harvey.&quot;

909
00:30:58 --> 00:31:01
You know, like, you know, and creating all these schisms

910
00:31:01 --> 00:31:02
because it sells newspapers.

911
00:31:02 --> 00:31:03
This is the thing that is

912
00:31:03 --> 00:31:05
It happened since the beginning of time.

913
00:31:05 --> 00:31:06
You ask a woman about another

914
00:31:06 --> 00:31:07
woman and trying to get her to say

915
00:31:07 --> 00:31:08
something bad, and then you make

916
00:31:08 --> 00:31:09
the article all about the fight.

917
00:31:09 --> 00:31:10
Lollapalooza news, however,

918
00:31:10 --> 00:31:11
Courtney Love, one of the tour

919
00:31:11 --> 00:31:13
headliners this year, with its hole band was officially

920
00:31:13 --> 00:31:15
charged with fourth-degree assault for this week, as she

921
00:31:15 --> 00:31:16
He acknowledged in a recent online

922
00:31:16 --> 00:31:17
rant, punching the Bikini Kill

923
00:31:17 --> 00:31:19
singer Kathleen Hanna backstage at a show at Lollapalooza

924
00:31:19 --> 00:31:20
July 4, a first-incident

925
00:31:20 --> 00:31:23
also reported online, Thurston Moore

926
00:31:23 --> 00:31:24
sonic-topping youth account.

927
00:31:24 --> 00:31:25
We Lollapalooza.

928
00:31:25 --> 00:31:27
Kathleen was there, and she was

929
00:31:27 --> 00:31:29
standing on the stage, watching

930
00:31:29 --> 00:31:31
us, and Courtney Love, basically,

931
00:31:31 --> 00:31:33
just punched in the face.

932
00:31:33 --> 00:31:36
And that was the beginning of our tour.

933
00:31:36 --> 00:31:37
I mean, there&#39;s all

934
00:31:37 --> 00:31:39
Lollapalooza punching thing Courtney Love.

935
00:31:39 --> 00:31:42
No, love Courtney punched her.

936
00:31:42 --> 00:31:45
See, I do not know - I .. I can not trust the Internet.

937
00:31:45 --> 00:31:47
That&#39;s the thing that pisses me off is that later,

938
00:31:47 --> 00:31:48
people, &quot;they fought!

939
00:31:48 --> 00:31:50
There was this rivalry, and they fought. &quot;

940
00:31:50 --> 00:31:52
It&#39;s like, &quot;Man, I was there watching a band, and

941
00:31:52 --> 00:31:53
Courtney came and attacked me. &quot;

942
00:31:53 --> 00:31:54
I think people do not realize

943
00:31:54 --> 00:31:56
Kathleen and Courtney did not know.

944
00:31:56 --> 00:31:57
It&#39;s a real bummer to be hit.

945
00:31:57 --> 00:31:58
Sucks. Is not cool.

946
00:31:58 --> 00:31:59
It&#39;s a real bummer if you are a

947
00:31:59 --> 00:32:00
feminist, and you are robbed

948
00:32:00 --> 00:32:02
for another woman, because it is just a kind of heartbreaking,

949
00:32:02 --> 00:32:03
especially a woman you are

950
00:32:03 --> 00:32:08
kind of hope that you could be a kind of allies.

951
00:32:08 --> 00:32:10
I think a lot of people who have air near Kathleen

952
00:32:10 --> 00:32:12
worried about her safety for a variety of reasons.

953
00:32:12 --> 00:32:16
You know, she&#39;s experienced violence in their direction really

954
00:32:16 --> 00:32:20
aggressive forms that no one should have to experience.

955
00:32:20 --> 00:32:23
Hate to Bikini Kill and specifically Kathleen.

956
00:32:23 --> 00:32:25
She would get letters from

957
00:32:25 --> 00:32:28
guys who were like, &quot;You must die.&quot;

958
00:32:28 --> 00:32:31
They just wanted, like, stamp it.

959
00:32:31 --> 00:32:34
And I do not know why.

960
00:32:34 --> 00:32:35
I remember things like that

961
00:32:35 --> 00:32:37
would happen, and he would feel totally shit.

962
00:32:37 --> 00:32:38
And I was like, I had children

963
00:32:38 --> 00:32:39
write me, saying, like, you

964
00:32:39 --> 00:32:40
know, &quot;I was going to kill me,

965
00:32:40 --> 00:32:42
and I have your record, and you saved my life. &quot;

966
00:32:42 --> 00:32:44
And all I could say back is, like, &quot;You saved my life, too,

967
00:32:44 --> 00:32:45
because I could not pass

968
00:32:45 --> 00:32:47
all - not critical, but

969
00:32:47 --> 00:32:52
all the hate I have thrown my way. &quot;

970
00:32:52 --> 00:32:55
I did an album called &quot;Julie Ruin&quot;, which was a solo

971
00:32:55 --> 00:32:57
record, and I made it through that

972
00:32:57 --> 00:32:58
out what had happened to me.

973
00:32:58 --> 00:33:00
And so I did it with a false name.

974
00:33:00 --> 00:33:02
In Bikini Kill, I was singing to

975
00:33:02 --> 00:33:04
an unspeakable idiot male who was

976
00:33:04 --> 00:33:05
Cum worldwide, and I

977
00:33:05 --> 00:33:07
It was allowing other women to see me do this.

978
00:33:07 --> 00:33:08
And I really wanted to start

979
00:33:08 --> 00:33:09
directly singing to other women.

980
00:33:09 --> 00:33:10
For Kathleen music to grow

981
00:33:10 --> 00:33:12
electronic direction directions

982
00:33:12 --> 00:33:14
Music makes perfect sense to me.

983
00:33:14 --> 00:33:16
When you have disconnected your community or lost your

984
00:33:16 --> 00:33:17
community, it&#39;s amazing if you

985
00:33:17 --> 00:33:19
You can take advantage of the means of technology itself.

986
00:33:19 --> 00:33:21
I visited Kathleen, and went to a music store.

987
00:33:21 --> 00:33:22
They had a drumatics drum machine.

988
00:33:22 --> 00:33:24
Kathleen bought this drum machine for $ 40.

989
00:33:24 --> 00:33:27
So she recorded, as all fuck &quot;Julie Ruin&quot; record.

990
00:33:27 --> 00:33:31
This record is a fucking masterpiece.

991
00:33:31 --> 00:33:33
It was this whole new side of Kathleen Hanna.

992
00:33:33 --> 00:33:34
It&#39;s as if you know someone.

993
00:33:34 --> 00:33:37
They are your friend, but never open your scrapbook

994
00:33:37 --> 00:33:39
and showed him what really made them what they are.

995
00:33:39 --> 00:33:40
That&#39;s what &quot;Julie Ruin&quot; began

996
00:33:40 --> 00:33:45
to do for those of us who are interested in Kathleen Hanna.

997
00:33:45 --> 00:33:48
I felt like a lot of my graphic sensitivity came out in

998
00:33:48 --> 00:33:50
because using samples is very cut-and-paste.

999
00:33:50 --> 00:33:53
Making fantasy for me was always in my room

1000
00:33:53 --> 00:33:56
myself and cut out things and have this really specific

1001
00:33:56 --> 00:33:57
relationship with my materials

1002
00:33:57 --> 00:33:59
that was not mediated by any other person.

1003
00:33:59 --> 00:34:02
She was out all by itself.

1004
00:34:02 --> 00:34:04
It sounded lo-fi and

1005
00:34:04 --> 00:34:07
purpose lo-fi and just very clever.

1006
00:34:07 --> 00:34:08
Looks like you could hear a

1007
00:34:08 --> 00:34:10
fingers of the human being all over it.

1008
00:34:10 --> 00:34:11
It seems that the room culture.

1009
00:34:11 --> 00:34:15
It sounds like something a girl has in her room.

1010
00:34:15 --> 00:34:16
Room a girl sometimes can

1011
00:34:16 --> 00:34:18
be this real creative space.

1012
00:34:18 --> 00:34:19
The problem is that these

1013
00:34:19 --> 00:34:21
rooms are all separated from each other.

1014
00:34:21 --> 00:34:22
So how do you take the room

1015
00:34:22 --> 00:34:23
you are cut off from all

1016
00:34:23 --> 00:34:26
other girls who are secretly in his room secret writing

1017
00:34:26 --> 00:34:27
things or make secret songs?

1018
00:34:27 --> 00:34:28
I wanted the album &quot;Julie Ruin&quot;

1019
00:34:28 --> 00:34:30
to sound like a girl in her room made this record, but

1020
00:34:30 --> 00:34:31
then not just throw it away,

1021
00:34:31 --> 00:34:32
or it was not only in his diary.

1022
00:34:32 --> 00:34:34
But she took it out and share with people.

1023
00:34:34 --> 00:34:40
♪ ... how many times I made you cry ♪

1024
00:34:40 --> 00:34:47
♪ you can tell anyone you want ♪

1025
00:34:47 --> 00:34:52
♪ but if you will talk about how I deserve what you did,

1026
00:34:52 --> 00:34:57
you can look now because I&#39;m gone ♪

1027
00:34:57 --> 00:34:58
For me, &quot;Julie Ruin&quot;

1028
00:34:58 --> 00:34:59
record is what really changed

1029
00:34:59 --> 00:35:01
Kathleen, in terms of its type, it was in a band.

1030
00:35:01 --> 00:35:03
It was in this band Bikini Kill, and they did everything

1031
00:35:03 --> 00:35:04
this thing fucking.

1032
00:35:04 --> 00:35:05
And she made this record

1033
00:35:05 --> 00:35:08
&quot;Julie Ruin&quot; and she&#39;s, like, now a musician.

1034
00:35:08 --> 00:35:10
Fuck.

1035
00:35:10 --> 00:35:12
&quot;Julie Ruin&quot; was a kind of

1036
00:35:12 --> 00:35:14
model, the first stone.

1037
00:35:14 --> 00:35:20
And then, Le Tigre was the beginning of a new world.

1038
00:35:20 --> 00:35:21
I decided I wanted to move to

1039
00:35:21 --> 00:35:22
Portland because I had to leave

1040
00:35:22 --> 00:35:29
cause Olympia &#39;was driving me crazy.

1041
00:35:29 --> 00:35:31
I gave my Kathleen &#39;zine.

1042
00:35:31 --> 00:35:34
I mean, I do not know if you&#39;d call that, like, you know it.

1043
00:35:34 --> 00:35:35
I just, like, said hi and gave

1044
00:35:35 --> 00:35:37
her in a show at Cafe X-ray in Portland.

1045
00:35:37 --> 00:35:40
I read fanzine Jo, and I was like, &quot;this is the best

1046
00:35:40 --> 00:35:41
fanzine I have ever read.

1047
00:35:41 --> 00:35:43
It has to be my new best friend. &quot;

1048
00:35:43 --> 00:35:44
Basically, I spent a whole day,

1049
00:35:44 --> 00:35:46
like, just driving around, looking for her.

1050
00:35:46 --> 00:35:48
She was like, &quot;You will be my friend.

1051
00:35:48 --> 00:35:49
We&#39;ll be in a band.

1052
00:35:49 --> 00:35:54
And that&#39;s it. &quot;

1053
00:35:54 --> 00:35:55
And I was like, &quot;okay.&quot;

1054
00:35:55 --> 00:35:56
My initial idea was to try

1055
00:35:56 --> 00:35:58
and register of &quot;Julie Ruin&quot; in a stage show.

1056
00:35:58 --> 00:35:59
I&#39;ve never been in a

1057
00:35:59 --> 00:36:00
band again in my life, I am

1058
00:36:00 --> 00:36:01
convinced that if it were not

1059
00:36:01 --> 00:36:02
for my friendship with Johanna,

1060
00:36:02 --> 00:36:03
Because I was really burnt and sad.

1061
00:36:03 --> 00:36:04
I was really depressed.

1062
00:36:04 --> 00:36:08
I remember sitting in my car, and it was raining, with Jo.

There is no way I could pay the rent, so I was really

1073

I knew I was not done.

1276
00:43:25 --> 00:43:28
I just did not want to face the fact that I was really sick.

1277
00:43:28 --> 00:43:30
I wanted to have control over it.

1278
00:43:30 --> 00:43:33
I wanted to tell everyone that I chose to stop.

1279
00:43:33 --> 00:43:36
But I do not - I do not - I did not choose.

1280
00:43:36 --> 00:43:41
I was told by my body that I had to stop.

1281
00:43:41 --> 00:43:45
But it was very painful for me to be told by someone or

1282
00:43:45 --> 00:43:48
anything I could and could not do.

1283
00:43:48 --> 00:43:54
So I told myself and told my bandmates and told my husband

1284
00:43:54 --> 00:43:57
and I told the world that I chose

1285
00:43:57 --> 00:44:01
to stop playing music because I had nothing else to say ...

1286
00:44:01 --> 00:44:06
Because it felt better to me than being in touch with the

1287
00:44:06 --> 00:44:07
the fact that I could never be

1288
00:44:07 --> 00:44:11
able to do what I love more than anything in the world.

1289
00:44:11 --> 00:44:14
We were seeing just, like, all these different doctors,

1290
00:44:14 --> 00:44:15
trying to figure it out.

1291
00:44:15 --> 00:44:18
And they were telling you all these different things, and they

1292
00:44:18 --> 00:44:20
They were doing all kinds of tests, fucking crazy.

1293
00:44:20 --> 00:44:23
They were like - she had something weird eye, and

1294
00:44:23 --> 00:44:24
as a doctor, &quot;Oh, yes it is

1295
00:44:24 --> 00:44:29
probably lupus, MS, or could be &#39;

1296
00:44:29 --> 00:44:30
Just like all this fucking crazy

1297
00:44:30 --> 00:44:31
shit, and you&#39;re like, &quot;What?&quot;

1298
00:44:31 --> 00:44:37
2008 the disease has taken a very strange turn.

1299
00:44:37 --> 00:44:39
Sex education through ...

1300
00:44:39 --> 00:44:41
I went to the march family planning.

1301
00:44:41 --> 00:44:42
I was not comfortable.

1302
00:44:42 --> 00:44:43
I was having language problems.

1303
00:44:43 --> 00:44:50
Our next speaker was the lead singer of Bikini Kill.

1304
00:44:50 --> 00:44:53
I feel I do not have to say anything else.

1305
00:44:53 --> 00:44:59
And Le Tigre and co-founder of the riot grrrl movement.

1306
00:44:59 --> 00:45:01
I could not hear out of

1307
00:45:01 --> 00:45:07
an ear, and I was, like, really struggling.

1308
00:45:07 --> 00:45:11
Suddenly, the sound changes in your head.

1309
00:45:11 --> 00:45:12
I thought I was having a stroke.

1310
00:45:12 --> 00:45:12
I could not speak.

1311
00:45:12 --> 00:45:13
I could not communicate.

1312
00:45:13 --> 00:45:15
And I was rolling as I was drunk.

1313
00:45:15 --> 00:45:16
One side of my body was numb.

1314
00:45:16 --> 00:45:19
The paramedics thought I had a small heart attack.

1315
00:45:19 --> 00:45:22
When I reached the hospital, the doctor asked me all my

1316
00:45:22 --> 00:45:23
symptoms, at which point I

1317
00:45:23 --> 00:45:24
It was like, &quot;I will not lie.&quot;

1318
00:45:24 --> 00:45:25
I was just like, &quot;Fuck you.

1319
00:45:25 --> 00:45:25
I am in the hospital.

1320
00:45:25 --> 00:45:26
I&#39;ll just say this woman all. &quot;

1321
00:45:26 --> 00:45:31
She was like, &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re just having a panic attack,

1322
00:45:31 --> 00:45:36
because there is no way you could be having neurological

1323
00:45:36 --> 00:45:40
respiratory difficulties and things and things of the stomach. &quot;

1324
00:45:40 --> 00:45:41
She was like, &quot;there are many

1325
00:45:41 --> 00:45:42
systems of the body to be wrapped, and

1326
00:45:42 --> 00:45:43
there is no disease that has everything

1327
00:45:43 --> 00:45:49
these body systems involved. &quot;

1328
00:45:49 --> 00:45:50
To live with something and

1329
00:45:50 --> 00:45:54
not knowing what it is, it is really terrible.

1330
00:45:54 --> 00:45:56
I late stage Lyme disease

1331
00:45:56 --> 00:45:59
which means that I had Lyme disease for - for now

1332
00:45:59 --> 00:46:01
about six years.

1333
00:46:01 --> 00:46:03
When she came to see me, she

1334
00:46:03 --> 00:46:05
I was sick for about five years.

1335
00:46:05 --> 00:46:07
She recalled that, in fact, it

1336
00:46:07 --> 00:46:10
He had been bitten by a tick in 2005.

1337
00:46:10 --> 00:46:11
And indeed, through its

1338
00:46:11 --> 00:46:15
history, she had been treated for Lyme disease.

1339
00:46:15 --> 00:46:17
I antibiotics for three weeks.

1340
00:46:17 --> 00:46:18
So when I got sick after I

1341
00:46:18 --> 00:46:20
not associated with Lyme disease.

1342
00:46:20 --> 00:46:23
And when he was brought to me by different experts, I

1343
00:46:23 --> 00:46:24
He said: &quot;I&#39;ve done the test.&quot;

1344
00:46:24 --> 00:46:26
You know, I would take my

1345
00:46:26 --> 00:46:27
shit Elisa test is, like,

1346
00:46:27 --> 00:46:28
the 20 dollars that insurance test

1347
00:46:28 --> 00:46:29
company wants you to take, show

1348
00:46:29 --> 00:46:30
doctors, and no one said:

1349
00:46:30 --> 00:46:33
&quot;Oh, this is really a low-quality test completely reliable.&quot;

1350
00:46:33 --> 00:46:36
But eventually, I have a test called the Western blot test,

1351
00:46:36 --> 00:46:39
and lit up like a Christmas tree.

1352
00:46:39 --> 00:46:43
It&#39;s like you&#39;re Superman and you met kryptonite.

1353
00:46:43 --> 00:46:45
That&#39;s what Lyme disease is similar.

1354
00:46:45 --> 00:46:48
I have to take my pills.

1355
00:46:48 --> 00:46:51
When you start treating someone with Lyme disease, which

1356
00:46:51 --> 00:46:53
person may get worse before they get better.

1357
00:46:53 --> 00:46:54
It&#39;s kind of like you wake up

1358
00:46:54 --> 00:46:56
sleeping giant when you use the

1359
00:46:56 --> 00:47:01
antibiotics, and the infection kicks back even harder.

1360
00:47:01 --> 00:47:08
I just took my medication an hour ago.

1361
00:47:08 --> 00:47:11
And ... I think I&#39;m having a reaction

1362
00:47:11 --> 00:47:17
now for ... Infection and medication

1363
00:47:17 --> 00:47:20
meeting or something.

1364
00:47:20 --> 00:47:22
I&#39;m filming this kind of cause

1365
00:47:22 --> 00:47:29
in my film, the film about me, I talk about having this

1366
00:47:29 --> 00:47:35
disease and, um, how he does it, so I can not do things.

1367
00:47:35 --> 00:47:39
And of course, I can not be on stage when I&#39;m like that, and

1368
00:47:39 --> 00:47:41
this is me when it&#39;s bad as it gets.

1369
00:47:41 --> 00:47:44
Normal look?

1370
00:47:44 --> 00:47:44
Do not.

1371
00:47:44 --> 00:47:48
Because it does not feel normal now.

1372
00:47:48 --> 00:47:53
But I want to ... show that is

1373
00:47:53 --> 00:47:57
because a lot of people are misdiagnosed.

1374
00:47:57 --> 00:47:59
Like, I was diagnosed five years ago.

1375
00:47:59 --> 00:48:01
Invade, as each part

1376
00:48:01 --> 00:48:04
your body, and then when you try to get rid of it, you have

1377
00:48:04 --> 00:48:07
These reactions really fucked up, and you can not control

1378
00:48:07 --> 00:48:12
your body or your speech, and it&#39;s real uncomfortable.

1379
00:48:12 --> 00:48:19
So it&#39;s something that ... I think it&#39;s good for now.

1380
00:48:19 --> 00:48:20
We&#39;ll have a seizure after.

1381
00:48:20 --> 00:48:22
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have a seizure after.

1382
00:48:22 --> 00:48:25
I think we should do a little more accurate.

1383
00:48:25 --> 00:48:29
I do not think people really saw her in her sicker.

1384
00:48:29 --> 00:48:34
You know, it&#39;s just her and Adam.

1385
00:48:34 --> 00:48:39
More stressed than I&#39;ve been in a long time.

1386
00:48:39 --> 00:48:42
Shit is crazy.

1387
00:48:42 --> 00:48:43
When you have an illness like

1388
00:48:43 --> 00:48:45
it is difficult to explain it to other people.

1389
00:48:45 --> 00:48:46
The expectation is out there,

1390
00:48:46 --> 00:48:47
&quot;Okay, so you had Lyme disease.

1391
00:48:47 --> 00:48:48
Did you take antibiotics.

1392
00:48:48 --> 00:48:49
You should be better. &quot;

1393
00:48:49 --> 00:48:52
When you&#39;ve had that for five years, and it was not

1394
00:48:52 --> 00:48:55
treated, it will not be the way it works.

1395
00:48:55 --> 00:48:57
She never talked about her

1396
00:48:57 --> 00:48:59
health or the pain she was or anything.

1397
00:48:59 --> 00:49:02
I did not know for a long time.

1398
00:49:02 --> 00:49:05
The people who run around to be

1399
00:49:05 --> 00:49:08
heroes act like they do not need help.

1400
00:49:08 --> 00:49:10
That&#39;s the nature of being a hero is that you do not need help.

1401
00:49:10 --> 00:49:10
You are the helper.

1402
00:49:10 --> 00:49:13
There are times when it

1403
00:49:13 --> 00:49:16
You know you can help.

1404
00:49:16 --> 00:49:17
But I do not think it is

1405
00:49:17 --> 00:49:21
necessarily an organic thing for her.

1406
00:49:21 --> 00:49:22
I realized that I wanted to write

1407
00:49:22 --> 00:49:23
a record of when I started to get

1408
00:49:23 --> 00:49:24
sicker and sicker and sicker,

1409
00:49:24 --> 00:49:26
Because once, like, I really was

1410
00:49:26 --> 00:49:30
&lt;I&gt; sure I could not do it, I really wanted. &lt;/ I&gt;

1411
00:49:30 --> 00:49:31
The only thing that made me change or

1412
00:49:31 --> 00:49:34
face it was that my disease was not only affecting me.

1413
00:49:34 --> 00:49:36
He was affecting the people I love.

1414
00:49:36 --> 00:49:39
I worked in a violent domestic shelter, and I remember women

1415
00:49:39 --> 00:49:42
all the time saying, &quot;I could take him, but when he started

1416
00:49:42 --> 00:49:44
abusing children, I took them and left. &quot;

1417
00:49:44 --> 00:49:45
They were, like, totally protective of their children,

1418
00:49:45 --> 00:49:46
but they were not protective of themselves.

1419
00:49:46 --> 00:49:47
When I saw it affecting Jo, as

1420
00:49:47 --> 00:49:48
Too bad it affected Jo and JD E

1421
00:49:48 --> 00:49:49
Adam, and I was like, &quot;is not

1422
00:49:49 --> 00:49:51
helping them I am minimizing it. &quot;

1423
00:49:51 --> 00:49:54
It was just much easier in the world if I just faced what

1424
00:49:54 --> 00:49:55
was happening, she stopped blaming

1425
00:49:55 --> 00:49:58
myself, and fucking deal with it.

1426
00:49:58 --> 00:50:02
I call my new band Julie ruin because it means

1427
00:50:02 --> 00:50:06
a consequence of the solo project I did in 99.

1428
00:50:06 --> 00:50:07
It&#39;s really just different in

1429
00:50:07 --> 00:50:09
I&#39;m not trying to write songs or anything.

1430
00:50:09 --> 00:50:10
I&#39;m just writing songs and

1431
00:50:10 --> 00:50:14
let them be what they want to be.

1433
00:50:16 --> 00:50:20
♪ ♪ do not go away

1434
00:50:20 --> 00:50:23
I feel embarrassed when people come up to me and say

1435
00:50:23 --> 00:50:24
I interest them or something

1436
00:50:24 --> 00:50:27
and thus more or less like having all these people put this

1437
00:50:27 --> 00:50:30
show and, like, doing covers of songs that I sang.

1438
00:50:30 --> 00:50:31
It feels like, overwhelming and

1439
00:50:31 --> 00:50:32
I have not really been able to understand it.

1440
00:50:32 --> 00:50:34
So everything I&#39;ve been through over

1441
00:50:34 --> 00:50:36
in recent years to get my

1442
00:50:36 --> 00:50:38
diagnosis so close to the show.

1443
00:50:38 --> 00:50:41
Just when I was very sick, I would sit around and be,

1444
00:50:41 --> 00:50:44
as I imagine that people be supportive and loving, because I

1445
00:50:44 --> 00:50:45
never let before.

1446
00:50:45 --> 00:50:46
And I had to learn to do

1447
00:50:46 --> 00:50:48
this because I was so sick for five years.

1448
00:50:48 --> 00:50:51
And now it&#39;s, like, will be physical, like, I&#39;m really

1449
00:50:51 --> 00:50:52

1450
00:50:52 --> 00:50:53
these people are just going to be

1451
00:50:53 --> 00:50:54
totally love and support me.

1452
00:50:54 --> 00:50:54
And is ...

1453
00:50:54 --> 00:50:55
It&#39;s impressive.

1454
00:50:55 --> 00:50:56
With the disease material, this means

1455
00:50:56 --> 00:50:58
that extra something that only my friends know.

1456
00:50:58 --> 00:51:00

I just want to read this very special text by Kathleen.

1471
00:51:42 --> 00:51:45
This is called &quot;grrrl manifesto turmoil.&quot;

1472
00:51:45 --> 00:51:49
&quot;For us girls crave records and books and fanzines that

1473
00:51:49 --> 00:51:53
talk to us, to make them feel included and can understand

1474
00:51:53 --> 00:51:57
in our own way, because I believe with all my heart,

1475
00:51:57 --> 00:52:01
mind, body grrrls constitute a revolutionary soul

1476
00:52:01 --> 00:52:06
force that can and will change the real world. &quot;

1477
00:52:06 --> 00:52:10
Thank you, Kathleen Hanna!

1478
00:52:10 --> 00:52:17
All right, kids, are you ready?

1479
00:52:17 --> 00:52:24
Ladies and gentlemen, Julie ruin!

1480
00:52:24 --> 00:52:25
Hey, guys.

1481
00:52:25 --> 00:52:27
Thank you for coming.

1482
00:52:27 --> 00:52:29
This is a very special night for me.

1483
00:52:29 --> 00:52:31
So we&#39;re Julie ruin, and we are writing a new album.

1484
00:52:31 --> 00:52:31
Are you ready?

1485
00:52:31 --> 00:52:31
IT IS.

1486
00:52:31 --> 00:52:32
What&#39;s the story of my life?

1487
00:52:32 --> 00:52:35
I have no fucking clue.

1488
00:52:35 --> 00:52:39
I just think there&#39;s this certain assumption that when a

1489
00:52:39 --> 00:52:42
man tells the truth is the truth.

1490
00:52:42 --> 00:52:44
And when a woman like me will tell you

1491
00:52:44 --> 00:52:46
the truth, I feel that I have to

1492
00:52:46 --> 00:52:48
negotiate how I will be perceived.

1493
00:52:48 --> 00:52:50
Like, I feel there is always

1494
00:52:50 --> 00:52:52
suspicion around women

1495
00:52:52 --> 00:52:58
Indeed, the idea that you&#39;re exaggerating.

1496
00:52:58 --> 00:52:59
I do not just sit there and be

1497
00:52:59 --> 00:53:01
like, &quot;this, this, this, this, that.&quot;

1498
00:53:01 --> 00:53:04
There is all this fear that I will have finally fuck

1499
00:53:04 --> 00:53:07
He stepped to the plate and told the truth, and someone will

1500
00:53:07 --> 00:53:08
say, &quot;eh, I do not think so.&quot;

1501
00:53:08 --> 00:53:11
♪ Air-air air air armageddon ♪

1502
00:53:11 --> 00:53:13
If I would not have admitted to myself that, like,

1503
00:53:13 --> 00:53:16
sexual abuse things that happened in my life, it was not just,

1504
00:53:16 --> 00:53:19
as something that happened when I was little and also as

1505
00:53:19 --> 00:53:21
my father and me blah blah blah treated.

1506
00:53:21 --> 00:53:23
It was like all these different things.

1507
00:53:23 --> 00:53:26
Like, I would never want to tell everyone the whole, all

1508
00:53:26 --> 00:53:27
story because it seemed crazy.

1509
00:53:27 --> 00:53:28
It sounded like too big of

1510
00:53:28 --> 00:53:30
a can of worms, how, who would believe me?

1511
00:53:30 --> 00:53:37
And then I was like, &quot;other women would believe me.&quot;

1512
00:53:37 --> 00:53:39
I do not give a damn what people think.

1513
00:53:39 --> 00:53:40
I know what is real.

1514
00:53:40 --> 00:53:41
I do not care if people do not

1515
00:53:41 --> 00:53:44
I think that feminism is important, because I know it is.

1516
00:53:44 --> 00:53:46
And I do not care if people do not

1517
00:53:46 --> 00:53:49
I think the final stage of Lyme disease exists because I have it, and

1518
00:53:49 --> 00:53:50
others have, and we

1519
00:53:50 --> 00:53:52
help each other, and we know that it exists.

1520
00:53:52 --> 00:53:55
And other people can think what they want.

1521
00:53:55 --> 00:53:57
My problem is when people get

1522
00:53:57 --> 00:53:59
in the path of feminism or people

1523
00:53:59 --> 00:54:01
get in the way of people who are

1524
00:54:01 --> 00:54:04
patient getting better, because they do not understand it.

1525
00:54:04 --> 00:54:07
And if they do not want to believe it, or not do

1526
00:54:07 --> 00:54:10
want to worry about it, that&#39;s totally fine, but should

1527
00:54:10 --> 00:54:12

27
00:01:02 --> 00:01:04
Ali, find me a good subject for news.

28
00:01:04 --> 00:01:06
Boss is unhappy nowadays

29
00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
I am going to bring you a hell of a news report today i am organizing this for three days.

30
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
A whale was seen on Bhosphorus Istanbul near KÄ±zkulesi

31
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
20 mt. long giant whale generated excitement among the people of Istanbul

32
00:01:12 --> 00:01:14
I went to the diver club to meet my friend Cevat.

33
00:01:14 --> 00:01:19
I have managed everything they built some model which looks like the back of a whale on water

34
00:01:19 --> 00:01:22
They  put this floating model on sea near Salacak, Istanbul

35
00:01:22 --> 00:01:26
I have a diver friend who sprayed water from under sea. Just like a real whale does they sprayed water

36
00:01:26 --> 00:01:28
And i photographed this event continuously.

37
00:01:28 --> 00:01:32
Think of us making this interview on newspaper.

38
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
Ali are you ok? Seriously!

39
00:01:34 --> 00:01:35
I am fine.

40
00:01:35 --> 00:01:36
Are you crazy

41
00:01:36 --> 00:01:37
There has never been a whale in Bhosphorus

42
00:01:37 --> 00:01:38
We cant even catch turbot nowadays

43
00:01:38 --> 00:01:39
So you dont like this...

44
00:01:39 --> 00:01:41

00:01:43 --> 00:01:45

47
00:01:45 --> 00:01:45

48
00:01:45 --> 00:01:46
I went and hired a helicopter

49
00:01:46 --> 00:01:47
I have made an arrangement with the pilots

50
00:01:47 --> 00:01:49
I asked them how long it will take me to learn it

51
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
They told me you are a talented person you can learn in a year

52
00:01:51 --> 00:01:56
Of course the news report will be fake it wont be true it will mention me becoming a pilot in two hours.

53
00:01:56 --> 00:01:59
Ok? I also took pictures from air.

54
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01

00:02:19 --> 00:02:21

68
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27

70
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31

00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
Because we are ruled by dictatorship in our planet

112
00:03:33 --> 00:03:35
What kind of punishment will you get if they find you?

113
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37

116
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39

117
00:03:39 --> 00:03:40
Our punishments are severe

00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
What if you speak

119
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44

120
00:03:44 --> 00:03:45
How can a person be punished for such a thingf

121
00:03:45 --> 00:03:47
Say it if you want to

122
00:03:47 --> 00:03:48
So the dictator wont be upset about it?

123
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
Whats it to him, he also speaks his own mind.

124
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
So how is the government over here in your country

125
00:03:52 --> 00:03:53

00:00:00 --> 00:00:13
oh I there didn&#39;t see you come in

3
00:00:13 --> 00:00:18
probably because I&#39;m talking to a camera
you know I&#39;m just standing here in my

4
00:00:18 --> 00:00:22
Freddy Krueger&#39;s sweater and my
traditional Christmas meal microwave

5
00:00:22 --> 00:00:27
popcorn in a pan on the stove and I&#39;m
thinking to myself I should give you

6
00:00:27 --> 00:00:32
guys a little Christmas treat this year
so I went out to get myself a true

7
00:00:32 --> 00:00:37
holiday classic for us to rip on today
unfortunately I couldn&#39;t secure the

8
00:00:37 --> 00:00:37
rights to that

9
00:00:37 --> 00:00:42
so instead we are getting the very first
sound version of Charles Dickens A

10
00:00:42 --> 00:00:48
Christmas Carol athlete title Scrooge
today we are joined in the RIP theatre

11
00:00:48 --> 00:00:54
by will wolf grim you might know and
Jerris the gunslinger or snow flame or

12
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
the guy who plays the physical body of
Lord advice because i&#39;m too overweight

13
00:00:57 --> 00:01:03
and of course by amethyst the voice of
them away and my prop maker sit back

14
00:01:03 --> 00:01:11
relax and enjoy this festive holiday
tail death ghosts and other unspeakable

15
00:01:11 --> 00:01:19
horrors I my favorite Christmas movie
the British Board of Film sensors

16
00:01:19 --> 00:01:21
isn&#39;t this the one with the end of the
film the sensors learn the true meaning

17
00:01:21 --> 00:01:24
of Christmas and decide to stop
censoring work you know it

18
00:01:24 --> 00:01:28
so why is there ghostly apparition of a
book over other books to avoid appearing

19
00:01:28 --> 00:01:31
racist this movie&#39;s version of marley is
played by a book

20
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
behold our cover bind eight

21
00:01:34 --> 00:01:39
I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s not the second
page the actual book

22
00:01:39 --> 00:01:42
we decided that the best way to
adaptable would be to just fill the guy

23
00:01:42 --> 00:01:50
flipping through it page by page art
direction by james carter of mars film

24
00:01:50 --> 00:01:57
editor a good to know they&#39;ll actually
be editing at some point to feel shall I

25
00:01:57 --> 00:02:00

evil was the way to go

42
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
thrill as all the looking guys work on
accounting

43
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
Kubrick films move faster than this

44
00:03:34 --> 00:03:36
yeah it&#39;s a nice trick man but those
taxes aren&#39;t going to advertise

45
00:03:36 --> 00:03:38
themselves

46
00:03:38 --> 00:03:41
Mary Katherine Gallagher the later years

vaunted we have called here at this
festive season of the arms the Scrooge

59
00:04:37 --> 00:04:41

this present time square look so

61
00:04:45 --> 00:04:49

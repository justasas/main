Oh

3
00:00:03 --> 00:00:06
Oh

4
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
yeah

5
00:00:08 --> 00:00:11
Oh

6
00:00:11 --> 00:00:17
since the initial discovery of the alien
spacecraft and 2054 by the language

7
00:00:17 --> 00:00:18
incorporation

8
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
we have located no other relatives of
the tester and culture

9
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
almost 20 years later still have not
solved mysteries

10
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
why did the event that&#39;s what do they
look like

11
00:00:27 --> 00:00:29
what did they come from

12
00:00:29 --> 00:00:30
all we have

13
00:00:30 --> 00:00:35
it&#39;s a tantalizing piece of machinery
and down a few answers as you know the

14
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
scientific developments from this fine
have pushed human technology literally

15
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
light years ahead of itself from example
being faster than light travel

16
00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
however two and a half weeks ago

17
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
a Norwegian interworld research ship
under the command of bein bored is

18
00:00:47 --> 00:00:53
conducting surveys of an unexplored
planet increasing the lycÃ©e by the

19
00:00:53 --> 00:00:54
purest coincidence

20
00:00:54 --> 00:00:58
one of George&#39;s survey probes landed
within visual range of what he believed

21
00:00:58 --> 00:00:59
to be a test or an artifact

22
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01
unfortunately

23
00:01:01 --> 00:01:06
boys never had the chance to verify find
this vessel lost its fuel in a micro

24
00:01:06 --> 00:01:11
medial collision but before this all
became boards transmitted the data to

25
00:01:11 --> 00:01:14
the Norwegian into world based on signal

26
00:01:14 --> 00:01:17
at this point i find is still there

27
00:01:17 --> 00:01:22
his untimely death has opened a loophole
in interstellar salvors law which we may

28
00:01:22 --> 00:01:28
not support because boards never
actually set foot on analyzing Norwegian

29
00:01:28 --> 00:01:31
enter world cannot claim the fun if it
exists

30
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
yeah

31
00:01:34 --> 00:01:37
currently the acquisition corporation
possesses all rights to the Testament

32
00:01:37 --> 00:01:41
spacecraft found around things and all
royalties derived from a scientific and

33
00:01:41 --> 00:01:42
industrial application

34
00:01:42 --> 00:01:42
yeah

35
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
so I propose that we get curious ,
enterprises down on the surface of the

36
00:01:46 --> 00:01:50
Lyceum before the region and the world
or any other competitive and claim this

37
00:01:50 --> 00:01:54
fine whatever it might be on the
interstellar salvors law

38
00:01:54 --> 00:01:58
all right to be out of jail you&#39;re aware
that the value of this corporation to

39
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
grow unimaginable such affection

40
00:02:01 --> 00:02:05
even perhaps to the point around like
that that would be substantial for

41
00:02:05 --> 00:02:09
economically and politically divided we
receive the data before we Jeanette

42
00:02:09 --> 00:02:09
world

43
00:02:09 --> 00:02:13
how do we do that according to our
operatives with in Norwegian in the

44
00:02:13 --> 00:02:13
world

45
00:02:13 --> 00:02:17
no one has yet had the chance to analyze
the data in fact is due to arrive this

46
00:02:17 --> 00:02:18
evening in Star City

47
00:02:18 --> 00:02:24
I&#39;ve arranged to have their careers
intercepted by one of our and 10

48
00:02:24 --> 00:02:28
yes she&#39;ll be arriving short she was
made for this time

49
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
yeah

50
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
yeah

51
00:02:34 --> 00:02:39
if that tape does contain information
about another texture and ship it will

52
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
do big things for this corporation

53
00:02:41 --> 00:02:44
whoever possesses it it&#39;s going to be
very rich

54
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
the Norwegian Correa&#39;s will be landing
in 45 minutes

55
00:02:47 --> 00:02:51
engage and cancel them yeah sorry

56
00:02:51 --> 00:02:54
I know that makes you feel uncomfortable
why shouldn&#39;t it

57
00:02:54 --> 00:02:57
you activate that a little charge goes
off in my head and 70 hours later I&#39;m

58
00:02:57 --> 00:03:00
dead from a massive hemorrhage just part
of the business

59
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
I know to protect quarry on his
reputation in case one of my assignments

60
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
gloves arrived after the kill

61
00:03:07 --> 00:03:12
find a safe place and absorb the data
with this rendezvous with me and June on

62
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
station by 3 20 and everything before I
must be killed

63
00:03:16 --> 00:03:20
you want no new sentence no evidence
which is why you&#39;re going to memorize

64
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
the tape with that

65
00:03:23 --> 00:03:28
depth of these quarries is unwarranted I
could just easily incapacitate them and

66
00:03:28 --> 00:03:33
steal the tape kill only when necessary
remember nonetheless

67
00:03:33 --> 00:03:36

she looked right at me the doors closed
and she kept on going so activated strip

127
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
given the tools and she&#39;ll be dead in
three days

128
00:07:04 --> 00:07:09
that&#39;s wrong she is now the only one who

kill only when you have to but when you
do use any means available

217
00:12:07 --> 00:12:08
all right

218
00:12:08 --> 00:12:11

yesterday begin

219
00:12:11 --> 00:12:17
yeah

220
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
one instant of lacks behavior like that
in the field and you&#39;re dead

221
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
try it again

222
00:12:22 --> 00:12:23
again

223
00:12:23 --> 00:12:24
yeah

224

yeah

225
00:12:30 --> 00:12:33
very good

226
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
and this is your auto programming for
selected

227
00:12:36 --> 00:12:39
and of course all of these weapons
systems are controlled the joystick here

228
00:12:39 --> 00:12:43
but you&#39;re about to meet is being
designed physical strength and intellect

229
00:12:43 --> 00:12:49
she can be used to steal seduce killed
before many number of a myriad of

230
00:12:49 --> 00:12:53
functions with precision or to further
the objectives of carrion man Department

231
00:12:53 --> 00:12:57
the most subtle and perhaps the most
effective tool

232
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
I introduced

233
00:13:00 --> 00:13:03
yeah

234
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
yeah

235

yeah

292
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
hmm

293
00:16:42 --> 00:16:49
always be at the Promethean fueled and
ready to leave at once right

294
00:16:49 --> 00:16:50
yeah

295
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
mmm

296
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
yeah

297
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
yeah

298
00:16:59 --> 00:17:02
yeah

299
00:17:02 --> 00:17:06
yeah

300
00:17:06 --> 00:17:06
ok

301
00:17:06 --> 00:17:06
yeah

302
00:17:06 --> 00:17:09
well we&#39;re on course we got to be there
in about fifty three hours

303
00:17:09 --> 00:17:14
so is there something you want to tell
me no no

304
00:17:14 --> 00:17:17
ok

305
00:17:17 --> 00:17:18
yeah

306
00:17:18 --> 00:17:20
well are you hungry then No

307
00:17:20 --> 00:17:25
so your synthetic person that&#39;s what
that was all about back there wasn&#39;t it

308
00:17:25 --> 00:17:28
yes

309
00:17:28 --> 00:17:31
I always thought synthetic people were
less than human

310
00:17:31 --> 00:17:37
yeah I mean no I mean I thought they
were designed to do menial duties or

311
00:17:37 --> 00:17:40
jobs considered too dangerous for real
people

312
00:17:40 --> 00:17:42
all right

313
00:17:42 --> 00:17:46
so who were those guys back there any
way for employers

314
00:17:46 --> 00:17:49
I was designed for corporate warfare
left

315
00:17:49 --> 00:17:52
seduction

316
00:17:52 --> 00:17:55
assassination

317
00:17:55 --> 00:17:59
but I get tired of being a slave to them
doing their dirty work so i left while

318
00:17:59 --> 00:18:03
doing so I kept something they had we
steal for them

319
00:18:03 --> 00:18:06
do you remember when the fair and ship
was discovered

320
00:18:06 --> 00:18:09
of course i was in high school

321
00:18:09 --> 00:18:12
as you can see it made quite an
impression on me we can imagine what it

322
00:18:12 --> 00:18:16
did for industry the amount of revenue
generated for it discovers that ship

323
00:18:16 --> 00:18:19
with the most valuable find in history
its unique another one have never been

324
00:18:19 --> 00:18:23
discovered the propulsion system found
the shipper an example of just one of

325
00:18:23 --> 00:18:24
its technological applications

326
00:18:24 --> 00:18:31
I know what is another one is unclaimed
if I&#39;m not an industry by tomorrow it

327
00:18:31 --> 00:18:31
won&#39;t matter

328
00:18:31 --> 00:18:38
why not there&#39;s a device implanted in
the back of my head which will cause a

329
00:18:38 --> 00:18:41
massive cerebral hemorrhage and less
than 65 hours

330
00:18:41 --> 00:18:46
there&#39;s a man on in this for you may be
able to help me well I&#39;ll get you there

331
00:18:46 --> 00:18:51
you can trust me I&#39;ve been taught never
to trust anyone

332
00:18:51 --> 00:18:54
but I have no choice

333
00:18:54 --> 00:18:56
fine

00:18:56 --> 00:18:59
so where do we go when we get to
industry this guy house

335
00:18:59 --> 00:19:03
it&#39;s a center of a huge terraforming
operation have a friend there Robert

336
00:19:03 --> 00:19:06
Thornton he&#39;s a genetic engineer he
designed me

337
00:19:06 --> 00:19:09
he&#39;s the only one who can help you may
be able to stop it

338
00:19:09 --> 00:19:12

what happened

358
00:20:24 --> 00:20:27

359
00:20:27 --> 00:20:30
and I&#39;m the only one who knows where it
is

360
00:20:30 --> 00:20:33

00:20:38 --> 00:20:40
never

364
00:20:40 --> 00:20:42
you&#39;ve always been one of the most
consistently clear thinkers I&#39;ve ever

365
00:20:42 --> 00:20:43
designed

366
00:20:43 --> 00:20:46
when it comes to strategy

367
00:20:46 --> 00:20:49
yeah

368
00:20:49 --> 00:20:52
hello

369
00:20:52 --> 00:20:57
well Brickman this is industry it is a
bit bare and actually hardly habitable

370
00:20:57 --> 00:21:00
but when you consider how hostile planet
environment can be

371
00:21:00 --> 00:21:05
it&#39;s really quite tame the baby is below
a deadly after prolonged exposure

372
00:21:05 --> 00:21:12
that&#39;s why our structures here built
above a certain altitude button

373
00:21:12 --> 00:21:15
function

374
00:21:15 --> 00:21:17
yeah

375
00:21:17 --> 00:21:18
you&#39;re welcome

well I gotta go back and take care of

387
00:21:47 --> 00:21:49
some debts you

388
00:21:49 --> 00:21:52
I haven&#39;t forgotten I tell you two
thousand dollars

389
00:21:52 --> 00:21:56
look when I&#39;m going to be
straightforward with you it&#39;s fatal for

390
00:21:56 --> 00:21:58
you to return to earth right now for two
reasons

391
00:21:58 --> 00:22:01
kuriyama won&#39;t rest until he finds you
in second you&#39;re crazy to turn your back

392
00:22:01 --> 00:22:05
on this tearing ship if it exists that&#39;s
ready to do this but I positively done

393
00:22:05 --> 00:22:08
I&#39;ve seen it

394
00:22:08 --> 00:22:12
the only chance you have of surviving
stick with me Hariyama is right behind

395
00:22:12 --> 00:22:17
us because it

396
00:22:17 --> 00:22:19
I need you

397
00:22:19 --> 00:22:22
I want you to fly me to a life him and
claimed that the sarin derelict

398
00:22:22 --> 00:22:24
why me

399
00:22:24 --> 00:22:26
I have an identity which I lack

400
00:22:26 --> 00:22:29
under the law I&#39;m not recognized

401
00:22:29 --> 00:22:33
come on Berkman consider it an extension
of our original contract

402
00:22:33 --> 00:22:36
yeah

403
00:22:36 --> 00:22:39
you got yourself a deal lady

404
00:22:39 --> 00:22:42
so where the hell is a lyceum anyway

405
00:22:42 --> 00:22:44
I&#39;m not exactly sure

406
00:22:44 --> 00:22:46
I have to correlate my data Thornton&#39;s
computer and then i will know its

407
00:22:46 --> 00:22:52
precise location then this ship can make
us a very rich

408
00:22:52 --> 00:22:56
ok

409
00:22:56 --> 00:23:00
yeah

410
00:23:00 --> 00:23:06
are you sure you have everything you
need yes with your computer i was able

411
00:23:06 --> 00:23:07
to analyze the data

412
00:23:07 --> 00:23:11
I now know the precise location of the
artifact and have a good idea of what to

413
00:23:11 --> 00:23:12
expect from the environment

414
00:23:12 --> 00:23:20
ok you know Graham is right behind us

415
00:23:20 --> 00:23:25
yeah don&#39;t worry I&#39;ve got my own against
him before

416
00:23:25 --> 00:23:28
well

417
00:23:28 --> 00:23:31
mmm smells like adventure in there

418
00:23:31 --> 00:23:37
engine exhaust maybe no no that&#39;s a
that&#39;s definitely adventure

419
00:23:37 --> 00:23:40
come on let&#39;s blow this joint

420
00:23:40 --> 00:23:43
Ida like to thank you for everything sir

to

422
00:23:46 --> 00:23:49
she cares for people

423
00:23:49 --> 00:23:52
more than you&#39;ll admit

424
00:23:52 --> 00:23:55

00:24:14 --> 00:24:15
dont you gotta come back

431
00:24:15 --> 00:24:18

497
00:27:54 --> 00:28:01

gamble

tell me you&#39;re the one who had her

503
00:28:25 --> 00:28:28

idea

00:28:28 --> 00:28:34
or have you forgotten that&#39;s the reason
I left this must really come as a blow

505
00:28:34 --> 00:28:34
to you

506
00:28:34 --> 00:28:38
you always manage to surround yourself
with people who possess qualities you

507
00:28:38 --> 00:28:41
don&#39;t lose your tactical genius

508
00:28:41 --> 00:28:46
Kyle represented your ruthlessness and I
was your conscience

509
00:28:46 --> 00:28:54
we&#39;ve dispensed with that and pen 10 was
your ideal and that&#39;s what hurts you

510
00:28:54 --> 00:29:00
that your ideal would abandon you at a
time you need her most go back if

511
00:29:00 --> 00:29:01
possible

512
00:29:01 --> 00:29:06
those be miss evaluator she&#39;s been in
the field just too long

you&#39;re right about one thing

516
00:29:18 --> 00:29:22
I don&#39;t need your weaknesses that&#39;s why
you&#39;re here designing bacteria trying to

517
00:29:22 --> 00:29:25
make this planet habitable instead of
creating Lee beams like pen

518
00:29:25 --> 00:29:31
I take you with me but thought it would
do me any good

519
00:29:31 --> 00:29:34
but as you said I no longer need a
conscience

520
00:29:34 --> 00:29:37
you call

521
00:29:37 --> 00:29:41
there&#39;s no place in the colonies where
you&#39;ll be safe

to me

in my profession trust gets you killed

532
00:30:13 --> 00:30:17

mistakes

someone

537

540
00:30:45 --> 00:30:51

get what you want

541
00:30:51 --> 00:30:57

pretty vulnerable without fighter

633
00:36:44 --> 00:36:44
protection

634
00:36:44 --> 00:36:48
she&#39;s got sophisticated tracking
equipment and shrapnel torpedoes people

635
00:36:48 --> 00:36:51
can debate millions of the projectile

636
00:36:51 --> 00:36:54
no time to argue we&#39;ve got hostiles on
her tail

637
00:36:54 --> 00:36:58

00:37:17 --> 00:37:27
you told me was against a programming to
disobey orders that you had no emotions

645
00:37:27 --> 00:37:33
how much damage she&#39;s done look how much
it costs us we found it necessary to

646
00:37:33 --> 00:37:35
program it with certain emotion

647
00:37:35 --> 00:37:38
otherwise she wouldn&#39;t be able to blend
in with the populace while on a mission

648
00:37:38 --> 00:37:41
sir

649
00:37:41 --> 00:37:44
yes

650
00:37:44 --> 00:37:47
one and three have been completely
destroyed

651
00:37:47 --> 00:37:52
total was one and three have engaged him
and be destroyed

652
00:37:52 --> 00:37:55
so what do we do now

653
00:37:55 --> 00:37:58
you&#39;re the one who wanted her to be
trained to fly combat she&#39;s exceeded our

654
00:37:58 --> 00:38:00
design expectations

655
00:38:00 --> 00:38:05
damn so we have a contact leaving the
atmosphere but it&#39;s not a tour

656
00:38:05 --> 00:38:12
brinkmanship have total seven and eight
prepared for launch of each of them

657
00:38:12 --> 00:38:15
armed with a three megatons future
torpedo tell the fighter pilots to

658
00:38:15 --> 00:38:19
detonate at those coordinates so it&#39;s
against the interspatial compact to

659
00:38:19 --> 00:38:21
detonate fusion devices and a planet&#39;s
atmosphere

660
00:38:21 --> 00:38:24
shut up and do as I say she&#39;ll try to
intercept the fighters in an attempt to

661
00:38:24 --> 00:38:27
save drinkman the torpedoes will
obliterate everything

662
00:38:27 --> 00:38:30
a hundred kilometers in all directions

663
00:38:30 --> 00:38:33
comment review proceeding toward radar
contact

664
00:38:33 --> 00:38:38
we&#39;ve got a long night Ren deciding

665
00:38:38 --> 00:38:39
shit to talk

666
00:38:39 --> 00:38:42
they must be tracking me since your
radar invisible

667
00:38:42 --> 00:38:45
I got him transferred to my ship and
let&#39;s get the hell out of here before

668
00:38:45 --> 00:38:46
it&#39;s too late

669
00:38:46 --> 00:38:50
I told you there won&#39;t be a plan in any
system where we will be safe if I fail

670
00:38:50 --> 00:38:53
trust me he never admitted if you trust
me

671
00:38:53 --> 00:38:56

that&#39;s not much time for fraud will be
fine wait for me

life

246
00:16:56 --> 00:17:03

long time to realize that yesterday can

247
00:17:03 --> 00:17:06

man

462
00:33:40 --> 00:33:43
yeah but you know what happened then
quit

463
00:33:43 --> 00:33:50
I started doing uppers to counteract of
Downers and function of the normal level

464
00:33:50 --> 00:33:53
which is really just what I was about to
begin with

465
00:33:53 --> 00:33:58
well that&#39;s that&#39;s what I mean I just
can&#39;t function in this place

466
00:33:58 --> 00:34:02
thank you about ready to flip out

467
00:34:02 --> 00:34:08

you can make that they really believe me

469

right i mean check this up

471
00:34:20 --> 00:34:25

472
00:34:25 --> 00:34:32
mean just look at this muscle rule your
neck my neck

473
00:34:32 --> 00:34:36
what about mine eh it&#39;s still fat hasn&#39;t
lost any weight at all

474
00:34:36 --> 00:34:41
look at it it&#39;s disgusting man say it&#39;s
that just what are you saying man how&#39;s

475
00:34:41 --> 00:34:43
a person supposed to lose weight in the
neck

476
00:34:43 --> 00:34:50
a strike he&#39;s probably got to make sense
for well it&#39;s like two key to the whole

477
00:34:50 --> 00:34:52
thing is , -

478
00:34:52 --> 00:34:59
intercall tranquility feeling good and
it&#39;s not being where the pain is

479
00:34:59 --> 00:35:02
that&#39;s like you have to take yourself on
a real mental trip

480
00:35:02 --> 00:35:05
if you have to separate yourself and
what&#39;s happening

481
00:35:05 --> 00:35:10
it&#39;s like divorce thought from action by
breaking thought down to its essence

482
00:35:10 --> 00:35:13
and

483
00:35:13 --> 00:35:15
then you have to visualize something
that

484
00:35:15 --> 00:35:19
something that&#39;s felt good to you before
you remember is good to take their

485
00:35:19 --> 00:35:21
places of the pain

486
00:35:21 --> 00:35:26
I think of think of of the thing that
you&#39;ve experienced before

487
00:35:26 --> 00:35:31
it&#39;s like really experience until all
becomes more real than real

488
00:35:31 --> 00:35:38
and then you have to visualize

489
00:35:38 --> 00:35:38
and

490
00:35:38 --> 00:35:41
taste smell and feel

491
00:35:41 --> 00:35:49
it just fills your head there&#39;s nothing
else there nothing else exists and then

492
00:35:49 --> 00:35:52
you there

493
00:35:52 --> 00:36:03
yeah

494

patriotism

803
00:59:55 --> 00:59:57

01:00:01 --> 01:00:04
I carry guns and I&#39;ve killed me

simply so that you and I can sit here
and talk like this

807
01:00:07 --> 01:00:10

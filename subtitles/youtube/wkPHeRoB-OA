00:00:00 --> 00:00:02
&lt;I&gt; And you thought they were trunks lying there. I&#39;ll tell you ... &lt;/ i&gt;

3
00:00:02 --> 00:00:03
&lt;I&gt; these alligators are evil. They are real. &lt;/ I&gt;

4
00:00:03 --> 00:00:06
&lt;I&gt; By the way, guys, you get a genuine baby alligator ... &lt;/ i&gt;

5
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
&lt;I&gt; and other souvenirs in the tent outside. &lt;/ I&gt;

6
00:00:09 --> 00:00:14
&lt;I&gt; You get a genuine alligator in the tent back there. &lt;/ I&gt;

7
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
-Podiam Do without the fake blood. - It&#39;s true, Mom.

8
00:00:16 --> 00:00:17
Why do not you shoot him?

9
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
They turned him back, he goes to sleep.

10
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
&lt;I&gt; Stay calm now. We have everything under control. &lt;/ I&gt;

11
00:00:21 --> 00:00:22
&lt;I&gt; Do not worry. Let&#39;s get him out of there. &lt;/ I&gt;

12
00:00:22 --> 00:00:23
&lt;I&gt; He&#39;s right, folks. &lt;/ I&gt;

13
00:00:23 --> 00:00:25
&lt;I&gt; We promise a fight alligators, staff, and ... &lt;/ i&gt;

14
00:00:25 --> 00:00:26
&lt;I&gt; sometimes the alligators win. &lt;/ I&gt;

15
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
&lt;I&gt; Palmas to Bobby Purcell, folks. Bobby Purcell. &lt;/ I&gt;

16
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
&lt;I&gt; Good boy, Bobby. You can go back next week. &lt;/ I&gt;

17
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
Honey, are wicked animals. He saw what they did to that man today?

18
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
Let&#39;s go Dear. It&#39;s starting to rain.

19
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
- And when he grows up? - I&#39;ll give it to the zoo.

20
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
Choose a cute, darling. Go ahead, not hurt you.

21
00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
Little babies are delicate. Let&#39;s go!

22
00:00:42 --> 00:00:43
I&#39;ll call it Ramon.

23
00:00:43 --> 00:00:45
- Cute. - Come on, honey.

24
00:00:45 --> 00:00:46
WELCOME TO MISSOURI

25
00:00:46 --> 00:00:47
This is your home.

26
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
Why not come and go to bed? Because I have to go to bed too.

27
00:00:50 --> 00:00:55
When you wake up, you go to school. Take a bus to school-alligator.

28
00:00:55 --> 00:01:00
You will go to school here. It has a lot of things you will like here.

29
00:01:00 --> 00:01:02
It has a fish, crickets and insects.

30
00:01:02 --> 00:01:06
You&#39;ll love living here, Ramón. It&#39;s so fun.

31
00:01:06 --> 00:01:07
It&#39;s time to go to bed.

32
00:01:07 --> 00:01:09
&lt;I&gt; The city of Chicago remains a chaos this morning. &lt;/ I&gt;

33
00:01:09 --> 00:01:12
&lt;I&gt; Hundreds of angry interrupted the Democratic Convention of 1968 ... &lt;/ i&gt;

34
00:01:12 --> 00:01:14
&lt;I&gt; fighting with the police force of Mayor Daly last night. &lt;/ I&gt;

35
00:01:14 --> 00:01:16
&lt;I&gt; - Hundreds were injured ... - Shut up &lt;/ i&gt;

36
00:01:16 --> 00:01:18
- Marisa! - She&#39;s not home!

37
00:01:18 --> 00:01:22
- Where the hell is she? - At school, the science fair.

38
00:01:22 --> 00:01:25
- What will you do with it? - I&#39;ll get rid of it.

39
00:01:25 --> 00:01:29
- This fucking alligator ... - And what will say to her?

40
00:01:29 --> 00:01:32
Let&#39;s say we found him dead, as we did with the hamsters.

41
00:01:32 --> 00:01:33
No, Bill.

42
00:01:33 --> 00:01:35
We will bury you in the sea.

43
00:01:35 --> 00:01:39
12 YEARS LATER

44
00:01:39 --> 00:01:40
Okay, people. Excuse.

45
00:01:40 --> 00:01:42
I think he took. What do you say, man?

46
00:01:42 --> 00:01:43
I know exactly for what you are going through.

47
00:01:43 --> 00:01:44
What are you looking at?

48
00:01:44 --> 00:01:48
The clearing behind the rareamento front. It&#39;s the same thing! The same thing.

49
00:01:48 --> 00:01:49
- You know? - Yes.

50
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
Right. How much is it? 15.90.

51
00:01:51 --> 00:01:55
I had another, a white. I was in front of the grocery store. I was there for 2 minutes and ... bingo!

52
00:01:55 --> 00:01:59
This happens a lot in this neighborhood. You call the police?

53
00:01:59 --> 00:02:00
I am the police.

54
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
The name was Snaps. I want to catch you.

55
00:02:02 --> 00:02:07
I know how you feel. It&#39;s cute, you cling to it, is not it?

56
00:02:07 --> 00:02:08
Yeah, if it sticks.

57
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
Duty calls, you know? Thank you.

58
00:02:10 --> 00:02:11
Do you have any advice?

59
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
Do not leave your shoes on the floor for a few months.

60
00:02:13 --> 00:02:14
- The teeth are being born. - Thank you.

61
00:02:14 --> 00:02:14
All right, man.

62
00:02:14 --> 00:02:15
How do you think it was like that?

63
00:02:15 --> 00:02:16
It looks like it was chewed.

64
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
It is the hand of a worker. Look at these calluses.

65
00:02:19 --> 00:02:20
Anything else?

66
00:02:20 --> 00:02:24
They found a lhasa apsu floating in the same tank.

67
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
- What is this, some kind of geek? - It is a type of dog.

68
00:02:26 --> 00:02:27
It has a clue who it could be.

69
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
- You! The Homicides here? - Yes it&#39;s me.

70
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
The boss wants you out there. Is a lady who has a dog.

71
00:02:32 --> 00:02:32
I&#39;ll be there.

72
00:02:32 --> 00:02:35
We had a big toe in the morgue once. Nothing, just a big toe.

73
00:02:35 --> 00:02:36
We never find the rest.

74
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
We not discovered who he was. We did a funeral and everything.

75
00:02:39 --> 00:02:40
It must have been a very small coffin.

76
00:02:40 --> 00:02:45
I checked the dog. There are only three of the race recorded throughout the state.

77
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
It reported the disappearance to two months ago.

78
00:02:47 --> 00:02:48
It all fits now.

79
00:02:48 --> 00:02:52
The body decomposes a little, but only internal organs were torn ...

80
00:02:52 --> 00:02:54
fully. The vocal cords were cut.

81
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
It seems so to Taffy.

82
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
Mrs. Moss, this is Madison detective.

83
00:02:59 --> 00:02:59
Hi.

84
00:02:59 --> 00:03:02
It looks exactly like Taffy. But it is much higher.

85
00:03:02 --> 00:03:06
It has the same brands, the same colors, everything.

86
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
It was up to her two months ago when I lost.

87
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
- That was up suéter that Dog? - Yes.

88
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
In there. See if you make some friends.

89
00:03:13 --> 00:03:15
Come on, dog. Here we go.

90
00:03:15 --> 00:03:17
I&#39;ll need more of these to this experiment.

91
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
How about a few cats? I have several cats.

92
00:03:20 --> 00:03:20
Doggies.

93
00:03:20 --> 00:03:22
I also have a budgie would like to get rid of.

94
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
Doggies! When finished with these, you can throw them away.

95
00:03:25 --> 00:03:25
It&#39;s all right.

96
00:03:25 --> 00:03:26
Oh my God.

97
00:03:26 --> 00:03:31
You know, a police officer came to my shop this morning. Almost peed myself.

98
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
I&#39;m scared, you know? I&#39;m really scared.

99
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
I think I should be on the low for some time, you know?

100
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
Gutchel, I need many more animals.

101
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
The boss is calling me results. Now, hurry up.

102
00:03:42 --> 00:03:42
Right.

103
00:03:42 --> 00:03:46
- Doggies. - Doggies.

104
00:03:46 --> 00:03:49
- Kelly? - Yes.

105
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
- Are you a friend of Edward Norton? - Yes, so what?

106
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
His timecard shows that last Friday he went out at 3 o&#39;clock,

107
00:03:54 --> 00:03:56
but his wallet and his clothes are still in your closet.

108
00:03:56 --> 00:04:00
I hit the card to him. He&#39;s right, is not it?

109
00:04:00 --> 00:04:01
What was the last place you saw him?

110
00:04:01 --> 00:04:06
It must have been Friday. We were going to open a part of the system near the center.

111
00:04:06 --> 00:04:07
Bastard.

112
00:04:07 --> 00:04:07
God!

113
00:04:07 --> 00:04:14
Well, I have to you imbeciles move.

114
00:04:14 --> 00:04:15
Let&#39;s go!

115
00:04:15 --> 00:04:16
Let&#39;s go!

116
00:04:16 --> 00:04:20
You know, if this continues, I will open a shop of spare parts.

117
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
- This is not the guy you came from the arm? - How do you know?

118
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
This guy cuts the square nails, the other the arredondava.

119
00:04:25 --> 00:04:26
What he wore on his feet? He was wearing boots?

120
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
No, I wore crocodile boots with metal spikes.

121
00:04:29 --> 00:04:30
It is the normal drainage equipment.

122
00:04:30 --> 00:04:35
We have one here and pathology discovered something very interesting.

123
00:04:35 --> 00:04:36
- What? - Cat Sand.

124
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
The guy must have been a fanatic cats.

125
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
Yes, we do a lot of research with animals.

126
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
Have you done business with a pet shop called Gutchel?

127
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
Our animals were raised here or caught in the state kennel.

128
00:04:45 --> 00:04:46
What happens when you run out of test animals?

129
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
We have to suspend the search, if it happens.

130
00:04:48 --> 00:04:49
- You take care of hormones, right? - Yes.

131
00:04:49 --> 00:04:56
Hypothetically, an adult dog can double its size in two months?

132
00:04:56 --> 00:04:57
Not currently.

133
00:04:57 --> 00:04:59
Look, detective, I would like to be more help, but ...

134
00:04:59 --> 00:05:03
as I said, when we finished with the animals, we took them back to the kennel ...

135
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
for cremation. Everything is carefully regulated by the humane society.

136
00:05:06 --> 00:05:11
Is it possible one of these animals to escape and finish the sewer system?

137
00:05:11 --> 00:05:14
No. Not at all.

138
00:05:14 --> 00:05:15
- They are very quiet. - Pardon?

139
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
I said that your animal tests are very quiet.

140
00:05:17 --> 00:05:23
Yes. We cut the vocal cords when they arrive. It helps to keep down the noise.

141
00:05:23 --> 00:05:24
Yes, it helps.

142
00:05:24 --> 00:05:31
Stop tap dancing so son. He was caught pants down.

143
00:05:31 --> 00:05:34
We are close in hormone research, sir. I think we should continue ...

144
00:05:34 --> 00:05:37
Yes. Well to the police, is not it?

145
00:05:37 --> 00:05:41
Gutchel was paid to another fund. So it can not be connected to the company.

146
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
I got rid of all animal that could be trackable.

147
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
- This Madison who was here ... - Yes, yes, yes.

148
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
- I&#39;m going to fix it. - Pardon?

149
00:05:48 --> 00:05:52
Not with the police that we care. It is with the fucking journalists.

150
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
- They want to ruin our image. - Yes sir.

151
00:05:54 --> 00:06:02
Go back to your chemistry set and I&#39;ll manage at all. Go go.

152
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
- Thank you sir. - Do not talk to any reporter.

153
00:06:05 --> 00:06:05
Yes sir.

154
00:06:05 --> 00:06:06
I do not know why I have to talk to them.

155
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
Why is your case. You have to accompany the music.

156
00:06:09 --> 00:06:12
- Jesus! You do not want a razor? - I was in a hurry in the morning.

157
00:06:12 --> 00:06:14
In a hurry!? For God&#39;s sake, you&#39;re half an hour late.

158
00:06:14 --> 00:06:17
- These reporters are imbeciles. - Watch your language there.

159
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
Edward Norton worked in the Department of Sewerage for 25 years.

160
00:06:19 --> 00:06:21
They identified another victim? And what you know about him?

161
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
Luke Gutchel had a pet store.

162
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
And Gutchel had a criminal record?

163
00:06:25 --> 00:06:25
No comments.

164
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
Detective, there is some evidence that links the two murders?

165
00:06:28 --> 00:06:31
We do not know if it was a murder and if there was evidence, could not comment on it.

166
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
-has Something that can comment? -Next question.

167
00:06:33 --> 00:06:33
Say it again.

168
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
As the bodies stopped drains?

169
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
In the city, we use a combination of sewage and drainage system ...

170
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
Therefore, the bodies can be stopped at any point.

171
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
Can you give us the cause of death in each case?

172
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
The bodies were dismembered. We hope the coroner&#39;s report.

173
00:06:43 --> 00:06:44
Can you tell us, at least, if they were similar?

174
00:06:44 --> 00:06:44
The bodies were dismembered.

175
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
- Are hiding information? - No comments.

176
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
You think you have some sort of Jack the Ripper, operating in the city?

177
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
It&#39;s a little too early to speculate that kind of ...

178
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
What reason do you think there were these attacks?

179
00:06:53 --> 00:06:55
Increase sales of newspapers. Look, I can not do that.

180
00:06:55 --> 00:06:59
As you can see, we have little information at this time.

181
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
Now, if you&#39;ll excuse us, Madison detective and I have work to do.

182
00:07:02 --> 00:07:05
Madison police, you are the same David Madison who lost his partner ...

183
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
Hotel in Baldwin incident in St. Louis?

184
00:07:07 --> 00:07:07
Yes.

185
00:07:07 --> 00:07:09
His partner was stabbed to death, was not it?

186
00:07:09 --> 00:07:11
- He was shot. - That&#39;s right. Excuse me.

187
00:07:11 --> 00:07:13
We will keep you informed. Thank you.

188
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
Let me tell the story of the theft of animals for them to have something to do.

189
00:07:15 --> 00:07:16
You&#39;re terrible, David.

190
00:07:16 --> 00:07:17
When you represent the department, you ...

191
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
Pete, I had a bad night. I had a nightmare.

192
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
I did not sleep much, not shaved this morning. So give me a break.

193
00:07:21 --> 00:07:24
David, you can not let that thing the Hotel Baldwin bother you.

194
00:07:24 --> 00:07:26
That was five years ago and no one blames you.

195
00:07:26 --> 00:07:28
Yes. Tell that to the newspapers. Thank you.

196

00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
I need someone to check the sewer me. Shamsky?

200
00:07:36 --> 00:07:37
I have to go in court today.

201
00:07:37 --> 00:07:38
Meyer, you can go?

202
00:07:38 --> 00:07:41
I think the boss will not release us.

203
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
- Sloan, what are you doing? - Taking care of the paperwork.

204
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
What, is my breath? They can make a draw. I need someone.

205
00:07:45 --> 00:07:45
I will.

206
00:07:45 --> 00:07:45
You go.

207
00:07:45 --> 00:07:49
I&#39;ll need some boots. Just I shine my shoes and ...

208
00:07:49 --> 00:07:50
- I do not want to water them. - You bet.

209
00:07:50 --> 00:07:50
You bet.

210
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
Achieving a methane pocket, it will help them.

211
00:07:52 --> 00:07:52
Right.

212
00:07:52 --> 00:07:53
Who cuts your hair, Madison?

213
00:07:53 --> 00:07:54
I, most of the times. Because?

214
00:07:54 --> 00:07:55
You should see a hair salon.

215
00:07:55 --> 00:07:59
Let your hair grow and divide aside. No one will be able to see.

216
00:07:59 --> 00:08:00
- Sir? - Yes.

217
00:08:00 --> 00:08:03
- I killed the man in the sewer. - Madison?

218
00:08:03 --> 00:08:04
Crazy.

219
00:08:04 --> 00:08:08
If you give us a second, I&#39;ll take you to Sergeant Reynolds. He will take his confession.

220
00:08:08 --> 00:08:13
No sir. I did not come to confess. I came ... to kill the rest of you.

221
00:08:13 --> 00:08:17
- I understand. How will you do that? - I&#39;m armed with explosives.

222
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
You two. Do not move!

223
00:08:20 --> 00:08:25
Your time is running out. I who I rode.

224
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
- Why would you do that, son? - They sent me.

225
00:08:28 --> 00:08:32
- Who sent you? - They. by radio.

226
00:08:32 --> 00:08:36
Madison, he&#39;s bluffing. Go left.

227
00:08:36 --> 00:08:37
- Calm down, Kelly. - Do not move.

228
00:08:37 --> 00:08:44
I&#39;ll kill us all. They sent me. by radio. by radio.

229
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
Dude, take your finger off the button, please.

230
00:08:46 --> 00:08:46
Kelly!

231
00:08:46 --> 00:08:47
They told me, do not understand? The voices ... the voices.

232
00:08:47 --> 00:08:48
- Friend. - The voices. The voices.

233
00:08:48 --> 00:08:51
Friend wants to know the truth. I was left-handed, they made me right handed.

234
00:08:51 --> 00:08:56
I wanted to be a priest, and I became a cop. You want to blow the place up? I do not care.

235
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
I stopped wanting to be a police officer last week.

236
00:08:58 --> 00:08:59
Not even blink.

237
00:08:59 --> 00:09:00
- What do I do? - Do not do anything yet.

238
00:09:00 --> 00:09:01
Look on your side. Not that side.

239
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
You must have a button near the counter.

240
00:09:03 --> 00:09:04
- Over 10 seconds. - OK.

241
00:09:04 --> 00:09:07
Right. More 9 seconds. I got, got, got it.

242
00:09:07 --> 00:09:08
Nobody move. Hold it tightly.

243
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
- I got him. - Let&#39;s see what we have here.

244
00:09:11 --> 00:09:12
It&#39;s a radio.

245
00:09:12 --> 00:09:14
Next time, try another place.

246
00:09:14 --> 00:09:16
Hey, Sloan, with all the paperwork. Come and fiche this guy.

247
00:09:16 --> 00:09:16
OK.

248
00:09:16 --> 00:09:20
- Did you see that guy&#39;s face? - And you thought he was bluffing.

249
00:09:20 --> 00:09:24
- You can not live forever. - It will not last long in the police with that attitude.

250
00:09:24 --> 00:09:27
Listening. Oh, man.

251
00:09:27 --> 00:09:28
Look at this place.

252
00:09:28 --> 00:09:32
- You worked in Saint Louis? - Yes.

253
00:09:32 --> 00:09:32
Why did you leave?

254
00:09:32 --> 00:09:33
I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard the story.

255
00:09:33 --> 00:09:37
All I heard is that it&#39;s kind of hard to work with you.

256
00:09:37 --> 00:09:38
Why you volunteered?

257
00:09:38 --> 00:09:43
They talk a lot of nonsense. Also, I know I care, you know what I mean?

258
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47
Well, I can not find anything.

259
00:09:47 --> 00:09:48
I&#39;m not surprised.

260
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
These maps are not complete. They were made in 1890.

261
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
We will lose the way. Here it is.

262
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
We can get home before dinner.

263
00:09:55 --> 00:09:56
Oh, man.

264
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
Methane. Use your mask.

265
00:09:58 --> 00:09:59
Do not light any match.

266
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
I saw a methane explosion at Saint Louis once.

267
00:10:01 --> 00:10:03
He opened a hole in the street. A bus fell into.

268
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
Well, at least we can find our way out of here.

269
00:10:05 --> 00:10:06
Where are we?

270
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
Accordingly, Cleveland.

271
00:10:08 --> 00:10:09
I met a guy like you in St. Louis.

272
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
They called him Billy Wild. It did not give a damn what happened.

273
00:10:12 --> 00:10:14
We were near the park once. Do you know Saint Louis?

274
00:10:14 --> 00:10:14
Kelly?

275
00:10:14 --> 00:10:14
Kelly?

276
00:10:14 --> 00:10:14
Kelly?

277
00:10:14 --> 00:10:15
Kelly?

278
00:10:15 --> 00:10:16
Kelly?

279
00:10:16 --> 00:10:17
Kelly?

280
00:10:17 --> 00:10:17
Kelly?

281
00:10:17 --> 00:10:17
Kelly?

282
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
I should give you a shot, asshole.

283
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
You have to relax, Madison.

284
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
Damn it. What do you think?

285
00:10:23 --> 00:10:25
I think someone&#39;s been here recently.

286
00:10:25 --> 00:10:27
I think we should come back here with a team and look better this place.

287
00:10:27 --> 00:10:28
Hey, Madison.

288
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
I do not mind telling you. I&#39;m getting kind of tired of this sewer.

289
00:10:31 --> 00:10:32
Son of a bitch.

290
00:10:32 --> 00:10:33
Wait a minute. I take.

291
00:10:33 --> 00:10:37
Here it is. Unroll each. That&#39;s right.

292
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
Right. It seems that if we follow this direction, we will find a way out.

293
00:10:41 --> 00:10:41
Will be home for dinner.

294
00:10:41 --> 00:10:42
I&#39;m not hungry anymore.

295
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
- Open it! - You&#39;re stuck.

296
00:10:44 --> 00:10:44
Push!

297
00:10:44 --> 00:10:45
- Move up! - I&#39;m moving up.

298
00:10:45 --> 00:10:45
No!

299
00:10:45 --> 00:10:45
No!

300
00:10:45 --> 00:10:46
No!

301
00:10:46 --> 00:10:46
Kelly!

302
00:10:46 --> 00:10:46
Kelly!

303
00:10:46 --> 00:10:48
&lt;I&gt; Dr. Klein. Calling Dr. Klein. &lt;/ I&gt;

304
00:10:48 --> 00:10:48
No!

305
00:10:48 --> 00:10:52
- There you are. - How did I get here?

306
00:10:52 --> 00:10:56
You came out of a culvert at the Campbell Street and started shouting &quot;alligator&quot;.

307
00:10:56 --> 00:10:59
Oh Jesus! Kelly!

308
00:10:59 --> 00:10:59
Kelly!

309
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
- Hey, hey, you will not get ... - Leave him alone.

310
00:11:02 --> 00:11:03
What happened to Kelly? You found?

311
00:11:03 --> 00:11:06
No. No signal. You know how it is.

312
00:11:06 --> 00:11:08
Stay for a few days. Pega takes.

313
00:11:08 --> 00:11:10
What you mean? We need to go back down there.

314
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
- You need to rest, David. - You are crazy?!

315
00:11:12 --> 00:11:13
You think I&#39;m going to lie in this bed as a kid ...

316
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
I sent to the sewer is gone?

317
00:11:15 --> 00:11:18
- Dr. Lee needs to see it. - Who is this Dr. Lee?

318
00:11:18 --> 00:11:19
He is a psychiatrist.

319
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
- He just to give you some tests. - I&#39;ll give you some tests.

320
00:11:21 --> 00:11:22
- He&#39;ll give you something for the head. - You who need something.

321
00:11:22 --> 00:11:23
- What is the matter with you? - Hi.

322
00:11:23 --> 00:11:23
How it feels?

323
00:11:23 --> 00:11:26
- What&#39;s it? Lost your newspaper delivery? - What is your problem?

324
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
- I just want to write a story. - Invent. Do you know how to do this.

325
00:11:29 --> 00:11:32
- I heard you lost another partner. - He has no comment on this.

326
00:11:32 --> 00:11:35
This is becoming a habit of yours. I drew the Baldwin Hotel shooting file.

327
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37
Hey, Kemp. Get out.

328
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
I&#39;m out. You tell me what happened yesterday in the sewer.

329
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
- No comments. - Chief, I&#39;m not asking you.

330
00:11:43 --> 00:11:44
I&#39;m asking for the Madison police.

331
00:11:44 --> 00:11:46
This is exactly what we find out, is not it, Chief?

332
00:11:46 --> 00:11:46
Right.

333
00:11:46 --> 00:11:49
The largest ever cataloged was about five meters.

334
00:11:49 --> 00:11:53
The sewer is not possible. Not at the zoo they grow to the maximum.

335
00:11:53 --> 00:11:54
It was bigger than that.

336
00:11:54 --> 00:11:56
- Excuse. - It was huge.

337
00:11:56 --> 00:11:58
Tell me something, Miss.

338
00:11:58 --> 00:12:02
- These snakes are yours? -. Not belong to the University.

339
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
- I have some non-poisonous at home. - It was more than five meters.

340
00:12:06 --> 00:12:09
An alligator half that size would starve to death in a week.

341
00:12:09 --> 00:12:12
There is no sunlight. There toxic gases and fluids.

342
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
Not to mention the question of how you got there first.

343
00:12:14 --> 00:12:17
If you saw what I saw, it was great.

344
00:12:17 --> 00:12:19
You said it was dark. Maybe you are mistaken.

345
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
Right. Thanks a lot for the help. Can I borrow this book?

346
00:12:23 --> 00:12:23
You can stay with him.

347
00:12:23 --> 00:12:23
Excuse.

348
00:12:23 --> 00:12:30
Dra. Kempdall, there may be another animal down there to be this big?

349
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
Nothing that I know. I&#39;m sorry.

350
00:12:32 --> 00:12:33
Thank you very much.

351
00:12:33 --> 00:12:34
I thought she would be of some help.

352
00:12:34 --> 00:12:37
It is the highest authority. It was worth trying.

353
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
Is playing?! She lives with snakes. What the hell you talking about?

354
00:12:39 --> 00:12:43
I did not say it was normal. She said she knew about alligators.

355
00:12:43 --> 00:12:46
Why not give up, David? It is one of his nightmares.

356
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
Nightmare is your ass. There&#39;s something down there.

357
00:12:48 --> 00:12:50
It will cost a lot of guys, but we&#39;re going to flush it.

358
00:12:50 --> 00:12:53
The only thing it will take is a license.

359
00:12:53 --> 00:12:54
Here, read it and weep.

360
00:12:54 --> 00:12:56
Our friend Kemp is to you.

361
00:12:56 --> 00:12:58
&quot;Cop loses new partner.&quot;

362
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
&quot;Serious circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the sewer ...

363
00:13:01 --> 00:13:05
Police Jim Kelly, detective partner David Madison during an investigation.

364
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
Such mysteries surrounding the death of Jerry Randolph, the Saint Louis police

365
00:13:09 --> 00:13:12
it was Madison partner in the fatal night of March 21, 1975 &quot;.

366
00:13:12 --> 00:13:15
&quot;Witnesses say the Madison detective in action,

367
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
unable to escape, wounded Randolph in the process.

368
00:13:19 --> 00:13:25
A commission of inquiry investigating the case discovered nothing about Madison.

369
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
- In the most recent disappearance ... &quot;- Hey, guys.

370
00:13:27 --> 00:13:27
Nice.

371
00:13:27 --> 00:13:31
&quot;In the most recent disappearance, officials would not comment.

372
00:13:31 --> 00:13:34
This reporter is not satisfied. &quot;

373
00:13:34 --> 00:13:35
Well, what kind of dreams?

374
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
He was under &quot;meds&quot; for most of that year.

375
00:13:37 --> 00:13:39
- What are &quot;meds&quot;? - Medication.

376
00:13:39 --> 00:13:42
He was talking nonsense like alligators in the sewer.

377
00:13:42 --> 00:13:45
- Alligators in the sewers? - Yes.

378
00:13:45 --> 00:13:47
Nice. Wonderful place.

379
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
Jesus Christ!

380
00:13:49 --> 00:13:50
Marisa Kempdall?

381
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
Hello? No, I was awake.

382
00:13:52 --> 00:13:53
Wait a minute. Go slow.

383
00:13:53 --> 00:13:53
Kemp?

384
00:13:53 --> 00:13:53
Do not.

385
00:13:53 --> 00:13:54
Yes, I&#39;m coming right over.

386
00:13:54 --> 00:13:58
Here is his camera. He caught in a tank.

387
00:13:58 --> 00:13:59
And no sign of Kemp?

388
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
The sewage staff did not speak any more.

389
00:14:01 --> 00:14:03
The rumor is starting to spread.

390
00:14:03 --> 00:14:04
- Of course it is. - Take while it&#39;s hot.

391
00:14:04 --> 00:14:05
There&#39;s something good for us?

392
00:14:05 --> 00:14:06
You will not believe.

393
00:14:06 --> 00:14:09
- It&#39;s a rat. - No, not that. On here. Look.

394
00:14:09 --> 00:14:11
Holy shit!

395
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
What do you think, Chief? You believe me now?

396
00:14:13 --> 00:14:15
Let&#39;s take the girl snakes to take a look.

397
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
- Who? - The herpetóloga.

398
00:14:17 --> 00:14:20
Imagine looking through your camera as it comes up on you.

399
00:14:20 --> 00:14:23
Well, it will be the first page, the way he wanted.

400
00:14:23 --> 00:14:26
Thomas Kemp, the magazine reporter &quot;National Probe&quot; ...

401
00:14:26 --> 00:14:27
He is missing and presumably dead.

402
00:14:27 --> 00:14:29
Your camera, the only clue to the disappearance,

403
00:14:29 --> 00:14:32
It was taken from a filtration tank sewer system last night.

404
00:14:32 --> 00:14:34
The film inside the camera has been saved.

405
00:14:34 --> 00:14:38
What seemed to be an unusually large alligator or similar reptile ...

406
00:14:38 --> 00:14:41
believed to be now responsible for at least four deaths.

407
00:14:41 --> 00:14:45
As mayor, I promise that no effort and no expense will be spared ...

408
00:14:45 --> 00:14:48
Professor, herpetóloga, author and probably the authority ...

409
00:14:48 --> 00:14:52
Here in the Midwest about reptiles and amphibian life.

410
00:14:52 --> 00:14:55
-. Dr. Kendall, what animal is that? - It&#39;s an alligator.

411
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
- It could not be ... - No doubt. It&#39;s definitely an alligator.

412
00:14:57 --> 00:15:00
I understand. What size should have, based on the photos you saw?

413
00:15:00 --> 00:15:02
If you&#39;re living in the sewer, could not be very large.

414
00:15:02 --> 00:15:04
Even under ideal conditions as the zoo, e.g.

415
00:15:04 --> 00:15:06
They are not even close to the size that would be in the wild.

416
00:15:06 --> 00:15:08
This causes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ...

417
00:15:08 --> 00:15:08
Where are you?

418
00:15:08 --> 00:15:10
Let&#39;s go guys! Let&#39;s go!

419
00:15:10 --> 00:15:12
- Answer? - Is that you, Paul?

420
00:15:12 --> 00:15:14
- Yes, who is it? - This is Frank.

421
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
- You&#39;re in position? - Yes.

422
00:15:16 --> 00:15:18
Unit answer. Who is it?

423
00:15:18 --> 00:15:21
We times entering each possible entry point.

424
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
Advancing and joining these three main channels.

425
00:15:24 --> 00:15:27
So that there is only one way out, which is here.

426
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
- And if he does not come? - Do not worry.

427
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
- He will come. - Oh, Dr. Kendall..

428
00:15:31 --> 00:15:34
- If you do not corner him, you will be fine. - Madison Detective?

429
00:15:34 --> 00:15:35
Who invited her?

430
00:15:35 --> 00:15:38
David, we do not know how this thing will react. Maybe she can help us.

431
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
- All units are positioned. - Thank you. Call me with them, please.

432
00:15:41 --> 00:15:44
- Here is the Madison. - Here is the Rudy. We are ready.

433
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
I did not believe you, then I&#39;m sorry.

434
00:15:46 --> 00:15:51
I did not care much for it. Okay, here is the Madison, the operation commander.

435
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
Command Center, this is the unit 1 and are moving forward.

436
00:15:53 --> 00:15:54
Unit 2, advancing.

437
00:15:54 --> 00:15:55
Here is the unit 3 forward.

438
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
I&#39;m still waiting for Carr. I can not talk to him on the radio.

439
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
- Have you tried ... - You are a quarter of the street.

440
00:16:01 --> 00:16:03
I&#39;m still waiting for Carr. I cant talk with him.

441
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
Try to talk to him, okay? Madison? Madison ?!

442
00:16:06 --> 00:16:11
Charlie, you have to back some 200 yards to the southwest and turn.

443
00:16:11 --> 00:16:12
This is Clark.

444
00:16:12 --> 00:16:15
I had one as a child. An alligator.

445
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
My father found him dead, so I could not stay with him for long.

446
00:16:17 --> 00:16:18
His name was Ramon.

447
00:16:18 --> 00:16:21
In fact, they are not good pets. The snakes are much better.

448
00:16:21 --> 00:16:23
- It is a strange girl, you know? - I&#39;m not a girl.

449
00:16:23 --> 00:16:24
Anyone younger than me is a boy.

450
00:16:24 --> 00:16:25
I&#39;m sorry about your friend.

451
00:16:25 --> 00:16:26
It must have been a terrible thing to see.

452
00:16:26 --> 00:16:30
Madison! 3 Charlie called and said he will leave in about 5 minutes.

453
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
- It&#39;s still there. - Where will you go?

454
00:16:32 --> 00:16:34
Where it came from, that&#39;s what I know.

455
00:16:34 --> 00:16:37
Mayor, this is David Madison, he is leading the operation.

456
00:16:37 --> 00:16:40
All grab your guns. In position. Let&#39;s go!

457
00:16:40 --> 00:16:40
In their positions.

458
00:16:40 --> 00:16:45
Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

459
00:16:45 --> 00:16:49
David, we need to figure out how we deal with the press about it.

460
00:16:49 --> 00:16:51
They lost, Chief. Somehow, more still inside.

461
00:16:51 --> 00:16:53
Come on, David. Let&#39;s get out of here.

462
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
- Chief Clark, can you tell what happened? - Anything! Nothing to declare.

463
00:16:56 --> 00:16:57
Conference with printed the morning.

464
00:16:57 --> 00:16:59
- Let&#39;s go! Come on, okay? - Do not fill.

465
00:16:59 --> 00:17:01
- Let&#39;s go. - Let&#39;s go. Let&#39;s go.

466
00:17:01 --> 00:17:01
Hitter.

467
00:17:01 --> 00:17:02
It is one of the TV.

468
00:17:02 --> 00:17:04
Let&#39;s get out of here. Let&#39;s go! Let&#39;s go!

469
00:17:04 --> 00:17:07
Oh no! He got me! He got me!

470
00:17:07 --> 00:17:09
Help! Help!

471
00:17:09 --> 00:17:09
Mother!

472
00:17:09 --> 00:17:13
Mother! Mother! The alligator! The alligator! It is the alligator!

473
00:17:13 --> 00:17:14
- I&#39;m on the phone. - But it is the alligator.

474
00:17:14 --> 00:17:15
I said later!

475
00:17:15 --> 00:17:19
Sorry, Connie, is this thing alligator and Joey&#39;s driving me crazy.

476
00:17:19 --> 00:17:21
Where I was? Ah, yes ... Joey back here!

477
00:17:21 --> 00:17:23
He took my knife. Joey&#39;s driving me crazy.

478
00:17:23 --> 00:17:24
Wide that damn map.

479
00:17:24 --> 00:17:27
Look, I gave you 78 men, you have the National Guard ...

480
00:17:27 --> 00:17:30
and you still lost in the city. Look at the hole he made.

481
00:17:30 --> 00:17:31
- He seeks water. - What?

482
00:17:31 --> 00:17:35
He seeks water. He spent a lot of energy and looking for a place with water to rest.

483
00:17:35 --> 00:17:40
Wonderful! We have rivers, we have channels, and look at that lake there.

484
00:17:40 --> 00:17:43
The safety of the public is my job.

485
00:17:43 --> 00:17:45
You do not have work unless I am reelected.

486
00:17:45 --> 00:17:47
Look, this can generate a lot of good publicity.

487
00:17:47 --> 00:17:50
And I can not have your personal cluttering everything. That is all.

488
00:17:50 --> 00:17:52
Give this girl an idea how big it was. Just a guess.

489
00:17:52 --> 00:17:53
It was the size of it?

490
00:17:53 --> 00:17:54
- Know the El Dorado? - The car?

491
00:17:54 --> 00:17:56
No, the refrigerator. Of course it&#39;s the car.

492
00:17:56 --> 00:17:58
Wait a minute. Are you saying that is as big as a car?

493
00:17:58 --> 00:18:01
Yes. Of course you can not count on the tail.

494
00:18:01 --> 00:18:02
- Of course. - Yes.

495
00:18:02 --> 00:18:04
Look at the size of that thing.

496
00:18:04 --> 00:18:08
This is amazing! Accordingly, should have 9 to 12 meters.

497
00:18:08 --> 00:18:09
But it is an alligator?

498
00:18:09 --> 00:18:12
David, this is Colonel Brock.

499
00:18:12 --> 00:18:13
What the hell is this?

500
00:18:13 --> 00:18:15
They are exploding a bomb to see if they can bring it up.

501
00:18:15 --> 00:18:17
It&#39;s a wild animal, not a submarine.

502
00:18:17 --> 00:18:19
I called Colonel Brock to take over the operation.

503
00:18:19 --> 00:18:19
Take care?

504
00:18:19 --> 00:18:21
He has hunted large animals around the world.

505
00:18:21 --> 00:18:22
It&#39;s a new game, David.

506
00:18:22 --> 00:18:25
- What do you expect me to do? - Just get out of my way.

507
00:18:25 --> 00:18:26
I&#39;ll start now, folks.

508
00:18:26 --> 00:18:29
- Hey, Madison! - The fault is not it the alligator have fled.

509
00:18:29 --> 00:18:31
Who is this beautiful girl?

510
00:18:31 --> 00:18:37
- Color Brock, this is Dr. Kendall ... -.. Oh the girl lizards.

511
00:18:37 --> 00:18:38
Now, you can go back to their books.

512
00:18:38 --> 00:18:41
It is better to accept all the help you can get. I saw what this animal can do.

513
00:18:41 --> 00:18:44
If I could not be killed to pursue it, what would be the point?

514
00:18:44 --> 00:18:48
Get your alligator souvenirs here! Memories of alligator here!

515
00:18:48 --> 00:18:52
Memories of alligator here! And you, friend, why not bring one for the kids?

516
00:18:52 --> 00:18:55
Alligators here! Alligators here!

517
00:18:55 --> 00:18:59
Take your alligators! And you, man? I will not bite you.

518
00:18:59 --> 00:19:00
You will not catch one, friend?

519
00:19:00 --> 00:19:03
See them scream and swing. Take them to the house and have fun.

520
00:19:03 --> 00:19:05
It is an alligator! Take one, friend! Take one, friend!

521
00:19:05 --> 00:19:06
Hey, man, you want to see something?

522
00:19:06 --> 00:19:07
It&#39;s yours for 20.

523
00:19:07 --> 00:19:08
It&#39;s a great animal pet for children.

524
00:19:08 --> 00:19:10
Feed it with the remnants and throw a water upon it.

525
00:19:10 --> 00:19:11
It&#39;s cheap.

526
00:19:11 --> 00:19:13
- Ross. Daly. - Yes, what is it?

527
00:19:13 --> 00:19:15
- Hold this guy. - Because?

528
00:19:15 --> 00:19:18
By type of ownership endangered or whatever you want.

529
00:19:18 --> 00:19:21
This is an attack on free trade system. Communist!

530
00:19:21 --> 00:19:23
- We&#39;re live? - I think so.

531
00:19:23 --> 00:19:26
Great. You are very beautiful, but we&#39;re here to talk about alligators.

532
00:19:26 --> 00:19:29
Look, alligators respond to sound.

533
00:19:29 --> 00:19:32
They talk to each other, call each other.

534
00:19:32 --> 00:19:32
Listen.

535
00:19:32 --> 00:19:33
What is it?

536
00:19:33 --> 00:19:36
This is called the help of a young alligator to his mother.

537
00:19:36 --> 00:19:37
They have a called love?

538
00:19:37 --> 00:19:40
The alligator is a very romantic creature.

539
00:19:40 --> 00:19:44
They are in heat in spring and produce a sound like this.

540
00:19:44 --> 00:19:46
And it attracts another alligator?

541
00:19:46 --> 00:19:48
Well, I hope so. I&#39;m counting on it.

542
00:19:48 --> 00:19:49
I work, you know?

543
00:19:49 --> 00:19:54
- I still have some experiences to do. - My dear girl, it is still loose.

544
00:19:54 --> 00:19:58
They will find it. And your great white hunter shoot him. And it will be their end.

545
00:19:58 --> 00:20:00
And you&#39;re not even curious how was that size?

546
00:20:00 --> 00:20:01
I&#39;ll be there for the autopsy.

547
00:20:01 --> 00:20:03
Look, I&#39;m still trying to piece together a few things.

548
00:20:03 --> 00:20:05
You&#39;re the only one I know who can tell me where the beast was.

549
00:20:05 --> 00:20:09
If it works, I&#39;ll buy you an iguana or something else that is beautiful.

550
00:20:09 --> 00:20:10
That would be great.

551
00:20:10 --> 00:20:12
It is a part of the lhasa apsu pituitary.

552
00:20:12 --> 00:20:16
The dark blue cells indicate that it was bombarded with some kind of hormone.

553
00:20:16 --> 00:20:16
What would cause this?

554
00:20:16 --> 00:20:18
Well, in some cases, become small in large dogs.

555
00:20:18 --> 00:20:21
I&#39;d bet on somatropin, but they have played test animals ...

556
00:20:21 --> 00:20:24
the sewer for years. You can not say under what combination our friend was exposed.

557
00:20:24 --> 00:20:25
Perhaps he dies of cancer.

558
00:20:25 --> 00:20:28
Jesus! He&#39;s a big guy.

559
00:20:28 --> 00:20:31
- What is it? - Excrement alligator. Do not step on.

560
00:20:31 --> 00:20:33
The last appearance was at Marquette Hill section of the city ...

561
00:20:33 --> 00:20:35
where it is believed that the animal is let loose.

562
00:20:35 --> 00:20:37
Residents were warned to stay off the streets.

563
00:20:37 --> 00:20:40
And they were asked to advise any appearance of alligator immediately.

564
00:20:40 --> 00:20:43
- And you work with progesterone as well? - Of course. We tested everything.

565
00:20:43 --> 00:20:45
- What kind of cow is that? - It&#39;s milk.

566
00:20:45 --> 00:20:46
She&#39;s great for dairy.

567
00:20:46 --> 00:20:49
The world has a problem of food shortages. We are trying to solve it.

568
00:20:49 --> 00:20:52
Yes. I know that you develop a synthetic form of testosterone.

569
00:20:52 --> 00:20:54
- Yes. We had success with it. - Why not marketed?

570
00:20:54 --> 00:20:58
Several contraindications. One of them, hyper-excited metabolic rate.

571
00:20:58 --> 00:20:59
What is this common language?

572
00:20:59 --> 00:21:01
This gave them an insatiable appetite.

573
00:21:01 --> 00:21:04
Look, detective, I have work to do. You have more questions?

574
00:21:04 --> 00:21:08
Yes. As the Pharmaceutical Slade paid for a lhasa apsu stolen?

575
00:21:08 --> 00:21:10
Mayor? Here is the Slade.

576
00:21:10 --> 00:21:13
We have a problem here in the lab you could help.

577
00:21:13 --> 00:21:15
Boss? Boss.

578
00:21:15 --> 00:21:17
- I have information about the alligator. - David ...

579
00:21:17 --> 00:21:22
A guy Slade, the friend of our dear mayor&#39;s into it.

580
00:21:22 --> 00:21:25
I need your badge, David. You&#39;re out of the corporation.

581
00:21:25 --> 00:21:28
- What you mean? - You went too far.

582
00:21:28 --> 00:21:30
I do not expect me to work for that guy, right?

583
00:21:30 --> 00:21:31
It&#39;s out of my hands.

584
00:21:31 --> 00:21:31
Homicides?

585
00:21:31 --> 00:21:31
No longer.

586
00:21:31 --> 00:21:32
EVIDENCE ROOM

587
00:21:32 --> 00:21:35
I was fired. It seems that we step on someone&#39;s toes.

588
00:21:35 --> 00:21:36
They can do this?

589
00:21:36 --> 00:21:38
Of course they can. It&#39;s their city. They can do whatever they want.

590
00:21:38 --> 00:21:38
How it feels?

591
00:21:38 --> 00:21:40
Always I worried that they would even say goodbye.

592
00:21:40 --> 00:21:42
Now that happened, I feel wonderful.

593
00:21:42 --> 00:21:42
What will you do?

594
00:21:42 --> 00:21:47
I&#39;ll go out and find that alligator and ... I&#39;ll kick his ass.

595
00:21:47 --> 00:21:48
When do we start?

596
00:21:48 --> 00:21:49
Have you had a boyfriend?

597
00:21:49 --> 00:21:52
I Had Stuart, who was president of the science club.

598
00:21:52 --> 00:21:53
When was that?

599
00:21:53 --> 00:21:59
In ninth grade. And I had Chester, who liked reptiles like me.

600
00:21:59 --> 00:22:01
- It seems cozy. - It was cool.

601
00:22:01 --> 00:22:03
Until he began to dissect their pets.

602
00:22:03 --> 00:22:07
- Here we are. This place ... - I know.

603
00:22:07 --> 00:22:10
I know this place better than anyone in the department.

604
00:22:10 --> 00:22:13
Here we split up and look.

605
00:22:13 --> 00:22:16
- What the hell are we looking for? - Something that does not seem to be here.

606
00:22:16 --> 00:22:18
I&#39;ll look for an alligator nest.

607
00:22:18 --> 00:22:21
- I would have shoes, bags, bags ... - Okay.

608
00:22:21 --> 00:22:22
It has a shopping cart up here.

609
00:22:22 --> 00:22:25
- Are you alright? - Yes I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s just a dog.

610
00:22:25 --> 00:22:25
Jesus!

611
00:22:25 --> 00:22:30
There should be other hidden animals here. It must be his house.

612
00:22:30 --> 00:22:31
Do you think he can try to come back here?

613
00:22:31 --> 00:22:33
If he tries to return to the system, I think so.

614
00:22:33 --> 00:22:36
Enough for me. I&#39;ll take my vacation when this is over.

615
00:22:36 --> 00:22:39
At least in Florida, they keep in the marshes, which is their place.

616
00:22:39 --> 00:22:41
Mr. Slade, have to go to the town hall for a reward.

617
00:22:41 --> 00:22:45
Let&#39;s stop stalling. I give money. I give money. Listen.

618
00:22:45 --> 00:22:48
The wedding is tomorrow. I want you to take the silver and the tables ...

619
00:22:48 --> 00:22:49
and the place where they should be after.

620
00:22:49 --> 00:22:51
- It is very generous of you, Mr. Slade. - Mayor, listen.

621
00:22:51 --> 00:22:53
We have four products.

622
00:22:53 --> 00:22:56
Four outstanding products with the Commission Food and Drug Administration.

623
00:22:56 --> 00:22:59
Four products. And so are many products.

624
00:22:59 --> 00:23:01
Oh, I understand. And if them crawl to the Company ...

625
00:23:01 --> 00:23:05
If crawl to us ... you&#39;re out of work to begin with.

626
00:23:05 --> 00:23:05
Arthur.

627
00:23:05 --> 00:23:09
Mayor, this is my future son in law, Arthur Helms.

628
00:23:09 --> 00:23:10
- How are you? - Nice to meet you.

629
00:23:10 --> 00:23:16
Arthur is my boy number 1. My boy number 1. Yes.

630
00:23:16 --> 00:23:16
Dinner time.

631
00:23:16 --> 00:23:18
- Where do I put this coat? - Right there.

632
00:23:18 --> 00:23:19
This is the Snaps.

633
00:23:19 --> 00:23:20
- How are you? - This is Marisa.

634
00:23:20 --> 00:23:22
- All right, kid, you hungry? - Can I use your phone.

635
00:23:22 --> 00:23:23
- Yeah, right here. - Thank you.

636
00:23:23 --> 00:23:24
What do you think, kid? Are you hungry?

637
00:23:24 --> 00:23:25
A bit of ground beef?

638
00:23:25 --> 00:23:26
- Hello? - Hello, Mom?

639
00:23:26 --> 00:23:27
I&#39;ll be late today.

640
00:23:27 --> 00:23:27
Here it is.

641
00:23:27 --> 00:23:28
Tomorrow you have school. And your homework?

642
00:23:28 --> 00:23:29
Mom, I&#39;m the teacher.

643
00:23:29 --> 00:23:34
I made a meatloaf for you. It&#39;s great. I spent his white shirt.

644
00:23:34 --> 00:23:39
But I found that purple skirt suits her.

645
00:23:39 --> 00:23:40
This is my mother.

646
00:23:40 --> 00:23:43
If you had come home yesterday, I would have eaten a great dinner.

647
00:23:43 --> 00:23:48
Sure, her cowboy, let&#39;s make you walk the plank.

648
00:23:48 --> 00:23:51
Yeah, you coward, we will steal all your gold.

649
00:23:51 --> 00:23:55
We will make you walk the plank.

650
00:23:55 --> 00:23:58
- You do not have courage. - Yes, I have.

651
00:23:58 --> 00:23:59
Come up here. Right now.

652
00:23:59 --> 00:24:01
- Right now. - Walk the plank.

653
00:24:01 --> 00:24:04
Donald? Donald?

654
00:24:04 --> 00:24:08
Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother!

655
00:24:08 --> 00:24:09
Mother, is the Donald!

656
00:24:09 --> 00:24:10
- Do you feel better? - Much.

657
00:24:10 --> 00:24:13
When I met you, I thought it was one of those straights.

658
00:24:13 --> 00:24:15
I thought? Well, you were wrong, is not it?

659
00:24:15 --> 00:24:18
When I met you, I thought I would have an apartment as well.

660
00:24:18 --> 00:24:21
Well, you were right. One of these days, I&#39;ll get rid of it.

661
00:24:21 --> 00:24:25
However, Marisa, look.

662
00:24:25 --> 00:24:27
- Let&#39;s have dinner now, right? - Right.

663
00:24:27 --> 00:24:31
And all the time I&#39;ll be thinking about whether to spend the night with me.

664
00:24:31 --> 00:24:34
This is not exactly an answer.

665
00:24:34 --> 00:24:39
If I eat and wonder whether yes or no, this can over-excite my metabolic rate.

666
00:24:39 --> 00:24:42
- Can I take that as a yes? - Yes.

667
00:24:42 --> 00:24:47
You know the neighborhood. Every expedition needs boots, native.

668
00:24:47 --> 00:24:51
- What do we gain? - 10 dollars. Per day. For each one.

669
00:24:51 --> 00:24:52
Nice!

670
00:24:52 --> 00:24:57
- I won 20. - A local dealer.

671
00:24:57 --> 00:25:00
I saw the guest book, checking the license plate numbers.

672
00:25:00 --> 00:25:04
This guy comes up behind me, shoves something in my neck and says that will blow my brains out.

673
00:25:04 --> 00:25:06
He took my gun and gave it to someone who was hiding.

674
00:25:06 --> 00:25:08
It made me lie down on the table, face down.

675
00:25:08 --> 00:25:10
I heard screams and shots up there.

676
00:25:10 --> 00:25:13
The guy behind me ran and I could not move. It seemed to have no legs.

677
00:25:13 --> 00:25:17
When I turned around, Jerry was coming down the stairs. I was dying.

678
00:25:17 --> 00:25:18
He had a gun pointed at you.

679
00:25:18 --> 00:25:20
He had a roll of coins he had taken from the cash register.

680
00:25:20 --> 00:25:22
The only weapon they had was mine. The one shot at Jerry.

681
00:25:22 --> 00:25:23
How could I know?

682
00:25:23 --> 00:25:28
I froze. It has a high penalty in this life to fear.

683
00:25:28 --> 00:25:30
You can not blame yourself for survival.

684
00:25:30 --> 00:25:30
What are you doing?

685
00:25:30 --> 00:25:32
Look, girl. I&#39;m fighting against baldness.

686
00:25:32 --> 00:25:35
I&#39;m kind sensitive to it. I hope not mention again.

687
00:25:35 --> 00:25:35
It is.

688
00:25:35 --> 00:25:39
Call Alley Scary. They say they hear deep breathing.

689
00:25:39 --> 00:25:41
- Where does? - Up to the railway line.

690
00:25:41 --> 00:25:42
Give me my rifle.

691
00:25:42 --> 00:25:45
- We better go look. - Who are we&quot;?

692
00:25:45 --> 00:25:47
The chargers follow the hunter to the lair.

693
00:25:47 --> 00:25:50
- They help. - Really?

694
00:25:50 --> 00:25:53
- Not in this jungle, sir. - Te see the other side.

695
00:25:53 --> 00:25:56
No courage? It must be the environment.

696
00:25:56 --> 00:25:56
Hey dude!

697
00:25:56 --> 00:26:00
What the fuck! Wait for me here, man.

698
00:26:00 --> 00:26:00
Let&#39;s get out.

699
00:26:00 --> 00:26:04
I studied history and psychology. When finished, it is decided police.

700
00:26:04 --> 00:26:07
That&#39;s what I always wanted to be, and I became a cop. Thank you.

701
00:26:07 --> 00:26:09
- You know what Freud talks about it? - What does he say?

702
00:26:09 --> 00:26:13
He says the police want to punish the company for their own illicit desires.

703
00:26:13 --> 00:26:15
This guy never made the turn kamikaze in East St. Louis.

704
00:26:15 --> 00:26:16
No. Probably not.

705
00:26:16 --> 00:26:19
- Speaking of illicit desires ... - Hi, Madison.

706
00:26:19 --> 00:26:23
Hey, Purdy, Ashe. How are you? I thought it would be in the jungle with Jungle Jim.

707
00:26:23 --> 00:26:25
They just find it in Marquette Hill.

708
00:26:25 --> 00:26:26
- What? - Brock?

709
00:26:26 --> 00:26:30
Not much left of it. We are working bent to find that animal.

710
00:26:30 --> 00:26:33
- I&#39;m sorry for his resignation. - Yes.

711
00:26:33 --> 00:26:36
- Jesus! - It&#39;s his fault.

712
00:26:36 --> 00:26:38
I understand how it should feel.

713
00:26:38 --> 00:26:41
Do not get me so fast, okay?

714
00:26:41 --> 00:26:41
Do not.

715
00:26:41 --> 00:26:41
On here.

716
00:26:41 --> 00:26:44
- Your mother is waiting. - Yes.

717
00:26:44 --> 00:26:45
Kelly!

718
00:26:45 --> 00:26:47
Kelly!

719
00:26:47 --> 00:26:48
No!

720
00:26:48 --> 00:26:49
No!

721
00:26:49 --> 00:26:50
Kelly!

722
00:26:50 --> 00:26:50
Kelly!

723
00:26:50 --> 00:26:53
It will come in a minute. She hates getting out of bed in the morning.

724
00:26:53 --> 00:26:58
I used to go up there. She slept so quietly that did not want to wake her.

725
00:26:58 --> 00:27:01
She was so angry at me because I did not want to go to school.

726
00:27:01 --> 00:27:05
I baked some cookies, watched novel to my husband, Bill, came home.

727
00:27:05 --> 00:27:10
And then we ... I&#39;ve been looking for this rosary. Here it is.

728
00:27:10 --> 00:27:11
Rest in peace.

729
00:27:11 --> 00:27:15
You know what he told me? &quot;Domir too takes you earlier to the grave.&quot;

730
00:27:15 --> 00:27:19
It worked the opposite with him. Rest in peace.

731
00:27:19 --> 00:27:20
You know I have a bad eye?

732
00:27:20 --> 00:27:22
I bet you can not tell what it is.

733
00:27:22 --> 00:27:25
It is this here? Or is this one?

734
00:27:25 --> 00:27:26
Did you like this?

735
00:27:26 --> 00:27:28
- What is your name? - Madeline.

736
00:27:28 --> 00:27:30
- Can I get you coffee? - No, I got it.

737
00:27:30 --> 00:27:31
You know feel at home, right?

738
00:27:31 --> 00:27:33
- Good morning David. - Hi daughter.

739
00:27:33 --> 00:27:34
- Hi Hi.

740
00:27:34 --> 00:27:37
- I came to apologize. - Whereby?

741
00:27:37 --> 00:27:38
You choose and I apologize for it.

742
00:27:38 --> 00:27:40
Do not forget that you have class tomorrow, Marisa.

743
00:27:40 --> 00:27:42
Want to see my collection of stones?

744
00:27:42 --> 00:27:43
Well, why do you need me?

745
00:27:43 --> 00:27:46
Why would anyone need someone? You&#39;re the biggest herpetóloga the country,

746
00:27:46 --> 00:27:49
you have a wonderful mind, it doctorate and beautiful breasts.

747
00:27:49 --> 00:27:51
I find it all very confusing.

748
00:27:51 --> 00:27:53
There&#39;s nothing to be confused. I know I&#39;m a boring sometimes.

749
00:27:53 --> 00:27:55
But everything worth having cause problems.

750
00:27:55 --> 00:27:56
Unless you want to live with the turtles.

751
00:27:56 --> 00:27:57
Will you come with me?

752
00:27:57 --> 00:27:59
- We&#39;ll see. - We&#39;ll see.

753
00:27:59 --> 00:28:01
The signs indicate that it is moving to the east.

754
00:28:01 --> 00:28:03
If you continue in this direction, it will reach the channel.

755
00:28:03 --> 00:28:05
If we wait at the end, right will come to us.

756
00:28:05 --> 00:28:06
And then what happens?

757
00:28:06 --> 00:28:09
Can I bring my mother. He can talk to him to kill him.

758
00:28:09 --> 00:28:13
No, I do not want to talk to Madison. Things are crazy and the way they are.

759
00:28:13 --> 00:28:15
Look, just let me know when state troopers are ready.

760
00:28:15 --> 00:28:18
Damn it! He is not hiding in the bushes.

761
00:28:18 --> 00:28:21
We have a lock on the canal at one mile above the river.

762
00:28:21 --> 00:28:23
It is perhaps to two miles from where we are now.

763
00:28:23 --> 00:28:27
Right. But if it is closed, it will come out of the river.

764
00:28:27 --> 00:28:28
What will he do when you leave?

765
00:28:28 --> 00:28:29
I think it depends on what is in your path.

766
00:28:29 --> 00:28:33
Holy shit! Is it out of the port.

767
00:28:33 --> 00:28:33
Where did he go?

768
00:28:33 --> 00:28:33
There he is.

769
00:28:33 --> 00:28:34
Get me out!

770
00:28:34 --> 00:28:35
Let me out!

771
00:28:35 --> 00:28:37
My leg! Pull me up!

772
00:28:37 --> 00:28:41
- Where in the channel? - The half mile from the river.

773
00:28:41 --> 00:28:47
Okay. Call that is available to go to the Slade Mansion. We work there.

774
00:28:47 --> 00:28:47
Anything!

775
00:28:47 --> 00:28:50
- Listen, did you see where it went? - It went down to about 200 yards.

776
00:28:50 --> 00:28:51
- Which side? - That side.

777
00:28:51 --> 00:28:52
- Let&#39;s go! - Have you ever been here before?

778
00:28:52 --> 00:28:54
You bet. It is the way to Slade Mansion.

779
00:28:54 --> 00:28:57
When I was young, a long time ago, I am going back there ...

780
00:28:57 --> 00:29:00
- And I cut one of those walnut trees. - Nogueiras.

781
00:29:00 --> 00:29:04
Left dipped in water two to three weeks,

782
00:29:04 --> 00:29:08
- Then you get a piece of coal ... - Coal.

783
00:29:08 --> 00:29:15
Then you take the walnut tree and puts on, just a little not to burn.

784
00:29:15 --> 00:29:19
And the aroma begins to exhale. Wonderful.

785
00:29:19 --> 00:29:22
This trick is very clever.

786
00:29:22 --> 00:29:23
Let&#39;s go to the car.

787
00:29:23 --> 00:29:25
Let me in! Let&#39;s go! Let me in!

788
00:29:25 --> 00:29:26
Slade, open the door!

789
00:29:26 --> 00:29:28
For the love of God! Slade!

790
00:29:28 --> 00:29:29
Ben, get out!

791
00:29:29 --> 00:29:30
Skirt!

792
00:29:30 --> 00:29:31
Get out of here!

793
00:29:31 --> 00:29:34
- You have to let us in! - Can I see your invitations?

794
00:29:34 --> 00:29:36
The alligator&#39;s coming. You have to let us in!

795
00:29:36 --> 00:29:39
Alligator? I have a magician, an orchestra ...

796
00:29:39 --> 00:29:41
Open it! Fast!

797
00:29:41 --> 00:29:43
- I will call the police. - Great. Call.

798
00:29:43 --> 00:29:46
- Where is he? - David!

799
00:29:46 --> 00:29:49
Jesus Christ! Where is he? Where is he?

800
00:29:49 --> 00:29:49
flow tunnel.

801
00:29:49 --> 00:29:51
That&#39;s right. It goes back to the sewer.

802
00:29:51 --> 00:29:52
And we know exactly where to find it.

803
00:29:52 --> 00:29:57
David! Hey, David! I need your help! David!

804
00:29:57 --> 00:29:59
Right. I have two minutes in the sewer.

805
00:29:59 --> 00:30:01
Tell the Chief where I will go out to make sure the manhole is free.

806
00:30:01 --> 00:30:01
Understood.

807
00:30:01 --> 00:30:02
Let&#39;s go! Let&#39;s go!

808
00:30:02 --> 00:30:02
Damn it!

809
00:30:02 --> 00:30:02
Shit!

810
00:30:02 --> 00:30:03
Hey, open up!

811
00:30:03 --> 00:30:04
Hey! Hey!

812
00:30:04 --> 00:30:05
- Open it! - Move the car.

813
00:30:05 --> 00:30:06
Lady, you need to move your car.

814
00:30:06 --> 00:30:08
- But the garbage ... - So give the defendant. Move yourself!

815
00:30:08 --> 00:30:09
Move that truck now!

816
00:30:09 --> 00:30:11
Lady, you have to move your car. Is anyone down.

817
00:30:11 --> 00:30:13
- What you mean? - Hey, you moron!

818
00:30:13 --> 00:30:14
What did he say?

819
00:30:14 --> 00:30:17
- Did you survive. He survived. - Any sign of him?

820
00:30:17 --> 00:30:20
- Only pieces. - Do you believe me now? Dreamless?

821
00:30:20 --> 00:30:21
When I doubted you?

822
00:30:21 --> 00:30:23
I think I&#39;ll join you with her mother. What do you think?

823
00:30:23 --> 00:30:24
Her mother?

824
00:30:24 --> 00:30:26
- Do you think your mother would like him? - Yes, she would.

825
00:30:26 --> 00:30:32
She likes the entries in the forehead. I think it&#39;s family.

826
00:30:32 --> 00:30:35
- We caught him. - We took it.

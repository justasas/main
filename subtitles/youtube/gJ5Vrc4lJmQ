2
00:00:00 --> 00:00:05
tonight on Nova the shocking story of a
girl who spent her childhood locked in

3
00:00:05 --> 00:00:05
the bedroom

4
00:00:05 --> 00:00:08
the girl reportedly was still wearing
diapers social worker discovered the

5
00:00:08 --> 00:00:09
case two weeks ago

6
00:00:09 --> 00:00:13
raised in isolation jeanne was a wild
child uncivilized barely able to walk or

7
00:00:13 --> 00:00:13
talk

8
00:00:13 --> 00:00:17
the indications are that she was beaten
for making eyes with footage never

9
00:00:17 --> 00:00:18
before seen on television

10
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
nova follows the controversial efforts
to unlock the secret of the wild child

11
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
yeah

12
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
what

13
00:00:27 --> 00:00:36
once in a great while civilized society
comes across a wild child a child has

14
00:00:36 --> 00:00:39
grown up in severe isolation with
virtually no human contact

15
00:00:39 --> 00:00:46
this is the story of such a case the
story begins in los angeles in November

16
00:00:46 --> 00:00:50
fourth 1970 specials in los angeles
suburb of Arcadia have taken custody of

17
00:00:50 --> 00:00:54
a 13 year old girl and they say was kept
in such isolation by her parents that

18
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
she never even learned to talk or
elderly parents have been charged with

19
00:00:57 --> 00:00:58
child abuse

20
00:00:58 --> 00:01:02
this is the scene of the crime the child
was locked in a room and tied to a party

21
00:01:02 --> 00:01:08
chair for most of her life completely
restrained she was forced to sit alone

22
00:01:08 --> 00:01:11
day after day and often through the
night

23
00:01:11 --> 00:01:15
she had little to look at and no one to
talk to for more than 10 years

24
00:01:15 --> 00:01:16
the girl reportedly was

25
00:01:16 --> 00:01:19
an infantile noises and still wearing
diapers when a social worker discovered

26
00:01:19 --> 00:01:22
the case two weeks ago the authorities
are hoping she still may have a normal

27
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
learning capacity here was a 13 year old
who seemed like an infant girl who would

28
00:01:27 --> 00:01:30
be known as Jeanne

29
00:01:30 --> 00:01:34
jeanne was taken to Children&#39;s Hospital
in Los Angeles where she immediately won

30
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
the hearts of doctors and scientists

31
00:01:36 --> 00:01:42
she was fragile and beautiful haunting
and so I was pulled that was very drawn

32
00:01:42 --> 00:01:45
to her even though I was nervous and
have no idea

33
00:01:45 --> 00:01:48
in many respects went to expense

34
00:01:48 --> 00:01:52
jeanne was about to test an idea
important to science and society at a

35
00:01:52 --> 00:01:56
nurturing environment could make up for
even the most nightmarish at past

36
00:01:56 --> 00:02:03
yeah

37
00:02:03 --> 00:02:08
if you make up offense in your head or
write it down and have a 10-12 words in

38
00:02:08 --> 00:02:08
it

39
00:02:08 --> 00:02:12
chances are you can listen for the rest
of your life for someone else to say the

40
00:02:12 --> 00:02:12
sentence

41
00:02:12 --> 00:02:15
you can go to the live here at UCLA
Susan Curtis teaches students about a

42
00:02:15 --> 00:02:19
crucial human trait the ability to learn
mine in the library and chances are you

43
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
will never come across that sentence

44
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
what I want to know the students begin
their study through a famous case

45
00:02:24 --> 00:02:29
k thing its gene this is not this
person&#39;s real name but when we think

46
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
about what a genie is the genie of the
creature that comes out of a bottle or

47
00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
whatever but emerges into human society
past childhood when we assume that it

48
00:02:37 --> 00:02:39
really that the creature that had a
human childhood

49
00:02:39 --> 00:02:43
Susan Curtis has a special connection
with the story she&#39;s telling 20 years

50
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
ago she was asked to join a team working
to rehabilitate genie

51
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
I was literally at the right place at
the right time I was a new graduate

52
00:02:49 --> 00:02:53
student interested in language
acquisition unencumbered by family ties

53
00:02:53 --> 00:02:59
the responsibilities and they asked me
if I would be interested when Curtis

54
00:02:59 --> 00:03:03
first joined the case G had a strange
bunny walk and other almost inhuman

55
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
characteristics

56
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
Jeannie constantly spat she sniffed and
Claude

57
00:03:08 --> 00:03:14
she barely spoke or made any noises the
indications are that she was beaten for

58
00:03:14 --> 00:03:18
making noise and consequently had
learned basically not to vocalize and

59
00:03:18 --> 00:03:20
she really didn&#39;t vocalize very much at
all

60
00:03:20 --> 00:03:24
when I first met her she was silent most
of the time

61
00:03:24 --> 00:03:29
Jeannie also receive daily visits at
Children&#39;s Hospital from James kept her

62
00:03:29 --> 00:03:33
psychologist can&#39;t recalls first meeting
his new patient

63
00:03:33 --> 00:03:34
I was

64
00:03:34 --> 00:03:36
captivated by her

65
00:03:36 --> 00:03:38
I was not the last person to become
captivated by her

66
00:03:38 --> 00:03:38
yeah

67
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
the story as we began to to learn about
it was sort of one of the things of

68
00:03:42 --> 00:03:43
course would reach out and grab you
anyway

69
00:03:43 --> 00:03:50
but she had a personal quality that
seemed to elicit rescue fantasies and

70
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
this in a group of people who are
interested in taking care of kids and we

71
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
specialize in early childhood were going
to be

72
00:03:54 --> 00:03:59
- powered by rescue fantasies anyway she
reached up and grabbed lots of us one of

73
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
genies most captivating qualities was
the intense way she explored her new

74
00:04:02 --> 00:04:03
environment

75
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07
oddly even strangers who knew nothing
about her story seemed to censor need to

76
00:04:07 --> 00:04:07
do so

77
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
one particularly striking memory of
those early months was an absolutely

78
00:04:10 --> 00:04:14
wonderful man who was a butcher and he
never asked her name you never asked

79
00:04:14 --> 00:04:15
anything about her

80
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
they just connected and communicated
somehow and every time we came in and i

81
00:04:18 --> 00:04:19
know this was so with others as well

82
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
he would slide open the little window
and hand her something that wasn&#39;t

83
00:04:23 --> 00:04:27
wrapped a bone of some sort some meat
fish whatever and he would allow her to

84
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
do her thing with it and to do her thing
with her thing was basically was to

85
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
explore it tap delete to put it up
against her lips and feel it with your

86
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
lips and touch it almost as if she were
blind

87
00:04:35 --> 00:04:39
word of the wild child spread attracting
scientists from all around the country

88
00:04:39 --> 00:04:43
one of them was Oklahoma psychiatrist j
surely when introduced

89
00:04:43 --> 00:04:49
I extended my hand she reached out with
her fingers and delicately touched my

90
00:04:49 --> 00:04:54
hand and then in a sense that that was
it she had she had made my acquaintance

91
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
he was satisfied though

92
00:04:56 --> 00:05:00
first I&#39;ll about me but my reaction was
I had a thousand questions immediately

93
00:05:00 --> 00:05:04
who what how how does it come about
wises why do I see what I&#39;m seeing

94
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
shirley was an expert in social
isolation

95
00:05:07 --> 00:05:12
jeanne was the most extreme case you
ever seen a solitary confinement is

96
00:05:12 --> 00:05:19
diabolically the most severe punishment
and in my experience really quite

97
00:05:19 --> 00:05:25
dramatic symptoms developed in as little
as 15 minutes to an hour and certainly

98
00:05:25 --> 00:05:30
inside of two or three days and try to
expand this to 10 years boggles one&#39;s

99
00:05:30 --> 00:05:30
mind

100
00:05:30 --> 00:05:34
surely wanted to assess how well Jeannie
had survived her long years of isolation

101
00:05:34 --> 00:05:38
he directed the team to gather
information on her brain waves for four

102
00:05:38 --> 00:05:41
nights running a wire Jeanne two
instruments that measure the electrical

103
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
activity in her brain while she slept

104
00:05:43 --> 00:05:51
what they found was an unusually high
number of so-called sleep spindles the

105
00:05:51 --> 00:05:54
dense punching patterns that look like
spindles on a spinning machine

106
00:05:54 --> 00:06:00
this was an abnormal brain wave pattern
the sleep studies raised the question of

107
00:06:00 --> 00:06:04
the puzzle the genie team for years was
Jeanne brain damage from her years of

108
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
abuse or had she been retarded from
birth

109
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
when Gina was a baby her father
apparently decided she was retarded

110
00:06:10 --> 00:06:13
he insisted on keeping her isolated
because of that

111
00:06:13 --> 00:06:16
authorities piece together these few
facts in the early weeks

112
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
Jean strange family circumstances made
it hard to learn more

113
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
Jenny&#39;s mother we can nearly blind claim
to cheat tool with a victim of a

114
00:06:22 --> 00:06:27
domineering husband genies father
shortly after authorities discovered

115
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
Jeannie shot and killed himself

116
00:06:29 --> 00:06:34
the suicide only added to the interest
in genies case she was surprised patient

117
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
and in the months to come the number of
visiting scientists increased

118
00:06:37 --> 00:06:41
genies new celebrity status marked the
beginning of a debate that would

119
00:06:41 --> 00:06:42
intensify over time

120
00:06:42 --> 00:06:45
how should her case be handled

121
00:06:45 --> 00:06:48
james cancer plan was the first to be
adopted

122
00:06:48 --> 00:06:50
he believed Jeannie could get better if
she were allowed to form relationships

123
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
and he was encouraged when she started
to do so

124
00:06:53 --> 00:06:58
up until one particular day did you
didn&#39;t seem to respond in any any

125
00:06:58 --> 00:06:59
special way to my coming or going

126
00:06:59 --> 00:07:04
at the end of our session then one day
when I left her expression changed from

127
00:07:04 --> 00:07:10
happy to say that indicate that there
was some some sadness in a separation

128
00:07:10 --> 00:07:10
for her

129
00:07:10 --> 00:07:13
it was the first indication that i had
they were beginning to form a

130
00:07:13 --> 00:07:14
relationship

131
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
I thought it long she had the capacity
to form attachments she had the capacity

132
00:07:17 --> 00:07:22
to learn to the capacity to get better
by the end of May something that

133
00:07:22 --> 00:07:25
happened to add to the hopes for
jeannie&#39;s future was a breakthrough that

134
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
everyone had waited for you

135
00:07:27 --> 00:07:30
it was captured on videotape by jean
Butler

136
00:07:30 --> 00:07:34
Jeanie&#39;s special education teacher here
in the classroom children&#39;s hospital but

137
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
towards teaching genie to tie her own
shoes

138
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
but there is about to tell jeannie you
do it and we can tell dr. Kent what you

139
00:07:39 --> 00:07:39
can do

140
00:07:39 --> 00:07:42
listen two genes reaction

141
00:07:42 --> 00:07:42
yeah

142
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
then

143
00:07:44 --> 00:07:48
Jeannie said the word doctor

144
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
it was one of more than a hundred words
in you buy that spring

145
00:07:51 --> 00:07:54
listen to another

146
00:07:54 --> 00:07:57
she was difficult to understand but
Genie was repeating words

147
00:07:57 --> 00:08:02
jeanne was beginning to talk I could
tell as all of his could just looking at

148
00:08:02 --> 00:08:07
her that there was a lot to Jeanne and
that what we had to do was to make sure

149
00:08:07 --> 00:08:11
we get for opportunities to express find
a way to take what was latent and

150
00:08:11 --> 00:08:15
express it or somehow then you know
acquire it because the potential just

151
00:08:15 --> 00:08:21
seemed so great for the first time in
her life

152
00:08:21 --> 00:08:25
Jeannie seem to be thriving for mental
and physical growth since coming to

153
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
Children&#39;s Hospital was obvious

154
00:08:27 --> 00:08:32
genies progress gave birth to a daring
hope she might fully recover

155
00:08:32 --> 00:08:37
and science might learn how her doctors
even publicly predicted success their

156
00:08:37 --> 00:08:40
confidence was an eerie echo of a moment
from the past

157
00:08:40 --> 00:08:44
an echo of another case like genies that
preceded hers by nearly 200 years

158
00:08:44 --> 00:08:50
the case began in 1800 when citizens of
this region in southern France

159
00:08:50 --> 00:08:53
discovered a remarkable creature who had
crept out of the nearby forest

160
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
he was animal behavior human form

161
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
mute and naked he was a wild child

162
00:08:59 --> 00:09:02
he would be known as Victor and this
statue would be erected to market entry

163
00:09:02 --> 00:09:06
into civilization citizens in the
village where Victor was discovered

164
00:09:06 --> 00:09:11
guessed he was 12 years old his food
preferences his lack of speech and the

165
00:09:11 --> 00:09:14
scars on his body indicated he had been
in the wild for most of his life

166
00:09:14 --> 00:09:21
Victor story intrigued historian and
psychologists Harlan lane around the

167
00:09:21 --> 00:09:24
time doctors in Los Angeles were
following genies case lanes and friends

168
00:09:24 --> 00:09:28
tracking Victor story shortly after the
boy was captured a biology professor

169
00:09:28 --> 00:09:33
took a very careful look at him a bonnet
air horn tells the story of a tremendous

170
00:09:33 --> 00:09:37
indifference to cold that Victor had one
day he took him and took off all his

171
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
clothes and the boy was thrilled to have
his clothes taken off and he started

172
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
leading him into the outdoors and it was
surrounded by snow at that time and

173
00:09:43 --> 00:09:46
Victor far from protesting was filled
with joy he gave out cries of joy and

174
00:09:46 --> 00:09:50
pulled gonna tear out the doors and
wanted to get out into the snow

175
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
another occasion he was actually out in
the snow Barenaked leaping about

176
00:09:53 --> 00:09:57
throwing the snow in the air eating snow
gonna tear concludes and I think we have

177
00:09:57 --> 00:10:01
to conclude that our sensitivity to
temperature is very much influenced by

178
00:10:01 --> 00:10:02
our life experiences

179
00:10:02 --> 00:10:06
word of the wild child travel north
Paris for the first anthropological

180
00:10:06 --> 00:10:11
society had just formed it was the end
of the age of enlightenment a time of

181
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
enormous discovery and debate

182
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
Victor walk into the middle of a raging
debate as timing was incredible

183
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
the question was what makes us human

184
00:10:19 --> 00:10:20
what separates man

185
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
from the beasts visit human appearance

186
00:10:23 --> 00:10:27
well anthropological expeditions were
returning with a wide variety of races

187
00:10:27 --> 00:10:32
and regions were not so clear on human
appearance is it

188
00:10:32 --> 00:10:38
walking upright but orangutans walk
upright is it language first reports

189
00:10:38 --> 00:10:43
were that Victor had no language then
again perhaps you could learn sum in any

190
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
case philosophers and animus and their
ilk were convinced that careful study of

191
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
Victor could finally answer the question
what is it that makes us human

192
00:10:49 --> 00:10:54
with Victor Parisians had a chance to
see human nature stripped of society and

193
00:10:54 --> 00:10:54
culture

194
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
this was a situation no one would set
out to create on purpose

195
00:10:57 --> 00:11:04
it was there were referred to as the
forbidden experiment scientists and

196
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
Paris quickly summon Victor from the
south of France all the victory could

197
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
hear they brought him to this school

198
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
the national institute for the deaf okay
we&#39;re at the National Institute for the

199
00:11:12 --> 00:11:13
Deaf and it happened right here

200
00:11:13 --> 00:11:16
the gardener from road as brings the
wild one right through here into the

201
00:11:16 --> 00:11:21
courtyard and I guess they were expected
and the director the ibc cow comes out

202
00:11:21 --> 00:11:28
and run they would be about here he Cal
comes out and what does he see not a

203
00:11:28 --> 00:11:33
nice little bourgeois deaf kid in the
school uniform is new pupil but a raging

204
00:11:33 --> 00:11:39
spitting snarling filthy Savage
defecating where he is urinating areas

205
00:11:39 --> 00:11:44
biting covered with scars long hair
wanted yellow teeth long fingernails a

206
00:11:44 --> 00:11:47
savage she could never seen anything
like that in his life so he backs off

207
00:11:47 --> 00:11:49
what you gonna do idea

208
00:11:49 --> 00:11:52
he&#39;s just hired a young physician from
the Military Hospital up the street

209
00:11:52 --> 00:11:56
followed by the name of Janaki tab so he
called it down it down

210
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
jean-marc guitar was a 26 year old
medical student who was ready to make

211
00:11:59 --> 00:11:59
his mark

212
00:11:59 --> 00:12:03
he saw the wild boy as an opportunity
retard was an interesting man wasn&#39;t he

213
00:12:03 --> 00:12:06
how&#39;s he going to make a name for
himself a place for himself in medicine

214
00:12:06 --> 00:12:09
and in the intellectual excitement of
the time because he was a brilliant

215
00:12:09 --> 00:12:12
fellow and he read philosophy a stupidly
studied medicine

216
00:12:12 --> 00:12:16
well the answer was that here was a
chance that would make a break him if he

217
00:12:16 --> 00:12:19
could actually civilized a wild child
the first person in history to do so

218
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
why he would be a figure down through
history even in the 20th century people

219
00:12:23 --> 00:12:24
might be discussing him

220
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
it&#39;s hard ambitions would pay off not
only would people in the 20th century

221
00:12:27 --> 00:12:31
still be discussing him but the famous
french director Francois Truffaut would

222
00:12:31 --> 00:12:36
play guitar in a movie about the case
that will be illustrates the risk guitar

223
00:12:36 --> 00:12:40
took more experienced doctors concluded
Victor was profoundly retarded from

224
00:12:40 --> 00:12:43
birth and unable to learn

225
00:12:43 --> 00:12:47
retardo believe that Victor had become
retarded because of his years of living

226
00:12:47 --> 00:12:48
in the wild

227
00:12:48 --> 00:12:56
he believed he could civilize victim
tardes diary was work with Victor makes

228
00:12:56 --> 00:12:59
this one of the most documented cases of
wild children throughout history

229
00:12:59 --> 00:13:03
in fact the diver served as the basis
for to pose movie called the wild child

230
00:13:03 --> 00:13:14
in Los Angeles proposed movie premiered
at the los Phoenix Theatre in Hollywood

231
00:13:14 --> 00:13:17
and

232
00:13:17 --> 00:13:21
one of the strangest chapters of the
story is the timing of the premiere for

233
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
Truffaut&#39;s movie about history&#39;s most
famous wild child

234
00:13:24 --> 00:13:29
open exactly one week after jeanne was
discovered in true Hollywood fashion

235
00:13:29 --> 00:13:32
the genie team took advantage of this
coincidence they arrange their own

236
00:13:32 --> 00:13:40
private screening in charge of this
event was hospital chief of Psychiatry

237
00:13:40 --> 00:13:41
Howard handsome

238
00:13:41 --> 00:13:46
well that afternoon at four-thirty we
left Children&#39;s Hospital and we we

239
00:13:46 --> 00:13:48
paraded up the street

240
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
we had an entourage of the street to the
last felis theater

241
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
it was all inspiring to us because here
was the first case that had been

242
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
documented in any scientific way

243
00:13:57 --> 00:14:02
and here we were having an opportunity
to see a film or trail of that here was

244
00:14:02 --> 00:14:05
history stamp of approval for daring to
rehabilitate a wild child

245
00:14:05 --> 00:14:08
guitar inspired everyone at the screen

246
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
yeah

247
00:14:11 --> 00:14:17
afterwards

248
00:14:17 --> 00:14:21
everybody was shocked and stunned they
just sat in silence for a bit because

249
00:14:21 --> 00:14:28
the film was so powerful in itself and
then the analogy with Jeannie began to

250
00:14:28 --> 00:14:30
hit it was like here

251
00:14:30 --> 00:14:34
history was repeating itself and
everybody there thought here is an

252
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
opportunity to learn something

253
00:14:36 --> 00:14:40
the screening was part of a special
conference for which the genie team

254
00:14:40 --> 00:14:44
invited consultants from all over the
country the government agency the

255
00:14:44 --> 00:14:47
National Institute of Mental Health had
agreed to fund a scientific project on

256
00:14:47 --> 00:14:47
gene

257
00:14:47 --> 00:14:51
now it was time to focus the direction
of research it soon became clear though

258
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
that participants were unlikely to agree
on one course of action

259
00:14:54 --> 00:14:58
oh we were off in a million direction I
mean each expert each person in their

260
00:14:58 --> 00:14:59
own discipline thought all

261
00:14:59 --> 00:15:04
wow I can do this I can do this I can do
that we were flooded flooded with our

262
00:15:04 --> 00:15:08
own associations and with the pursuits
that each of us might have thought wow

263
00:15:08 --> 00:15:09
look what we can do

264
00:15:09 --> 00:15:16
look what we might learn from this a
girl who has appeared out of nowhere to

265
00:15:16 --> 00:15:18
bring all the proposed plans for Jeanne
into focus

266
00:15:18 --> 00:15:21
there was another player on the team
David regular a psychologist at

267
00:15:21 --> 00:15:25
Children&#39;s Hospital regular to was
hooked on Jimmy&#39;s case maybe everybody

268
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
came in contact with her was attracted
to her she had a quality somehow

269
00:15:28 --> 00:15:31
connecting with people which develop
more and more book was present really

270
00:15:31 --> 00:15:35
from the start on she had a way of
reaching out without saying anything but

271
00:15:35 --> 00:15:38
just somehow by the kind of look in her
eyes and people wanted to do things for

272
00:15:38 --> 00:15:38
her

273
00:15:38 --> 00:15:44
regular decided how to focus the
research around the time jeans first

274
00:15:44 --> 00:15:45
birthday at Children&#39;s Hospital

275
00:15:45 --> 00:15:49
Junior is now 14 years old the timing
was fitting because regular wanted to

276
00:15:49 --> 00:15:49
know

277
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
could the clock be turned back for
Jeanne in particular

278
00:15:52 --> 00:15:56
could a teenager still learn to talk
this has already been the subject of

279
00:15:56 --> 00:16:01
much debate but the time jeanne was
discovered it all began with noam

280
00:16:01 --> 00:16:04
chomsky a young linguist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology

281
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
Chomsky declare that we acquire language

282
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
not just because we are taught it but
because we are born with the principles

283
00:16:10 --> 00:16:15
of language there in our genes we have
language Chomsky said because of nature

284
00:16:15 --> 00:16:20
not just nurture then along came a
neuropsychologist to add his own twist

285
00:16:20 --> 00:16:20
to the theory

286
00:16:20 --> 00:16:23
Eric Klinenberg agreed were born with
the principles of language but claimed

287
00:16:23 --> 00:16:27
there is a deadline for applying them if
a first language is an acquired by

288
00:16:27 --> 00:16:29
puberty he said it may be too late

289
00:16:29 --> 00:16:34
John scale in eburg rock the field they
were hot

290
00:16:34 --> 00:16:40
linguistics was in it was a perfect time
to test the new ideas recalls linguist

291
00:16:40 --> 00:16:44
Alyssa newport what Leonard proposed is
what&#39;s called the critical . hypothesis

292
00:16:44 --> 00:16:48
and what he suggested is that there&#39;s a
particular period in the life of humans

293
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
when they&#39;re right for learning
languages

294
00:16:50 --> 00:16:55
what this hypothesis was looking for was
some more direct evidence but of course

295
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
you don&#39;t do these experiments whenever
wishes to deprive somebody of language

296
00:16:58 --> 00:17:02
during the critical period to see what
happens it happened that at that time

297
00:17:02 --> 00:17:05
when that would have been the right
thing for Lana breaks hypothesis

298
00:17:05 --> 00:17:11
jeanne was discovered this is why Susan
Curtis join the genie team

299
00:17:11 --> 00:17:15
she was a graduate student in
linguistics she would put the critical .

300
00:17:15 --> 00:17:18
hypothesis to its first real test

301
00:17:18 --> 00:17:24
this is one of the first video tapes of
Curtis has worked with Jeannie Sharpe

302
00:17:24 --> 00:17:32
where she wanted it seemed to me almost
desperately to recode her world with

303
00:17:32 --> 00:17:35
verbal labels and sometimes we would
just stand in a window and she would

304
00:17:35 --> 00:17:38
take my hand and point out the window at
a panorama before us and i would really

305
00:17:38 --> 00:17:41
know exactly what it was she wanted to
know the word for but she would persist

306
00:17:41 --> 00:17:45
until she we&#39;ve got a new word while
Curtis track Jeannie speech

307
00:17:45 --> 00:17:50
James can&#39;t continue to work on her
emotional development cat was concerned

308
00:17:50 --> 00:17:52
that with the growing number of people
involved in a case

309
00:17:52 --> 00:17:56
Jeannie wouldn&#39;t be able to form single
dependable relationships so he set out

310
00:17:56 --> 00:17:58
to be her surrogate parent

311
00:17:58 --> 00:18:01
I want to be part of her that ordinary
life so I would frequently be there in

312
00:18:01 --> 00:18:03
the morning when she had breakfast and
be there in the evening when she went to

313
00:18:03 --> 00:18:03
bed

314
00:18:03 --> 00:18:07
read her a story kiss you goodnight turn
off the lights go and then do things

315
00:18:07 --> 00:18:10
during the day when she became when she
had sort of important things that she

316
00:18:10 --> 00:18:13
had to go through like physical exams
are things like that it was I would come

317
00:18:13 --> 00:18:14
along with her as though she were my
child

318
00:18:14 --> 00:18:18
she was very special to me did you feel
loved her

319
00:18:18 --> 00:18:22
well doctors are supposed to love their
patients but if you can find it upward

320
00:18:22 --> 00:18:23
admit the same thing

321
00:18:23 --> 00:18:26
yes yeah i was very attached to her

322
00:18:26 --> 00:18:28
pretend she saw helium balloon she
couldn&#39;t believe him the fact that you

323
00:18:28 --> 00:18:30
could let them go up and pull them back
down again

324
00:18:30 --> 00:18:33
she had a you just kind of laughed some
people have is just a full-out chocolate

325
00:18:33 --> 00:18:35
so contagious that right around and
start to let well they made her laugh

326
00:18:35 --> 00:18:43
like that one of my memories was that we
would go to a place they were worth

327
00:18:43 --> 00:18:49
where there would be a stand of spools
of thread and schools where each color

328
00:18:49 --> 00:18:54
thread would incremental change from the
spools next to it and she wanted a word

329
00:18:54 --> 00:18:59
for every different you and I didn&#39;t
know I mean I had a box of 64 crayola

330
00:18:59 --> 00:19:02
crayon to the child and I remember you
know burnt sienna and all these colors

331
00:19:02 --> 00:19:06
that I tried to extract from my memory
guy don&#39;t English doesn&#39;t have words for

332
00:19:06 --> 00:19:09
all of these different shoes and she was
very frustrated when I would say very

333
00:19:09 --> 00:19:12
dark blue and very very dark blue

334
00:19:12 --> 00:19:16
for Jeanne every new object every field
trip was a visit to a magic kingdom

335
00:19:16 --> 00:19:20
the previous fall the world had
discovered genie now Jeannie could

336
00:19:20 --> 00:19:23
discover the world

337
00:19:23 --> 00:19:25
there was a time that she passed a

338
00:19:25 --> 00:19:29
father and a little boy who were coming
out of a shop and a little boy was

339
00:19:29 --> 00:19:33
carrying a toy fire engine and they just
passed and then they turned around and

340
00:19:33 --> 00:19:37
came back and boy without word handed
the fire engine to Jeannie

341
00:19:37 --> 00:19:40
she never asked for it she never said a
word she did this kind of thing so i

342
00:19:40 --> 00:19:43
have two people

343
00:19:43 --> 00:19:45
you can&#39;t imagine what that was like

344
00:19:45 --> 00:19:48
her eyes I don&#39;t believe so I don&#39;t
think I really could sometimes I could

345
00:19:48 --> 00:19:51
understand and guess pretty well what
she was going to do but that was

346
00:19:51 --> 00:19:56
familiarity and not an ability i think
to empathize with understand the way she

347
00:19:56 --> 00:19:59
saw the world

348
00:19:59 --> 00:20:01
ok

349
00:20:01 --> 00:20:07
after her discovery was a time of firsts
for Jeanne water the grass about you can

350
00:20:07 --> 00:20:10
the most significant happened here in
the home of Gene Butler for teacher at

351
00:20:10 --> 00:20:13
Children&#39;s Hospital you get some water
and take the table

352
00:20:13 --> 00:20:17
Jeannie moved in you can get water get a
glass it was a new step for Jimmy her

353
00:20:17 --> 00:20:21
first trial run in a foster home that
what you want it miss July eleventh this

354
00:20:21 --> 00:20:25
about this house this is not the time
she just took the milk and chocolate

355
00:20:25 --> 00:20:29
milk into the bedroom here but were
videotapes genies passion for hoarding

356
00:20:29 --> 00:20:31
things especially containers of liquid

357
00:20:31 --> 00:20:34
although there is no obvious explanation
this has been reported in other cases of

358
00:20:34 --> 00:20:36
children raised in isolation

359
00:20:36 --> 00:20:41
Jimmy began living here after Butler
said she had exposed genie to German

360
00:20:41 --> 00:20:41
measles

361
00:20:41 --> 00:20:44
it began as a temporary quarantine
Butler wanted to make it permanent

362
00:20:44 --> 00:20:51
Butler shown here with Jimmy and James
can&#39;t wanted to be genies official

363
00:20:51 --> 00:20:54
foster parent and she wanted to see
changes in the handling of genius case

364
00:20:54 --> 00:20:58
but we thought frequent visits by team
members can&#39;t and Susan Curtis were

365
00:20:58 --> 00:20:59
exhausting genie

366
00:20:59 --> 00:21:02
that was the summer when we were then
both disallowed in teaching others house

367
00:21:02 --> 00:21:06
so you know we didn&#39;t we didn&#39;t have
such a fun summer with some of that

368
00:21:06 --> 00:21:11
included weeks of of a concern and
anxiety and you know anger and all kinds

369
00:21:11 --> 00:21:14
of things because he and I were kicked
out of the house floor

370
00:21:14 --> 00:21:18
she&#39;s crazy she didn&#39;t want the other
attachments someone she wanted chicken

371
00:21:18 --> 00:21:21
and cheese to walk around saying i&#39;m not
i am going to be the next any supplement

372
00:21:21 --> 00:21:23
this girl is gonna make me famous

373
00:21:23 --> 00:21:26
maybe used it to joke about it because
she was so overt about it

374
00:21:26 --> 00:21:28
why doesn&#39;t know if she had the desire
why is she so willing to tell her

375
00:21:28 --> 00:21:31
husband but she certainly found a way to
can kind she concocted this story the

376
00:21:31 --> 00:21:37
whole thing&#39;s untrue and a German
measles rash the bickering continued for

377
00:21:37 --> 00:21:40
more than a month according to journals
left behind by jean butler who died in

378
00:21:40 --> 00:21:41
1988

379
00:21:41 --> 00:21:45
oh but the road she feared jeanne was
being experimented with too much are you

380
00:21:45 --> 00:21:49
going to do that again whether this was
Butler&#39;s true motivation and keeping

381
00:21:49 --> 00:21:53
away other team members cannot be known
but it raised again the issue of how

382
00:21:53 --> 00:21:54
Jeannie should be treated

383
00:21:54 --> 00:21:59
could she be a scientific subject and
still be a patient on the morning of

384
00:21:59 --> 00:22:03
Bacchus 13 social workers arrived at
Butler&#39;s house with a decision on her

385
00:22:03 --> 00:22:05
application to be genies foster parent

386
00:22:05 --> 00:22:08
partly on advice from Children&#39;s
Hospital it was rejected

387
00:22:08 --> 00:22:13
we were not satisfied with the quality
of the care that

388
00:22:13 --> 00:22:17
jeanne was evil what had at gene
Butler&#39;s so that had to be interrupted

389
00:22:17 --> 00:22:25
and again it was up to up to management
is to interrupt that Genie return to

390
00:22:25 --> 00:22:27
Children&#39;s Hospital for only a couple of
hours

391
00:22:27 --> 00:22:32
a new foster parent came to take her
home it was David regular regular

392
00:22:32 --> 00:22:36
decided to take charge of the case he
decided to take over control as

393
00:22:36 --> 00:22:39
therapists and also be genies foster
parent and the principal investigator

394
00:22:39 --> 00:22:44
ordinarily mental health people are not
involved in these kinds of multiple

395
00:22:44 --> 00:22:44
roles

396
00:22:44 --> 00:22:47
what kind of the stress of desperate we
were to find a place that was

397
00:22:47 --> 00:22:50
appropriate and I remember making the
commitment in my mind for a three-month

398
00:22:50 --> 00:22:53
period which obviously got extended much
longer

399
00:22:53 --> 00:22:54
how is she

400
00:22:54 --> 00:22:57
she was with us approximately four years

401
00:22:57 --> 00:23:01
genies new home was in a neighborhood
near children&#39;s hospital she lived here

402
00:23:01 --> 00:23:04
with David regular his wife Marilyn and
the bigger children

403
00:23:04 --> 00:23:08
we really didn&#39;t know what to expect
except that we knew that she needed a

404
00:23:08 --> 00:23:13
great deal of help and on the other hand
it was very exciting to feel that

405
00:23:13 --> 00:23:18
perhaps we could help her and perhaps
she could be rehabilitated Maryland a

406
00:23:18 --> 00:23:22
graduate student in human development
was genies new teacher she soon found

407
00:23:22 --> 00:23:24
herself giving Jeannie unconventional
lessons

408
00:23:24 --> 00:23:29
Jeannie would erupt in silence storms of
Rage tugging and tearing her own body to

409
00:23:29 --> 00:23:32
turn Jeannie self-destructive anger
outward Maryland taught her how to have

410
00:23:32 --> 00:23:32
a fit

411
00:23:32 --> 00:23:37
how to slam doors and stamping feet
eventually

412
00:23:37 --> 00:23:40
maryland encourage Genie to turn her
pain and anger into words

413
00:23:40 --> 00:23:45
and there came a time when she could say
rough time and sometimes she could tell

414
00:23:45 --> 00:23:49
you the degree of how upset she was by
waving one finger which meant she was

415
00:23:49 --> 00:23:55
very upset or kind of waving her hand
which meant she was upset but it wasn&#39;t

416
00:23:55 --> 00:23:55
gonna be a big deal

417
00:23:55 --> 00:23:58
I see you

418
00:23:58 --> 00:24:06
yeah one of maryland&#39;s first tasks was
to awaken in Jeanne a sense of her

419
00:24:06 --> 00:24:07
connection to the physical world

420
00:24:07 --> 00:24:14
March watch County what i&#39;m doing like a
historic counterpart Viktor genies and

421
00:24:14 --> 00:24:17
disconnected from certain bodily
sensations

422
00:24:17 --> 00:24:22
I would allow her to run her own
bathwater or her own shower water and

423
00:24:22 --> 00:24:23
when I would touch it

424
00:24:23 --> 00:24:29
I would realize it was icy cold and i
would say this is so coupled you&#39;re

425
00:24:29 --> 00:24:33
going to freeze and it was as though it
didn&#39;t make any difference in their new

426
00:24:33 --> 00:24:34
role as genies foster parents

427
00:24:34 --> 00:24:37
the rivers were suddenly responsible for
a child who needed full-time supervision

428
00:24:37 --> 00:24:43
they also took responsibility for genius
therapy attempts to help her grapple

429
00:24:43 --> 00:24:44
with the horror of her childhood

430
00:24:44 --> 00:24:48
ok in this primitive role-playing
exercise

431
00:24:48 --> 00:24:54
maryland pretends to be genies mother
because there isn&#39;t any time father&#39;s

432
00:24:54 --> 00:24:55
gonna be angry

433
00:24:55 --> 00:24:58
maryland tries to elicit memories of
genies past

434
00:24:58 --> 00:25:01
I wonder which is

435
00:25:01 --> 00:25:03
yeah

436
00:25:03 --> 00:25:07
you want to see your father

437
00:25:07 --> 00:25:08
yeah

438
00:25:08 --> 00:25:11
like to look at home

439
00:25:11 --> 00:25:22
what were you sitting on cereal into the
part where did you say

440
00:25:22 --> 00:25:25
bridging why did you sleep

441
00:25:25 --> 00:25:32
you slept in a while this videotape
shows how to stress jeanne was by her

442
00:25:32 --> 00:25:32
childhood

443
00:25:32 --> 00:25:35
it also reveals a developmental
breakthrough jeanne was using language

444
00:25:35 --> 00:25:38
to describe past events

445
00:25:38 --> 00:25:42
jeanne was talking about things that
happened before words were part of the

446
00:25:42 --> 00:25:46
world for a child who barely spoke just
a short time ago

447
00:25:46 --> 00:25:50
jeanne was doing remarkably well with
language Susan Curtis continue to track

448
00:25:50 --> 00:25:53
your progress

449
00:25:53 --> 00:26:00
Jeannie could read simple words
vocabulary was growing here she&#39;s about

450
00:26:00 --> 00:26:03
the same i like log

451
00:26:03 --> 00:26:08
let me see the log you find a picture
below I didn&#39;t even know you knew it

452
00:26:08 --> 00:26:09
along was all right

453
00:26:09 --> 00:26:13
why do you see a lot i was struck with
how different the words that she knew

454
00:26:13 --> 00:26:16
were from the vocabulary words that
young children would know when they&#39;re

455
00:26:16 --> 00:26:17
acquiring a first language

456
00:26:17 --> 00:26:24
she had words for emotions angry sad
excited happy she had words color words

457
00:26:24 --> 00:26:31
shape words square rectangle for
jeannie&#39;s seem to be pulling off a

458
00:26:31 --> 00:26:35
linguistic school she had passed the
critical age of puberty but she seemed

459
00:26:35 --> 00:26:36
to be learning a first language

460
00:26:36 --> 00:26:39
Curtis began doubting the notion that
there was a deadline for doing so

461
00:26:39 --> 00:26:43
my early ideas were that the sky might
be with you

462
00:26:43 --> 00:26:49
I couldn&#39;t help thinking that she might
in fact just be able to be able to show

463
00:26:49 --> 00:26:51
that people really were wrong

464
00:26:51 --> 00:26:55
jenny was at last settled into a new
life she even went to a nursery school

465
00:26:55 --> 00:27:00
pokes through that unlike other cases of
children isolated from society

466
00:27:00 --> 00:27:02
genies could have a happy ending

467
00:27:02 --> 00:27:08
at the Paris institute for the deb jeans
historic counterpart also seem to

468
00:27:08 --> 00:27:14
flourish when reunited with civilization
is shown in truth I was moving

469
00:27:14 --> 00:27:17
Victor responded successfully to method
used to teach the death

470
00:27:17 --> 00:27:20
yeah Victor&#39;s teacher created his own
methods as well

471
00:27:20 --> 00:27:24
guitar used cut out letters for lessons
that are still used in kindergartens all

472
00:27:24 --> 00:27:25
over the world

473
00:27:25 --> 00:27:30
that&#39;s it yeah he had a knack for
gradually increasing the complexity of

474
00:27:30 --> 00:27:41
Victor&#39;s tasks mo da is teaching Victor
to read simple phrases like to throw a

475
00:27:41 --> 00:27:45
key so he writes throw key and French
and then flames a key then expecting the

476
00:27:45 --> 00:27:46
same

477
00:27:46 --> 00:27:49
victor is doing well he&#39;s reading the
sentence is performing the action buddy

478
00:27:49 --> 00:27:52
Todd doesn&#39;t trust it could be by sheer
memory has seen guitar do it

479
00:27:52 --> 00:27:55
so he decides to scramble the nouns and
verbs and get some weird combinations

480
00:27:55 --> 00:27:58
like to Terra stone to cut a cop to eat
a broom presents

481
00:27:58 --> 00:28:02
Tara stone to Victor and show some
ingenuity he goes off he gets a hammer

482
00:28:02 --> 00:28:04
and smashes a stone cut a cup

483
00:28:04 --> 00:28:07
except the cup and hurls it on the floor
and shatters eat a broom

484
00:28:07 --> 00:28:10
this time he changes the noun goes off
and gets a piece of bread and devours it

485
00:28:10 --> 00:28:15
this was eat are constantly analyzing
upping the ante pushing the kid towards

486
00:28:15 --> 00:28:19
civilization toward the skills that we
have and Victor generally rising to the

487
00:28:19 --> 00:28:22
challenge each time taking the small
step

488
00:28:22 --> 00:28:25
this was the kind of struggle they
engaged in together for six years

489
00:28:25 --> 00:28:30
indeed for a while teacher and pupil
were joined in a shared mission of

490
00:28:30 --> 00:28:31
awakening

491
00:28:31 --> 00:28:36
yeah and this is as far as film director
Truffaut takes his version of the story

492
00:28:36 --> 00:28:38
many people have asked me what do you
think of the Truffaut film the wild

493
00:28:38 --> 00:28:39
child lawful Sauvage

494
00:28:39 --> 00:28:44
and what I think it was that it was a
pretty solid job of phone times reports

495
00:28:44 --> 00:28:48
i made over here but I do have one
exception and that is at the end of the

496
00:28:48 --> 00:28:51
film the child climbs the stairs when
the idea that he&#39;s walking off into a

497
00:28:51 --> 00:28:55
future of endless possibilities in which
you may even write his autobiography and

498
00:28:55 --> 00:28:56
that&#39;s simply false

499
00:28:56 --> 00:29:03
in reality the history books show that
pictures progress slow down it time

500
00:29:03 --> 00:29:06
reported while Victor knew how to read
simple words he never really learned how

501
00:29:06 --> 00:29:07
to talk

502
00:29:07 --> 00:29:10
guitar recommended that the forbidden
experiment be stopped

503
00:29:10 --> 00:29:15
you know we attributed to eat our this
mode of wanting to use Victor to build

504
00:29:15 --> 00:29:18
his own career and I think that was true
when the point came that he was no

505
00:29:18 --> 00:29:20
longer serving victory nor serving
science

506
00:29:20 --> 00:29:23
he was no longer serving his career he
abandoned me let him go

507
00:29:23 --> 00:29:27
guitar gave up he asked my own behind
the housekeeper to take the boy and down

508
00:29:27 --> 00:29:32
the street from the Deaf school and
there they lived rather a gray sad for

509
00:29:32 --> 00:29:33
long existence the two of them

510
00:29:33 --> 00:29:36
so the story is not as romantic as true
for would have us believe

511
00:29:36 --> 00:29:39
Victor lived his last days at this very
spot in Paris

512
00:29:39 --> 00:29:42
he died in his forties in 1828

513
00:29:42 --> 00:29:46
picture story did not in well in Los
Angeles more than a century later

514
00:29:46 --> 00:29:52
genies caregivers were working to ensure
that their pupil fared better when you

515
00:29:52 --> 00:29:56
see your mama in the house when when
Jeannie use gestures a lot to

516
00:29:56 --> 00:30:03
communicate the Riddler&#39;s arranged for
her to learn sign language see mama

517
00:30:03 --> 00:30:04
saturday

518
00:30:04 --> 00:30:08
why critics fault the teacher in
Victor&#39;s case for emphasizing spoken

519
00:30:08 --> 00:30:08
speech

520
00:30:08 --> 00:30:14
the riggers tried to avoid this mistake
all in the week&#39;s turned into months

521
00:30:14 --> 00:30:17
the months and the years and David
regular the man who would be scientists

522
00:30:17 --> 00:30:20
therapist and foster parent to Jeanne
seem to find a way to juggle all those

523
00:30:20 --> 00:30:23
roles in reality the juggling act had
started to fall apart

524
00:30:23 --> 00:30:27
this is the paper for years river had
trouble managing the research part of

525
00:30:27 --> 00:30:27
the case

526
00:30:27 --> 00:30:30
curtis&#39;s language studies preceding the
greater had been getting government

527
00:30:30 --> 00:30:31
money to do more

528
00:30:31 --> 00:30:36
indeed he gathered hundreds of videos to
supervise countless tests but he never

529
00:30:36 --> 00:30:38
clearly defined his own research

530
00:30:38 --> 00:30:41
show me the shoe that time

531
00:30:41 --> 00:30:46
I&#39;m hi to add to the murkiness of the
study was an unresolved question which

532
00:30:46 --> 00:30:49
would make it difficult to draw firm
scientific conclusions was Jimmy brain

533
00:30:49 --> 00:30:52
damaged from birth team members
disagreed

534
00:30:52 --> 00:30:56
my impression was clearly that jeanne
was mentally retarded from birth

535
00:30:56 --> 00:31:02
based on for example my sleep study
which showed these extreme spindles

536
00:31:02 --> 00:31:06
which are fairly characteristic of
severe mental retardation genie of a

537
00:31:06 --> 00:31:09
functionally retarded because she had
hardly lived and experienced the world

538
00:31:09 --> 00:31:09
around her

539
00:31:09 --> 00:31:12
um was not mentally deficient in any
sense in which we typically think of as

540
00:31:12 --> 00:31:16
mentally deficient for example on
psychological tests that measure mental

541
00:31:16 --> 00:31:21
age every year after she had been found
her mental age increased one year

542
00:31:21 --> 00:31:25
this is just not something that happens
in a person with a child or an adult who

543
00:31:25 --> 00:31:33
is mentally retarded the government
agency that was funding the research

544
00:31:33 --> 00:31:39
project grew uneasy with the scientific
ambiguities of genius case the national

545
00:31:39 --> 00:31:41
institute of mental health was looking
for payback for the years of money and

546
00:31:41 --> 00:31:45
poured into the study and it wasn&#39;t
finding any after repeated warnings in

547
00:31:45 --> 00:31:46
the fall of 74

548
00:31:46 --> 00:31:50
niamh stopped funding the genie project
citing a failure to collect data in a

549
00:31:50 --> 00:31:52
scientifically meaningful way

550
00:31:52 --> 00:31:55
nobody knew exactly how to deal with
this

551
00:31:55 --> 00:31:59
we were doing our best we got the best
kind of counsel that&#39;s kind of advice

552
00:31:59 --> 00:32:02
we had to sort that out and take that as
it came

553
00:32:02 --> 00:32:05
but we did the very best we know how and
we believe that nobody knew any better

554
00:32:05 --> 00:32:12
in the year following the laws of their
research grand the regulars decided to

555
00:32:12 --> 00:32:19
end their foster care of Jeannie their
decision caused concern among their

556
00:32:19 --> 00:32:19
colleagues

557
00:32:19 --> 00:32:23
it&#39;s not the King as a surprise to us
shouldn&#39;t have we had a lot of

558
00:32:23 --> 00:32:25
consultants and a lot of people coming
in and one of the questions we were

559
00:32:25 --> 00:32:30
asked often by more than one person is
what&#39;s going to happen here when the

560
00:32:30 --> 00:32:33
hospital goes away when you have the
research grant goes away of all of the

561
00:32:33 --> 00:32:36
very interested in how this youngster is
developing those searches folder can go

562
00:32:36 --> 00:32:36
away

563
00:32:36 --> 00:32:40
who&#39;s going to stay behind with cheating
this was something that I was certainly

564
00:32:40 --> 00:32:46
concerned about the fact that should we
not take Gennie because we did not plan

565
00:32:46 --> 00:32:52
to have her forever and it was something
that we we talked about very actively

566
00:32:52 --> 00:32:58
and we finally decided that if we could
give her a good home with much love and

567
00:32:58 --> 00:33:01
rehabilitation within that home

568
00:33:01 --> 00:33:09
nurturing caretaking and and good things
that that would give her the ability to

569
00:33:09 --> 00:33:14
cope at some later time so that she
would have a good foundation in a stable

570
00:33:14 --> 00:33:17
home and that was our reasoning

571
00:33:17 --> 00:33:23
what is all the red knob for linguists
Susan Curtis it was time to sum up her

572
00:33:23 --> 00:33:27
years of work with Jeannie a clear
picture was emerging in her data but for

573
00:33:27 --> 00:33:30
Jeanne that picture was not promising

574
00:33:30 --> 00:33:34
here when asked to make a question genie
comes up with what

575
00:33:34 --> 00:33:36
red blue is in

576
00:33:36 --> 00:33:42
Jeannie didn&#39;t seem to be able to put
words together in a normal grammatical

577
00:33:42 --> 00:33:42
way

578
00:33:42 --> 00:33:45
this seemed to support the idea of a
critical period for acquiring language

579
00:33:45 --> 00:33:50
ingenious case the vocabulary with what
she was good at conveying messages is

580
00:33:50 --> 00:33:53
what she was good at but if you look at
the sentence that she would utter it

581
00:33:53 --> 00:33:53
wouldn&#39;t be

582
00:33:53 --> 00:33:58
dramatical so she might say things like
spot you glove applesauce by store where

583
00:33:58 --> 00:33:59
the message was clear

584
00:33:59 --> 00:34:03
you know the dog named spot chewed the
glove for done

585
00:34:03 --> 00:34:06
we need a precise we need to buy apple
sauce at the store on but in both of

586
00:34:06 --> 00:34:08
these cases you can see it they&#39;re not
sent to the English we wouldn&#39;t say

587
00:34:08 --> 00:34:11
applesauce by store would say we need to
buy apple sauce at the store or

588
00:34:11 --> 00:34:14
applesauce is what we want from the
store or something that is an actual

589
00:34:14 --> 00:34:18
sentence of English much of the language
research on Jeannie was completed by

590
00:34:18 --> 00:34:23
1975 a pivotal year for her that summer
she returned here to her childhood home

591
00:34:23 --> 00:34:26
to live with her mother

592
00:34:26 --> 00:34:29
genies mother had been acquitted of
child abuse charges she wanted to resume

593
00:34:29 --> 00:34:32
care of her daughter but she soon found
it too difficult

594
00:34:32 --> 00:34:37
let&#39;s began another sad chapter in
genies life a series of placements in

595
00:34:37 --> 00:34:38
foster homes

596
00:34:38 --> 00:34:46
jeanne was subjected to abuse to
punishment to harassment to the extreme

597
00:34:46 --> 00:34:47
in some of these homes

598
00:34:47 --> 00:34:51
then she would be moved again to another
home and another home

599
00:34:51 --> 00:34:55
and meanwhile we knew nothing about it
until the bombshell hit the bombshell

600
00:34:55 --> 00:35:02
a lawsuit a lawsuit against Hanson
regular can&#39;t

601
00:35:02 --> 00:35:07
Curtis and Children&#39;s Hospital of Los
Angeles like Victor&#39;s genies case had

602
00:35:07 --> 00:35:08
not ended well

603
00:35:08 --> 00:35:12
and now there was a modern American
twist to her story a lawsuit

604
00:35:12 --> 00:35:16
the lawsuit filed by genies mother
charged the Jeanne Jeanne with excessive

605
00:35:16 --> 00:35:17
and outrageous testing

606
00:35:17 --> 00:35:21
we&#39;re gonna be finished soon as you put
all those cards and boxes we&#39;re going to

607
00:35:21 --> 00:35:25
be often the lawsuit claimed the
researchers gave testing priority over

608
00:35:25 --> 00:35:28
genies welfare pushing her beyond the
limits of her endurance

609
00:35:28 --> 00:35:41
apparently on the lawyer suing
children&#39;s hospital with Louise monaco

610
00:35:41 --> 00:35:42
and Samuel pods

611
00:35:42 --> 00:35:45
they should have had close that they
were going at things wrongly because

612
00:35:45 --> 00:35:48
they were getting visits from NIH the
National Institute of Mental Health

613
00:35:48 --> 00:35:49
telling them what she

614
00:35:49 --> 00:35:51
yeah you got all these videos but
they&#39;re not indexed in my catalog

615
00:35:51 --> 00:35:55
they&#39;re offering a drawer on your doing
tests that have no scientific purpose

616
00:35:55 --> 00:35:58
you&#39;re going to test that we made up and
we&#39;re doing tests repetitively which

617
00:35:58 --> 00:36:01
lose their validity over over with the
repetitiveness no means certain tests of

618
00:36:01 --> 00:36:02
you administer them within a year

619
00:36:02 --> 00:36:04
you can tell with your measuring
anything or not you&#39;re just measuring

620
00:36:04 --> 00:36:04
how familiar

621
00:36:04 --> 00:36:07
the subject is with the tests right
again

622
00:36:07 --> 00:36:12
yeah you do it in a box don&#39;t you work
fast it was our job to measure progress

623
00:36:12 --> 00:36:14
to determine what changes were taking
place

624
00:36:14 --> 00:36:19
indeed if we had not done as much as we
did we would have really not fulfill the

625
00:36:19 --> 00:36:24
purposes of our grant but in addition to
that the test thing that she underwent

626
00:36:24 --> 00:36:27
was by and large fun experiences for her

627
00:36:27 --> 00:36:32
depositions were taken experts were
seven and while the suit was eventually

628
00:36:32 --> 00:36:34
settled it raised an important question

629
00:36:34 --> 00:36:38
the decision was made the team go as far
as it could go in treating genie or did

630
00:36:38 --> 00:36:40
the research get in the way position

631
00:36:40 --> 00:36:45
we did everything we could not to
exploit the case on in a way that would

632
00:36:45 --> 00:36:49
impinge on her privacy or impact on her
psychologically or emotionally

633
00:36:49 --> 00:36:53
and that wasn&#39;t difficult because of the
things we ever I don&#39;t think they

634
00:36:53 --> 00:36:56
started out with the notion of let&#39;s
explore for all the money we can get

635
00:36:56 --> 00:37:00
I think maybe everybody started out with
an ocean on one they wanted to help her

636
00:37:00 --> 00:37:03
but - this is like the biggest thing
that hit town in quite a number of years

637
00:37:03 --> 00:37:06
it was right on the heels of true force
movie the wild child

638
00:37:06 --> 00:37:08
hence the name that was given to her
they mean when they had seminars at

639
00:37:08 --> 00:37:13
children&#39;s hospital they show the movie
as part of the seminar on and so I mean

640
00:37:13 --> 00:37:16
this was like a worldwide attraction so
i think it was really easy to get side

641
00:37:16 --> 00:37:21
track despite all she&#39;s been through

642
00:37:21 --> 00:37:25
genies troubles were not over in her
first foster home jeanne was severely

643
00:37:25 --> 00:37:27
punished for vomiting

644
00:37:27 --> 00:37:31
the experience was so traumatizing
Jeannie ended up back in children&#39;s

645
00:37:31 --> 00:37:34
hospital where the regulars offered
assistance

646
00:37:34 --> 00:37:37
you couldn&#39;t help it

647
00:37:37 --> 00:37:40
so now you&#39;re keeping your mouth closed
so you won&#39;t bother

648
00:37:40 --> 00:37:44
jeanne was afraid to open her mouth she
progressed to the only way she knew how

649
00:37:44 --> 00:37:47
to be under siege completely silent

650
00:37:47 --> 00:37:50
this would be one of the last times the
regulars videotape genie

651
00:37:50 --> 00:37:51
Jean out of

652
00:37:51 --> 00:37:55
an adult care foster home in Southern
California it&#39;s at least the sixth home

653
00:37:55 --> 00:37:58
she has lived in since the research
project ended

654
00:37:58 --> 00:38:01
what do we take away from this really
sad story look there&#39;s an ethical

655
00:38:01 --> 00:38:02
dilemma in this kind of research

656
00:38:02 --> 00:38:05
if you want to do rigorous science then
genies interest in going to come second

657
00:38:05 --> 00:38:08
some of the time if you only care about
helping genie

658
00:38:08 --> 00:38:10
then you wouldn&#39;t do a lot of the
scientific research so what are you

659
00:38:10 --> 00:38:14
going to do to make matters worse the
two roles scientists and therapists were

660
00:38:14 --> 00:38:15
combined in one person in her case

661
00:38:15 --> 00:38:18
so I think future generations are going
to study genies case as we&#39;ve been

662
00:38:18 --> 00:38:21
studying Victor&#39;s not only for what I
can teach us about human development but

663
00:38:21 --> 00:38:24
also for what I can teach us about the
rewards and the risks of conducting the

664
00:38:24 --> 00:38:27
forbidden experiment

665
00:38:27 --> 00:38:30
yeah

666
00:38:30 --> 00:38:33
yeah

667
00:38:33 --> 00:38:45
yeah

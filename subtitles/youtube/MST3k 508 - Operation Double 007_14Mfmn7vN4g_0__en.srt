Japanese I really think so

215
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:24,769
the results are due not only to modern
surgical technique but also to an

216
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:30,288
ancient tibetan process defined as the
hypnotic process of total recall it

217
00:18:30,288 --> 00:18:34,338
differs from the usual hypnosis in that
it allows us to operate with the

218
00:18:34,338 --> 00:18:37,878
complete surrender of the subconscious
universe obtain their patients

223
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:59,269

but I am capable of lip reading i would

228
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:14,749
say the young lady is not an ideal
subject for this sort of thing

00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:18,259
she's hot it appears to have unusual
willpower I'm afraid he would take too

00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,710

00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:26,600
doesn't your room same right now let's
review the steps on how to run a hostage

347
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,808
down overall

348
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,808
could we stop at a baskin-robbins

349
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,788
holder Repole clergy dr. Connery what
you look at that photo

350
00:29:40,788 --> 00:29:44,269
it was in mr. Shue cos bag she said you
know him

351
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:48,440
it's ward Jones he was planning to marry
her then I showed up I met him when he

352
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,538
took my course and hypnosis

353
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:55,220
the one I gave in Japan a very capable
chap thinks he's a chicken star jones

354
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,390
killed this morning

355
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:00,919
what's been killed by the same people
who tried to kidnap a sugar rush rivalry

356
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:02,538
she's back in our hands

357
00:30:02,538 --> 00:30:06,440
what had important information he was
the seller's unfortunately was killed

358
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,190
before he got it to us actually ward
asked us to protect your she could

359
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,580
because he'd given her some secret
information and he was afraid she might

360
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:14,720
be in danger

361
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,890
now she denies this absence of barnaby
jones rapper and I'm inclined to think

362
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:22,880
she's telling the truth but we can't
find any explanation of these museums

363
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,990
then I'll explain it to you what
happened was just isn't a special yogi

364
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:31,909
technique quite complicated but very
effective briefly it's very possible to

365
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:36,110
communicating and eating in job new
state of hypnosis of total recall the

366
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:39,859
subject himself doesn't know he knows
but he would be able to repeat verbatim

367
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:42,199
if he was again hypnotized to the same
extent

368
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,830
what do you mean that's how r June's
precisely you're well it's clear ward

369
00:30:45,829 --> 00:30:50,240

376
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,730

377
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:22,869

Sean's acting talent is discovered in an
early age and leads to a long and

543
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:19,440
lucrative film career while Neil's
talent for selling light bulbs over the

544
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,639
phone is discovered leading to a long
life of menial jobs and aimless drifted

545
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:28,739

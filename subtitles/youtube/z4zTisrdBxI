00:00:00 --> 00:00:03
SIGNS OF LIFE

3
00:00:03 --> 00:00:04
What&#39;s the matter?

4
00:00:04 --> 00:00:07
It&#39;s so hot!

5
00:00:07 --> 00:00:09
Bring him over there.

6
00:00:09 --> 00:00:12
He&#39;s almost dead.

7
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
Four weeks
after the parachutist Stroszek

8
00:00:14 --> 00:00:15
was transferred to Crete, -

9
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
- he was wounded and had to be
withdrawn from battle.

10
00:00:18 --> 00:00:19
He and another soldier
had been shot at

11
00:00:19 --> 00:00:20
by partisans in the west, -

12
00:00:20 --> 00:00:24
- near the town of Chania.

13
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
It occurred during a lull
in the fighting, -

14
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
- in a village held
by the Germans.

15
00:00:29 --> 00:00:30
After convalescence,

16
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
Stroszek was sent to Cos
in the Dodekanes.

17
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
On that island,
there had been no fighting.

18
00:00:35 --> 00:00:38
It was peaceful there.

19
00:00:38 --> 00:00:39
A helpful officer
sought to find a post -

20
00:00:39 --> 00:00:41
- where Stroszek could spend
the rest of the war

21
00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
- without seeing
any more action.

22
00:00:44 --> 00:00:46
The occupation of the island
was peaceful, -

23
00:00:46 --> 00:00:49
- and only required
a garrison of 60.

24
00:00:49 --> 00:00:51
Stroszek was separated
from the main garrison -

25
00:00:51 --> 00:00:54
- and stationed
in the old fortress.

26
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
His Greek wife, Nora,
and two other soldiers -

27
00:00:57 --> 00:00:58
- lived together with him there.

28
00:00:58 --> 00:01:01
A previous guard informed them
about their duties.

29
00:01:01 --> 00:01:04
The only entrance,
which could be reached by a bridge, -

30
00:01:04 --> 00:01:07
- had to be kept locked at night.

31
00:01:07 --> 00:01:10
Parts of the town had been destroyed
several times by earthquakes.

32
00:01:10 --> 00:01:13
As a result, old relics were
often found under the ruins.

33
00:01:13 --> 00:01:15
The Venetians
began to use relics

34
00:01:15 --> 00:01:18
to fill in the walls
of the fortress.

35
00:01:18 --> 00:01:20
After the walls were finished, -

36
00:01:20 --> 00:01:23
- this was no longer possible.

37
00:01:23 --> 00:01:25
There was an ammunition depot
in the main courtyard -

38
00:01:25 --> 00:01:28
- which was abandoned by the
Greeks and had to be guarded -

39
00:01:28 --> 00:01:31
- even though the Germans
couldn&#39;t use it in their own weapons.

40
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
Guarding this
was their only real task.

41
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
The living-quarters were located

42
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
in a newer building
in the fortress.

43
00:01:38 --> 00:01:41
There,
the still incomplete museum

44
00:01:41 --> 00:01:43
and the house of the restorer -

45
00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
- had been requisitioned
by the army.

46
00:01:46 --> 00:01:48
The surroundings had
a strange effect on Stroszek, -

47
00:01:48 --> 00:01:51
- but he could find
no explanation for this.

48
00:01:51 --> 00:01:54
However, the others adapted
themselves quickly to the place.

49
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
Stroszek had tried his hand
at various jobs without success.

50
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
At one time,
he had been a salesman.

51
00:01:59 --> 00:02:02
But he had always wanted to
emigrate to Canada or Australia.

52
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
Then he thought of
going to Chile, -

53
00:02:04 --> 00:02:07
- since he knew a family there.

54
00:02:07 --> 00:02:10
Nora nursed him in the hospital.

55
00:02:10 --> 00:02:13
Stroszek had been granted
special permission to marry her.

56
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
What a shame that the people had
to leave all their belongings behind.

57
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
The household crockery,
their little pictures.

58
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
How touching it all is.

59
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
And now we are making ourselves
comfortable here.

60
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
Do you understand me?

61
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
If this war goes on
much longer, -

62
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
- we&#39;ll spend a long time here.

63
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
If the war lasts very long, -

64
00:02:34 --> 00:02:37
- I might have a baby here.

65
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
The words are hard to read
because they run into each other.

66
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
It&#39;s beautiful.

67
00:02:43 --> 00:02:46
Becker had often missed school
because of illness.

68
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
Still, he passed his exams
with the highest marks.

69
00:02:49 --> 00:02:53
When war came, stronger men
were found unfit for service.

70
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
He passed his physical, but soon
fell ill after he was drafted.

71
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
Meinhard was formerly
a bar-keeper, -

72
00:02:58 --> 00:03:01
- until one of his customers
was killed in a brawl.

73
00:03:01 --> 00:03:02
He then became a crane-operator.

74
00:03:02 --> 00:03:05
It paid better anyway.

75
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
Everything&#39;s full of oil here.

76
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
Here everything&#39;s full of oil.

77
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
Salad in oil,
fish in oil, meat, -

78
00:03:14 --> 00:03:17
- machine-gun in oil.

79
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
What a shitty country!

80
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
Empty, no ammunition.

81
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
Are we supposed
to shoot with grease?

82
00:03:26 --> 00:03:29
Okay, I&#39;ll get it.

83
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
I couldn&#39;t fix
a decent meal today.

84
00:03:31 --> 00:03:33
Salt and other things
are missing.

85
00:03:33 --> 00:03:35
We have wine instead.

86
00:03:35 --> 00:03:36
No thanks, not for me.

87
00:03:36 --> 00:03:39
It tastes like turpentine.

88
00:03:39 --> 00:03:40
Dammit!

89
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
This place is full of roaches.

90
00:03:43 --> 00:03:44
They&#39;re not harmful.

91
00:03:44 --> 00:03:46
They are the most repulsive
things on earth.

92
00:03:46 --> 00:03:47
They don&#39;t even bite.

93
00:03:47 --> 00:03:48
It&#39;s not that.

94
00:03:48 --> 00:03:51
They snap and pop all night
long, just like this.

95
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
Just like that all night.

96
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
Becker, listen, I&#39;ve got it.

97
00:03:57 --> 00:04:00
The trap has to be placed
against the wall, -

98
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
- since the roaches always keep
running along the walls.

99
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
It works like this.
Look!

100
00:04:06 --> 00:04:09
The roach runs
up this board or ramp -

101
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
- until it arrives
at this trap, -

102
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
- which moves
at the slightest touch.

103
00:04:14 --> 00:04:15
Then it falls into the funnel, -

104
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
- either this way or that way.

105
00:04:18 --> 00:04:21
It should be baited,
but with what?

106
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
What do you think they eat,
sugar?

107
00:04:24 --> 00:04:27
One could try it.

108
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
Stroszek volunteered from the beginning
for sentry duty at night.

109
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
The lights in town
were never put out at night.

110
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
He loved to sit
facing the town -

111
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
- in order to show the world
that he was still functional.

112
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
Everyplace else had been bombed:
Only this place was spared.

113
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
Stroszek thought that he could detect
a kind of anticipation in the town -

114
00:04:44 --> 00:04:47
- which somehow attracted him
and seemed to offer him a challenge.

115
00:04:47 --> 00:04:48
Unbelievable!

116
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
There really are roaches
in here!

117
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
There are even two of them!

118
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
I know I&#39;ve got
some insecticide somewhere.

119
00:04:57 --> 00:05:00
This is the right seasoning.

120
00:05:00 --> 00:05:03
That&#39;s what they get -

121
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
- for being so repulsive.

122
00:05:06 --> 00:05:08
Do we have turpentine
or something?

123
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
The brushes are getting sticky;
we can throw them away soon.

124
00:05:11 --> 00:05:12
Maybe hot water would work.

125
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
Are you crazy?

126
00:05:14 --> 00:05:15
- Gasoline.

127
00:05:15 --> 00:05:18
- Gas would do the job.

128
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
I&#39;ll pick some up
when I go in town.

129
00:05:20 --> 00:05:23
I can mail the letters too.

130
00:05:23 --> 00:05:25
Those damned idiots, -

131
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
- loading me down
with a whole can.

132
00:05:28 --> 00:05:31
And in this heat.

133
00:05:31 --> 00:05:32
Dammit!

134
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
That&#39;s what I say about it.

135
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
Regulations!

136
00:05:38 --> 00:05:41
To hell with them.

137
00:05:41 --> 00:05:42
You took long enough.

138
00:05:42 --> 00:05:43
I&#39;m almost finished.

139
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
What do you mean, long?

140
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
You just can&#39;t reason
with those idiots from supply.

141
00:05:48 --> 00:05:49
I tell them I want a little gas.

142
00:05:49 --> 00:05:50
They say they haven&#39;t got any.

143
00:05:50 --> 00:05:53
So I had to take a whole can.

144
00:05:53 --> 00:05:55
That&#39;s regulations for you.

145
00:05:55 --> 00:05:56
Hurry up.

146
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
I can&#39;t take this fiddling
around much longer.

147
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
We&#39;ve only been here
two weeks, -

148
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
- and in two days
we won&#39;t have any more work.

149
00:06:03 --> 00:06:04
In 2 days
we can twiddle our thumbs.

150
00:06:04 --> 00:06:05
You are always napping anyway.

151
00:06:05 --> 00:06:06
Don&#39;t be angry.

152
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
All work doesn&#39;t have to go
so fast.

153
00:06:09 --> 00:06:12
Here are peaches.

154
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
Not peashes, but peaches.

155
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
Please take seat.

156
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
I&#39;ll make my round on the bike.

157
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
I&#39;m not the best guard.

158
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
There&#39;s hardly any goat&#39;s milk.

159
00:06:25 --> 00:06:28
So we have to drink
black coffee.

160
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
- Aha.
- Aha, what?

161
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
I&#39;ve always said -

162
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
- that goat&#39;s milk is shit;
it tastes like he-goat.

163
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
Besides, she doesn&#39;t give
any milk.

164
00:06:37 --> 00:06:38
Maybe we should sell her.

165
00:06:38 --> 00:06:39
Who would buy her?

166
00:06:39 --> 00:06:40
She&#39;s as old as Methuselah.

167
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
The founders
probably brought her.

168
00:06:43 --> 00:06:44
A pity.

169
00:06:44 --> 00:06:47
I imagined everything
to be so nice.

170
00:06:47 --> 00:06:50
A goat that gives milk,
hens that lay eggs.

171
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
I imagined
a pretty little garden.

172
00:06:53 --> 00:06:56
But this place
is too dry for that.

173
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
Well, Becker, what&#39;s up?

174
00:06:58 --> 00:06:59
Has the goat given any milk?

175
00:06:59 --> 00:07:00
Found any eggs?

176
00:07:00 --> 00:07:03
No, but there&#39;s a strange fellow
outside the gate.

177
00:07:03 --> 00:07:04
He wants to come in.

178
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
Do we know him, or what?

179
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
No idea;
he says he&#39;s a king.

180
00:07:09 --> 00:07:10
A king?

181
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
He must have a screw loose.

182
00:07:12 --> 00:07:13
He&#39;s well-mannered.

183
00:07:13 --> 00:07:14
Let&#39;s have a look at him.

184
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
Although the isolation of
the fortress weighed on them, -

185
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
- the appearance of a stranger -

186
00:07:19 --> 00:07:22
- was felt as a violation of a domain
which had to be defended.

187
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
Excuse the disturbance.

188
00:07:24 --> 00:07:26
I think I&#39;d better leave.

189
00:07:26 --> 00:07:28
I didn&#39;t realize
that soldiers were here.

190
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
I hope
that I didn&#39;t disturb you.

191
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
Would you like to have
some coffee?

192
00:07:33 --> 00:07:36
No, please don&#39;t bother.

193
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
I had intended to ask this gentleman
whether I could spend the night here.

194
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
I&#39;m a stranger in this country.

195
00:07:41 --> 00:07:42
There would be room enough.

196
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
No, this is military territory.

197
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
Actually, we have no objections.

198
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
Excuse my curiosity,
but where do you come from?

199
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
I&#39;m not sure, but I think
I was born in Portugal.

200
00:07:52 --> 00:07:55
I&#39;m a gypsy, you know,
and am probably from Portugal.

201
00:07:55 --> 00:07:58
I was there as a small child.

202
00:07:58 --> 00:08:01
You say that you&#39;re a king?

203
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
Does this thing work?

204
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
That&#39;s nice.

205
00:08:06 --> 00:08:07
Where did you get it?

206
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
I&#39;ve had it for a long time.

207
00:08:09 --> 00:08:11
Tell us some more.

208
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
This is a rare occasion.

209
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
I really am a king.

210
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
I became separated
from my tribe as a child.

211
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
Since then
I&#39;ve been searching for them.

212
00:08:21 --> 00:08:22
I&#39;ve been
practically everywhere -

213
00:08:22 --> 00:08:23
in Germany for a long time, -

214
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
- in Poland, England, and Spain.

215
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
I was in Rumania too.

216
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
I&#39;m not ashamed of my poverty;
I can live of it.

217
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
Sometimes I do card-tricks.

218
00:08:33 --> 00:08:36
It is quite difficult
for us gypsies.

219
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
What a strange person.

220
00:08:39 --> 00:08:41
I mean the gypsy.

221
00:08:41 --> 00:08:43
Do you think he was lying?

222
00:08:43 --> 00:08:45
Probably.

223
00:08:45 --> 00:08:46
I didn&#39;t believe him.

224
00:08:46 --> 00:08:49
He&#39;s like a paper flower
compared to this one.

225
00:08:49 --> 00:08:50
Can you make anything
out of that?

226
00:08:50 --> 00:08:53
It&#39;s difficult
for the words run together.

227
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
Something&#39;s missing here.

228
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
This word is &quot;demos.&quot;

229
00:08:58 --> 00:08:59
What does &quot;demos&quot; mean?

230
00:08:59 --> 00:09:02
People.

231
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
- &quot;Kyna,&quot; the dog...

232
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
Pardon me,
I used the wrong case.

233
00:09:08 --> 00:09:11
I have the feeling that life&#39;s
rather unbalanced here.

234
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
Our duty here is as simple
as one can imagine.

235
00:09:13 --> 00:09:14
But keeping watch all night -

236
00:09:14 --> 00:09:16
And one doesn&#39;t sleep
long mornings.

237
00:09:16 --> 00:09:18
It&#39;s really too short.

238
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
Why do you always try
to get us to hurry?

239
00:09:20 --> 00:09:23
We have plenty of time
so we can take things easy.

240
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
Look!

241
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
A super egg from a super hen.

242
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
Could you give me the chalk
for a minute to try something?

243
00:09:32 --> 00:09:34
Know how to hypnotize a hen?

244
00:09:34 --> 00:09:37
You press its head to the ground
and draw a straight line from the bill.

245
00:09:37 --> 00:09:39
We used to watch
my grandfather do that.

246
00:09:39 --> 00:09:42
One could also draw a circle.

247
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
Then the hen would run in a circle
until it became exhausted.

248
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
Ever seen
a caterpillar procession?

249
00:09:47 --> 00:09:50
There are thousands of caterpillars
creeping through the woods.

250
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
If you change the direction
of the first one so it follows the last, -

251
00:09:53 --> 00:09:56
- then they run in a circle
until they are exhausted.

252
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
That would be a new method
to kill insects.

253
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
Come here my dear...

254
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
What a stupid expression
hens have.

255
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
It could hypnotize one.

256
00:10:06 --> 00:10:08
Hen, who is hypnotizing
whom here?

257
00:10:08 --> 00:10:10
Watch now!

258
00:10:10 --> 00:10:13
Ready; set; go!

259
00:10:13 --> 00:10:15
Isn&#39;t that our king?

260
00:10:15 --> 00:10:18
Ah, you&#39;re still here!

261
00:10:18 --> 00:10:20
This is a friendly place here.

262
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
I&#39;d like to stay for a while.

263
00:10:23 --> 00:10:26
Have you found
any of your clan yet?

264
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
You see, I&#39;ve thought it over.

265
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
It could be that your clan
is also looking for you, -

266
00:10:31 --> 00:10:34
- and since you
are looking for them, -

267
00:10:34 --> 00:10:37
- you might be going
in circles -

268
00:10:37 --> 00:10:39
- and might never meet.

269
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
I don&#39;t run in circles;
others do.

270
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
Our people
always changes directions.

271
00:10:44 --> 00:10:47
That&#39;s crazy.

272
00:10:47 --> 00:10:50
I have a card trick to show you.

273
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
Is that a normal pack of cards?

274
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
Yes, it&#39;s legitimate.

275
00:10:55 --> 00:10:57
All nines.

276
00:10:57 --> 00:10:58
There must be a trick to it.

277
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
You must have a second pack
up your sleeve.

278
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
Oh, that&#39;s a fine collection.

279
00:11:03 --> 00:11:06
Here is something for you.

280
00:11:06 --> 00:11:09
That&#39;s a souvenir,
a little wooden owl.

281
00:11:09 --> 00:11:12
You can buy one in any shop.

282
00:11:12 --> 00:11:13
Look.

283
00:11:13 --> 00:11:16
The eyes and ears are moving.

284
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
Maybe hydro-pressure has something
to do with the movements.

285
00:11:19 --> 00:11:21
The tail moves too.

286
00:11:21 --> 00:11:24
Wait, it can be pulled out.

287
00:11:24 --> 00:11:27
Something is moving inside -
a fly.

288
00:11:27 --> 00:11:28
The poor things.

289
00:11:28 --> 00:11:29
There&#39;s another one.

290
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
Look how it crawls.

291
00:11:31 --> 00:11:32
It&#39;s half dead.

292
00:11:32 --> 00:11:35
It&#39;s terrible
to do such a thing.

293
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
He&#39;s gone.

294
00:11:38 --> 00:11:41
People here tell a story
about a submarine -

295
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
- that surfaced here
a few days ago.

296
00:11:44 --> 00:11:47
It happened towards evening.

297
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
Some of the crew came up on deck
to get some fresh air.

298
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
It was just sunset -

299
00:11:53 --> 00:11:56
- and they were so impressed
by the setting sun -

300
00:11:56 --> 00:11:59
- that they didn&#39;t notice
the enemy planes approaching.

301
00:11:59 --> 00:12:01
Well, some did notice them, -

302
00:12:01 --> 00:12:04
- and they were able to
escape through the hatch.

303
00:12:04 --> 00:12:07
They closed the hatch
and submerged.

304
00:12:07 --> 00:12:10
Three remained on deck
and were drowned.

305
00:12:10 --> 00:12:13
No, I&#39;m not uneasy.

306
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
What&#39;s bothering you then?

307
00:12:15 --> 00:12:18
What are you thinking about?

308
00:12:18 --> 00:12:21
Take off your shoes.

309
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
Come here quickly, Meinhard!

310
00:12:23 --> 00:12:25
Where is Stroszek?

311
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
He&#39;s in the house with Nora.

312
00:12:27 --> 00:12:30
I have copies of the texts
and even translations of them.

313
00:12:30 --> 00:12:33
Stroszek,
come here for a minute.

314
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
This is Achmed.

315
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
He says he&#39;s a Turk,

316
00:12:38 --> 00:12:39
and as a Turk would normally
pray 5 times a day.

317
00:12:39 --> 00:12:41
But he only prays
3 times a day now -

318
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
- because the children
scoff at him.

319
00:12:44 --> 00:12:47
He has a printed copy
of the inscription.

320
00:12:47 --> 00:12:48
About our stone too?

321
00:12:48 --> 00:12:49
About this one too;

322
00:12:49 --> 00:12:52
I can read it to you,
if you like.

323
00:12:52 --> 00:12:55
Don&#39;t mind if it is
only fragmentary.

324
00:12:55 --> 00:12:58
Much of it is omitted.

325
00:12:58 --> 00:13:00
&quot;...have shown reverence
to the gods, -

326
00:13:00 --> 00:13:03
- have offered thanks to the gods,
also the inhabitants of Cos...&quot;

327
00:13:03 --> 00:13:06
The text begins
right in the middle.

328
00:13:06 --> 00:13:08
It continues like this:

329
00:13:08 --> 00:13:11
&quot;...for the days are sure;
the merchants sigh no more, -

330
00:13:11 --> 00:13:14
- and the ports join
in the rejoicing:

331
00:13:14 --> 00:13:17
- For the seas are safe,
the pirates destroyed.

332
00:13:17 --> 00:13:19
All the robbers and their chief
have been hanged, -

333
00:13:19 --> 00:13:22
- even his dog has been hanged.&quot;

334
00:13:22 --> 00:13:25
I can&#39;t make much of that.

335
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
You&#39;ve got the wrong idea.

336
00:13:27 --> 00:13:29
The ancient Greeks
weren&#39;t like that.

337
00:13:29 --> 00:13:32
During the Olympic games,
they put stones between their knuckles -

338
00:13:32 --> 00:13:33
- and covered them
with leather straps.

339
00:13:33 --> 00:13:36
They smashed
their noses to pulp.

340
00:13:36 --> 00:13:39
How beautiful it is when
the worst of the heat is gone.

341
00:13:39 --> 00:13:41
Where is Becker?

342
00:13:41 --> 00:13:44
He&#39;s looking
for new inscriptions.

343
00:13:44 --> 00:13:46
Stop that nonsense.

344
00:13:46 --> 00:13:48
There aren&#39;t any fish there.

345
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
You just don&#39;t know!

346
00:13:51 --> 00:13:54
At full moon the whole sea
is full of them.

347
00:13:54 --> 00:13:57
They&#39;re only an inch or so long;
but there are shoals of them.

348
00:13:57 --> 00:14:00
The whole world
is full of vermin.

349
00:14:00 --> 00:14:03
What a mood you&#39;re in now.

350
00:14:03 --> 00:14:05
What&#39;s wrong?

351
00:14:05 --> 00:14:08
Is it my fault again?

352
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
Is it because of that cock?

353
00:14:10 --> 00:14:13
It wasn&#39;t my fault,
it was the children.

354
00:14:13 --> 00:14:16
Do you know what kangaroos
look like on Sunday?

355
00:14:16 --> 00:14:19
I can magnetize a knife.

356
00:14:19 --> 00:14:22
Watch, ladies and gentlemen.

357
00:14:22 --> 00:14:25
The greatest show on earth...

358
00:14:25 --> 00:14:28
The magnetic current has to flow
through the arm into the knife.

359
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
It should be a straight wall,
a smooth one.

360
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
There, now fold your arms.

361
00:14:34 --> 00:14:37
The one who holds out longest
is the winner.

362
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
On certain days Stroszek
became confused and apathetic.

363
00:14:40 --> 00:14:42
Now and then he undertook
something with haste,

364
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
only to give it up again.

365
00:14:44 --> 00:14:47
Nora acted prudently;
but he began -

366
00:14:47 --> 00:14:50
- to withdraw from her
and the others.

367
00:14:50 --> 00:14:53
Are you a tough one.

368
00:14:53 --> 00:14:56
But only because you&#39;re light.

369
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
It&#39;s no wonder.

370
00:14:59 --> 00:15:02
Now I&#39;m only against myself.

371
00:15:02 --> 00:15:05
One time Stroszek stretched a rope
and tried tight-rope walking.

372
00:15:05 --> 00:15:07
Meinhard ran for Nora
to stop him.

373
00:15:07 --> 00:15:09
But he was already on the rope
by the time she arrived.

374
00:15:09 --> 00:15:12
But she retained her composure,
and he didn&#39;t fall.

375
00:15:12 --> 00:15:13
What on earth are you doing?

376
00:15:13 --> 00:15:14
Lighting a cigarette.

377
00:15:14 --> 00:15:16
Are you mad?
We&#39;ll all explode!

378
00:15:16 --> 00:15:19
Oh, I see.

379
00:15:19 --> 00:15:22
Give me the ones
that are finished.

380
00:15:22 --> 00:15:25
I said the finished ones.

381
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
All of them.

382
00:15:28 --> 00:15:31
Now fill them with some powder.

383
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
More wool.

384
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
I didn&#39;t find any sawdust,
but it should work.

385
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
What a way to cut that.

386
00:15:37 --> 00:15:40
Like this you see.

387
00:15:40 --> 00:15:41
That&#39;s how it should be done.

388
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
Will that help?

389
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
I&#39;m sure that it&#39;ll work
like a rocket exploding.

390
00:15:45 --> 00:15:47
No, not in any case.

391
00:15:47 --> 00:15:48
I&#39;ll show you.

392
00:15:48 --> 00:15:51
If I fill the rocket with powder
and then wool -

393
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
- it won&#39;t explode all at once.

394
00:15:53 --> 00:15:56
It will go gradually,
understand?

395
00:15:56 --> 00:15:59
Before we proceed
we ought to try one out.

396
00:15:59 --> 00:16:01
How many do you have?

397
00:16:01 --> 00:16:02
About 8.

398
00:16:02 --> 00:16:03
Wait to set them off.

399
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
I&#39;ll get Nora.

400
00:16:06 --> 00:16:09
It was Stroszek&#39;s idea
to make the fireworks -

401
00:16:09 --> 00:16:12
- out of the powder taken
from the shells in the depot.

402
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
But the others
had to do the work -

403
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
- for Stroszek had again lapsed
into passivity.

404
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
Thank God that we have something
to keep us busy again.

405
00:16:20 --> 00:16:22
Now we can try one out.

406
00:16:22 --> 00:16:23
Give me one of those.

407
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
Where are you
going to set it off?

408
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
Over this shaft here.

409
00:16:27 --> 00:16:30
I just hold it like this, light it,
and it will work just fine.

410
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
That will blow
your hand to bits.

411
00:16:32 --> 00:16:35
No problem at all.

412
00:16:35 --> 00:16:38
Wouldn&#39;t it be better to attach
it to a piece of wood?

413
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
You&#39;re cowards!

414
00:16:40 --> 00:16:41
Out of the way there.

415
00:16:41 --> 00:16:44
I won&#39;t take any responsibility
for this.

416
00:16:44 --> 00:16:47
During the night, partisans
had secretly laid out a crown -

417
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
- of light stones
on the mountain.

418
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
It could be seen
from a distance.

419
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
It didn&#39;t signify
immediate danger, -

420
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
- but it did distinguish
friend and foe.

421
00:16:57 --> 00:17:00
Now that I can talk,
what shall I say?

422
00:17:00 --> 00:17:01
Come on in.

423
00:17:01 --> 00:17:03
I won&#39;t disturb you.

424
00:17:03 --> 00:17:06
Well, then -

425
00:17:06 --> 00:17:08
Where are you stationed?

426
00:17:08 --> 00:17:09
Here in the town.

427
00:17:09 --> 00:17:12
But there is nothing to do
in this place.

428
00:17:12 --> 00:17:13
I have no official duties.

429
00:17:13 --> 00:17:16
I can practice all day long.

430
00:17:16 --> 00:17:18
You&#39;re really lucky, aren&#39;t you?

431
00:17:18 --> 00:17:20
But sometimes I have to carry
heavy objects,

432
00:17:20 --> 00:17:22
and that ruins my hands.

433
00:17:22 --> 00:17:25
Then I have to start all over again
until my fingers loosen up again.

434
00:17:25 --> 00:17:28
I&#39;m actually running
after my fingers.

435
00:17:28 --> 00:17:31
I don&#39;t understand much about music,
but you do play well.

436
00:17:31 --> 00:17:33
That was Chopin.

437
00:17:33 --> 00:17:36
You may think that the music
is not fitting for this place.

438
00:17:36 --> 00:17:37
It&#39;s different -

439
00:17:37 --> 00:17:38
- malicious.

440
00:17:38 --> 00:17:41
Chopin himself was malicious;
he was unpredictable.

441
00:17:41 --> 00:17:44
The only thing
one could count on -

442
00:17:44 --> 00:17:47
- was him coughing blood.

443
00:17:47 --> 00:17:50
Don&#39;t you hear it in the music?

444
00:17:50 --> 00:17:51
What&#39;s the matter?

445
00:17:51 --> 00:17:53
Nothing, nothing at all.

446
00:17:53 --> 00:17:56
Come on and tell me about it.

447
00:17:56 --> 00:17:58
Is it anything special?

448
00:17:58 --> 00:18:01
No, nothing special.

449
00:18:01 --> 00:18:04
Then tell me what it is.

450
00:18:04 --> 00:18:06
Well...

451
00:18:06 --> 00:18:09
no, I do feel at home
in the fortress, -

452
00:18:09 --> 00:18:11
- and we get on well enough, -

453
00:18:11 --> 00:18:14
- but I feel closed in somehow,
the walls -

454
00:18:14 --> 00:18:17
- Yes, I see what you mean.

455
00:18:17 --> 00:18:20
You know that
we brought you here -

456
00:18:20 --> 00:18:23
- especially to give you
a chance to recuperate.

457
00:18:23 --> 00:18:26
Would you like to be sent
on patrol now and then?

458
00:18:26 --> 00:18:29
That would be nice.

459
00:18:29 --> 00:18:32
Look, I&#39;ll send you
to the southeast ridge tomorrow.

460
00:18:32 --> 00:18:33
That&#39;s not dangerous.

461
00:18:33 --> 00:18:36
But we have to show up there
again, anyway.

462
00:18:36 --> 00:18:39
It won&#39;t be too much
for his knee.

463
00:18:39 --> 00:18:42
I&#39;ll show you which route
to take on the map.

464
00:18:42 --> 00:18:45
First to the ridge,
then the plateau.

465
00:18:45 --> 00:18:48
You can be back
by the afternoon.

466
00:18:48 --> 00:18:51
Would you like to drink
some water?

467
00:18:51 --> 00:18:53
Wife, get some water for them!

468
00:18:53 --> 00:18:56
Drink as much as you like.

469
00:18:56 --> 00:18:59
You&#39;re dripping with sweat.

470
00:18:59 --> 00:19:02
Don&#39;t you want to rest?

471
00:19:02 --> 00:19:05
We don&#39;t have anything to eat.

472
00:19:05 --> 00:19:08
Sorry, there&#39;s no bread.

473
00:19:08 --> 00:19:11
You may have
some more water, though.

474
00:19:11 --> 00:19:13
The little one can hardly talk;

475
00:19:13 --> 00:19:16
her mother is out
with the sheep, -

476
00:19:16 --> 00:19:19
and I&#39;m gone most of the night.

477
00:19:19 --> 00:19:22
Now and then she goes into town
to visit her aunt Maria.

478
00:19:22 --> 00:19:25
There she learns
to talk a little.

479
00:19:25 --> 00:19:28
It&#39;s beautiful here;
there&#39;s water and fresh air.

480
00:19:28 --> 00:19:31
There are no children here
for her to talk to.

481
00:19:31 --> 00:19:33
She can hardly talk at all.

482
00:19:33 --> 00:19:37
Won&#39;t you say your song
for them?

483
00:19:37 --> 00:19:40
Go and say it.

484
00:19:40 --> 00:19:42
Say it?

485
00:19:42 --> 00:19:45
Say it from the beginning.

486
00:19:45 --> 00:19:48
High on the mountain,
lambs are grazing, -

487
00:19:48 --> 00:19:49
- grazing there in loneliness.

488
00:19:49 --> 00:19:51
One of them is lost.

489
00:19:51 --> 00:19:53
Run, shepherds, run!

490
00:19:53 --> 00:19:56
For over the mountains
are circling...

491
00:19:56 --> 00:19:59
- &quot;vultures.&quot;

492
00:19:59 --> 00:20:00
Drink that.
It&#39;s good in the heat.

493
00:20:00 --> 00:20:03
You know that I can&#39;t stand
this thin stuff.

494
00:20:03 --> 00:20:06
The medical officer wants to
examine us today at five o&#39;clock.

495
00:20:06 --> 00:20:09
What?

496
00:20:09 --> 00:20:11
Our next examination
wasn&#39;t scheduled for two weeks.

497
00:20:11 --> 00:20:12
Don&#39;t ask me why.

498
00:20:12 --> 00:20:15
They do as they please with us.

499
00:20:15 --> 00:20:18
Did you know that they are
thinking of sending you home?

500
00:20:18 --> 00:20:21
Why me?

501
00:20:21 --> 00:20:24
Because of yesterday
on the mountain.

502
00:20:24 --> 00:20:27
So, you squealed on me!

503
00:20:27 --> 00:20:30
Admit that you squealed on me,
you swine!

504
00:20:30 --> 00:20:33
Sit down, Stroszek,
and go on eating.

505
00:20:33 --> 00:20:34
Don&#39;t touch me.

506
00:20:34 --> 00:20:35
It&#39;s better like this.

507
00:20:35 --> 00:20:38
He and Nora saw the captain.

508
00:20:38 --> 00:20:39
Nora, out of the way!

509
00:20:39 --> 00:20:42
Get away, get out of here!

510
00:20:42 --> 00:20:43
I don&#39;t see anything.

511
00:20:43 --> 00:20:45
The shooting must be coming
from the houses.

512
00:20:45 --> 00:20:48
Stroszek has gone mad.

513
00:20:48 --> 00:20:50
He shot at us.

514
00:20:50 --> 00:20:51
It was just like the last time.

515
00:20:51 --> 00:20:53
He had another fit.

516
00:20:53 --> 00:20:54
Did you disarm him?

517
00:20:54 --> 00:20:56
It was impossible;
he had a gun.

518
00:20:56 --> 00:20:57
It&#39;s not partisans.

519
00:20:57 --> 00:21:00
One of our men on the fortress
has gone berserk.

520
00:21:00 --> 00:21:02
Stand by.

521
00:21:02 --> 00:21:05
No, we don&#39;t need
any road blocks.

522
00:21:05 --> 00:21:07
Alright,
send a platoon over here.

523
00:21:07 --> 00:21:09
We may even have to move the HQ.

524
00:21:09 --> 00:21:11
The entrance is exposed.

525
00:21:11 --> 00:21:14
Who would ever
have imagined this?

526
00:21:14 --> 00:21:17
Send out some sentries;
but don&#39;t alarm him.

527
00:21:17 --> 00:21:20
I think his wife can lure him
out in an hour or so.

528
00:21:20 --> 00:21:23
Away, go away.

529
00:21:23 --> 00:21:24
Come down from here.

530
00:21:24 --> 00:21:27
I promise nothing
will happen to you.

531
00:21:27 --> 00:21:30
I don&#39;t follow orders anymore.

532
00:21:30 --> 00:21:33
I&#39;ve taken up the cause of man.

533
00:21:33 --> 00:21:34
One has to keep something, -

534
00:21:34 --> 00:21:37
- plants.

535
00:21:37 --> 00:21:40
Their names:
Wheat, barley, poppies.

536
00:21:40 --> 00:21:43
Come down immediately, Stroszek.

537
00:21:43 --> 00:21:46
That&#39;s an official order.

538
00:21:46 --> 00:21:49
Go away you swine!

539
00:21:49 --> 00:21:52
I&#39;m going to blow up
the whole works.

540
00:21:52 --> 00:21:54
That was a mistake.

541
00:21:54 --> 00:21:57
We should have taken
stricter measures.

542
00:21:57 --> 00:22:00
Now he&#39;s worse and doesn&#39;t
expose himself at all.

543
00:22:00 --> 00:22:02
We can&#39;t get snipers
close enough -

544
00:22:02 --> 00:22:05
- because he might see them
and blow up the ammo.

545
00:22:05 --> 00:22:07
What do you think doctor:

546
00:22:07 --> 00:22:10
Is there a chance
he might return to normal?

547
00:22:10 --> 00:22:12
It&#39;s difficult to say.

548
00:22:12 --> 00:22:13
What you want is a prognosis, -

549
00:22:13 --> 00:22:16
- but with the information
I have,

550
00:22:16 --> 00:22:19
I can&#39;t even make a diagnosis.

551
00:22:19 --> 00:22:22
We don&#39;t know the extent
of his injury.

552
00:22:22 --> 00:22:25
We don&#39;t have
the hospital report.

553
00:22:25 --> 00:22:28
And we know nothing about his
background and circumstances -

554
00:22:28 --> 00:22:31
- which led
to his present state.

555
00:22:31 --> 00:22:34
Still, we can reckon that he
might come back to normal soon.

556
00:22:34 --> 00:22:37
Just like yesterday,
after his fit.

557
00:22:37 --> 00:22:40
But I wouldn&#39;t count
on a rapid remission.

558
00:22:40 --> 00:22:43
I would suggest that we listen
to what Stroszek has to say, -

559
00:22:43 --> 00:22:46
- and how he behaves and acts.

560
00:22:46 --> 00:22:49
Then we might be able to understand
what is really the matter with him.

561
00:22:49 --> 00:22:52
How should we act towards him?

562
00:22:52 --> 00:22:55
With extreme caution,
in any case.

563
00:22:55 --> 00:22:58
One must bear in mind
that a person in his state -

564
00:22:58 --> 00:22:59
- is capable
of almost anything, -

565
00:22:59 --> 00:23:01
- even of executing
complex actions.

566
00:23:01 --> 00:23:04
If you provoke him, he might
very well blow up the depot -

567
00:23:04 --> 00:23:06
- And from
the technical standpoint -

568
00:23:06 --> 00:23:07
- does he have
the technical capability?

569
00:23:07 --> 00:23:10
Yes.
I&#39;m afraid he does.

570
00:23:10 --> 00:23:13
If he is ready,
it could go up now.

571
00:23:13 --> 00:23:15
It only takes a few grenades.

572
00:23:15 --> 00:23:18
What could be
the force of the blast?

573
00:23:18 --> 00:23:21
I&#39;m not through with
my calculations.

574
00:23:21 --> 00:23:24
There are 5 or 6 tons of TNT, -

575
00:23:24 --> 00:23:26
- if all of
the hydro-mines detonate.

576
00:23:26 --> 00:23:28
The other ammo
is not so dangerous.

577
00:23:28 --> 00:23:31
But that is enough to endanger
whole sections of the town.

578
00:23:31 --> 00:23:35
The damage would be
so extensive -

579
00:23:35 --> 00:23:38
- as to endanger the surrounding
houses from falling debris.

580
00:23:38 --> 00:23:41
Then we have to evacuate
the other buildings.

581
00:23:41 --> 00:23:44
It&#39;s what I anticipated.

582
00:23:44 --> 00:23:47
Mr. Vassiliou, we have summoned you
as a civilian representative.

583
00:23:47 --> 00:23:50
I hope you understand
this measure.

584
00:23:50 --> 00:23:51
Do you understand me?

585
00:23:51 --> 00:23:52
Yes, of course.

586
00:23:52 --> 00:23:54
It&#39;s difficult to move people.

587
00:23:54 --> 00:23:57
There&#39;s no place to put them.

588
00:23:57 --> 00:24:00
The German&#39;s take up
too much space.

589
00:24:00 --> 00:24:03
He asks if anything
can be done to help.

590
00:24:03 --> 00:24:04
There&#39;s not much to eat, -

591
00:24:04 --> 00:24:07
- and the boats can&#39;t be unloaded
since they can&#39;t leave the harbor.

592
00:24:07 --> 00:24:10
The ships can&#39;t leave
the harbor anymore?

593
00:24:10 --> 00:24:13
There&#39;s not much we can do now.

594
00:24:13 --> 00:24:16
At least not before dusk.

595
00:24:16 --> 00:24:19
If he remains quiet,
we can wait for one more night.

596
00:24:19 --> 00:24:22
He&#39;ll return to normal soon,
maybe tomorrow.

597
00:24:22 --> 00:24:25
He has to sleep or at least
relax his attention.

598
00:24:25 --> 00:24:28
We can discuss
the evacuation separately.

599
00:24:28 --> 00:24:31
The people in question will probably
have to leave their goods behind, -

600
00:24:31 --> 00:24:34
- in order to facilitate it.

601
00:24:34 --> 00:24:36
Stroszek repeatedly threatened
to blow the ammo -

602
00:24:36 --> 00:24:39
- as soon as anyone came close.

603
00:24:39 --> 00:24:41
He said he would blow up
the whole place, -

604
00:24:41 --> 00:24:43
- and make the earth shake.

605
00:24:43 --> 00:24:46
Then people would see what was
at the bottom of everything.

606
00:24:46 --> 00:24:49
He wanted to make
this revelation.

607
00:24:49 --> 00:24:52
After this, the evacuation
measures were accelerated.

608
00:24:52 --> 00:24:54
Don&#39;t be sad.

609
00:24:54 --> 00:24:57
If you are sad, we are too.

610
00:24:57 --> 00:25:00
I haven&#39;t seen my kids
for 10 years.

611
00:25:00 --> 00:25:03
I work every day,
and it is not easy.

612
00:25:03 --> 00:25:05
That&#39;s life for you.

613
00:25:05 --> 00:25:08
Much happens
in the course of life.

614
00:25:08 --> 00:25:11
Come to us when you are down.

615
00:25:11 --> 00:25:14
We can sit and talk.

616
00:25:14 --> 00:25:17
Stroszek didn&#39;t expose himself
and held the fortress against everyone.

617
00:25:17 --> 00:25:19
He was almost invulnerable.

618
00:25:19 --> 00:25:21
He challenged friend and foe
to battle, -

619
00:25:21 --> 00:25:23
- but no one accepted
his challenge.

620
00:25:23 --> 00:25:26
He declared war on everyone
in a furious protest.

621
00:25:26 --> 00:25:29
He even rebelled against
the orbit of the sun at dawn.

622
00:25:29 --> 00:25:32
He screamed that one could only
encounter light with light.

623
00:25:32 --> 00:25:33
Did everything go alright?

624
00:25:33 --> 00:25:35
There weren&#39;t any incidents at all.

625
00:25:35 --> 00:25:37
Such an action
is always unpopular.

626
00:25:37 --> 00:25:38
What is Stroszek doing now?

627
00:25:38 --> 00:25:41
Take the rest of the guns
and files along too.

628
00:25:41 --> 00:25:42
He&#39;s been restless.

629
00:25:42 --> 00:25:43
Maybe he fears an attack.

630
00:25:43 --> 00:25:46
He&#39;s still threatening
to blow the place up.

631
00:25:46 --> 00:25:49
Look at this rag here.

632
00:25:49 --> 00:25:52
Exactly like this here, a rag...

633
00:25:52 --> 00:25:55
What is that?

634
00:25:55 --> 00:25:57
He failed to set the sun on fire, -

635
00:25:57 --> 00:26:00
- just as the town at which he
aimed his rockets remained unscathed.

636
00:26:00 --> 00:26:03
He only managed to kill a donkey
the day before.

637
00:26:03 --> 00:26:06
Now he had to be content
with a scorched chair.

638
00:26:06 --> 00:26:08
Since no one accepted
his challenge,

639
00:26:08 --> 00:26:10
Stroszek began to insult
the town.

640
00:26:10 --> 00:26:12
A town
of immaculate virginity, -

641
00:26:12 --> 00:26:15
- just waiting for someone
to bombard it.

642
00:26:15 --> 00:26:18
That&#39;s what every town
waits for.

643
00:26:18 --> 00:26:21
It was her fault that things
turned out unsatisfactory.

644
00:26:21 --> 00:26:23
We won&#39;t shoot at him.

645
00:26:23 --> 00:26:26
The danger of him setting fire
to the ammo would be too great.

646
00:26:26 --> 00:26:29
The best chance to catch him is
while he&#39;s setting off the rockets.

647
00:26:29 --> 00:26:32
He said that he was going to
set off some more soon.

648
00:26:32 --> 00:26:34
Yes, he still has many of the...

649
00:26:34 --> 00:26:35
how do you say...?

650
00:26:35 --> 00:26:36
You mean rockets?

651
00:26:36 --> 00:26:37
Fireworks?

652
00:26:37 --> 00:26:38
Yes, rockets.

653
00:26:38 --> 00:26:41
He surely has a lot left,
because we made many of them.

654
00:26:41 --> 00:26:44
If he does set off some more -

655
00:26:44 --> 00:26:47
- we could certainly
overpower him, -

656
00:26:47 --> 00:26:50
- for he sets off the rockets
near the battlement.

657
00:26:50 --> 00:26:53
And that&#39;s far-removed
from the ammo.

658
00:26:53 --> 00:26:55
He&#39;ll be so busy
with the rockets -

659
00:26:55 --> 00:26:58
- that my men can scale the wall
at various points simultaneously, -

660
00:26:58 --> 00:27:01
- particularly at dark.

661
00:27:01 --> 00:27:04
Take up your positions at 6 o&#39;clock
when you are given the sign.

662
00:27:04 --> 00:27:07
But wait to act at the moment -

663
00:27:07 --> 00:27:09
- when the first rocket goes up.

664
00:27:09 --> 00:27:12
There&#39;ll be
more fireworks today.

665
00:27:12 --> 00:27:15
Men, the most important thing -

666
00:27:15 --> 00:27:17
- is to scale
the wall quickly, -

667
00:27:17 --> 00:27:20
- and at all three points.

668
00:27:20 --> 00:27:23
You will receive equipment for it, -

669
00:27:23 --> 00:27:26
- ropes, ladders, hooks,
and teargas.

670
00:27:26 --> 00:27:29
Stroszek cried that they could
do nothing to him, no one could, -

671
00:27:29 --> 00:27:31
- for he had now found
his calling.

672
00:27:31 --> 00:27:34
At 10 years of age, he was already
catching trout with his bare hands -

673
00:27:34 --> 00:27:37
- when the other boys
were still wetting their pants.

674
00:27:37 --> 00:27:40
During the night when Stroszek
again started another firework display, -

675
00:27:40 --> 00:27:42
- he was overpowered
by his own men.

676
00:27:42 --> 00:27:45
He didn&#39;t make it to the depot,
for he was already surrounded.

677
00:27:45 --> 00:27:48
In his rebellion he had
undertaken something titanic -

678
00:27:48 --> 00:27:50
- for the enemy
was far superior.

679
00:27:50 --> 00:27:53
Thus he had failed as miserably
as all others of his kind.

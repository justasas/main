1
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,880
Whole thing was an accident.

2
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,080
Nobody's going to find out.

3
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,920
You'll make sure,they'll only dig so far?

4
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,400
This ground is soft,there's something else.

5
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,240
- There's another body.- I have nothing new to tell you.

6
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,640
We didn't have a body back then.

7
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,640
With a blanket, this is a directlink to someone from your house.

8
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,480
I saw you, tear out something fromhis body.

9
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:13,200
Could be of some use,might even point to who did it.

10
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,680
Take this.

11
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,560
It's a proud moment, when a manreceives his first ever wage.

12
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,240
No matter how he comes by it.

13
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,520
The world is full of men likeRory McCleod.

14
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,800
It's the ones that love you, evenwhen you give them reason not to.

15
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,360
That's a real man.

16
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,960
That's your Davey.

17
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,400
John and Isabella were together?Is that what you're telling me?

18
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,160
- It's you that I care about.- Then aren't I lucky to have you?

19
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,560
- You can't go on the run.- Annie, I have to.

20
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,760
Coates. He won't let this lie.

21
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,880
Perhaps Coates understands exactlythe type of man you are.

22
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,400
A liar, a cheat. Is it unreasonableto assume a murderer too?

23
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,800
Mam?

24
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,760
Mam?

25
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Yes, love?

26
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,160
What's gonna happen to Johnny?

27
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,520
I don't know.

28
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,800
But it were my fault.

29
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,200
I can't let him take t'blame for it.

30
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,080
We'll sort it.

31
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,120
Now try and get some sleep.

32
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,880
I need to own up, Mam.

33
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,800
- I better tell them that it were me.- No, you don't.

34
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,440
You get that idea out of your headright now. And keep your voice down.

35
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,480
How the heck are you gonna sort it?

36
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
What's happening?

37
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Nothing, love.

38
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
You go back to sleep.

39
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,720
Your brother's dreaming, is all.

40
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,280
I was only saying.

41
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,520
You've been "only saying" allmorning.

42
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,360
Just give it a rest, will you?

43
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,120
Mark my words, the law takes on adifferent meaning when you're a gentleman.

44
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,000
We'll see no justice here.

45
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,960
Red was murdered in cold blood andthrown in the ground like an animal.

46
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,000
Now his body's sitting thererotting,

47
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,720
while Johnny Blackwoodkisses the backsides of his cronies.

48
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,280
Look, everybody says Red wereresponsible for the explosion.

49
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,320
It seems to me he were an animal!

50
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,360
There's no proof Johnny did owt.

51
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,240
But if he did, I reckonhe was doing us all a favour.

52
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,040
You two have always been specialfriends, haven't you?

53
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
Hey, hey. Leave it! Leave it!

54
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,760
Leave it!

55
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,520
Get back to work, you two.

56
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,560
And no more trouble.

57
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,000
Forgive me for intruding,Mr Blackwood.

58
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,240
But with you being his brother,you'll know he's not to blame.

59
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,360
I can't help you, Mrs Quaintain.Coates is dealing with the matter.

60
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,920
He must take my brother before themagistrate, same as any man.

61
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,880
But you have sway, sir...

62
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
...influence.

63
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
And I know you're a good man.

64
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,040
The way you took my daughter in,saved her life.

65
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,960
You know Johnny could never hurtanyone.

66
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,480
Justice is blind to family loyalty.

67
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,120
I can't get involved.

68
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,720
So you're happy to entrust his lifeto another?

69
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,880
And you're sure Mr Coates is theright man?

70
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,880
I'm sorry, Mrs Quaintain.

71
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,480
You can't just abandon him!

72
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,040
Your food, Mr Blackwood.

73
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,800
I trust you slept well.

74
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,800
I need to see my brother.

75
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,840
I need to talk to him.

76
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,160
No, it's best you stay right herefor now.

77
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,720
Red has friends on the gangand there've been rumblings.

78
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,360
I've sent for the magistrate,but until then,

79
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,000
you're safer under lock and key.

80
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,280
And whatever's happened between us,sir,

81
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,960
I'll see that you're dealt withfairly.

82
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,360
Mr Coates?

83
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,040
The workers are not happy, sir.They want answers.

84
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,840
As do we all.

85
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,040
We need to get t'magistrate downhere quick time to avoid trouble.

86
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,120
It's a day's ride into town. I ain'tleaving that prisoner with no protection.

87
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,360
And I ain't taking him with me,neither.

88
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,680
You yourself know, anything canhappen up on those moors.

89
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,960
No, we stay right here until thingsquieten down.

90
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
This is our town.

91
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,160
Our turf, and Red was one of our own,not some gent dressed up in navvy's clothes.

92
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,280
Johnny needs to pay for what he didto him.

93
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

94
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,760
I can assure you, justice will beserved. You have my word.

95
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,880
What's your promise count for in a room fullof gentlemen who think we're nowt but scum?

96
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,640
You run this town. Do something!

97
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,680
- All right.- Do it now before we do.

98
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,720
Let's talk about it.

99
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,080
See if maybe we can come to asolution between ourselves.

100
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,000
Capstick's.

101
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,240
- Joe?- Yeah?

102
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,280
A barrel of ale if you will.

103
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,320
- A barrel?- That's right.

104
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,320
If you please.

105
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,600
We've got important matters todiscuss.

106
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
I'll roll one out.

107
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,560
What are you doing? What is it?

108
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,600
Davey, please, I need to see him.

109
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,000
It ain't safe here.

110
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,120
Imagine it were Alma,begging to see you.

111
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
I have to talk to him.

112
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,280
All right.

113
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,400
But if Mr Coates catches you,or me, for that matter...

114
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,760
Thank you.

115
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,280
Annie.

116
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,280
Annie.

117
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,040
What are we gonna do?

118
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,080
I'm helpless, trapped in here.

119
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,160
I'll think of something.

120
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
In the meantime, we keep quiet.

121
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,360
We give them nothing.

122
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,960
Maybe Charles will see sense.

123
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,080
No, we're on our own,he won't help us.

124
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,320
I went to him, asked him to help.

125
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,560
He straight out refused,won't use his position, anything.

126
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,600
No, listen to me,it'll be all right.

127
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,760
I'll do everything I canto get Coates off your back,

128
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,200
clear your name,I don't know how but I will.

129
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,840
Annie, be careful.

130
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Coates is gunning for me.

131
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,920
He'll stop at nothing to be rid ofme.

132
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,280
Then let him do his worst.

133
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,880
He's got nothing on you,no evidence.

134
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,640
You didn't kill Red.

135
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,440
Drink up, gentlemen.

136
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,880
If you'll excuse me a moment,I've got business to attend to.

137
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,880
What's Coates playing at,filling their bellies with ale?

138
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Surely it'll inflame things?

139
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,600
I don't know, but it's the fastestgrasp of silver we've had in a while.

140
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,600
Mr Quaintain?

141
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,840
Whoa, whoa.

142
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,480
It's all right.

143
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,240
This trouble's got us all on edge.

144
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,440
Yes, sir.

145
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Your mother too, huh?

146
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,600
Especially since your pa's goneand Johnny's locked up.

147
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,240
- She's scared, sir.- Well, it's an upsetting business.

148
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,320
It must be tough on you,living in that house.

149
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,400
You know, uh...

150
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,720
sometimes a man needs another man'scounsel.

151
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,760
Come and take a walk with me.

152
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,960
Sometimes you just need to share theweight.

153
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,800
You know?

154
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,720
Take another man's view on theworld.

155
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,960
I guess you had Johnny until now.

156
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,640
You were beginning to trust him...

157
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,800
...seek his advice.

158
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,520
I do listen to him.

159
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,560
And me mam.

160
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,720
Just happen they're not always right.

161
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,680
I mean... how can I let another mantake on something that's my doing?

162
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,840
George, what's on your mind?

163
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,720
I promised me mam that I'd take it tot'grave.

164
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,920
I feel so ashamed.

165
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,920
I can't stop thinking about it.

166
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,000
It's there every day when I wake up.

167
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,800
He had nowt to do with it.

168
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
It had nothing to do with Johnny.

169
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,920
He were just trying to help.

170
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,640
I didn't mean him no harm.

171
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,600
I wanted to get away from him.

172
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,160
Are you telling me...

173
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,160
...that Red's death was down to you?

174
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,640
Johnny tried to cover it up.

175
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,800
I can't let him pay for it, I can't.

176
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,440
I'm scared.

177
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840
Come here, son. Aww.

178
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,600
We can handle this between us.

179
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,960
You mustn't say a thing about this.

180
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,040
Not another word about it toanybody.

181
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,800
Aye, of course.

182
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,360
Now we're for it.

183
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,920
These lot won't rest until they'velynched him.

184
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,960
Aye, I think you're right.

185
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,720
Coates has made fools of us all.

186
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,000
Thinking he can quieten us downwith a bellyful of ale?

187
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,440
It's time Johnny Blackwoodlearnt the meaning of justice.

188
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,000
Open the door, Davey!

189
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,160
Look, I can't do that.Calm down, Shay.

190
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,880
Get out of me way!

191
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,000
Blackwood!

192
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,040
Come on out to me, Blackwood!

193
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,880
Let me out, Davey!

194
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,920
- Come out here!- Get back, Shay.

195
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,160
Come on, get back!Everybody, get back!

196
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,800
Calm down.

197
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,720
Calm down! Get back!

198
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,360
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

199
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,840
Gentlemen!

200
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,880
Everybody, calm down!

201
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,920
I know you all want actions.

202
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,560
But let's go back to the tavern.

203
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:24,560
And you can give voice to yourconcerns there in a civilised way.

204
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,840
What, while he's hiding in there?

205
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,560
- Give me the keys.- What about the magistrate?

206
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,600
There's no time.

207
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,840
Get back.

208
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,880
I've nothing to hide!

209
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,280
If each of you has a voice, it's onlyright that Johnny Blackwood has one too.

210
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,240
I hope you have a good story workedout.

211
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,120
Get him out of there! Come on!

212
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,160
Get him out of there!

213
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,040
- Where's George?- I'm not sure.

214
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,080
I need to find him.

215
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,480
I don't want you wanderingabout alone out there.

216
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,840
Mam, what is going on?

217
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,480
Hello, love. I'm just aftera quick word with your mam.

218
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,520
Come in.

219
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,960
I thought you might need a friendwith all that's going on.

220
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,200
You two, wait out there.

221
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,840
But don't think about stepping offthat porch.

222
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,280
Can I count on you,Polly, as a friend?

223
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,240
In the truest sense of the word?

224
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,280
I need you to do something for me.

225
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,920
Without asking questions.

226
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,840
We all know that Johnny and Redcame to blows once.

227
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,880
Navvies are always scrapping.

228
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,520
And it's a fact that Red's body wasfound in Annie Quaintain's blanket.

229
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:58,080
Now, Annie Quaintain is not strongenough to kill a man of Red's stature.

230
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,320
But Johnny Blackwood was living in her hutand could have easily taken that blanket.

231
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,000
Mr Coates, it's a bunkhouse!

232
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,160
Any number of fellascould have snatched that blanket.

233
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
What I know that you don't know,

234
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,240
is that Mr Blackwood was determinedto exhume those bodies by himself.

235
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,600
That's not true.You're a liar, Mr Coates.

236
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,800
It's not a job that any man wouldrelish,

237
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,680
unless he had something to hide,perhaps.

238
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,160
How about we cut his throat andsling him in the same dirty hole?

239
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,080
- Quiet, please.- You don't know what you're talking about.

240
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,440
Quieten down!

241
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,080
He went missing just after Red wasdug up!

242
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,200
You don't know what you're talkingabout!

243
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,120
He was trying to flee! And, look,he's lied to us from the start!

244
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,840
What posh gent would want to livedown here unless he was hiding summat?

245
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,880
What's he got to hide?

246
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,520
Quiet, please!

247
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,040
This is not gonna work if we allspeak at once.

248
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,560
Now, if you want to say yourpiece...

249
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,240
Give me this. Bring this on out.

250
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,160
If you've got something to say...

251
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,080
you stand on this.

252
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,560
If you ain't standing right there,then you ain't got the right to talk.

253
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,440
- Agreed?- Aye.

254
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,240
The whole town's turning out.

255
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,240
Mam, why have you changed yourdress?

256
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,080
- That's your mourning gown, in't it?- Yes, it is.

257
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,800
Reckon it'll do no harm to remind them we'vehad enough heartache for one lifetime.

258
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,920
Right, Martha, you're to accompanyyour mam.

259
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,800
George, me and you are gonna keep aneye on that stew pot.

260
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,840
Why can't George come?

261
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,560
It's no place for young eyes norears.

262
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,080
Aye, all right.

263
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,560
You look after your mam.

264
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
So what if Johnny fought with Red?

265
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,880
It don't make him guilty of murder.

266
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,080
Oh, oh, Dagger! Happen you're in on it,mate, you're always trying to protect him.

267
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,880
All navvies fight from time to time!

268
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,960
Me too!

269
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,720
And you... you... and you.

270
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,120
And no one's accusing us of killingRed.

271
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,520
You've got nothing on him.

272
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,080
Well said, Dagger!You can't prove anything!

273
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,600
Quiet, quiet.

274
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,640
Who's next to step up and speak?

275
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,520
I reckon I've got summat totell you.

276
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,840
I were taking a walk late the othernight.

277
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:05,640
I stopped for a breather,a short moment to myself.

278
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,680
Were you on your own?

279
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,880
And I overheard Annie and Johnnytalking.

280
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,800
At first, I thought theywere having a private moment.

281
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,840
I mean, Annie's got two kids.

282
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,800
It can't be easy for sweethearts,even at their age.

283
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,400
They were whispering secrets...

284
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,960
about something terrible that hadhappened.

285
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,600
And you could see it by the look ontheir faces.

286
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,400
What did I tell you? He's guilty!

287
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,160
Quieten down, everybody!

288
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,120
Let the girl speak!

289
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,480
What's she playing at?She don't know nothing about it!

290
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,720
Don't bet on it. Where there'strouble, Alma'll find it.

291
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,760
- You're right there, Joe.- Aye.

292
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,640
All I ever hear talk of is yourmam's cooking.

293
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,440
What's the big secret,then, eh, George?

294
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,360
Secret? What do you mean?

295
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,840
The ingredient.

296
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,080
Oh, erm... dunno. Salt?

297
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,160
Too busy with your books to worryabout owt like cooking, aren't you?

298
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,880
Then how come you've not turneda single page since I got here?

299
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,560
Have you ever played faro?

300
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,040
Eh?

301
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,880
Johnny and Red were avowed enemies!

302
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,400
What happened was more than scrapping. Jackhad to break them apart and warn Red off.

303
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,920
Sadly, Jack is not here to speak forhimself.

304
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,200
Hatty...

305
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,960
...is there something you can help uswith?

306
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,400
No.

307
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,880
But your husband might have saidsomething.

308
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:05,520
No one's opinion was more trustedthan Jack's.

309
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,280
It would mean a lot to us all if weknew how he felt about the matter.

310
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,680
Speak up, lass.

311
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,920
Jack did tell me about a fightbetween Johnny and Red.

312
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,160
Aye, every man saw it.She doesn't need to account for it.

313
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,200
No, not the fight at the viaduct.

314
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,160
They fought another time as well.

315
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,960
It was down at the river,it ended with Red pulling a knife.

316
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Jack had no option but to fire him.

317
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,800
Red vowed to pay Johnny out.

318
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,920
Well, happen Johnny got there first!

319
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,520
No, I'm not saying there was any kind ofvendetta between them, I'm not saying that.

320
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:03,560
I can't deny there were bad blood.

321
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,280
Jack did the right thing banishingRed.

322
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,160
And Red paid him out with thatexplosion.

323
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,320
I say Red Killeen got what hedeserved!

324
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,200
Dead and buried in an unmarkedgrave! I'm glad of it!

325
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,640
Me mam don't let us play cards int'house.

326
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,080
Me and me dad used to but shestopped us.

327
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,120
Oh, yeah? Why's that, then?

328
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,520
She said it were a game for cheatsand drunks.

329
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,720
Hey, your bet were on t'other cardbefore.

330
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,160
Happen your mam was right.

331
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,160
You're getting there. It only took tworounds before you noticed this time.

332
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,640
How long do you reckon they're gonnabe?

333
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,800
You're fond of Johnny, then?

334
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,080
Well, aye.

335
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,200
Then there's Johnny's feud with hisbrother.

336
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,080
And the reason he hid his name.

337
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:19,560
Who's to say that Johnnydidn't cause that explosion...

338
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,520
...trying to sabotage his brother'sbusiness?

339
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,320
Is this the fair hearing that youpromised me?

340
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,040
You set me up from the start.

341
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,280
What more do we need to hear?

342
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,200
Johnny had cause. He has a history ofviolence, he's got a history of lying.

343
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,560
So what are we gonna do with theguilty man?

344
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,400
We've no prison.

345
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,480
We banish him across our borders,he walks away a free man.

346
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,120
Call for the magistrate!

347
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,160
As far as I can see...

348
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,440
...there is only one solution.

349
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,200
Take that, you dirty scum!

350
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,080
Leave him alone! Don't touch him!

351
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:07,320
Everybody, step back!

352
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,720
Mr Coates, sir.

353
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,760
- What about the tin?- What's that?

354
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,800
The one you took from Red's corpse.

355
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,440
You said it was evidence.

356
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,480
Evidence that's not gonna help him.

357
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,600
That tin had money in and it ended up inyour pocket. I heard how you spent it.

358
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,040
It was a pretty girl, huh?

359
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,480
Don't let anything happen to him.

360
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:40,080
I need to go to the Blackwood house,Mr Blackwood needs to know what's happening.

361
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,440
I'm begging you,don't let them touch him.

362
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,100
Come on!

363
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,460
You have to come, Mr Blackwood!

364
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,500
It's John, he's in bad trouble.

365
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,500
The shanty folk are taking justiceinto their own hands.

366
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:19,340
At least, they're about to.what about the magistrate?

367
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,140
Mr Coates, he didn't send for him!

368
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:25,460
Some of the men are talking vengeanceand demanding that Johnny pay in kind.

369
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,700
I think they might hang him.

370
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:30,740
Oh, Lord, have mercy.

371
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,460
Got you.

372
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:00,340
You need to do it with moreconfidence.

373
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,380
I could see your hand shaking.

374
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:09,220
I've got my work cut out with you.

375
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,060
What's going on?

376
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,460
Your mam told me to tell you to gowith Polly.

377
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,500
Says it's important.

378
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:31,740
You've all heard about the violentaltercation between Johnny and Red.

379
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,780
He hasn't denied it, to his credit.

380
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,500
But what about his movementsaround the time Red was murdered?

381
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,660
Annie Quaintain?

382
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:46,020
You're best placed to help us withthat.

383
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,660
Hold on tight, George.

384
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,740
You ever driven an horse before?

385
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,540
We're going too fast!

386
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,620
By heck!

387
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,140
George, love, what are you doing?

388
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,180
Sit down before you fall down!

389
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,860
I need to get off.

390
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,460
Whoa!

391
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,380
Whoa, Bessie!

392
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:43,420
I need to go back there!

393
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:46,300
George, love, what's the matter allof a sudden?

394
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:47,860
George!

395
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,180
You're quite fond of Johnny,Miss Quaintain?

396
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:58,540
I don't see how my opinion on himhas any bearing here, Mr Coates.

397
00:49:59,420 --> 00:50:01,700
The two of you are close,we all know that.

398
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,980
He's a good man.

399
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:09,020
Are you two close enough to conceala crime, perhaps?

400
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,700
He's no crime to conceal.

401
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:15,740
Of course he has! She knows morethan she's letting on!

402
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,140
And you have no idea who took thatblanket?

403
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,100
No.

404
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:36,900
There wasn't one fella in particular whocomplained about being cold that night?

405
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,860
Hey, that's enough! Leave her be!

406
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,180
Cheap jibes won't get you any closerto the truth, Mr Coates.

407
00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:45,780
You and Johnny are close.

408
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:48,820
Is that why I can't see a weddingring on your finger?

409
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,620
Or is it because you and the manwho stands here are lovers?

410
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:58,500
Do you two share a lovers' secret,

411
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:01,220
a secret that you would do anythingto conceal?

412
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,580
Tell the truth, woman!

413
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,900
You're right, Mr Coates!

414
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,940
We do have a secret.

415
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:20,260
Johnny and I are lovers.

416
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,500
Oh, now we're gettingsomewhere!

417
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:25,660
See, ladies and gentlemen,what I've been telling you?

418
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:28,540
And we were together... alone...

419
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,860
the night that Red Killeen wasmurdered.

420
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:34,380
That's how I know he has no crime toconceal.

421
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:38,740
So, no, I don't wear my wedding ringany more. I don't even know where it is!

422
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:42,500
So you want us to believethat you were in a deep clinch,

423
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,540
a passionate embrace with this man,

424
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:48,140
the moment that Red Killeenwas being murdered?

425
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:50,180
Yes, I do, because it's true!

426
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:54,020
You want us to believe that whileyou stand here in your mourning clothes?

427
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:56,060
Who are you, Annie? Huh?

428
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,700
The grieving widow who's strugglingto protect her children,

429
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,220
or a woman who just throwsher wedding ring away

430
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:05,940
so that she canlay with a handsome young navvy,

431
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:09,260
just moments after the tragic deathof two of his friends?

432
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,580
Mr Coates! Mr Coates!

433
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:42,100
I reckon I can tell yout'whereabouts of that wedding ring.

434
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:46,260
She sold it me...in return for taking her to Settle.

435
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,980
She were going after her boy.

436
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,020
He'd run away.

437
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:51,980
It's in a shop there.

438
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,740
I pawned it.

439
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:55,780
Why was her lad running away?

440
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:59,620
Happen he knows summat.George Quaintain, where is he?

441
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,660
No, no!

442
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:04,500
No, you don't need the boy.You don't need George.

443
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:07,060
You can't put a boy on the stand,it ain't fair.

444
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,060
Oh, look who's turned up to save theday!

445
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:15,500
Just in time, Mr Blackwood, just intime to witness Jericho justice.

446
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:19,220
You can't create a monsterand then expect it not to roar!

447
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,980
You're to tell me how you did it,exactly.

448
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,300
They're like a pack of animals.

449
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:47,140
Mam is taking a hiding in there, soyou're to tell me so I can help her.

450
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,780
And you.

451
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:51,060
George!

452
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,100
I just wanted to get away from him.

453
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:55,140
He had me trapped on t'scaffold.

454
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,340
I took this tanner's knife...

455
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:01,380
just to protect myself with.

456
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,020
To scare him off.

457
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,060
I didn't mean to cut him.

458
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:10,940
You're to go home.Go home and stay there.

459
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:12,460
No... Johnny.

460
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,220
He'll get blamed for it, they'llhang him. It's my doing.

461
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,460
It's all right.Trust me, I know what to do.

462
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,500
Please just go.

463
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,120
Hey!

464
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,160
You've got to do something!

465
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,840
I'm not sure I can. They're not gonna let mejust walk Johnny out of here. There'll be a riot!

466
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,600
I've something to say.

467
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,354
Johnny Blackwood is guilty,I know so.

468
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,760
Johnny killed Red.

469
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,920
There were a fight between him andJohnny up on t'scaffold.

470
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,840
Johnny cut Red with a tanner's blade.

471
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,760
There was a weapon buried next tothe body.

472
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,800
A tanner's blade.

473
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:20,760
- She's right!- A tanner's blade! What do you say to that?

474
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,880
- George.- Where is he?

475
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,360
George!

476
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,160
George.

477
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,840
- Get that boy down!- Martha is lying.

478
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:35,760
Get down, George!

479
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,080
She's just trying to protectme!

480
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,760
Johnny Blackwood's innocent.

481
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,000
I killed Red Killeen.

482
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,920
Let the boy speak!

483
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,800
Look, I had no intention of hurtinghim!

484
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,840
No reason to!

485
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,880
But he chased me up t'scaffold.

486
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,520
I grabbed t'tanner's bladeto protect meself with, that's all.

487
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:06,040
I nicked him once on t'neckwhen I were trying to fight him off.

488
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,800
Then... he fell back off t'scaffold.

489
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,840
It were him or me.

490
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,040
Look, Johnny did nothing wrong.

491
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,280
He were just trying to help me andme mam.

492
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,320
But it were wrong.

493
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:21,560
Wrong of me to let him.

494
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,760
Wrong of me not to own up.

495
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:28,920
Cos when a man's at fault,he should face t'consequences.

496
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,680
Why was Red so set on killing you?

497
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,920
What had passed between you?

498
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,080
I knew what he'd done.

499
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,440
I saw him stealing from t'explosiveshut.

500
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,040
Red caused the explosion.

501
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,800
He killed Skinny and Jack.

502
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:59,400
Calm down, everybody.

503
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,760
Quieten down.

504
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,640
I think it's time to release me.

505
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,360
- Annie, bring the boy up.- No...

506
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,120
He's confessed like a man,let him face the consequences.

507
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,160
George is just a boy!

508
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:34,760
George Quaintain has...bravely admitted the killing of Red.

509
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,800
It were an accident!

510
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,440
Now it's up to us to decide hisfate.

511
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,840
You can't do owt to him, Mr Coates.

512
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,920
Let the boy be, Mr Coates.

513
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,960
What say you, Mr Blackwood?

514
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,160
Surely he was doing all he couldto save himself.

515
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,640
- Aye.- He was that.

516
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,080
It'll be my recommendation to the magistratethat Red Killeen's death was accidental.

517
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:32,320
Red Killeen murdered one of ours.

518
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,080
And he's not here today to talkabout that.

519
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,560
But some might say that today,justice was done.

520
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,640
We'll shake on it, Mr Coates.

521
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,440
Come on, son.

522
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,520
You kept your cards close to yourchest.

523
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,160
I am so proud of you, Davey Sharpe.

524
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,200
You were summat else today.

525
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:43,800
What were you doing out walking solate to overhear what you did?

526
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,240
Like I said, I were taking a momentfor meself.

527
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,960
I couldn't sleep.

528
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,800
I were thinking of you.

529
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,760
It's as though this trouble...

530
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,600
all this hurt caused for George,Johnny, Annie...

531
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,120
...all started with lies.

532
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,360
Folk being afraid of telling thetruth.

533
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,800
- I don't want to live like that.- You won't have to.

534
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,360
Not if you're with me.Not once we're married.

535
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,320
Let's set a date, Davey.

536
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,880
Make me an honest woman.

537
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,440
Charles, wait.

538
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,880
Words can't express our relief,John.

539
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,680
Will you not stay for a drink?

540
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,840
Toast my freedom and George's.

541
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,880
I don't think so.

542
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,920
Home, Easter, if you please.

543
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,960
Oh, come on, Charles, why not?

544
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:03,040
There's been more than one secretunearthed here in the past two days.

545
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,400
I know what happened between you.

546
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,840
Oh, Charles, I...

547
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,320
It was a long time ago.

548
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,320
I'm so sorry.

549
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,600
Drive on.

550
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,760
Aye, you best run like a rat.

551
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,160
You've got no place here.

552
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,560
You'll be seeing me again,Dagger Wilkins.

553
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,000
I ain't finished here.

554
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:51,400
Why didn't you tell me what had happenedinstead of lying to me all this time?

555
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,920
- Didn't you trust me?- I couldn't put you through it, Martha.

556
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,360
The lies, the fear...

557
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,960
Look, it's over now.

558
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,960
We can start again.

559
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
No more secrets.

560
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,160
Come on.

561
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:29,360
What was it you once said to me?

562
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,920
You'd either see a stallion driveanother from the herd.

563
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:35,960
You've been desperate to get rid of mesince we first clapped eyes on each other.

564
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,600
I had to give this town its justice.

565
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,160
And serve yourself into the bargain.

566
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,360
You've got a week to work out yournotice.

567
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,720
And then I want you gone.

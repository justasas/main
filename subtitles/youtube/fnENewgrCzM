430
00:24:51 --> 00:24:58
boat opposition out our brain science
for the Chairman brother

431
00:24:58 --> 00:25:01
30 game

432
00:25:01 --> 00:25:06
mother and two brothers and sisters we
have convened this extraordinary general

433
00:25:06 --> 00:25:10
meeting in order to discuss the problem
which faces they saw namely the

434
00:25:10 --> 00:25:11
disgraceful unethical

435
00:25:11 --> 00:25:14
I p.m.

436
00:25:14 --> 00:25:17
I realized that feelings are running I
but i think i want to point out first

437
00:25:17 --> 00:25:19
that you&#39;ve got to find your cat before
you can skin it

438
00:25:19 --> 00:25:23
our skin then if I find him they got me
out last night they&#39;ve got this all at

439
00:25:23 --> 00:25:26
one time or another but we&#39;re in the day
to decide what&#39;s going to be done about

440
00:25:26 --> 00:25:30
it now my personal feelings on a point
of Honor mr. Chairman I suggest we test

441
00:25:30 --> 00:25:37
out the feed into the meeting before any
resolution is put to the delegates right

442
00:25:37 --> 00:25:43
well chairs out and for the feelings of
the delegates recognize your fingers

443
00:25:43 --> 00:25:48
fingers Ferguson pickpocketing active
and Bedford High Street an independent

444
00:25:48 --> 00:25:52
operator on a test while the two large
organizations represented here today i

445
00:25:52 --> 00:25:57
feel that the interest of the small man
must be taken into consideration before

446
00:25:57 --> 00:26:01
any actual had he been doing a large
organizations what are you rather than

447
00:26:01 --> 00:26:04
about

448
00:26:04 --> 00:26:10
brothers unity the only way we can
counteract this minutes is by concerted

449
00:26:10 --> 00:26:16
action thing like piggy bikes smuggler
London Airport over in a new a very

450
00:26:16 --> 00:26:20
about 3 or my name&#39;s not talk about him
in an ass months two thousand quit with

451
00:26:20 --> 00:26:23
the watch is stuffed inside now

452
00:26:23 --> 00:26:28
educated earnest confidence trickster
element inspired and other well-known

453
00:26:28 --> 00:26:29
water hills

454
00:26:29 --> 00:26:32
I want to know what the police doing
about it

455
00:26:32 --> 00:26:36
morning gentlemen order that&#39;s not a bad
idea not a bad idea at all why don&#39;t we

456
00:26:36 --> 00:26:39
take a leaf out of there but and got a
place

457
00:26:39 --> 00:26:42
it stands to reason done it

458
00:26:42 --> 00:26:45
I mean the Sun dogs must be talking
about this as we all are they don&#39;t do

459
00:26:45 --> 00:26:47
their reputation any good to have a lot
of crooks going around dressed up as

00:26:47 --> 00:26:47
peelers

461
00:26:47 --> 00:26:51

suggest the overture should be making a

462
00:26:51 --> 00:26:54
police with a name to the eventual
cooperation between our two bodies in

463
00:26:54 --> 00:26:56

the chair recognizes the bird on a front
row

473
00:27:34 --> 00:27:37
mr. Chairman I move that this been dealt
with from the top of the brother gates

pearly gates beyond existing yeah he has

475
00:27:47 --> 00:27:47
this front

476
00:27:47 --> 00:27:50
he has a social prestige few of us could
match yeah

477
00:27:50 --> 00:27:53
a spokesman such as him will bring great
testes to our organization

478
00:27:53 --> 00:27:56

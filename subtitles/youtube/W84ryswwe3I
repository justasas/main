238
00:14:45 --> 00:14:46
with that kind of nonsense

239
00:14:46 --> 00:14:49
it&#39;s like applegate mention we all stand
up for people are going to tear it down

240
00:14:49 --> 00:14:52
and build some new chocolate

241
00:14:52 --> 00:14:53

know I&#39;m dedicated to breathe new life
into each town

245
00:15:04 --> 00:15:08
and what better way than building the
deedstown shopping gallery the dum-dum

246
00:15:08 --> 00:15:11
donut and a stop and spend are going to
save this town mayor there has been some

247
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
opposition to the destruction of these
old homes is that why applegate mansion

248
00:15:14 --> 00:15:14
is still standing

249
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
I think our talented Billy contracted in
Causton to answer that one

250
00:15:17 --> 00:15:24
hi oh well TV cameras aren&#39;t usually so
found plan to revitalize the town is to

251
00:15:24 --> 00:15:29
remove all symbols of our stagnant past
our historical landmarks our first

252
00:15:29 --> 00:15:35
attempt was delayed by interference from
a few no ghosts right

253
00:15:35 --> 00:15:41
militant reactionaries ain&#39;t no need to
worry though the deedstown rejuvenation

254
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
project will soon be back on track

255
00:15:43 --> 00:15:47

characteristics of the births of humans

172
00:11:51 --> 00:11:56
phase one is death in the second phase
you shall increase the quantity of Earth

173
00:11:56 --> 00:12:01
blood which you are transmitting to the

pastoring of the births of humans upon
your honor

181
00:12:27 --> 00:12:33
phase 5 his conquest subjugation and

212
00:14:15 --> 00:14:16
to be pretty casual about it

how can one not be casual that there&#39;s
not a remarkable thing but it&#39;s not

I assume dr. you brother screw tonight
my blood

290
00:18:47 --> 00:18:51
certainly have mr. Johnson there are
many questions I&#39;d like to ask you that

291
00:18:51 --> 00:18:52
desire is predictable

292
00:18:52 --> 00:18:55
how many answers you receive however is
not predictable

293
00:18:55 --> 00:19:02
have you spoken to anyone of this no I
best keep it an absolute secret

294
00:19:02 --> 00:19:06
excellent feeling . and you tell me
anything that I do not know

295
00:19:06 --> 00:19:11
continue this your blood is different
from any I&#39;ve ever studied in my entire

296
00:19:11 --> 00:19:14
career and what we first place

297
00:19:14 --> 00:19:17
no man on earth should be able to live
with such a low count of red corpuscles

298
00:19:17 --> 00:19:21
as you have continued in the second
place your Bloods behaving in an

299
00:19:21 --> 00:19:25
impossible manner the glutens breaking
down destroying the basic structure of

300
00:19:25 --> 00:19:26
the blood itself

301
00:19:26 --> 00:19:29
the result is evaporated blood

302
00:19:29 --> 00:19:32
that&#39;s an over simplification blood
within the veins couldn&#39;t possibly

303
00:19:32 --> 00:19:37
evaporate and more precise term would be
evaporation is a term would suffice

304
00:19:37 --> 00:19:40
doctor have you found a cause

305
00:19:40 --> 00:19:43
not yet but you think you will

306
00:19:43 --> 00:19:48
i&#39;m a i&#39;m already neglecting my other
work to devote all my time to this

307
00:19:48 --> 00:19:48
problem

308
00:19:48 --> 00:19:53
god forbid such a dreadful new plague
should strike the earth it

309
00:19:53 --> 00:19:57
god forbid it you seem already aware of
what&#39;s happening to him

310
00:19:57 --> 00:20:03
I am aware doctor the cure is not soon
forthcoming the blood of my body will

311
00:20:03 --> 00:20:08
turn to dust and I would day the doctor
it&#39;s my job to try to cheer up the pace

312
00:20:08 --> 00:20:12
that is an infant attitude dr. continue
your studies and return him

313
00:20:12 --> 00:20:16
again when you have learned more and
perhaps I shall learn something soon

314
00:20:16 --> 00:20:20
I feel that time is the great element in
this case time

00:24:43 --> 00:24:46
everyone in close relations in the city
story

386
00:24:46 --> 00:24:50
why let me leave me a million bucks me
that the curiosity of patient

387
00:24:50 --> 00:24:53
well I have a 200-pound and Detroit
sends me about saltwater candy every

388
00:24:53 --> 00:24:54
Christmas

389
00:24:54 --> 00:24:58
are you close to your at you read me the
child every now and then she gets on the

390
00:24:58 --> 00:25:00
phone and have a nice long collect chat
with me

391
00:25:00 --> 00:25:06
you may increase the flow blood this
time story mr. Johnson for a man who

392
00:25:06 --> 00:25:08
didn&#39;t know he had have a blood test
before transfusion you seem to know an

393
00:25:08 --> 00:25:12
awful lot about medicine now I have done
some reading the last three days

394
00:25:12 --> 00:25:16
yes perhaps you could give me a bit of
information that i was unable to

395
00:25:16 --> 00:25:22
discover in my research that and the
Iranian method of cancer examination it

396
00:25:22 --> 00:25:27
is true that the uranium flies to the
cancerous area but the books neglected

397
00:25:27 --> 00:25:28
to give me an explanation

398
00:25:28 --> 00:25:34
true nobody knows the amazing than one
assumption may be that since cancer

399
00:25:34 --> 00:25:38
tracks review activity with the
cancerous tissue itself may be charged

400
00:25:38 --> 00:25:39
with the negative energy

401
00:25:39 --> 00:25:44
possibly that might lead to a cure what
do you think so I don&#39;t think anything

402
00:25:44 --> 00:25:44
mr. Jansen

403
00:25:44 --> 00:25:49
now you just you just lie still until
the transfusion is finished

404
00:25:49 --> 00:25:52
yes anywhere

00:31:03 --> 00:31:03
you

492
00:31:03 --> 00:31:07
you were the recorder I said a live
specimen through the beam of the Korea

493
00:31:07 --> 00:31:13
was the subhuman satisfactory careerist
murdered for his behind the specimen of

494
00:31:13 --> 00:31:17
humanoid arrived in the de bana beam in
a compressed date

495
00:31:17 --> 00:31:23
he was crushed to the size of this
communication across the department

496
00:31:23 --> 00:31:27
concluded reservedly that it is
impossible to transmit a human or

497
00:31:27 --> 00:31:32
subhuman and at me through the beam from
the earth and the Korean live because he

498
00:31:32 --> 00:31:35
never napped be if the conclusion is
correct

499
00:31:35 --> 00:31:38
you and I will be unable to return to
the mana however I shall send another

500
00:31:38 --> 00:31:39
specimen this night

501
00:31:39 --> 00:31:43
if it is correct we must remain upon
this world in two weeks buyer

502
00:31:43 --> 00:31:49
I would prefer the outer planets in this
system to the present agony Nevada that

503
00:31:49 --> 00:31:51
is an emotional statement

504
00:31:51 --> 00:31:55
it is an emotional time and if i do not
receive blood within four productions of

505
00:31:55 --> 00:31:58
time i will have no continuing need for
a look

506
00:31:58 --> 00:32:01
do you have blood

507
00:32:01 --> 00:32:07

00:32:07 --> 00:32:10
oh hello hi hello don&#39;t wear from a
friend

509
00:32:10 --> 00:32:13

510
00:32:13 --> 00:32:19
the compounds fantastic

511
00:32:19 --> 00:32:22
not only does it contain every vitamin
known to man but a few I&#39;ve never even

512
00:32:22 --> 00:32:25
seen before and it has the basic food
structures concentrated with bulk

513
00:32:25 --> 00:32:29
roughage energy and diet control all in
the same molecular structure

514
00:32:29 --> 00:32:32
you mean that he&#39;s combined all of this
into one primary unit

515
00:32:32 --> 00:32:35
yes who is he

516
00:32:35 --> 00:32:38

well let&#39;s see what they have here for a
hungry man

518
00:32:41 --> 00:32:44
do you think it&#39;s possible to reproduce
chances unit think we&#39;ve discussed this

519
00:32:44 --> 00:32:47
sufficiently i guess i&#39;ll try the
breaded veal cutlets

520
00:32:47 --> 00:32:50

age museum

observation is correct

522
00:32:54 --> 00:32:57

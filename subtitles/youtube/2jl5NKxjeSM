00:02:40 --> 00:02:44

33
00:02:44 --> 00:02:51
yes sir until the road please the
problem lease we received a call from a

34
00:02:51 --> 00:02:57
mr. Ellison Drake to look in she thought
they might be trouble trouble

35
00:02:57 --> 00:03:04
gasps but no need to concern least let
me decide that I master passed away last

36
00:03:04 --> 00:03:04
night

37
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
most unexpected natural causes

38
00:03:08 --> 00:03:14
yes the body&#39;s on its way now to be
involved but dr. Bradford his personal

39
00:03:14 --> 00:03:25
physician is still have you can&#39;t talk
to him dr. Bradford this is lieutenant

40
00:03:25 --> 00:03:32
wrong of the police find another tenant
this is dr. surgery dr. Zira kids a

41
00:03:32 --> 00:03:38
friend of the family but you&#39;re mr.
Drake&#39;s personal physician

42
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
yes that&#39;s right that doctors Eureka&#39;s
an archaeologist he deals with the dead

43
00:03:42 --> 00:03:48
not the living the butler here tells me
that mr. Drake died suddenly it was a

44
00:03:48 --> 00:03:55
natural death would you like to see the
stick effort coronary occlusion sure

45
00:03:55 --> 00:03:59
there&#39;s a long history of cardiovascular
failure in the drake family probably a

46
00:03:59 --> 00:04:04
congenital weakness something in the
heredity riches so that the last three

47
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
generations every male member of the
great family has died in the same way

48
00:04:07 --> 00:04:13
and it almost the same age 60 and an
autopsy would be a waste of time and

49
00:04:13 --> 00:04:19
money it might help pinpoint the exact
area of malfunction but I see this

50
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
Alison Drake told me that the dead man
had been worried about something to do

51
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
with them

52
00:04:25 --> 00:04:30
shrunken head that strange Rodgers found
while the horrible looking things

00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
hanging outside the window there last
night you will tell me that had

54
00:04:33 --> 00:04:34
something to do with mr. Bates death

55
00:04:34 --> 00:04:39
it&#39;s a little preposterous internal
cannon sure mr. Drake and died naturally

56
00:04:39 --> 00:04:46
do any of you know if this head
represents a superstition something I am

57
00:04:46 --> 00:04:47
familiar with Sam&#39;s

58
00:04:47 --> 00:04:56
dances Jabara indian name for sunken
hands I am considered something of an

59
00:04:56 --> 00:05:03
authority on the Indian culture that is
why Rodgers sent for me when this was

60

251
00:22:45 --> 00:22:57
have a talk about it could one man have
lived long enough to put all three

252
00:22:57 --> 00:22:58
schools in there

253
00:22:58 --> 00:23:01
I know of no such case in medical
history

254
00:23:01 --> 00:23:10
Jeff dr bratteli that&#39;s it that&#39;s the
way the impressions appeared on the

255
00:23:10 --> 00:23:16
skulls cult of the headless man was
composed of high priests or witch

256
00:23:16 --> 00:23:22
doctors of jungle tribes deep in the
Amazon country of South America there is

257
00:23:22 --> 00:23:25
no proof legend has it that the men of
this called achieved immortality through

258
00:23:25 --> 00:23:35
the infusion into the body of a fluid
created by the tribal priests and the

259
00:23:35 --> 00:23:38
operation was successfully completed the
man who achieved immortality for he

260
00:23:38 --> 00:23:41
would no longer need food or oxygen to
exist

261
00:23:41 --> 00:23:46
the lips are sewn tight approve the
theory and the brand of the cult small

262
00:23:46 --> 00:23:55
impressions of skulls were branded on
the fingers okay so it&#39;s alleged I don&#39;t

263
00:23:55 --> 00:24:00
believe it ever happen I don&#39;t believe
it could somewhere in the past many

264
00:24:00 --> 00:24:03
legends have a basis in fact

265
00:24:03 --> 00:24:09
and what I don&#39;t have another look
around the grounds you wanna come with

266
00:24:09 --> 00:24:12
me but I&#39;d better stay here if Jonathan
needs me I&#39;ll go

267
00:24:12 --> 00:24:16
what do you expect a fine i&#39;m not sure
when I shot before I hit something hit

268
00:24:16 --> 00:24:21
bad by the way yelled when I look he was
gone the best disappearing like I&#39;ve

269
00:24:21 --> 00:24:22
ever seen

270
00:24:22 --> 00:24:41
sure it was something human yeah well
satisfied only human beings wear sandals

271
00:24:41 --> 00:24:45
or shoes means he must have been right
here on this spot

272
00:24:45 --> 00:24:50
what is it

273
00:24:50 --> 00:25:02
foreground soften up the footprints
didn&#39;t leave any for average straight

274
00:25:02 --> 00:25:11
thinking cop that is impossible but
there has to be an act if he bullet hole

275
00:25:11 --> 00:25:14
probably from one of the shots fired

276
00:25:14 --> 00:25:18
yeah

277
00:25:18 --> 00:25:31
well I take these back to the lab go
back to the house and stay there don&#39;t

278
00:25:31 --> 00:25:37
you go wandering around these grounds
don&#39;t want anything else to happen

279
00:25:37 --> 00:25:56
John from great your life was saved by
dr. breath that will not happen again

280
00:25:56 --> 00:26:16

immediately

285
00:27:28 --> 00:27:31
yes

286
00:27:31 --> 00:27:34
his heart strong enough but he&#39;s gone
back into shock worse than before

287
00:27:34 --> 00:27:38
what could have happened where the
pupils of the eyes are dilated something

288
00:27:38 --> 00:27:43
must have terrified him a nightmare or
something worse

289
00:27:43 --> 00:27:46
there&#39;s a policeman outside nobody could
have gotten in without being seen

290
00:27:46 --> 00:27:51
you&#39;re forgetting the thing that came
after your father before left no

291
00:27:51 --> 00:27:57
footprints perhaps something was real
and tangible what if it wasn&#39;t

292
00:27:57 --> 00:28:01
everything&#39;s done that can be done you
aren&#39;t going to the husband

293
00:28:01 --> 00:28:05
I think there&#39;s something more important
to your father that must be taken care

294
00:28:05 --> 00:28:06
of first

295
00:28:06 --> 00:28:09
i&#39;ll be at the hospital later

00:28:36 --> 00:28:39

299
00:28:39 --> 00:28:42
something is puzzling me and as you&#39;re
an expert on such matters brought you

300
00:28:42 --> 00:28:42
can help me

301
00:28:42 --> 00:28:49
yes harare is the favorite arrow poison
of the jibaro Indians is it not and also

302
00:28:49 --> 00:28:54
of the armchairs and others the Amazon
tribes the she borrows of the

303
00:28:54 --> 00:28:58
headhunters who treat their trophies
that is correct

304
00:28:58 --> 00:29:08
but why this sudden interest in karate
because i am convinced that you re not

305
00:29:08 --> 00:29:13
hard fit cause the death of chemistry
and tonight someone used the same poison

306
00:29:13 --> 00:29:17
on Jonathan drink that he did not die

307
00:29:17 --> 00:29:20
how did you know that

308
00:29:20 --> 00:29:25
how very fortunate mr. Drake that you
were present to save his life

309
00:29:25 --> 00:29:32
I tell me how did you know that it makes
no difference since you will never leave

310
00:29:32 --> 00:29:35
here to save his life again

311
00:29:35 --> 00:29:38
yeah

312
00:29:38 --> 00:29:40
yeah

313
00:29:40 --> 00:29:44
yeah

314
00:29:44 --> 00:29:49
make any sense out of it

315
00:29:49 --> 00:29:53
I analyzed the bullet and the sample and
nothing makes any sense

316
00:29:53 --> 00:29:57
Jeff you hit something with that pull it
all right but what is something else

317
00:29:57 --> 00:30:02
no blood on it yeah a little yet the
internal composition of the thing you

318
00:30:02 --> 00:30:07
hit is about one-third blood and the
rest were re re the thing should be dead

319
00:30:07 --> 00:30:16
it&#39;s practically impossible the stuff
what about the saddle you&#39;ve got a

320
00:30:16 --> 00:30:17
strong stomach

321
00:30:17 --> 00:30:27
it&#39;s made from human skin they are you
sure i&#39;m sure the name of all that&#39;s

322
00:30:27 --> 00:30:30
holy what if you tied onto in this case
i don&#39;t know i&#39;m going around service

323
00:30:30 --> 00:30:37
the buzzer is a dad to a guy named Surak
maybe even come up with a few answers

324
00:30:37 --> 00:30:41
it&#39;s a regular ND archaeologists but
he&#39;s a he&#39;s an expert on primitive

325
00:30:41 --> 00:30:46
culture headhunting carry all the sort
to talk to him before there&#39;s a lot of

326
00:30:46 --> 00:30:52
things I didn&#39;t believe in before i&#39;m
beginning to change my mind

327
00:30:52 --> 00:30:55
see you later

328
00:30:55 --> 00:30:58
lieutenant round this is a surprise

329
00:30:58 --> 00:31:01
sorry to bother you dr. sorry but I
thought you might give me some help yes

330
00:31:01 --> 00:31:07
it&#39;s the drink is oh yes please come in
thank you i was apologize for this room

331
00:31:07 --> 00:31:11
i use a little i&#39;m usually occupied my
studies

332
00:31:11 --> 00:31:17
I&#39;m a police when doctors rec trained to
deal in facts and anything to do with

333
00:31:17 --> 00:31:23
headhunting doesn&#39;t seem very factual to
your you&#39;re the expert of it but it&#39;s

334
00:31:23 --> 00:31:28
more than headhunting something attacked
Jonathan drink i managed to get off a

335
00:31:28 --> 00:31:33
few shots at it and I hit it once i also
found the bullet that I hit it with

336
00:31:33 --> 00:31:38
police lab tells me that it was stained
with a solution of blood

337
00:31:38 --> 00:31:45
kirari mostly kirari that is strange
quite strange indeed

338
00:31:45 --> 00:31:50
then you don&#39;t have any explanation for
lieutenant have you considered the

339
00:31:50 --> 00:31:51
supernatural aspects

340
00:31:51 --> 00:31:55
oh yes I consider them they come up with
exactly nothing

341
00:31:55 --> 00:31:58
and perhaps it isn&#39;t a police matter at
all

342
00:31:58 --> 00:32:03
attempted murder is always a police
matter you asked for my help I&#39;m trying

343
00:32:03 --> 00:32:07
to give it to you when the only way i
know sorry

344
00:32:07 --> 00:32:14
it depends strictly on your point of
view lieutenant throughout history some

345
00:32:14 --> 00:32:18
of our strongest cultures were based on
the taking of heads when the practice

346
00:32:18 --> 00:32:21
was abandoned or suppress the little
civilization to generated and soon

347
00:32:21 --> 00:32:24
disappeared even today the practice two
flashes and several parts of the world

348
00:32:24 --> 00:32:28
the Philippines India you Kenny upper
regions of the Amazon until a few years

349
00:32:28 --> 00:32:34
ago it was prevalent in civilized Europe
maybe they&#39;re still better ways to kill

350
00:32:34 --> 00:32:40
somebody then by hacking of his hit i
see i haven&#39;t changed your point of view

351
00:32:40 --> 00:32:48
know when the head of a strong value and
the enemy is properly taken the

352
00:32:48 --> 00:32:51
possessor acquires the Spirit the soul

353
00:32:51 --> 00:32:56
the vital spark that kept his enemy
alive the degree of a multimeter

354
00:32:56 --> 00:33:20
spill something a red dye will come on
what did you mean by taking the head

355
00:33:20 --> 00:33:26
public and the wrong with it it was a
sacred ritual of the ancient culture

356
00:33:26 --> 00:33:29
scale could not be damaged otherwise the
soul would escape

357
00:33:29 --> 00:33:32
come here

358
00:33:32 --> 00:33:36
the cut has been made just hear about
the shoulder higher

359
00:33:36 --> 00:33:41
hola incision is made of the bamboo
blade never with a metal night the ion

360
00:33:41 --> 00:33:42
cannon ate the soul

361
00:33:42 --> 00:33:47
IC afterward the trophy is preserved in
the usual fashion removal of the scow

362
00:33:47 --> 00:33:54
say how the opening the eyes nose and
mouth then slow shrinking process with

363
00:33:54 --> 00:33:57
hearts and smoke and heated pebbles

364
00:33:57 --> 00:34:02
which still doesn&#39;t explain why someone
would want to kill Drake did you expect

365
00:34:02 --> 00:34:08
you to answer that for you I wasn&#39;t sure
just what you could ask dr. Eric

366
00:34:08 --> 00:34:15
you know anything about the curse on the
brake family cats and I didn&#39;t

367
00:34:15 --> 00:34:22

if you want to make an offer do so by
all means

179
00:11:45 --> 00:11:48

breakdown and instead a charming teacher

all I want now is evidence evidence of
what I&#39;m certain that he&#39;s losing power

another house can&#39;t profit of course the

don&#39;t think so but she knows something
that&#39;s a danger

439
00:28:05 --> 00:28:08
that&#39;s why we&#39;ve got to get away from
him out of that house

440
00:28:08 --> 00:28:11

and where do you usually pass the
evenings with your gentlemen friends and

450
00:28:46 --> 00:28:52
welcome had a square sit in the park and
perhaps it would be departing too much

451
00:28:52 --> 00:28:58
from tradition if you want to come with
me to music all day

452
00:28:58 --> 00:29:03
I always mean what I say I shall meet
you at 750 at the corner of the square

453
00:29:03 --> 00:29:09
your ramen a party was never going to do
nothing to announce the answer the belt

454
00:29:09 --> 00:29:10
this is battle

455
00:29:10 --> 00:29:13
what name should I say that cosmic
mysteries

456
00:29:13 --> 00:29:15
how do you do

457
00:29:15 --> 00:29:18
how do you do when you come in here for
a moment

458
00:29:18 --> 00:29:21
see that mrs. Marin is not informed of
the school

459
00:29:21 --> 00:29:25
he could I hope you&#39;ll forgive me for
calling a desire but I happen to be in

460
00:29:25 --> 00:29:26
Lambton and I&#39;d have to see better

461
00:29:26 --> 00:29:33
I&#39;m sorry but my wife is unable to see
you tomorrow this is a little difficult

462
00:29:33 --> 00:29:37
to explain but you may remember that at
the time of your marriage there was a

463
00:29:37 --> 00:29:38
slight friction between us

464
00:29:38 --> 00:29:41
I was peculiarly alive to the effects

465
00:29:41 --> 00:29:44
my sister and I have long regretted
these differences they&#39;ve kept separated

466
00:29:44 --> 00:29:47
from bella to LA in your opinion

467
00:29:47 --> 00:29:51
we&#39;re anxious to see her again haven&#39;t
stayed with some Devon to the air always

468
00:29:51 --> 00:29:54
used to do this so much good down there
you are under the impression she&#39;s ill

469
00:29:54 --> 00:29:58
and what has given you that impression
she was never strong

470
00:29:58 --> 00:30:02
I&#39;m the best guardian of my wife self
all the same I should like to see my

471
00:30:02 --> 00:30:05
cousin and I was with me when we heard
you arrive

472
00:30:05 --> 00:30:09
if she had wished to see you she
wouldn&#39;t have asked me to speak to you

473
00:30:09 --> 00:30:10
down here

474
00:30:10 --> 00:30:15
she refused to see me the inference
appears to be perfectly clear

475
00:30:15 --> 00:30:18
I don&#39;t think I like your tone melon

476
00:30:18 --> 00:30:21
you&#39;re under no obligation to listen to
it

477
00:30:21 --> 00:30:24
mr. Walter

478
00:30:24 --> 00:30:30
I&#39;m not going to leave this house until
I see my cousin you propose to interfere

479
00:30:30 --> 00:30:31
between a husband and wife

480
00:30:31 --> 00:30:38
it would require physical force for
stylespotter and so will you please show

481
00:30:38 --> 00:30:41
this gentleman out

482
00:30:41 --> 00:30:44

square has he been here

485
00:30:50 --> 00:30:53

night and the opinion of the police were
to be found them and vanished with him

going flying in my room watching the

561
00:35:48 --> 00:35:52
guests I&#39;d missing for some one place
where no one can go where you stay again

562
00:35:52 --> 00:35:57
along the route from the empty house
next door saying it freaks it all fits

563
00:35:57 --> 00:35:58
to me

564
00:35:58 --> 00:36:02

try it on the down low boom

565
00:36:02 --> 00:36:05
go away leave this house

566
00:36:05 --> 00:36:15
what do you know about the way that i
found an envelope addressed this when we

567
00:36:15 --> 00:36:16
first came here

568
00:36:16 --> 00:36:19
that&#39;s what started I&#39;ve got it solved
it I&#39;ve saved you

569
00:36:19 --> 00:36:22
god what a marvelous man I am what are
you talking

570
00:36:22 --> 00:36:27
you&#39;re mr. melon is my mr. Louie bar a
criminal maniac who murdered his aren&#39;t

571
00:36:27 --> 00:36:30
and steals back to his own house at
night

572
00:36:30 --> 00:36:34
still searching for those rubies he
couldn&#39;t find 20 years ago and every

573
00:36:34 --> 00:36:43
time he likes the gas up in that room so
it dims down here like brightens up here

574
00:36:43 --> 00:36:48
his key in the door a few minutes
afterwards I can&#39;t stand it that mine

575
00:36:48 --> 00:36:51
wow you are not going out of your mind
this is melon

576
00:36:51 --> 00:36:54
you&#39;re slowly and methodically being
driven out of your mind

577
00:36:54 --> 00:36:57
why because quite by accident you got
into his identity and that makes it

578
00:36:57 --> 00:37:00
dangerous to him he couldn&#39;t get rid of
you by ordinary means if you have an

579
00:37:00 --> 00:37:00
inquiry

580
00:37:00 --> 00:37:02
so he&#39;s driving you mad

581
00:37:02 --> 00:37:05
and in order to discredit anything that
you say as the ravings of a lunatic

582
00:37:05 --> 00:37:10
thank god you&#39;re not married to him not
matter

583
00:37:10 --> 00:37:13
certainly not he made another lady long
before he met you she&#39;s still alive

584
00:37:13 --> 00:37:16
i dunno i&#39;ll be in finding out things
about mr. Lewis power

585
00:37:16 --> 00:37:21
where is this woman what&#39;s the trouble
Australia have three months away by then

586
00:37:21 --> 00:37:22
it&#39;ll be too late to save you

587
00:37:22 --> 00:37:26
that&#39;s why you&#39;ve got to give me the
evidence we need him any proof of Louie

588
00:37:26 --> 00:37:27
about his identity

589
00:37:27 --> 00:37:30
I don&#39;t know where to find you tell me
where to look yes but in here

590
00:37:30 --> 00:37:35
don&#39;t understand to me is still my
husband

591
00:37:35 --> 00:37:39
I couldn&#39;t betray my husband you mean
the man who betrayed you into thinking

592
00:37:39 --> 00:37:40
you were married to him

593
00:37:40 --> 00:37:45
that&#39;s different that was before I knew
him we live together as husband and wife

594
00:37:45 --> 00:37:48
if I betrayed him might be betraying
myself even though I tell you at this

595
00:37:48 --> 00:37:48
moment

596
00:37:48 --> 00:37:51
he&#39;s sitting in a music hall with
another woman your pomade

597
00:37:51 --> 00:37:56
it&#39;s hard to take everything from you
and I&#39;m afraid it is

598
00:37:56 --> 00:38:01
you will straight in and I follow you in
a moment

599
00:38:01 --> 00:38:04
you gonna do don&#39;t take a little stroll

600
00:38:04 --> 00:38:07
when we go out again I&#39;ll let you know

601
00:38:07 --> 00:38:10
did it it anymore

602
00:38:10 --> 00:38:13
and then you will

603
00:38:13 --> 00:38:16
he keeps his papers in there this is
where we start

604
00:38:16 --> 00:38:19
but it&#39;s not good that means that
probably something inside of a very

605

00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,217
(rock music)

2
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,980
- Dennis.

3
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:29,855
Dennis!

4
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:34,902
- Hey, what gives?

5
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,323
- You're being paidto work around here!

6
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:41,076
Not to sit around andblast your eardrums.

7
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,872
- Hey, hey, hey, take it easy.

8
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:43,869
I can do both.

9
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,918
(phone ringing)

10
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,792
(dial tone)- Hello?

11
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:49,666
Hello?

12
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,886
Didn't you hearthe phone ringing?

13
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,339
- No, I didn't.

14
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:01,300
- [McCreedy] They'vealready hung up!

15
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:02,555
- Well then it couldn'thave been too important.

16
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,182
- Don't you have anysense of responsibility?

17
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,230
That could have beena very important call.

18
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,354
- [Dennis] At this hour?

19
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:10,935
- In the future wouldyou just answer the phone

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,441
no matter what hour it is, andnot make your own decisions

21
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,694
about what's importantand what isn't?

22
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,445
- Yeah, yeah, right, right.

23
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,869
- It's time for our rounds.

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,641
(eerie music)

25
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:30,063
Did I ever tell youwhat the studio was like

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,810
when I first started here?

27
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,232
- Yeah, more than once.

28
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,607
- Oh, it used to be one ofthe busiest lots in town.

29
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,440
- It's a real thrivingmetropolis now.

30
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,572
Hey wait a minute,what's this down here?

31
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:45,871
- Oh, it's justan old film vault,

32
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,163
there's nothing down there.

33
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,957
- Yeah, but why don'twe check it anyway?

34
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,535
- I'm telling you there'snothing down there,

35
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,044
and I'm not going to wastemy time checking it out.

36
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,170
- [Voiceover] McCreedy.

37
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,296
- What is it now?

38
00:02:58,637 --> 00:02:59,797
- [Voiceover] I needto talk to you now.

39
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,503
- Well I can't right now.

40
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,260
- [Voiceover] Now, I mean it.

41
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,262
- Finish the rounds.

42
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,140
And remember what I said.

43
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,312
- Whatever you say, Pops.

44
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:26,203
(faint rock music in headphones)

45
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,425
(intense music)

46
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,151
- What took you so long?

47
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,649
- I made it asquickly as I could,

48
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,401
I was clear across the lot.

49
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,984
- You're not as youngas you used to be.

50
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,284
I tried calling you atthe main gate before,

51
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,487
why didn't you answer the phone?

52
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,949
- I must have caughtit just as you hung up.

53
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:15,161
- Well let's be a littlemore efficient from now on.

54
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,336
How's the new boy doing?

55
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,164
- Fine, fine.

56
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,669
But I really need to get back.

57
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,343
- Just a minute, I wanttalk to you about these

58
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,422
beer cans I foundin the front gate.

59
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:31,434
(ominous music)

60
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:39,101
- So there's nothing down here.

61
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,739
I wonder what they keep in here.

62
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,079
Yoohoo, Mr. McCreedy?

63
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,792
(growling)

64
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,145
Is somebody there?

65
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,522
(growling)

66
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,529
Is somebody there?

67
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,866
(radio static)

68
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:23,755
- I'll give you areport in the morning.

69
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:43,233
(feedback squealing)

70
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,657
(crowd cheering)

71
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,280
(rock music)

72
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,319
(cries out)

73
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,455
(creepy music)

74
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,564
(door slams shut)

75
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,786
(eerie music)

76
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,528
- Another one quit?!

77
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,241
What was the problem this time?

78
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,493
- I'm not sure whatthe problem was, sir.

79
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,665
- It wasn't somethingyou said to him, was it?

80
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:47,867
- [McCreedy] It could have been.

81
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,545
- I'm holding you responsiblefor this, McCreedy.

82
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,873
Every time we hire anew guard he only lasts

83
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,504
for a couple ofweeks, then he's gone.

84
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,131
How many is it now, three, four?

85
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:00,338
- It's three, and Ireally don't think

86
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,548
you need to hire anyone else.

87
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,680
I can run the post myself.

88
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,012
- Look, you've beenhere for a long time.

89
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,393
You know as well as Ido that we need to have

90
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,565
a second guard ready sohe can fill in for you

91
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,019
if you can't makeit here some night.

92
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:16,901
- But I've never missed anight since I've been here!

93
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:19,198
- You're not as young asyou used to be, we need

94
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,616
to be prepared.

95
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,615
Do you know that if somethingwere to happen to this studio

96
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:27,040
while no one was on duty,our insurance is voided?

97
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,208
- This place has beendeserted for almost 30 years.

98
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,537
- Stop making excuses.

99
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,338
I want you to hire a new guard,

100
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:37,668
and this time hire one whowill stick around for a while.

101
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,798
Or else I'll hire two.

102
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,096
- So, Kevin, is this thefirst time that you've worked

103
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,393
as a security guard?

104
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,598
- Yes sir, but I'm a veryfast learner, and I promise

105
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,683
to try extra hard.

106
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,734
And I really need the job.

107
00:10:57,574 --> 00:11:01,237
- Well you sound verymature for your age.

108
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:04,320
You don't own one of thoseportable radios with headphones,

109
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,198
do you?

110
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,037
- No sir.

111
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,208
- That's good, I thinkwe'll get along just fine.

112
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,205
Now, are you ready foryour first tour of the lot?

113
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,625
- Oh, oh yes sir, evenprepared to take notes.

114
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,008
- It's not that complicated.

115
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,187
You've never been on astudio lot like this before,

116
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,362
have you?

117
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,689
- No sir.

118
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,445
- Well, it's not thatdifficult to keep track of.

119
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,528
Now there isn't muchgoes on here anymore.

120
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,113
- How long have youbeen working here?

121
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,540
- Oh, quite a while.

122
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,742
About 30 years, actually.

123
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,668
And I've never misseda day and had to have

124
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:57,122
someone fill in for me.

125
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,549
- 30 years, that's amazing.

126
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:00,875
- Well, not really.

127
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,961
You know, timebecomes sort of a blur

128
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,297
when you reach a certain age.

129
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,132
Sometime I'll tell youwhat this place was like

130
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,934
when it was still afunctioning studio.

131
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,637
- I'd like to hear about that.

132
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:17,396
(mysterious music)

133
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,655
- Now Kevin, if I toldyou that something

134
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,655
was very important, you'dlisten to me, wouldn't you?

135
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:27,781
- Of course.

136
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,111
- Good.

137
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,822
Now there is a part ofthis lot that I want you

138
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,623
to stay away from.

139
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,873
I don't want to have toexplain all the details to you,

140
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:39,001
I just want you to promiseto stay clear of it.

141
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,878
- I understand.

142
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:44,882
- Now this is the partI was telling you about.

143
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,429
- What's down there?

144
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,681
- It's just a lot ofdangerous machinery.

145
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,853
Now don't go in there andtake the chance of injuring

146
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,101
yourself, do you understand?

147
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:57,773
- Yeah.

148
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,360
- Good, now I don'twant to have to

149
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,529
remind you a second time.

150
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,154
Just stay clear of this area.

151
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,878
- So is there anything elseI need to be made aware of?

152
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,001
- There is one other thing.

153
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,092
This is what I wastelling you about.

154
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,895
Oh, but don't worry, I'venever had to use it.

155
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,221
- Really?

156
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:39,979
- That's right, not in allthe years I've been here.

157
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,028
But I would like to show youhow to use it sometime though,

158
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,402
you never know whenyou might need it.

159
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,076
(ominous music)

160
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,184
- Hi.

161
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,686
- Not now, yourfriends are here.

162
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,570
- Hey, how's it going?

163
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,192
- What'd you bring,some new music?

164
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,619
- No, I just rented avideotape that Amy and I

165
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:34,945
were gonna watch.

166
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,371
- Well that was very nice.

167
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,370
- Let me see what you got.

168
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:39,951
What?

169
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,752
Don't you ever get any tapesfrom the adult section?

170
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,330
My boyfriend wouldnever bring me a tape

171
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,336
that didn't have atleast a single X rating.

172
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,917
- Well Kevin isn't like that.

173
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,049
He would never want me to seeanything that was rated X.

174
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,221
Would you?

175
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,798
- No, I wouldn't.

176
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,851
(horn beeps)

177
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,238
- Oh right man, I'drecognize that horn anywhere,

178
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,530
that's my Nick.

179
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,199
Back from two monthsof army training,

180
00:15:12,537 --> 00:15:14,528
and you know what a manwants when he's been away

189
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:48,982
- No, no.

190
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,748

192
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,582

193

00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:24,889
something and knowing how to use it.

203
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,099
- Would it be okayif I used your phone?

204
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:29,060

00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,989
- What else did youdo with the gun?

210
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,829

Yet.

215
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:57,554

238
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,519

- What's the matter, Kevin?

294
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:00,418

00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,541
- I've got all thetime in the world.

296
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:11,470
- What do you do about someonewho you can never make happy?

297
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,551

308
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:48,377
Uh-oh.

318
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,458
- Get away from him.

319
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,791
- Who's this, your grandson?

320
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,668

00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:13,960
- I said, get away from him.

322
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,304
- Who are you kidding?

323
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,848
You don't know how to use that.

324
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,605
(gunshot)

325
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,852
(coughing)

326
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,185
- Are you okay?

327
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,145
Do you want me tocall an ambulance?

328
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,855
- No no, I'm fine.

329
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,440
- Damn.

330
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,695
- What's the matter?

331
00:25:38,037 --> 00:25:38,901
- I just wish Amycould've been here to see

332
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,406
what I just did.

333
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,115
- He's still on the lot.

334
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,540
- What do we do now?

335
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:46,958
- I'm going to call the police.

336
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:49,958
Try to locate where he is,but keep a distance from him.

337
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,960
Don't try to be a hero.

338
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,513
(suspenseful music)

339
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,886
- Mr. McCreedy?

340
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,892
I'm going down that hallwaywhere all the machinery is.

341
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:50,564
I think he went down there.

342
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,392
I'm going in for a closer look.

343
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,411
- Good God, the vault!

344
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,242

348
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,515

(growling)

350
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,396
- We're too late!

351
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,519
Kevin, why did you go in there?

352
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,771
Why didn't you listen to me?

353
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:19,834

354
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,837

00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,664
- I don't understand!

358
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:03,499

360
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,672
Those creatures,the vault, I tried.

361
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,683
All my work, 30 years I'vebeen trying to prevent this

362
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,434
from happening.

363
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,891
- To prevent whatfrom happening?

364
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,521
- Those creatures.

365
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:27,357
Why do you think I spent thelast 30 years of my life here?

366
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,158
I was keeping themfrom escaping.

367
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,993
I was young when Ibegan to work here,

368
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:38,371
and the studio wasbusy and prosperous.

369
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:45,253
I'll always remember thenight that it happened.

370
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,927
It was late, there washardly anyone around.

371
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,715
I didn't even knowwhat it was at first.

372
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:56,222
It was all so fast,just a flash of light

373
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,144
and then a sudden explosion.

374
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,851
I stepped out tosee what it was,

375
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,526
but there was no oneelse there except for me.

376
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:10,862
It was right in themiddle of the lot.

377
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,694
Had it been daytime, itprobably would have been crushed

378
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:15,245
in all the traffic.

379
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:20,041
I just stared atit for a long time.

380
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:22,961
I didn't know whatto make of it.

381
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,209
And then suddenly it moved.

382
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,713
And out from the top of thedisc came this small creature,

383
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,385
a sort of hobgoblin.

384
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:35,428
It looked around and thenit stared right at me.

385
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:40,475
I didn't move, I justkept watching him.

386
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,691
Looked so friendly at first.

387
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:48,903
If only I'd knownwhat lay ahead.

388
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:55,073
- But I still don't understand.

389
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:59,908
- I let the creatures liveon the lot, it was my secret.

390
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,334
And then I learned ofthe power they had.

391
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,081
I still don't knowif they figured

392
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:08,041
they were doing goodfor people or not.

393
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:12,799
They slowly began todestroy everyone on the lot.

394
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,597
They would find a person,tap into his brain,

395
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:19,176
and then create hiswildest fantasy.

396
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:22,479
It seemed harmless at first,I mean, watching everyone

397
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:26,775
around me becoming rich orfamous, but for most people

398
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:32,314
what they really want inlife can be very dangerous.

399
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,947
In fact, the creatures woundup destroying everyone,

400
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,950
everyone they camein contact with.

401
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,700
They're, they're, they're loosein the city now.

402
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:44,830
- But you could warn everyone.

403
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,003
They'd listen to your story.

404
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,420
- Would they?

405
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:51,841
No one believed me 30 years ago.

406
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:53,259
I went straight tothe head of the studio

407
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:54,882
and tried to explain it to him.

408
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,212
He didn't believeme, no one did.

409
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,346
I just watched helplesslyas people around me

410
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,678
were destroyed, one by one.

411
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,104
- Then what can we do?

412
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:10,064
- I'm too old to catchup with them now,

413
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,441
but you might stillhave a chance.

414
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:16,115
There aren't very many ofthem, but they move quickly.

415
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:19,286
Just remember, they'reattracted to bright lights,

416
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:22,330
that's how you can fight them.

417
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,033
Watch everyone around you.

418
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,164
When a person beginsto act strangely,

419
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:28,916
it means that oneof the creatures

420
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,623
have tapped into his mind.

421
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,674
When this happens, thecreature is never far away.

422
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,048
Find it and kill itbefore it's too late.

423
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,426
Because when the creaturedies, the fantasy ends

424
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,599
and the victim is safe.

425
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:46,101
Now remember, they're onlyattracted to bright light.

426
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,056
That's how you find them.

427
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,983
But you must destroythem all before dawn

428
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,186
because once it'sdaylight, it's too late.

429
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:54,521
- Okay.

430
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,653
- You'll never beable to stop them.

431
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:00,280
(ominous music)

432
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,874
(record scratch)

433
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,332
(dance music)

434
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,133
- Alright!

435
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,153
(growling)

436
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,373
Come on Amy, wouldyou get with it?

437
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,420
(growling)

438
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,805
(horn beeps)

439
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:09,183
That car horn, I'drecognize it anywhere!

440
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,938
(horn beeps)

441
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:17,104
See you guys later.

442
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,488
Much later.

443
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,243
That's weird.

444
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:29,208
Maybe he's circlingthe block or something.

445
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,870
- I brought your jacket.

446
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,580
I thought you mightbe cold out here.

447
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,756
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

448
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,083
- Where's Nick?

449
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,885
I thought I heardhis horn before.

450
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:41,881
- So did I.

451
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,173
- Well maybe you should waitinside until you see him.

452
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,054
- He's just lookingfor a place to park,

453
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,760
now would you goback in the house?

454
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,936
- There's plenty of parkingin front, maybe it wasn't

455
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,184
his horn?

456
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:53,685
- Look, I'm positive it was.

457
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,312
Maybe the policejust pulled him over

458
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,769
for all his warrantsor something.

459
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,102
Now would you justgo back in the house?

460
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,358
- Fine, I get the message.

461
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,782
- Just take thisstupid jacket with you.

462
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:09,782
Damnit Nick, wherethe hell are you?

463
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,634
(growling)

464
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,465
Amy, would you justgo back in the house

465
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:29,142
and leave me alone?

466
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,605
And would you stopbreathing all over me?

467
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,057
(growls)

468
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:38,314
(screaming)

469
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,985
- Sounds like Nickfinally got here.

470
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,332
- Get the fuck off me!

471
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,296
- She must be happy to see him.

472
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,226
- Take that, you little bastard!

473
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,449
- Honestly, couldn't Nick wait?

474
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,874
(screaming)

475
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,626
(growling)

476
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,621
Go on, grab it!

477
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,537
- It's like a new dance.

478
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:22,877
Looks pretty kinky.

479
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,417
Hey guys!

480
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:27,093
- Nick, thank God you're here!

481
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,008
Something wild came out of the woodsand attacked us!

482
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,464
- I know I'm here to take ya out.

483
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,549
- Oh it's those rabid animals!

484
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,852
(screaming)

485
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,061
(growling)

486
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,088
I knew I'd find a use for this.

487
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,473
Just open the doorand stand back.

488
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:20,225
- Oh my God, whatdo you call that?

489
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,730
- Urban renewal.

490
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:33,822
- Wait!

491
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,291
No, put that out!

492
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,963
(growling)

493
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,352
You guys okay?

494
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,429
- Yeah, I'm just peachy.

495
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,355
- I had everythingunder control.

496
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:06,685
- Good, then you canfinish off your van.

497
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,827
- I don't understand,what were those things?

498
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:25,412
- It's a long story.

499
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,293
What they do to yourbody is nothing compared

500
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,090
to what they do to your mind.

501
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,338
- Don't have toworry about that.

502
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,169
- You sure you're all okay?

503
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,221
I mean, you don't feelanything different, do you?

504
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,424
- I think I wet my pants.

505
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,803
Hey, I was only kidding.

506
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,765
- And none of you havea desire to do anything

507
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,396
you've never done before, right?

508
00:40:48,738 --> 00:40:49,648
- I don't thinkthere's anything left

509
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,525
that we haven't done before.

510
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,322
- How 'bout you, Amy?

511
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,321
- Well actually I dowanna try this new Chinese

512
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:58,119
restaurant that I heard about.

513
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:58,990
- Kyle?

514
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,535
- Could I use yourtelephone again?

515
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,332
I wanna call my girlfriend.

516
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,410
- We still haven't metthis mystery girl of yours,

517
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,746
what kind of relationshipdo the two of you have?

518
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:11,834
- I guess you'd say it'sa fantasy relationship.

519
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,940
(ominous music)

520
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:49,124
(growling)

521
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:08,314
(phone ringing)

522
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,391
- Hi, it's me, Fantasia.

523
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,818
Thanks for calling.

524
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:15,442
I need a new house petto impress my friends.

525
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,614
Now hurry beforethe zookeeper comes,

526
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,614
help me hide thisiguana on my body.

527
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,071
Uh, can I help you, miss?

528
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:27,500
Oh yes Mr. Beastmaster,something just crawled up my leg.

529
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,544
Oh, see if you can find it.

530
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:35,500
I think you'd better comeback to my office with me.

531
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:38,507
Now wait a minute, areyou sure your office

532
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:41,134
is in the baboon pit?

533
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:45,435
Mister zookeeper, what doyou think you're doing?

534
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:48,980
This isn't thechildren's petting zoo.

535
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:53,276
I have a new house pet foryou, miss, ha ha ha ha ha.

536
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,439
Oh, mister zookeeper, Icould never take a cockatoo

537
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:58,318
that size.

538
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,443
(record scratch)

539
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,531
Now stop wasting yourmoney calling me.

540
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,036
I'm right outside your door.

541
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,953

00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,801
So I've heard.

00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,128

564
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,135

565
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,012
I've gotta go acrosstown and get Kyle.

Don't make a moveor do anything.

568
00:45:33,356 --> 00:45:36,894
And above all, don'tfantasize about anything!

569
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:56,917
- You know, girls, I couldthink of a fantasy right now.

570
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,542
It's involving the number three.

571
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:27,698
- Oh Fantasia, you'remy ideal woman.

572
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,617
You're intelligent, you'vegot a wonderful personality,

573
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,286

Will you marry me?

576
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:40,753
- Skip the ceremony, we'regoing straight to the honeymoon.

577
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:50,255
Oh Fantasia, baby I couldwatch you all night long.

578
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,132

579
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,637
all night long.

580
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:57,311
Now hurry, I know a shortcut.

581
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,300
Oh, don't park here.

582
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,890
- Why not?

583
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,102
- You have to park near the edge

584
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,809
if you want to go all the way.

585
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:47,357
- Oh yeah, sure.

586
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:58,827
How's that?

587
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,708
- Perfect.

588
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,331
- That was someshortcut you knew about.

589
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:04,502
I never knew therewas a road through

590
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,796
the children's playground.

591
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:09,087
- There isn't.

592
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,840
(laughs)

593
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:14,638
Well, what are you waiting for?

594
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:27,894
- Fantasia, where are you going?

595
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:30,855
- I wanted a betterview of the city.

596
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:35,238
You can see it all from here.

597
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:41,616
Now, isn't that a lovely view?

598
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,077
- Oh, it sure is.

599
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,501
Where are you going now?

600
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,502
- Just wait a second.

601
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:54,963
You just keep watching the view.

602
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:59,266
Just hold tight and get readyfor the ride of your life.

603
00:49:01,105 --> 00:49:02,185
- Do it to me.

604
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,317
(groaning)

605
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,741
You need any help?

606
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,993
- Would you get backinside and wait for me?

607
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,995
This time don't move!

608
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:30,880
We're almost there.

609
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,506
Just think nastythoughts while you wait.

610
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,923
(suspenseful music)

611
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,488
(groaning)

612
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,118
(growling)

613
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,145
- Do it do me, baby.

614
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:31,771
- You damn fool!

615
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,945
What are you doing here?

616
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,647
- I want you tomeet my girlfriend.

617
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:37,731
Wait 'til you see her.

618
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:38,862

619
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:39,942
Honey?

620
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,026
- Kyle, there's no girl.

621
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:42,908
She was a figmentof your imagination.

622
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:44,955
- No she's not, she'sjust hiding somewhere.

623
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,782
I told you, she's a shy girl.

624
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:47,832
Sweetie?

625
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,125
- Shy girl?

626
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,169
That bleached blondewitch almost killed you!

627
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:55,795
She was back there trying topush your car over the cliff!

628
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,091
Hey, come on!

629
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,632

630
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,056
(explosion)

631
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:18,192
- Whoa.

632
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,608
- Now do you believe me?

633
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,042
(ominous music)

634
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,309
I'll discuss my phonebill with you later.

635
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,768
Oh no.

636
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:52,974
They're gone!

637
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:57,278

638
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:10,995

640
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:22,003
- Hit the creature!

641
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,104
Idiot.

642
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:42,652
The creatures brokeloose, are you guys okay?

643
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,858
- We're doing just fine.

644
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:46,819
- What about Amy, where's she?

645
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:48,745
- She was acting kinda strange.

646
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:49,993
- [Kevin] What?

647
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:51,323

649
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:53,288
- What?

650
00:52:53,629 --> 00:52:54,835
Why didn't you try to stop her?

651
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,287
- What's the big deal?

652
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:57,621
I've been there before.

653
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:58,955
- You guys, don'tyou understand?

654
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,166
These creatures have a power.

655
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:03,173
They can tap into yourbrain and sense the things

656
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:05,721
that you really wanna do.

657
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:07,173
- What's wrong with that?

658
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:08,883
- They also try to kill you.

659
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:11,093
I just chased Kyle across townand pulled him out of his car

660
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,850
right before it rolledover a cliff and blew up.

661
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,226
- It's still burning now.

662
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:18,183
- You see what I'm tryingto tell you guys now?

663
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,144
- What could happenat that nightclub?

664
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:21,319
- Well there's a lot of bikers

665
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:23,648
and people fighting everywhere,and I've seen people

666
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,027
dealing drugs and knife fights.

667
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:25,983
- What?

668
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,485
Oh no, come on, we've gotta go.

669
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:28,576
Come on!

670
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:30,821
- And I've seen the policearresting people there

671
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,656

672
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,284
- Oh no, come on!

673
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,870
(rock music)

674
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,731
Daphne, I think yougot this all wrong.

675
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:04,358
Amy would never cometo a place like this.

676
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,315
She won't even go through themall parking lot by herself.

677
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,317
- Would you just listen to me.

678
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,027
You guys have to have acertain kind of attitude

679
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,487
when you're inthis part of town.

680
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:13,788
You've gotta looklike you belong, okay?

681
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,662
- Yeah, I get it.

682
00:54:16,712 --> 00:54:18,202
- Look, would you just listento me and nothing will happen.

683
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:20,128
Now look, I think one of usshould hold all the wallets

684
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,047
for safe-keeping.

685
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:22,918
You.

686
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,462
Now quiet and just be cool.

687
00:54:33,145 --> 00:54:35,511
- Nick, Kevin, Daphne?

688
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:38,351

01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:52,523
- Hey look, there's Amy!

904
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:58,655
Amy, are you okay?

905
01:12:59,834 --> 01:13:00,994
- I'm not sure.

906
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:03,121
Why am I dressed likea rock video slut?

907
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:05,124
- It's a long story,I'll explain later.

908
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:10,754
- You there.

909
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:12,881
Name, rank, serial number.

910
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,338
- Don't shoot me,I'm just an employee.

911
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:18,220
I don't even bookthe talent here.

912
01:13:21,522 --> 01:13:23,183
- Sergeant, can't you stop him?

913
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:24,434
- Why?

914
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:25,890
This is the besttraining he's ever had.

915
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,475
You could never getthis at boot camp.

916
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,151
- You call that training?

917
01:13:29,488 --> 01:13:30,898
He could kill somebody.

918
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,071
- War isn't pretty.

919
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,364
- Daphne and Nickare still inside,

920
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:36,488
we gotta try and help 'em.

921
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,035
- Wait.

922
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:40,283
I have a specialmission for you.

923
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:41,455
- You do?

924
01:13:41,792 --> 01:13:42,451
- Yes.

925
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:46,285
Have you ever consideredjoining the USO?

926
01:13:46,631 --> 01:13:47,620
- The USO?

927
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:48,624
- Yes, think of it.

928
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:50,046
Entertain thetroops, doing your part

929
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:52,296
for our country.

930
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,377
A small but patriotic gesturethat would be appreciated

931
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:58,214
by our boys off fightingaround the world.

932
01:13:58,559 --> 01:13:59,298
- I'll do it!

933
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:00,474
- Good!

934
01:14:00,811 --> 01:14:02,301
You can start right away.

935
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:05,309
I've got a truckload ofsoldiers out in the parking lot.

936
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:08,357
If you start now you can befinished with them by morning.

937
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:09,228
- What?

938
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:11,402
Nick, do something, yourSergeant's after me.

939
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:13,396
Just shoot him!

940
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:15,356
- One more time, babe.

941
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,487
Here, do it yourself.

942
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:18,817
- Stop wasting time.

943
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:20,448
- Nick!

944
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,405
- Maybe I should send Nick offto some third world country.

945
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,741
That'll give you allthe time that you need.

946
01:14:25,086 --> 01:14:26,371
- Let go of me!

947
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:27,497
- Or maybe I should get Nickout of the picture altogether.

948
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:30,671
Nick, this is yoursergeant speaking!

949
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:32,168
Save the troops!

950
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:34,041
That's an order!

951
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:35,968
- Nick! No, don't do it!

952
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:41,553
(explosion)

953
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:45,181
(screaming)

954
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,741
- That truck of soldiersis waiting outside.

955
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:06,165
It'll be a dream come true.

956
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,618
(growling)

957
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:14,044
- My dream can cometrue right now.

958
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:20,133
(explosion)

959
01:15:22,435 --> 01:15:24,141
I got the last of 'em.

960
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:38,614
(magical chimes)

961
01:15:57,219 --> 01:16:00,131
- Must've been arowdy crowd tonight.

962
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:03,510
- Hey, hey, hey Miss Sincere.

963
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,808
You know I really liked thatshow you were doing inside.

964
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,102
- Okay scumball, the showis over, why don't you just

965
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,601
climb back under your rock?

966
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,978
- Daphne, I could've done that.

967
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:15,059
- Oh, sorry.

968
01:16:16,781 --> 01:16:20,239
- Amy, I want you to know thatI'll always be there for you.

969
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:21,611
- Well you know, no one'sever really noticed me

970
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,488
before like that.

971
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,571
I mean, I've always just beenthought of as Daphne's friend.

972
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:30,579
This is the first time somebodycame up to me like that.

973
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,080
I kinda liked it.

974
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,537
- Amy I meant what I said.

975
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,588
I'm gonna prove it to you.

976
01:17:01,283 --> 01:17:02,398
- Where is he?

977
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:11,824
Mr. Comstock, I wasn'tsure if you'd still

978
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:13,375
be here this late.

979
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:14,667
- I'm on my way out the door.

980
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,370
What do you want now?

981
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:18,171
- The creatureshave broken loose.

982
01:17:18,509 --> 01:17:19,589
The same ones I triedto warn you about

983
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:21,667
when I first got my job here.

984
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:22,751
- Are you gonna try totell me that same story

985
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:25,463
about the hobgoblins again?

986
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:26,342
- Yes sir.

987
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:29,471
I'm glad you stillremember about them.

988
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:31,677
- How could I forgetthat nonsense?

989
01:17:32,022 --> 01:17:33,432
Now get outta hereand get back to work.

990
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:35,059
- But you don't understand.

991
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,983
They broke loose tonight,they're out there

992
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,651
somewhere in the city!

993
01:17:39,989 --> 01:17:41,695
I already sent the otherguard out to try to find them.

994
01:17:42,032 --> 01:17:43,522
- What?

995
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:45,904
You mean there's no one manningthe front gate right now?

996
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:46,950
- No sir.

997
01:17:47,288 --> 01:17:48,573
- This is preposterous.

998
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:50,575
You do know that ifsomething were to happen

999
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,577
to this studio whileno one was on duty,

1000
01:17:52,918 --> 01:17:55,034
our insurance willrefuse to pay off?

1001
01:17:55,379 --> 01:17:56,334
- Yes sir.

1002
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,208
- Well then getback on your post.

1003
01:17:58,549 --> 01:17:59,789
- You're not listening!

1004
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:01,544
I want to go out and find him.

1005
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:03,251
He must need my help by now!

1006
01:18:03,596 --> 01:18:05,757
- You are not going toleave your job to go out

1007
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,679
and chase some foolishness.

1008
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:10,975
If you walk off thislot, you are fired.

1009
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:13,932
- Well good.

1010
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:17,981
Saves me thetrouble of quitting.

1011
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:43,674
- Mr. McCreedy?

1012
01:18:47,014 --> 01:18:47,924
- Hey there.

1013
01:18:51,852 --> 01:18:53,558
We have a score to settle.

1014
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:56,262
(intense music)

1015
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:07,527
- Amy, this time I'mgonna make you proud.

1016
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:27,543
(punching)

1017
01:19:28,806 --> 01:19:30,216
- Amy, I think Kevin'sproved his bravery to you,

1018
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:32,764
would you tell him to stopbefore he kills himself?

1019
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:36,685
- For God's sake Kevin,stop before he kills you!

1020
01:20:12,182 --> 01:20:15,515
- Sometimes you win,sometimes you lose.

1021
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:24,562
- No!

1022
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:26,018
(gunshot)

1023
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:36,328
(screams)

1024
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,576
(magical chimes)

1025
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:47,415
- I'm sorry for sendingyou out on your own.

1026
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,966
I should have known thecreatures would try to destroy

1027
01:20:49,303 --> 01:20:49,837
you, also.

1028
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:52,878
- Where are they going now?

1029
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:54,713
- Back to theirhome in the vault.

1030
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:56,924
Hurry, there isn'tmuch time left.

1031
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:58,224
- Kevin, wait.

1032
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:02,138
(sultry music)

1033
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:08,856
Don't take too long.

1034
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:10,233
I'll be waiting.

1035
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:14,028
- Let's go!

1036
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:41,222
(suspenseful music)

1037
01:21:48,904 --> 01:21:49,814
- Do you think--

1038
01:21:50,155 --> 01:21:50,769
- Shhh.

1039
01:21:58,122 --> 01:21:59,362
I was right about them.

1040
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:01,196
They're back inside.

1041
01:22:02,668 --> 01:22:04,408
- Well maybe weshould get closer

1042
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:06,664
and lock them back inside again.

1043
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:09,542
- No, I've spent 30years guarding them,

1044
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:11,965
and I was firedfrom my job tonight.

1045
01:22:12,302 --> 01:22:14,509
I won't be around hereto keep an eye on them.

1046
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:15,927
- You were fired?

1047
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:20,424
Well, maybe I couldguard them from now on.

1048
01:22:22,104 --> 01:22:23,969
- Oh no, I don't want youto throw your life away

1049
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:25,645
the way I had to.

1050
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:28,478
There is a better way.

1051
01:22:32,364 --> 01:22:33,444
- Did you find them?

1052
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:35,238
- Yeah, they're backinside the vault.

1053
01:22:35,576 --> 01:22:36,986
- What are you gonna do to them?

1054
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:38,533
- I don't know.

1055
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:39,906
- Kevin.

1056
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:42,989
Did I ever tell youwhat I did in the war?

1057
01:22:43,333 --> 01:22:44,163
- No.

1058
01:22:45,419 --> 01:22:46,579
- Munitions.

1059
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,035
(beeping)

1060
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,291
(explosion)

1061
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:02,595
Isn't it ironic that theyshould pick a movie studio

1062
01:23:02,936 --> 01:23:04,142
to land?

1063
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,439
Unless they figured theybelonged in a dream factory.

1064
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:14,528
- You were my hero tonight.

1065
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:19,900
- What?

1066
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:21,735
Are you sure?

1067
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,115
- Yeah, I'm sure.

1068
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:31,669
- Daphne?

1069
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:32,746
- Yeah.

1070
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:34,251
- This is for you.

1071
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:37,046
- Really?

1072
01:23:38,138 --> 01:23:41,630
No one's ever givenme flowers before.

1073
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:43,260
- Oh, but there's lots ofthings I could show you

1074
01:23:43,602 --> 01:23:45,467
for the first time.

1075
01:23:45,812 --> 01:23:46,392
Nick.

1076
01:23:47,272 --> 01:23:48,512
- Nick?- [Amy] Nick?

1077
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:49,687
- Nick!

1078
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,265
- Daph, baby!

1079
01:23:52,736 --> 01:23:55,944
Told you guys I hadeverything under control.

1080
01:23:58,951 --> 01:23:59,610
Daphne.

1081
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:02,196
- Nicky.

1082
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:04,448
- [Both] Van!

1083
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:19,213

ASSAULT TO 13a DP

3
00:00:06 --> 00:00:10
ANDERSON, CALIFORNIA A Los Angeles ghetto.

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
Saturday, 3:10 am.

5
00:00:12 --> 00:00:13
You hear that?

6
00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
Let&#39;s go.

7
00:00:14 --> 00:00:17
High! Police! Drop your weapons and put your hands on your head!

8
00:00:17 --> 00:00:19
&lt;I&gt; &quot;Local news: Six members of a youth gang &lt;/ i&gt;

9
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
&lt;I&gt; were killed yesterday during a shootout ... &lt;/ i&gt;

10
00:00:21 --> 00:00:23
&lt;I&gt; with police in southern L. Commissioner Davidson ... &lt;/ i&gt;

11
00:00:23 --> 00:00:27
&lt;I&gt; called a news earlier today to talk about the shootings. &quot;&lt;/ I&gt;

12
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
&lt;I&gt; &quot;As Commissioner of LA I called ... &lt;/ i&gt;

13
00:00:30 --> 00:00:32
&lt;I&gt; This emergency conference. We are in crisis &lt;/ i&gt;

14
00:00:32 --> 00:00:34
&lt;I&gt; The problem of gangs are out of our control. &lt;/ I&gt;

15
00:00:34 --> 00:00:36
&lt;I&gt; Automatic weapons stolen from our arsenal ... &lt;/ i&gt;

16
00:00:36 --> 00:00:37
&lt;I&gt; were not recovered. &lt;/ I&gt;

17
00:00:37 --> 00:00:41
&lt;I&gt; Now we know that these weapons fell into the wrong hands. &lt;/ I&gt;

18
00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
&lt;I&gt; The police force is coming to deplorable extremes, it is true ... &lt;/ i&gt;

19
00:00:44 --> 00:00:47
&lt;I&gt; but the weapons are out there, and if people ... &lt;/ i&gt;

20
00:00:47 --> 00:00:51
&lt;I&gt; that has to organize will not have a chance! &quot;&lt;/ I&gt;

21
00:00:51 --> 00:00:53
&lt;I&gt; &quot;The Commissioner also said that many weapons were ...&quot; &lt;/ i&gt;

22
00:00:53 --> 00:00:54
For the six.

23
00:00:54 --> 00:00:55
&quot;Cholo&quot;

24
00:00:55 --> 00:00:56
For the six.

25
00:00:56 --> 00:01:00
Headquarters, here speaks Lieutenant Bishop. Do you have anything for me?

26
00:01:00 --> 00:01:01
&lt;I&gt; Please wait in line. &lt;/ I&gt;

27
00:01:01 --> 00:01:04
&lt;I&gt; If you look well, you might find something to do! &lt;/ I&gt;

28
00:01:04 --> 00:01:08
Captain Collins! What a surprise to hear your voice!

29
00:01:08 --> 00:01:09
&lt;I&gt; How are things going, Lieutenant? &lt;/ I&gt;

30
00:01:09 --> 00:01:14
All right, considering I got the stop for four minutes!

31
00:01:14 --> 00:01:19
&lt;I&gt; I have a small job for tonight. Mera supervision. &lt;/ I&gt;

32
00:01:19 --> 00:01:22
&lt;I&gt; Head to the 13th DP and assume the rank of Capt. Gordon. &lt;/ I&gt;

33
00:01:22 --> 00:01:23
The police station in the South Zone?

34
00:01:23 --> 00:01:24
&lt;I&gt; Roger that. &lt;/ I&gt;

35
00:01:24 --> 00:01:25
It will be closed tomorrow!

36
00:01:25 --> 00:01:28
What will I do there? Look at the walls?

37
00:01:28 --> 00:01:30
&lt;I&gt; Want to be a hero in your first job, Lieutenant? &lt;/ I&gt;

38
00:01:30 --> 00:01:32
Yes sir!

39
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
&lt;I&gt; There are no heroes, Bishop. Only men who fulfill orders. &lt;/ I&gt;

40
00:01:34 --> 00:01:37
Understood Sir. I&#39;m driving me to 13aDP.

41
00:01:37 --> 00:01:39
Over and out.

42
00:01:39 --> 00:01:40
Starker?

43
00:01:40 --> 00:01:41
This way.

44
00:01:41 --> 00:01:43
They took a fucking little job, huh?

45
00:01:43 --> 00:01:44
Better than many others.

46
00:01:44 --> 00:01:46
Go on a bus sentenced to death is not what I ...

47
00:01:46 --> 00:01:47
call &quot;Best&quot;.

48
00:01:47 --> 00:01:48
These are Wells and Claudel.

49
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
- He is fine? - Just a little cold!

50
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
- And Wilson? - In a special room ...

51
00:01:53 --> 00:01:54
This is Napoleon Wilson.

52
00:01:54 --> 00:01:55
Do you have a cigarette?

53
00:01:55 --> 00:01:57
Close the door.

54
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
I want you to know something, Wilson.

55
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
I hate to bring people to Death Row.

56
00:02:01 --> 00:02:03
If you try something, or anything ...

57
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
I have two armed policemen, ready to erase you.

58
00:02:05 --> 00:02:06
E cigarette, do you?

59
00:02:06 --> 00:02:07
You understood well, Wilson?

60
00:02:07 --> 00:02:10
Boiei in some places, but I understand the principal.

61
00:02:10 --> 00:02:11
Let&#39;s go.

62
00:02:11 --> 00:02:12
He fell off his chair.

63
00:02:12 --> 00:02:16
I no longer sit as well as before.

64
00:02:16 --> 00:02:16
Lift it.

65
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
I&#39;m jealous, Wilson. They gave escort and these chains ...

66
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
cool and left me almost free!

67
00:02:21 --> 00:02:22
What is it?

68
00:02:22 --> 00:02:23
Do you have a cigarette?

69
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
- I have, but I will not give you. - Why not?

70
00:02:26 --> 00:02:28
They can hurt you. Cigarettes kill.

71
00:02:28 --> 00:02:31
You do not like competition?

72
00:02:31 --> 00:02:32
Do you think the &quot;King of Shit&quot;?

73
00:02:32 --> 00:02:33
Sometimes it hits.

74
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
Enough talking and walk!

75
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
I stretch myself a little?

76
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
I&#39;ll be chained there, hours after going ...

77
00:02:40 --> 00:02:43
put me in a cell, perhaps for another nine years!

78
00:02:43 --> 00:02:44
I&#39;ll see current ad nauseam!

79
00:02:44 --> 00:02:45
It&#39;s ok.

80
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
Goodbye, Wilson! I&#39;ll miss you...

81
00:02:47 --> 00:02:48
Cascade your director.

82
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
You should tell the truth ...

83
00:02:50 --> 00:02:54
or a white lie. Sometimes it helps.

84
00:02:54 --> 00:02:57
He no longer stands as well as before.

85
00:02:57 --> 00:02:59
&lt;I&gt; &quot;With sunspots, the ...&quot; &lt;/ i&gt;

86
00:02:59 --> 00:03:03
&lt;I&gt; &quot;Young dead were identified as members ... &lt;/ i&gt;

87
00:03:03 --> 00:03:08
&lt;I&gt; the gang Street Thunder. &quot;Strange was noted ... &lt;/ i&gt;

88
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
&lt;I&gt; racial mixing between members of the gang, which indicates ... &quot;&lt;/ i&gt;

89
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
Let&#39;s recap. What will you say to Margaret?

90
00:03:14 --> 00:03:14
Forgot it.

91
00:03:14 --> 00:03:17
He will say, &quot;Margaret, to live with us, now that Fred is gone&quot;

92
00:03:17 --> 00:03:19
&quot;Margaret, to live with us now that Fred died.&quot;

93
00:03:19 --> 00:03:20
- &quot;Departed&quot; - &quot;Departed.&quot;

94
00:03:20 --> 00:03:26
&quot;We have a room waiting for you.&quot; - &quot;We have a room waiting for you.&quot;

95
00:03:26 --> 00:03:29
&quot;And I said to Dad, if you do not come and live with us ...

96
00:03:29 --> 00:03:33
- I&#39;ll run away from home. &quot;- This will give not paste!

97
00:03:33 --> 00:03:34
You&#39;re right. Forget this.

98
00:03:34 --> 00:03:35
I&#39;m starving!

99
00:03:35 --> 00:03:39
You will prefer to eat and sleep after we get out of this neighborhood!

100
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
Well, I still think it would be better we find a place to eat.

101
00:03:42 --> 00:03:45
This is the wrong street ... I can not find the street ...

102
00:03:45 --> 00:03:46
Why not ask for them?

103
00:03:46 --> 00:03:50
Bon Air Place ... must stay two blocks away.

104
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
Aunt Seward said police serve to ...

105
00:03:52 --> 00:03:53
answer questions and help us.

106
00:03:53 --> 00:03:55
Aunt Seward says that because never put ...

107
00:03:55 --> 00:03:56
feet out to the sixth grade.

108
00:03:56 --> 00:03:57
All right, honey.

109
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
Hi. I&#39;m Lieutenant Bishop.

110
00:03:59 --> 00:04:02
One moment, I&#39;ll tell the captain is here.

111
00:04:02 --> 00:04:04
- Hello, Lieutenant. - Hi.

112
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
- I&#39;m Leigh. - Bishop Ephraim.

113
00:04:06 --> 00:04:07
This is Julie.

114
00:04:07 --> 00:04:08
Hi, Julie.

115
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
- Things are quiet here. - For a change.

116
00:04:10 --> 00:04:11
We arrived on time.

117
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
It seems so. When you are going to move?

118
00:04:14 --> 00:04:17
Should turn off the light and phones tomorrow at ten o&#39;clock.

119
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
It seems even the end.

120
00:04:19 --> 00:04:20
- Want some coffee, Lieutenant? - Yes thanks.

121
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
- I just do. I&#39;ll get. - Thank you.

122
00:04:22 --> 00:04:23
Hello, 7814.

123
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
I feel, but the station was transferred.

124
00:04:25 --> 00:04:26
I&#39;ll give you the new phone.

125
00:04:26 --> 00:04:27
You&#39;re welcome.

126
00:04:27 --> 00:04:29
Cia. TelefÃ´nica should do it.

127
00:04:29 --> 00:04:30
They were coming at five.

128
00:04:30 --> 00:04:32
Hello. Can I speak to your supervisor?

129
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
Here is the 734-3743 ...

130
00:04:34 --> 00:04:34
Black?

131
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
For more than 30 years.

132
00:04:36 --> 00:04:36
Excuse me...

133
00:04:36 --> 00:04:37
Two sugar cubes.

134
00:04:37 --> 00:04:39
I grew 4 blocks from here.

135
00:04:39 --> 00:04:42
I had 4 or 5 years old, my father sent me here with a ticket.

136
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
The detective read it and said: &quot;we hold GURIS ...

137
00:04:45 --> 00:04:46
who misbehave. &quot;

138
00:04:46 --> 00:04:50
When he went to call my father, I wrote on his desk.

139
00:04:50 --> 00:04:52
For months, I feared that he found

140
00:04:52 --> 00:04:53
and would arrest me!

141
00:04:53 --> 00:04:54
Why did your father sent you here?

142
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
Why say &quot;bad words&quot; in front of Mom.

143
00:04:57 --> 00:04:58
What wrote on his desk?

144
00:04:58 --> 00:04:59
Rather bold for a little boy.

145
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
His father did not take you from Anderson early enough.

146
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
The captain will serve you now, Lieutenant.

147
00:05:04 --> 00:05:05
I&#39;ll be there.

148
00:05:05 --> 00:05:06
By the way...

149
00:05:06 --> 00:05:09
Nobody took me from Anderson when I was a baby.

150
00:05:09 --> 00:05:11
I left alone, when I was twenty years.

151
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
- Have fun with your new station. - I&#39;m going to have fun.

152
00:05:13 --> 00:05:14
Thanks for the coffee.

153
00:05:14 --> 00:05:16
They got out? For put them out!

154
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
Fold the patrols! And send them over here!

155
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
And go to call another station that ...

156
00:05:21 --> 00:05:22
is not being turned off!

157
00:05:22 --> 00:05:22
What night!

158
00:05:22 --> 00:05:24
We have a 3-20 every 15 min.

159
00:05:24 --> 00:05:30
Robberies eight assaults, and not even eight o&#39;clock!

160
00:05:30 --> 00:05:31
Can be sunspots.

161
00:05:31 --> 00:05:33
Atmospheric pressure.

162
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
I heard on the radio.

163
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
At seven o&#39;clock, I go to the new police station in Ellendale.

164
00:05:38 --> 00:05:41
You assume here until Weaver arrive at four o&#39;clock.

165
00:05:41 --> 00:05:44
All you have to do is answer the phone and give orders.

166
00:05:44 --> 00:05:47
Maybe someone still think this is still a police station.

167
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
What about dependencies?

168
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
Only a few cells and the bathroom.

169
00:05:51 --> 00:05:53
Still I do not understand why this place is still running.

170
00:05:53 --> 00:05:58
It works and does not work, Lieutenant. It is in transition.

171
00:05:58 --> 00:06:04
Always be suspicious when the Central pushes you a &quot;supervisory work.&quot;

172
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
This here will end quickly.

173
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
I&#39;ll talk to Wilson. Take cover.

174
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
Mind if I sit next to her?

175
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
- You smoke? - You asked me that before.

176
00:06:14 --> 00:06:16
- But he did not answer. - I do not smoke.

177
00:06:16 --> 00:06:17
Now he answered.

178
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
It&#39;s getting dark.

179
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
In my position, the days are like women.

180
00:06:22 --> 00:06:28
Each is precious, but all end up leaving you.

181
00:06:28 --> 00:06:28
What you want?

182
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
- Accepts a balinha? - You strip.

183
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
You are curious about me, or came to piss me off?

184
00:06:33 --> 00:06:37
- I do not understand you, Wilson. - Curious.

185
00:06:37 --> 00:06:42
- You&#39;re not psychotic, not stupid ... - But I&#39;m an asshole!

186
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
You can not take everything away from me.

187
00:06:44 --> 00:06:46
Why did you kill these men?

188
00:06:46 --> 00:06:47
I always ask the same thing.

189
00:06:47 --> 00:06:49
always say the same thing.

190
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
I consulted a psychic who told me: &quot;Son ...

191
00:06:51 --> 00:06:53
It has something strange to you. &quot;

192
00:06:53 --> 00:06:57
&quot;Something to do with death.&quot; I was young,

193
00:06:57 --> 00:06:58
and I believed him.

194
00:06:58 --> 00:07:02
- And he was right. - This is not an answer.

195
00:07:02 --> 00:07:03
For me serve.

196
00:07:03 --> 00:07:06
Where&#39;d you get that name, &quot;Napoleon&quot;?

197
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
- I&#39;ll tell you someday. - When?

198
00:07:08 --> 00:07:09
Before I die.

199
00:07:09 --> 00:07:13
I will do everything possible to be around when your time comes.

200
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
This guy is bad!

201
00:07:15 --> 00:07:18
I thought the director had said it was a cold!

202
00:07:18 --> 00:07:19
The guy is bad!

203
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
- How much for the Presidio? - Six more hours.

204
00:07:23 --> 00:07:25
We&#39;ll have to stop.

205
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
What is the nearest police station?

206
00:07:27 --> 00:07:29
Anderson.

207
00:07:29 --> 00:07:32
- What is the same address? - Dad!

208
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
- Dad, the ice cream! - One moment, Margareth.

209
00:07:35 --> 00:07:36
Can you give me an ice cream?

210
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
- Sorry, honey, I&#39;ve closed. - But the tune is playing!

211
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
Please, I want an ice cream.

212
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
- What flavor? - Vanilla mixed.

213
00:07:43 --> 00:07:46
Please ... give all my money, but do not hurt me, please!

214
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
Hey! This is common vanilla!

215
00:07:49 --> 00:07:50
I wanted mixed vanilla!

216
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
Okay, Margaret, we&#39;ll be there in a few minutes.

217
00:07:52 --> 00:07:53
Take it...

218
00:07:53 --> 00:07:56
under the truck seat!

219
00:07:56 --> 00:08:00
DISTRICT TRANSFERRED TO PLACE 1977 Ellendale.

220
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
- Hello, Lieutenant. Special Agent Starker. - Bishop Ephraim.

221
00:08:02 --> 00:08:04
I&#39;m going to the Presidio Cenola three prisoners

222
00:08:04 --> 00:08:07
Half an hour ago, one of them got sick. It seems serious.

223
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
- What does he has? - I do not know, but I have to put it ...

224
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
- In a cell until we call a doctor. - I did not see the sign.

225
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
The district is no longer here. He was transferred.

226
00:08:15 --> 00:08:17
- All right, but you&#39;re here! - Go cut the light ...

227
00:08:17 --> 00:08:18
tomorrow morning.

228
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
You&#39;re telling me you can not put them in a cage?

229
00:08:20 --> 00:08:23
- If you go down the main street, ten blocks ...

230
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
Look, I have no time to argue!

231
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
What that guy has can be contagious!

232
00:08:28 --> 00:08:32
Just put it in a cell, call the doctor ...

233
00:08:32 --> 00:08:34
All right, bring it here.

234
00:08:34 --> 00:08:37
- This guy is ... someone you know? - Napoleon Wilson.

235
00:08:37 --> 00:08:38
Do not play!

236
00:08:38 --> 00:08:39
You have cigarette?

237
00:08:39 --> 00:08:41
No. Sorry.

238
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
I saw a smoking here.

239
00:08:44 --> 00:08:45
You can scrounge a cigarette for me?

240
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
- I came to see the patient, ma&#39;am? - I&#39;m just passing through.

241
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
I admit, Wilson ... you&#39;re right ...

242
00:08:50 --> 00:08:54
the &quot;King of Shit,&quot; even in this position!

243
00:08:54 --> 00:08:57
Come on, man, calm down! Speak!

244
00:08:57 --> 00:08:58
Speak!

245
00:08:58 --> 00:08:59
Lieutenant!

246
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
- Who? - One minute.

247
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
How much action for a disabled police station!

248
00:09:03 --> 00:09:04
He&#39;s in shock, Chaney.

249
00:09:04 --> 00:09:07
- Can not talk. - He said he was followed.

250
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
Operator? I&#39;m waiting for ten minutes!

251
00:09:09 --> 00:09:12
As well? Where did he go? Have breakfast?

252
00:09:12 --> 00:09:16
What you mean? You have no other doctor available?

253
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
Coffee Time? For him take the coffee break!

254
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
Yes, I ... I wait in line! These police doctors ...

255
00:09:22 --> 00:09:25
- Calm down, relax! - There&#39;s no one out there!

256
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
- Chaney, help me to take him to the office. - Calm...

257
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
Hello! They cut the line!

258
00:09:30 --> 00:09:32
- We have a blanket? - Here&#39;s one.

259
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
Wrap it in him. Keep it warm. I&#39;ll call a doctor!

260
00:09:35 --> 00:09:39
Luck! First let me waiting, and now I can not line!

261
00:09:39 --> 00:09:41
- The line has not dropped. - As well?

262
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
The phone went dead!

263
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
The phone must be turned off before.

264
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
I&#39;m leaving. Lieutenant, this station ...

265
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
It looks like a diner!

266
00:09:49 --> 00:09:50
Thank you very much!

267
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
- He said he shot at his daughter. - At where?

268
00:09:53 --> 00:09:54
I do not know. Barely understand what he says.

269
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
And the phone?

270
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
- What now? - Power loss.

271
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
But the street lights are still lit!

272
00:10:01 --> 00:10:03
I&#39;ll use the car radio to call the district.

273
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
Chaney stumbled!

274
00:10:05 --> 00:10:07
He did not stumble. He was shot.

275
00:10:07 --> 00:10:10
- What? - Looks like it&#39;s still alive.

276
00:10:10 --> 00:10:13
- But we do not hear anything! - Silencers.

277
00:10:13 --> 00:10:14
Used silencers.

278
00:10:14 --> 00:10:18
- Are behind those trees. - Why shoot at the police station?

279
00:10:18 --> 00:10:20
Starker! Lock the doors! Stay away from the windows!

280
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
The phone is cut, the lights go out ...

281
00:10:22 --> 00:10:23
and still call this station!

282
00:10:23 --> 00:10:26
Open the door! Let me in!

283
00:10:26 --> 00:10:30
If you will leave us here, at least take the handcuffs!

284
00:10:30 --> 00:10:31
- Leigh!

285
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
I want you watching the windows.

286
00:10:33 --> 00:10:34
Be right back.

287
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
- Are you all right? - Very good, as always.

288
00:10:36 --> 00:10:37
What&#39;s up out there?

289
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
Hey! We have the right to know what&#39;s going on!

290
00:10:41 --> 00:10:45
It&#39;s always like that. For us, life is only beaten.

291
00:10:45 --> 00:10:47
I think it was. I do not see anyone.

292
00:10:47 --> 00:10:48
Do you have any exit by the funds?

293
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
Only the garage door. But to no avail.

294
00:10:51 --> 00:10:52
Because?

295
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
It has a high wall in the back. The only way to ...

296
00:10:55 --> 00:10:56
Leave is giving back ahead.

297
00:10:56 --> 00:10:57
Come with me.

298
00:10:57 --> 00:11:02
- And the other houses around? - Empty. Sentenced homeless.

299
00:11:02 --> 00:11:03
Nobody lives here?

300
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
There are people in two houses down the block.

301
00:11:05 --> 00:11:08
- How far are they here? - 500 or 600 yards.

302
00:11:08 --> 00:11:11
- You mean, no one heard anything. - This is impossible!

303
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
Used silencers. They drowned out the shots.

304
00:11:13 --> 00:11:14
Only they heard smashing windows.

305
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
Someone must have heard it!

306
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
I think they left! Take a look!

307
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
- I found these magnesium bullets. - We do not have signaling weapon.

308
00:11:22 --> 00:11:25
I thought so. Let&#39;s open it.

309
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
- Nothing moving. - Saw? If you leave, you will see ...

310
00:11:28 --> 00:11:33
- They are gone! - I can not open it!

311
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
- This thing looks solid! - What are you doing?

312
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
- I had to think of a way out! - Do you have any suggestions?

313
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
We&#39;ll stay here and wait for someone to appear, right?

314
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
We are in the city center, a police station!

315
00:11:43 --> 00:11:44
Someone will appear.

316
00:11:44 --> 00:11:47
They should appear within 15 to 20 minutes. They will come.

317
00:11:47 --> 00:11:51
They killed the guy&#39;s phone. It is hanging on the pole.

318
00:11:51 --> 00:11:54
You must have cut all lines of the court.

319
00:11:54 --> 00:11:55
What does that mean?

320
00:11:55 --> 00:11:59
If the lines fell in every area, no one can call the police.

321
00:11:59 --> 00:12:03
The telephone does not know automatically when you have an off line?

322
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
Wait a minute. There they are.

323
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
They blocked the street.

324
00:12:07 --> 00:12:09
Someone coming.

325
00:12:09 --> 00:12:10
What does that mean?

326
00:12:10 --> 00:12:15
- They&#39;re marking us, or something. - Let me guess...

327
00:12:15 --> 00:12:19
We are under siege! Beleaguered, damn it!

328
00:12:19 --> 00:12:20
They want that guy!

329
00:12:20 --> 00:12:21
Why not give it to them?

330
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
And do not come to me with these civilized looks!

331
00:12:23 --> 00:12:29
This D. P is under my authority. He came to help. We will.

332
00:12:29 --> 00:12:32
- All right, Lieutenant. - Thank you.

333
00:12:32 --> 00:12:33
Get them in the cells!

334
00:12:33 --> 00:12:35
Come on, girl ... quickly!

335
00:12:35 --> 00:12:38
Get out of here! Quickly!

336
00:12:38 --> 00:12:39
Give me a gun!

337
00:12:39 --> 00:12:41
They are coming down the hall!

338
00:12:41 --> 00:12:44
- I can not endure more - Shit!

339
00:12:44 --> 00:12:45
The window!

340
00:12:45 --> 00:12:46
Stay tuned!

341
00:12:46 --> 00:12:47
Julie?

342
00:12:47 --> 00:12:51
Wilson, will barricaded the door. Come help me.

343
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
Wells, watch the front, and the officers.

344
00:12:54 --> 00:12:58
- You saved my life. Twice. - Two?

345
00:12:58 --> 00:13:05
The first out there on the bus. I thought I had been mistaken, and let roll.

346
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
And now she saved me again, when he took in the cells.

347
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
You must be a decent guy, to keep me alive.

348
00:13:10 --> 00:13:11
I want to keep everyone alive.

349
00:13:11 --> 00:13:16
This time I&#39;m sure they heard us. The cars should arrive in 5 min.

350
00:13:16 --> 00:13:17
Explosive.

351
00:13:17 --> 00:13:20
- If a bullet hits it ... - Look at this!

352
00:13:20 --> 00:13:25
- How are you doing? - I can not move my fucking arm.

353
00:13:25 --> 00:13:28
Perfect timing. You did well.

354
00:13:28 --> 00:13:31
If it had been, maybe Julie was alive.

355
00:13:31 --> 00:13:33
They are removing the cars.

356
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
I do not believe. They are parking away. Because?

357
00:13:35 --> 00:13:38
By far the street seems normal. As if nothing had happened.

358
00:13:38 --> 00:13:44
Anything? They killed police! And a desk, and a prisoner!

359
00:13:44 --> 00:13:46
We killed some of them! That&#39;s nothing?

360
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
Where are the bodies?

361
00:13:47 --> 00:13:48
They took the bodies!

362
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
- How did it so quickly? - The fairy godmother must have helped them.

363
00:13:51 --> 00:13:54
You really metidinho the smart, huh?

364
00:13:54 --> 00:13:58
- The guys back there also are gone. - They took the body Starker.

365
00:13:58 --> 00:14:01
What a pity. I promised to say something to him.

366
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
What&#39;s it? What they did?

367
00:14:04 --> 00:14:08
They hid every sign that there was a shooting here!

368
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
What I wanted to know is ... why all this started?

369
00:14:11 --> 00:14:19
- He came here ... damn, for 30 minutes! - All because of a man?

370
00:14:19 --> 00:14:23
Do not forget the &quot;Cholo&quot;. That they brought to us.

371
00:14:23 --> 00:14:28
- Cholo? - What happened? It was white!

372
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
Nobody told me anything on a Cholo!

373
00:14:31 --> 00:14:34
What is it? What does that mean?

374
00:14:34 --> 00:14:38
It means they are shitting for us!

375
00:14:38 --> 00:14:43
Not afraid to die. They want to fuck us ...

376
00:14:43 --> 00:14:44
no matter what it costs.

377
00:14:44 --> 00:14:48
- It only death. - How do you know about it?

378
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
I spent time in jail with one of these ...

379
00:14:51 --> 00:14:52
gang members, motherfuckers.

380
00:14:52 --> 00:14:55
This can not happen!

381
00:14:55 --> 00:14:58
Not in the middle of town! Not today!

382
00:14:58 --> 00:15:00
We are in the real world. Wake up, man.

383
00:15:00 --> 00:15:03
The shooting lasted a minute and a half ... two!

384
00:15:03 --> 00:15:05
I do not think anyone heard us!

385
00:15:05 --> 00:15:07
And if you hear? What would see?

386
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
An empty street. An abandoned station.

387
00:15:10 --> 00:15:12
Maybe someone from the new station appears.

388
00:15:12 --> 00:15:15
Meanwhile, I have a plan.

389
00:15:15 --> 00:15:19
His name is: save your ass. It comprises:

390
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
We jump through that window, and ran ...

391
00:15:21 --> 00:15:22
like a motherfucker!

392
00:15:22 --> 00:15:27
Wells, I can not let you do that.

393
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
I&#39;m not asking you to leave!

394
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
Will clip you before turning the corner.

395
00:15:31 --> 00:15:32
It is on the side of those who, Wilson?

396
00:15:32 --> 00:15:36
No side here. We are all together.

397
00:15:36 --> 00:15:39
I was shot again tonight.

398
00:15:39 --> 00:15:41
I&#39;m not to repeat the dose.

399
00:15:41 --> 00:15:45
I just wanted to say one thing. If they do not catch you ...

400
00:15:45 --> 00:15:49
and I&#39;m praying for it, I hope you have the decency ...

401
00:15:49 --> 00:15:55
to stop at a police station and warn that we are here!

402
00:15:55 --> 00:15:58
All this speech and this gun was not even loaded!

403
00:15:58 --> 00:16:00
Shit silencer! I was shooting with a gun ...

404
00:16:00 --> 00:16:02
discharged and did not even know.

405
00:16:02 --> 00:16:06
&quot;Timing&quot; perfect. You are good.

406
00:16:06 --> 00:16:07
On occasion.

407
00:16:07 --> 00:16:09
The problem is that it is not the only one.

408
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
I only have three more bullets.

409
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
- Wilson? - 3 bullets.

410
00:16:13 --> 00:16:14
- Leigh? - 2 bullets.

411
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
There should be more ammunition. We have to find.

412
00:16:17 --> 00:16:18
Does anyone have a cigarette?

413
00:16:18 --> 00:16:19
Got a light?

414
00:16:19 --> 00:16:25
&lt;I&gt; We have received reports of fires or shooting nearby. &lt;/ I&gt;

415
00:16:25 --> 00:16:34
&lt;I&gt; The phones do not work. The local police station does not respond. &lt;/ I&gt;

416
00:16:34 --> 00:16:38
We have a war going on here, and we have not found!

417
00:16:38 --> 00:16:44
Here is unit 7. We are prowling the quadrant 4. All quiet here.

418
00:16:44 --> 00:16:48
Nothing unusual to report. We will give another turn.

419
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
I suggest reinforcements and a helicopter. Exchange.

420
00:16:50 --> 00:16:54
When in availability, we send them to your quadrant.

421
00:16:54 --> 00:16:57
&lt;I&gt; All helicopters are currently in use. &lt;/ I&gt;

422
00:16:57 --> 00:17:00
How do they want us to find something without helicopters?

423
00:17:00 --> 00:17:05
- Overwork Saturdays. - Unit 7 speaking. 10-4.

424
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
Let&#39;s check that street!

425
00:17:08 --> 00:17:09
- The Gramency? - IT IS.

426
00:17:09 --> 00:17:10
But there&#39;s nothing there, except the old police station.

427
00:17:10 --> 00:17:11
- But let&#39;s not go there? - For what?

428
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
- It will work. - You&#39;re crazy!

429
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
- Are you sure about the basement? - I have.

430
00:17:15 --> 00:17:16
- What if you&#39;re wrong? - I said I was sure.

431
00:17:16 --> 00:17:19
- But what if you&#39;re wrong? - I spent five years here. I know the place.

432
00:17:19 --> 00:17:20
It sounds good to me.

433
00:17:20 --> 00:17:23
It seems to me hell, but it&#39;s all we have.

434
00:17:23 --> 00:17:24
Who will?

435
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
I do not know how to hotwire a car.

436
00:17:26 --> 00:17:27
I&#39;m a cop!

437
00:17:27 --> 00:17:29
It has to be me or Wells.

438
00:17:29 --> 00:17:31
Shit, shit, shit !!!

439
00:17:31 --> 00:17:34
What&#39;s going on? Have not we get the chance.

440
00:17:34 --> 00:17:37
- I will lose! - What pessimism, Wells!

441
00:17:37 --> 00:17:42
I lose! I&#39;ve always had bad luck! How do you think did I get here?

442
00:17:42 --> 00:17:44
Maybe this will change.

443
00:17:44 --> 00:17:46
You have to change. And if we do not have a coin,

444
00:17:46 --> 00:17:48
we can do something else.

445
00:17:48 --> 00:17:50
- What? - Take in hand.

446
00:17:50 --> 00:17:53
One, two, three, four, five, thousand, who miss this ...

447
00:17:53 --> 00:17:55
It goes to the son of a bitch!

448
00:17:55 --> 00:17:57
I said I was going to lose! Damn, let&#39;s do it again!

449
00:17:57 --> 00:17:59
We do not have time for this!

450
00:17:59 --> 00:18:00
Why she got out?

451
00:18:00 --> 00:18:03
If I can do with one arm, all right.

452
00:18:03 --> 00:18:05
Or sign of them. Let&#39;s go.

453
00:18:05 --> 00:18:07
You want me to show where it is?

454
00:18:07 --> 00:18:08
I take him down. Stay here.

455
00:18:08 --> 00:18:10
It is near the furnace. You can not go wrong.

456
00:18:10 --> 00:18:11
No one will give me good luck?

457
00:18:11 --> 00:18:12
Good luck.

458
00:18:12 --> 00:18:15
Look at this. Two strips wishing me good luck.

459
00:18:15 --> 00:18:18
I&#39;m fucked!

460
00:18:18 --> 00:18:23
5 feet down to the south, another 20 ahead and then I leave the culvert.

461
00:18:23 --> 00:18:24
That&#39;s right.

462
00:18:24 --> 00:18:26
What I wanted to know it is what is the difference ...

463
00:18:26 --> 00:18:29
between it here, and what I intended to do 20 minutes ago?

464
00:18:29 --> 00:18:31
- None. - But you stopped me!

465
00:18:31 --> 00:18:31
Why not now?

466
00:18:31 --> 00:18:32
One thing.

467
00:18:32 --> 00:18:36
When you leave here, call the cops before crossing the border.

468
00:18:36 --> 00:18:37
What makes you think I do that?

469
00:18:37 --> 00:18:39
See you, Wilson.

470
00:18:39 --> 00:18:42
The basement would not be a bad place to stay if they come.

471
00:18:42 --> 00:18:44
The only access is the hall.

472
00:18:44 --> 00:18:47
We could stop them for a few minutes.

473
00:18:47 --> 00:18:48
But we would be trapped down there.

474
00:18:48 --> 00:18:51
We have only eight bullets to defend ourselves.

475
00:18:51 --> 00:18:52
And here above is free area.

476
00:18:52 --> 00:18:53
You will see someone.

477
00:18:53 --> 00:18:55
A man with faith. rare quality.

478
00:18:55 --> 00:18:56
Is that you?

479
00:18:56 --> 00:18:58
I do not think that will rescue me.

480
00:18:58 --> 00:19:00
Maybe you are with the wrong people.

481
00:19:00 --> 00:19:01
I&#39;m in the police for five years.

482
00:19:01 --> 00:19:03
enough time to grow hair in stone.

483
00:19:03 --> 00:19:04
Is that you?

484
00:19:04 --> 00:19:05
I believe only a man.

485
00:19:05 --> 00:19:06
clean way. Let&#39;s go!

486
00:19:06 --> 00:19:08
What the hell is he waiting for?

487
00:19:08 --> 00:19:09
All clear ahead.

488
00:19:09 --> 00:19:11
Come on fucking!

489
00:19:11 --> 00:19:12
He left!

490
00:19:12 --> 00:19:13
Come on, son of a bitch!

491
00:19:13 --> 00:19:14
They saw!

492
00:19:14 --> 00:19:15
Save the bullets.

493
00:19:15 --> 00:19:16
He managed! Got!

494
00:19:16 --> 00:19:17
Let&#39;s go! Go!

495
00:19:17 --> 00:19:18
He will get!

496
00:19:18 --> 00:19:20
Maybe it&#39;s just a breaking window!

497
00:19:20 --> 00:19:21
Son of a bitch!

498
00:19:21 --> 00:19:25
Shit, Wells. You never will see the border.

499
00:19:25 --> 00:19:27
We have to go to the basement. Use all the time ...

500
00:19:27 --> 00:19:32
and ammunition we have. Wells already was. Look.

501
00:19:32 --> 00:19:33
Let&#39;s go.

502
00:19:33 --> 00:19:35
We can make a barricade. Take these ...

503
00:19:35 --> 00:19:37
plaques and to block the entrance.

504
00:19:37 --> 00:19:39
- And what we will use for this? - What can find.

505
00:19:39 --> 00:19:41
- Still have a gun? - Two bullets.

506
00:19:41 --> 00:19:42
I keep telling us?

507
00:19:42 --> 00:19:45
Save for the first two scoundrels who appear ahead.

508
00:19:45 --> 00:19:47
We should have given a weapon to Wells.

509
00:19:47 --> 00:19:49
Why do not we kill them when they come?

510
00:19:49 --> 00:19:50
You know that.

511
00:19:50 --> 00:19:54
I do not know who he is, what happened to him, or what he did.

512
00:19:54 --> 00:19:56
It can be anyone.

513
00:19:56 --> 00:20:00
- But I wanted to know one thing - Only one?

514
00:20:00 --> 00:20:03
There are other, but that is what matters most.

515
00:20:03 --> 00:20:04
What is?

516
00:20:04 --> 00:20:06
Why did you end up here soon?

517
00:20:06 --> 00:20:08
There are two things that I teach you ...

518
00:20:08 --> 00:20:10
even if they cost me life.

519
00:20:10 --> 00:20:11
First, if a man

520
00:20:11 --> 00:20:13
is injured, do not take on the trail.

521
00:20:13 --> 00:20:14
And the other?

522
00:20:14 --> 00:20:15
Come with me, Wilson!

523
00:20:15 --> 00:20:16
It seems that your timing is terrible.

524
00:20:16 --> 00:20:17
The history of my life.

525
00:20:17 --> 00:20:19
I was born in the wrong timing.

526
00:20:19 --> 00:20:21
explosive tank, magnesium capsules.

527
00:20:21 --> 00:20:23
I tie the capsules beneath the tank.

528
00:20:23 --> 00:20:28
I&#39;m at the door with the rifle, shoot in the capsules,

529
00:20:28 --> 00:20:29
overflow the tank.

530
00:20:29 --> 00:20:31
We will blow them up.

531
00:20:31 --> 00:20:33
And what will prevent us burst together?

532
00:20:33 --> 00:20:35
Let&#39;s hold that sign on the front door ...

533
00:20:35 --> 00:20:37
to protect us.

534
00:20:37 --> 00:20:38
You can hit here?

535
00:20:38 --> 00:20:40
I have 3 bullets. That is enough.

536
00:20:40 --> 00:20:41
I never argue with a confident man.

537
00:20:41 --> 00:20:41
Let&#39;s go.

538
00:20:41 --> 00:20:42
Unit 7 speaking.

539
00:20:42 --> 00:20:44
We are checking the Gramency stretch with Imperial.

540
00:20:44 --> 00:20:45
All dark, quiet and deserted.

541
00:20:45 --> 00:20:47
Waiting instructions. Exchange

542
00:20:47 --> 00:20:49
What are those cars doing there?

543
00:20:49 --> 00:20:51
You must have people working.

544
00:20:51 --> 00:20:54
This station will be changing in the next two weeks.

545
00:20:54 --> 00:20:56
We&#39;re wasting time here.

546
00:20:56 --> 00:20:57
I do not know...

547
00:20:57 --> 00:20:58
There&#39;s something strange here ...

548
00:20:58 --> 00:21:00
&lt;I&gt; We have received more reports of shots ... &lt;/ i&gt;

549
00:21:00 --> 00:21:02
We did not hear anything, dammit!

550
00:21:02 --> 00:21:03
&lt;I&gt; According to our reports ... &lt;/ i&gt;

551
00:21:03 --> 00:21:06
&lt;I&gt; need no one knew the location of the shooting. &lt;/ I&gt;

552
00:21:06 --> 00:21:09
&lt;I&gt; Also gone, a car of Cia. Phone ... &lt;/ i&gt;

553
00:21:09 --> 00:21:11
&lt;I&gt; We are sending reinforcements. &lt;/ I&gt;

554
00:21:11 --> 00:21:14
Unit 7. We have nothing to report,

555
00:21:14 --> 00:21:17
We do not find the location of the shooting.

556
00:21:17 --> 00:21:19
I repeat the request for a helicopter.

557
00:21:19 --> 00:21:22
&lt;I&gt; When you&#39;re on availability, we will send them to your quadrant. &lt;/ I&gt;

558
00:21:22 --> 00:21:23
Unit 7. Understood.

559
00:21:23 --> 00:21:26
- There&#39;s something wrong here! - Listen to this!

560
00:21:26 --> 00:21:28
Rain! It was just what was needed!

561
00:21:28 --> 00:21:30
It has to do with the old 13a. DP!

562
00:21:30 --> 00:21:32
Hey! This is not rain! What the fuck ...

563
00:21:32 --> 00:21:33
Jesus Christ!

564
00:21:33 --> 00:21:37
Unit 7! Emergency! Calling all cars!

565
00:21:37 --> 00:21:38
Emergency! Emergency

566
00:21:38 --> 00:21:41
Molotov cocktails. They will burn it here.

567
00:21:41 --> 00:21:42
It&#39;s the time!

568
00:21:42 --> 00:21:43
Excuse me.

569
00:21:43 --> 00:21:44
Whistles well.

570
00:21:44 --> 00:21:45
Can I ask you a question?

571
00:21:45 --> 00:21:47
As a cop, I thought it would ...

572
00:21:47 --> 00:21:48
at any moment.

573
00:21:48 --> 00:21:50
Where&#39;d you get that name, Napoleon Wilson?

574
00:21:50 --> 00:21:52
I tell you anytime.

575
00:21:52 --> 00:21:53
When?

576
00:21:53 --> 00:21:54
Within one or two minutes.

577
00:21:54 --> 00:21:55
You want to walk right?

578
00:21:55 --> 00:21:57
Does anyone have a cigarette?

579
00:21:57 --> 00:21:58
We have a doctor to miss.

580
00:21:58 --> 00:21:59
Ms!

581
00:21:59 --> 00:22:00
Get out of here!

582
00:22:00 --> 00:22:02
It would be a privilege it would leave my side.

583
00:22:02 --> 00:22:03
I know it would be.

584
00:22:03 --> 00:22:05
You really are the &quot;King of Shit,&quot; Wilson!

585
00:22:05 --> 00:22:06
Sometimes it hits.

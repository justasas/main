00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,179
d Niner was operating by itself when it
ran him down

307
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:19,900
throttling pivoting floating the blade

308
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:27,369
I don't know how some malfunction and
the controls you seen rogue machine we

309
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:28,630
operate before

310
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:36,849
look I heard McCarthy - I'm trying to
warn you it a blue light my god it was

311
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:37,960
there in the blade

312
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:44,500
you don't believe that the question is
to you know touch trackpad boys often

313
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,480

harmless now sort of fuel or right up
out there somewhere

316
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:01,299
so we leave it being that the company
engineers come in and find the box and

317
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,019
it later

318
00:36:02,019 --> 00:36:06,969

the d Niner operating all by itself

328
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:23,769
you're paid to work you saw - did you
when it got belted him for good

329
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:28,119

386
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,860
he's coming off this spool

387
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:40,660
remote control that's got to be it huh

388
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,659
that thing is running by remote control

389
00:43:44,469 --> 00:43:47,549
listen

390
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:51,600
listen you guys we gotta do something

391
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:56,309
I mean something's wrong machines
machines

392
00:43:56,849 --> 00:44:01,230
just don't run by themselves that means
there's somebody else on this island

393
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:05,699
you know foreign spies or something
about a mad scientist

394
00:44:05,699 --> 00:44:08,699
no listen Dennis come on I'm serious
we're wasting away

395
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:12,329
there's gotta be a logical explanation

396
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:23,578
got him gassed up yeah

397
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:26,640
sure like to know what that day niners
run on

398
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:31,170
yeah so what are we going to get out of
here way to that high ground

399
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:35,099
we're not going after the d9 but until
we figure out how that dynamite didn't

400
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:35,880
face it

401
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:41,219
I still say it's remote control we can
move faster will hide and run gain time

402
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:49,469
until that ship shows up calling the
shots . you better ride with me

403
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:02,700
yeah

404
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:11,599
yeah

405
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,949
hey Dennis

406
00:45:12,949 --> 00:45:17,299
did I ever tell you I played in the
Cotton Bowl 64 I caught two touchdown

407
00:45:21,949 --> 00:45:24,949
yeah

408
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:41,400
yeah

409
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,639
yeah

410
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:46,639
yeah

411
00:45:52,179 --> 00:45:54,839
yeah

412
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,840
yeah

413
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:12,550
ok

414
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,420
yeah

415
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,420
yeah

416
00:46:42,329 --> 00:46:49,289
yeah

417
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:55,170
she won't make it any further up this
grade

418
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:15,250
I think we better take a look around up
there first

419
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:19,480
we don't want to get ourselves trapped
hey guys you want to laugh when you hear

420
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,300
the cockamamie story or dennys been
handed me

421
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:25,300
best we can do best man it's terrific

422
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:30,940
well the truth is we don't know anything
for a fact except that bulldozer kills

423
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:36,099
that's good enough for me you stay here
with Dutch sharp let's take a look

424
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:47,289
there's some logical explanation

425
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,630
hey Dennis

426
00:47:58,630 --> 00:47:59,890
listen

427
00:47:59,889 --> 00:48:03,338
want some music that thing can't hear

428
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:12,940
look maybe this isn't such a good idea
you know maybe would be smart to split

429
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,318
up

430
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:20,829
Kelly and chub you and me like teams and
we stand a better chance what do you say

431
00:48:21,338 --> 00:48:28,929
why not every man for himself you
serious

432
00:48:28,929 --> 00:48:33,368
we stick together

433
00:48:39,139 --> 00:48:42,139
yeah

434
00:48:43,909 --> 00:48:54,469
what about this slope you think the
designer can get up

435
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:57,649
given time it can make a road any word
wants to go

436
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:02,420
well then we'd better fight back what do
you think about building a signal far

437
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:05,420
maybe a airplane or a fishing boat might

438
00:49:09,719 --> 00:49:12,750
yeah

439
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:20,360

00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:26,670
won't stop steal it will take out the
electrical systems in the rubber

446
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:32,070

that thing you can't kill a machine

496
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:03,980

01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:56,219
hey wait a minute of course you can't
kill a machine

577
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:01,289
don't you see my mistake the thing

578
01:07:01,818 --> 01:07:10,639
whatever that's what has to be stopped
how I don't know but there's a way it's

579
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:11,659
got to be a way

580
01:07:11,659 --> 01:07:15,048
think man how do you go about killing on
a killer

581
01:07:15,048 --> 01:07:18,048
it's too heavy to hang it's too big to
put in the gas chamber

582
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,708
electricity Berlin I'm serious

583
01:07:25,278 --> 01:07:30,920
electrocution we should use to that big
dozer we got that generator but it's

584
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:31,789
damaged

585
01:07:31,789 --> 01:07:36,469
maybe maybe not we need a conductor some
kind of spinning your wheels can or not

586
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:41,838
it will work

587
01:07:42,409 --> 01:07:45,828
and that's what's going to make it work
come on sorry ball give me a hand

588
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:52,750

you got it straight

592
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:14,590
gonna make that dogs are charged the
greater he gets both treads on that grid

593
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:18,760
why I'm we pride like bacon assuming it
will come from that direction

594
01:08:19,659 --> 01:08:23,559
I'll jockey the greater assuming it's
dumb enough to be sukkot you're going to

595
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:26,620
be at the generator ready to throw the
switch right

596
01:08:26,619 --> 01:08:32,199
it doesn't work it has to be under
warranty

597
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:37,390
you know you may make it yet soluble

598
01:08:44,539 --> 01:08:49,489

625
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:34,960
no I guess not all we got is our word
that the thing existed

01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:40,239
you know we could fake things tell the
authorities the guys got caught in a

627
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:41,260
landslide

628
01:12:41,260 --> 01:12:47,800

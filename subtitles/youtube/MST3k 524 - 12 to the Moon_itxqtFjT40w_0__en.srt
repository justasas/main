that show together because it was a

16
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:11,818

there the stuff started happening

17
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:19,439

31
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:21,490

real jerk it

39
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:02,290
there are a lot of reasons you could
give for why dr. Forrester is the way he

40
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:05,289
is personally I think it's because he's
ugly and stupid

my morals and study x over G minus 3

444
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:12,858

captain Anderson speaking reporting
successful landing on the moon time is

483
00:39:00,699 --> 00:39:04,779
calculated plus 37 minutes since the
last surviving our first lunar

484
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:10,720
disembarkation next schedule contact
with central birth control at all two

485
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:16,449
hundred and regulations literally the
one you like us you really like the

486
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:21,068

additional reflex action

503
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:32,199

15 days and nights upon the earth

704
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:20,059
sinking into the Promised dust and the
way drag is better on the ship answers

principle of the hydrogen bomb behaviour

gentlemen let's make no mistake our
situation is extremely serious but movie

929
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:06,579
we are caught in orbit in order to
survive you have to remain at our

930
01:14:06,579 --> 01:14:07,809
present altitude

931
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:10,330

934
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:23,139
something like this has ever happened
before

935
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:26,170
for the past ten hours the North
American continent remains in an

936
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,550
isolation of silence

937
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:30,760
no contact can be established by any
means of communication with either

938
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:33,280
Canada the United States or Mexico

939
01:14:33,279 --> 01:14:37,269

nation bound yeah

941
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:44,170

step by if you informed

942
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:48,310
we now return to miami on the radio no
wonder all communication is shut off

943
01:14:48,939 --> 01:14:52,389
you know I don't think we could even
come down out of our final orbit

944
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:55,990
I'm afraid you're right away - why we
gotta go

945
01:14:55,989 --> 01:14:59,380
we are insulated we are safe in here we

946
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:03,789
yes but for how long no I don't know
we're operating now under automatic

947
01:15:03,789 --> 01:15:08,500
control how about the engines Montell
the engines meal I forgot the engines

948
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,510
over worked on

949
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:15,730
it's only a matter of time before the
turbines give out to you to come so

950
01:15:15,729 --> 01:15:19,089
close to success and such a month

951
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:22,390
it may work it's if he has to

952
01:15:23,529 --> 01:15:28,689
listen you want to know a secret our
emergency space taxi works on that Tommy

953
01:15:28,689 --> 01:15:29,289
power

954
01:15:29,289 --> 01:15:35,229
right right right we must fashion a
powerful atom bomb assembling and

955
01:15:35,229 --> 01:15:39,579
uniting it's a number of Bartlett's such
as we used on the move

956
01:15:39,579 --> 01:15:46,539
two men drawn by a lot walk into a bar
to pilot the taxi of our life one can

957
01:15:46,539 --> 01:15:51,069
know I'm thinking of purple capital of a
commander of the moment of the crater

958
01:15:51,069 --> 01:15:54,639
result of the explosion might thought
the big freeze

959
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:58,420
yes but i'm such a one how all the space
taxi crashed through the frozen

960
01:15:58,420 --> 01:15:59,380
atmosphere

961
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:05,770
sign on penetration market as it
disperses the micrometeoroid clouds

962
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:09,280
it should break an opening for the space
taxi to go through

963
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:16,029
yes it could be piloted through frozen
space but but but we have to inform you

964
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:19,269
that it might disintegrate in the
explosion

965
01:16:19,779 --> 01:16:25,539
that's why i said the two men should be
drawn by left because the night belongs

966
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:31,810
to Lover's their chances to return to
the loo my e are quite a report

you got a job

969
01:16:38,420 --> 01:16:42,710
you it is worth the risk to break up the
big freeze which paralyzes not only the

970
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:44,510
country but the whole continent

01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:30,340
Eric rights let me begin by saying that
if I could I would have the show hookup

1122
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:32,349

1123
01:29:32,349 --> 01:29:36,670

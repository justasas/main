3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:08
Don&#39;t know how many times

4
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
I&#39;ve been crossed off the list
and left for dead.

5
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
Guess when it first happens
the day you were born...

6
00:00:12 --> 00:00:13
you&#39;re gonna lose count.

7
00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
So this...

8
00:00:14 --> 00:00:15
this ain&#39;t nothing new.

9
00:00:15 --> 00:00:16
There are bad days...

10
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
and then there are legendary bad days.

11
00:00:18 --> 00:00:20
This was shaping up to be one of those.

12
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
Whole damn planet wanted a piece of me.

13
00:00:22 --> 00:00:23
Can&#39;t stay in the open.

14
00:00:23 --> 00:00:24
Can&#39;t risk another attack.

15
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
It&#39;s always the punch you don&#39;t see
coming that puts you down.

16
00:00:27 --> 00:00:28
But why didn&#39;t I see it?

17
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
Of course they were
gonna try to kill me.

18
00:00:29 --> 00:00:30
Death is what they do for a living.

19
00:00:30 --> 00:00:31
So the question ain&#39;t
&quot;What happened?&quot;

20
00:00:31 --> 00:00:32
The question is...

21
00:00:32 --> 00:00:33
&quot;What happened to me?&quot;

22
00:00:33 --> 00:00:35
You are the Lord Marshal now.

23
00:00:35 --> 00:00:36
How did they get so close?

24
00:00:36 --> 00:00:38
How did I let them
blindside me like that?

25
00:00:38 --> 00:00:40
Threshold!
Take us to the threshold!

26
00:00:40 --> 00:00:41
Necromongers.

27
00:00:41 --> 00:00:43
Some wanted to put a crown on my head.

28
00:00:43 --> 00:00:45
Some wanted to put a noose
around my neck.

29
00:00:45 --> 00:00:46
Please...

30
00:00:46 --> 00:00:47
come back to bed.

31
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
Every Lord Marshal was supposed
to take some big oath...

32
00:00:50 --> 00:00:54
one that I never really got around to.

33
00:00:54 --> 00:00:56
You could say it created
a little friction...

34
00:00:56 --> 00:00:58
and more than a few assassins.

35
00:00:58 --> 00:00:59
I needed a way out.

36
00:00:59 --> 00:01:00
Some new place.

37
00:01:00 --> 00:01:01
Or maybe just...

38
00:01:01 --> 00:01:02
an old one.

39
00:01:02 --> 00:01:02
Furya.

40
00:01:02 --> 00:01:03
I know what it&#39;s called.

41
00:01:03 --> 00:01:04
You just don&#39;t know where it is.

42
00:01:04 --> 00:01:06
- I need charts. I need maps.
- Impossible.

43
00:01:06 --> 00:01:06
I need a direction.

44
00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
Purged from all records,
as you well know.

45
00:01:08 --> 00:01:11
But you remember where,
Commander Vaako.

46
00:01:11 --> 00:01:12
So many worlds...

47
00:01:12 --> 00:01:14
The only map left in existence...

48
00:01:14 --> 00:01:15
is the one that&#39;s in my head...

49
00:01:15 --> 00:01:15
Riddick.

50
00:01:15 --> 00:01:16
So what do you want?

51
00:01:16 --> 00:01:17
The crown?

52
00:01:17 --> 00:01:18
Transcendence.

53
00:01:18 --> 00:01:18
Krone.

54
00:01:18 --> 00:01:18
Break off a ship.

55
00:01:18 --> 00:01:19
Riddick&#39;s going home.

56
00:01:19 --> 00:01:19
Vaako.

57
00:01:19 --> 00:01:21
You can&#39;t blame him
for dangling Furya.

58
00:01:21 --> 00:01:22
Home has a certain equity.

59
00:01:22 --> 00:01:25
But I do blame him for what came next.

60
00:01:25 --> 00:01:26
It&#39;s a long way to come.

61
00:01:26 --> 00:01:27
For this.

62
00:01:27 --> 00:01:29
This guy with
the fucked-up face, Krone...

63
00:01:29 --> 00:01:30
he was supposed to be our ride home.

64
00:01:30 --> 00:01:35
But instead of Furya,
we wind up someplace called...

65
00:01:35 --> 00:01:36
Not Furya.

66
00:01:36 --> 00:01:39
Yet again,
someone was trying to play me.

67
00:01:39 --> 00:01:40
So yet again...

68
00:01:40 --> 00:01:41
we play for blood.

69
00:01:41 --> 00:01:43
You keep what you kill, Riddick!!

70
00:01:43 --> 00:01:44
You keep what you kill!

71
00:01:44 --> 00:01:46
Somewhere along the way,
I lost a step.

72
00:01:46 --> 00:01:47
I got sloppy.

73
00:01:47 --> 00:01:48
Dulled my own edge.

74
00:01:48 --> 00:01:50
Maybe I went and
did the worst crime of all...

75
00:01:50 --> 00:01:51
I got civilized.

76
00:01:51 --> 00:01:53
So now we zero the clock.

77
00:01:53 --> 00:01:56
Just me and this no-name world.

78
00:01:56 --> 00:01:58
Gotta find that animal side again.

79
00:01:58 --> 00:01:58
Before long...

80
00:01:58 --> 00:02:01
I realized there was
a whole other world over there...

81
00:02:01 --> 00:02:03
of water, grass and life.

82
00:02:03 --> 00:02:05
Just had one thing in my way.

83
00:02:05 --> 00:02:06
Come on, show me some teeth.

84
00:02:06 --> 00:02:07
Escape artist, huh?

85
00:02:07 --> 00:02:08
What have you got over there?

86
00:02:08 --> 00:02:09
Thought we shared everything.

87
00:02:09 --> 00:02:09
Drop it.

88
00:02:09 --> 00:02:10
Stay.

89
00:02:10 --> 00:02:11
Bounty hunters...

90
00:02:11 --> 00:02:11
Wait.

91
00:02:11 --> 00:02:12
Wait...

92
00:02:12 --> 00:02:12
Steady...

93
00:02:12 --> 00:02:12
Okay, now.

94
00:02:12 --> 00:02:12
Sounds good.

95
00:02:12 --> 00:02:12
All yours.

96
00:02:12 --> 00:02:13
It says &quot;dog food&quot; on it.

97
00:02:13 --> 00:02:14
If you could read.

98
00:02:14 --> 00:02:14
Come on...

99
00:02:14 --> 00:02:15
Alright. Bring me my reserve.

100
00:02:15 --> 00:02:15
Rain.

101
00:02:15 --> 00:02:15
It&#39;s a good thing.

102
00:02:15 --> 00:02:18
Just because you&#39;ve never seen it
before doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a bad thing.

103
00:02:15 --> 00:02:15
Where&#39;s yours?

104
00:02:18 --> 00:02:19
Hey... easy...

105
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
Looks like our time is up here.

106
00:02:21 --> 00:02:21
Nothing.

107
00:02:21 --> 00:02:21
Look again, Diaz.

108
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
Somebody should teach
this Riddick asshole how to count.

109
00:02:23 --> 00:02:24
&quot;Leave one ship&quot;?

110
00:02:24 --> 00:02:25
Like we&#39;ve got a fucking spare
laying around.

111
00:02:25 --> 00:02:26
Let&#39;s crank it up.

112
00:02:26 --> 00:02:27
Morning, Cyclps.

113
00:02:27 --> 00:02:27
Hey, Luna.

114
00:02:27 --> 00:02:27
Yeah.

115
00:02:27 --> 00:02:28
Wake her up, kick her outta bed.

116
00:02:28 --> 00:02:28
What do you mean?

117
00:02:28 --> 00:02:28
We&#39;re running heavy.

118
00:02:28 --> 00:02:28
She&#39;s a prisoner.

119
00:02:28 --> 00:02:29
- Wasn&#39;t she gonna pay our way back?
- We&#39;re going big now.

120
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
Okay? Cut that 60 kilos loose.

121
00:02:32 --> 00:02:35
- Get away! Get away from me!
- Stop, just stop!

122
00:02:35 --> 00:02:36
What do you want now?

123
00:02:36 --> 00:02:38
I&#39;m gonna take off the restraints.
Okay?

124
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
- I don&#39;t want them off.
- No, it&#39;s not like that.

125
00:02:40 --> 00:02:41
Nobody&#39;s gonna touch you now.

126
00:02:41 --> 00:02:42
Santana&#39;s head is into other stuff now.

127
00:02:42 --> 00:02:42
Your lucky day.

128
00:02:42 --> 00:02:43
- Get the fuck away from me.
- Alright.

129
00:02:43 --> 00:02:44
What planet is this?
Where are we?

130
00:02:44 --> 00:02:45
It&#39;s got air and water.
That&#39;s all you gotta know.

131
00:02:45 --> 00:02:46
- But how am I supposed to survive?
- Just go.

132
00:02:46 --> 00:02:47
Before he changes his mind.

133
00:02:47 --> 00:02:48
I was getting attached to her.

134
00:02:48 --> 00:02:49
Now where is my box at?

135
00:02:49 --> 00:02:49
The name...

136
00:02:49 --> 00:02:50
is Santana!

137
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
Shot-caller for this crew right here!

138
00:02:52 --> 00:02:57
I am the guy who knows all,
sees all, beats all!

139
00:02:57 --> 00:02:58
Spitting it kinda strong, ain&#39;t he?

140
00:02:58 --> 00:02:59
Gotta bait the trap.

141
00:02:59 --> 00:03:03
I&#39;ve come all this way
to collect your head in a box!

142
00:03:03 --> 00:03:04
Right here!

143
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
So have yourself a fine day now...

144
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
Mr. Richard B. Riddick!

145
00:03:08 --> 00:03:09
I suspect...

146
00:03:09 --> 00:03:12
it will be one...
of your very last!

147
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
Well, you don&#39;t need to agitate Riddick
any more than... you know.

148
00:03:16 --> 00:03:18
Any more than bringing his head
back in a box would?

149
00:03:18 --> 00:03:19
Shit.

150
00:03:19 --> 00:03:20
Here comes the neighborhood.

151
00:03:20 --> 00:03:20
Small world.

152
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
Unidentified vessel,
this is Clan Vagos out of Ursa Five.

153
00:03:23 --> 00:03:24
Be advised that
we are on the ground now

154
00:03:24 --> 00:03:26
and have responded
to emergency signal.

155
00:03:26 --> 00:03:29
No distress found, no need to land.

156
00:03:29 --> 00:03:33
I repeat, there is no reason for you
to land at this location at this time.

157
00:03:33 --> 00:03:34
Is that clear?

158
00:03:34 --> 00:03:38
No reason for you to land
at this location at this time.

159
00:03:38 --> 00:03:39
What the fuck did I just say?!

160
00:03:39 --> 00:03:41
It was a long haul.
We could take on some water.

161
00:03:41 --> 00:03:42
Wouldn&#39;t mind a little
true-gravity time either.

162
00:03:42 --> 00:03:44
Like I was saying, I&#39;ve got this.

163
00:03:44 --> 00:03:47
You know who that was, right?
On the emergency beacon?

164
00:03:47 --> 00:03:48
Wouldn&#39;t be here if I didn&#39;t.

165
00:03:48 --> 00:03:50
The concept of back-up still
has no appeal to you?

166
00:03:50 --> 00:03:52
My besties here can ball with anyone.

167
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
No disrespect for your crew,
of course,

168
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
who look strong, too,
in those matchy-matchy outfits.

169
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
Shit. Didn&#39;t know
there was a dress code.

170
00:03:59 --> 00:04:00
Yeah, right?

171
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
Well, it&#39;s not my intention
to jump another man&#39;s claim.

172
00:04:02 --> 00:04:04
If you don&#39;t mind, maybe we&#39;ll just pull
up a chair and spectate for a while.

173
00:04:04 --> 00:04:04
What if I do?

174
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
This is a Co-op station, pal.
It&#39;s open to all mercs.

175
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
- By the way, my name is...
- &quot;Too late&quot;.

176
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
That&#39;s your name.
Too Late.

177
00:04:11 --> 00:04:13
And I don&#39;t need you stepping
all over my dick here, my friend.

178
00:04:13 --> 00:04:13
Well, I tell you what.

179
00:04:13 --> 00:04:15
I won&#39;t lift a finger to help you until
you come ask me for it. How&#39;s that?

180
00:04:15 --> 00:04:18
I was scoping this out earlier.
It&#39;s a cave system. Five clicks south.

181
00:04:18 --> 00:04:18
Might be worth a look.

182
00:04:18 --> 00:04:19
Hey, Too Late.

183
00:04:19 --> 00:04:22
Need to pull a node from your ship and
store it right here next to mine. Okay?

184
00:04:22 --> 00:04:22
Oh, really? Why&#39;s that?

185
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
Riddick triggered the beacon
to get off-world, right?

186
00:04:24 --> 00:04:28
Basically, he was calling a taxi.

187
00:04:28 --> 00:04:28
And...?

188
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
And a ship would make
a sweet trap, right?

189
00:04:30 --> 00:04:34
Confined space, metal walls...
jail cell.

190
00:04:34 --> 00:04:35
Ace cool, huh?

191
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
Is it true half the people you meet
are below average intelligence?

192
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
Got to make sure the ship stays grounded
when he comes for them, okay?

193
00:04:40 --> 00:04:40
Come on.

194
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
Dahl... pull a node from the ship.

195
00:04:42 --> 00:04:42
I&#39;ll do it!

196
00:04:42 --> 00:04:43
Any time now, Riddick.

197
00:04:43 --> 00:04:47
I&#39;m telling you, this is total overkill.
Eleven of us out here now?

198
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
Should have been a four-man op, tops.

199
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
You are jinxing our janx, man.
And that ain&#39;t cool.

200
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
Hey, I don&#39;t give a shit what they say.
He&#39;s one guy.

201
00:04:54 --> 00:04:55
Whatever you say.

202
00:04:55 --> 00:04:56
He&#39;s one guy.

203
00:04:56 --> 00:04:58
So I guess that&#39;s what passes for
a fucking moon on this planet.

204
00:04:58 --> 00:04:59
It&#39;s gonna be a dark night.

205
00:04:59 --> 00:05:00
Advantage, him.

206
00:05:00 --> 00:05:03
Maybe he&#39;s gonna wear you down first.
Force you to go without sleep.

207
00:05:03 --> 00:05:04
Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m busy?

208
00:05:04 --> 00:05:05
I&#39;m just sharing my thoughts.

209
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
Well, now that you have...

210
00:05:07 --> 00:05:11
can I politely invite you to
step off my fucking porch?!

211
00:05:11 --> 00:05:12
I&#39;ll start rotating down.

212
00:05:12 --> 00:05:12
You let me know, huh?

213
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
As soon as I have his head in a box,
I will let you know.

214
00:05:14 --> 00:05:15
Grid 29D.
Stand by, stand by.

215
00:05:15 --> 00:05:15
What you got, cuz?

216
00:05:15 --> 00:05:16
Some dingo-dongo thing.

217
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
Yeah. I see it now.

218
00:05:18 --> 00:05:18
You want me to pop it?

219
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
Knock it down.
One shot suppressed.

220
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
Nice work, Diaz.
Encouraging.

221
00:05:22 --> 00:05:23
Had something in my eye.

222
00:05:23 --> 00:05:24
It&#39;s called a scope.

223
00:05:24 --> 00:05:25
Try next time.

224
00:05:25 --> 00:05:25
You got this, right?

225
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
Will you get off my freaking frequency!

226
00:05:27 --> 00:05:28
What the fuck is going on here?

227
00:05:28 --> 00:05:29
Thank fucking God!

228
00:05:29 --> 00:05:30
Fuck off!

229
00:05:30 --> 00:05:33
Rubio, coming your way now.
Gotta swap out a bad sensor.

230
00:05:33 --> 00:05:34
What was here versus what was found.

231
00:05:34 --> 00:05:35
How does it square?

232
00:05:35 --> 00:05:38
Pretty good. The morphine&#39;s gone,
but that&#39;s always the first thing to go.

233
00:05:38 --> 00:05:39
That was a bit weird, though.

234
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
&quot;A predator restraint
with 4 2-inch offset jaws.&quot;

235
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
Six listed, zero found.

236
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
Well, it is an odd thing
to go for a walk.

237
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
Yeah, but Boss, you know how
shit goes missing from these stations.

238
00:05:47 --> 00:05:49
One bad year and guys
are ripping shit off for salvage.

239
00:05:49 --> 00:05:49
Hey, Santana?

240
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
You did sweep the area
before I got here, right?

241
00:05:51 --> 00:05:52
Sweep for what?

242
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
Well, I just want to make sure
no one has set any traps for us.

243
00:05:54 --> 00:05:54
5Q.

244
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
- Understand what I&#39;m saying?
- Traps?

245
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
What kind of traps?

246
00:05:57 --> 00:05:58
The kind with jaws.

247
00:05:58 --> 00:05:59
Don&#39;t touch that fucking thing!

248
00:05:59 --> 00:05:59
What?

249
00:05:59 --> 00:05:59
Up-armor.

250
00:05:59 --> 00:05:59
Shit!

251
00:05:59 --> 00:05:59
Ready, ready.

252
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
Stay put, stay put!
Stay put, stay put!

253
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
Who the hell was
that screaming and why?

254
00:06:02 --> 00:06:02
Nunez...

255
00:06:02 --> 00:06:03
break out the sweep gear.

256
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
And figure out how many
of these big-ass traps...

257
00:06:06 --> 00:06:07
we got out here, okay?

258
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
I&#39;m thinking maybe the whole upper left
quad is some kind of fucking mine field.

259
00:06:11 --> 00:06:12
You do that now, okay, Nunez?

260
00:06:12 --> 00:06:13
Copy that, Nunez?

261
00:06:13 --> 00:06:14
Nunez?

262
00:06:14 --> 00:06:16
This is bad.
This is very bad.

263
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
- Nunez? Nunez?
- Shut the fuck up, puto!

264
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
His radio just crapped out.
Someone get eyes on him.

265
00:06:20 --> 00:06:22
And show him right where
he should be - 13H. Go, go, go!

266
00:06:22 --> 00:06:22
Right here.

267
00:06:22 --> 00:06:23
13-H. He&#39;s supposed to be
right fucking...

268
00:06:23 --> 00:06:26
So this was overkill, huh?
Eleven of us, too many, yeah.

269
00:06:26 --> 00:06:27
You know all about Riddick, right?

270
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
Well, maybe you need
to take that shit back!

271
00:06:29 --> 00:06:31
Take the jinx off our janx.
You understand me?

272
00:06:31 --> 00:06:35
That&#39;s what you need to do, Falco.
You need to unjinxelate our fucking janx!

273
00:06:35 --> 00:06:36
Don&#39;t mess with me now.

274
00:06:36 --> 00:06:37
Hey, what is it?

275
00:06:37 --> 00:06:37
- Get back!
- It&#39;s me, it&#39;s me.

276
00:06:37 --> 00:06:37
He&#39;s got Falco!

277
00:06:37 --> 00:06:38
Jock up, but you&#39;re staying home.

278
00:06:38 --> 00:06:39
No one&#39;s going out there
until I say so.

279
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
- Man down, he got Falco.
- Compromise, compromise.

280
00:06:41 --> 00:06:43
- How the fuck did he do that?
- Never even saw him. He was right here...

281
00:06:43 --> 00:06:43
What about the ship?
Is he on it?

282
00:06:43 --> 00:06:46
He&#39;s not coming for the ships,
he&#39;s coming for us! Just fucking shoot!

283
00:06:46 --> 00:06:47
One night, three dead.

284
00:06:47 --> 00:06:48
Not sure I&#39;m loving this trend.

285
00:06:48 --> 00:06:49
Two dead, one missing.

286
00:06:49 --> 00:06:50
Exactly. Three dead.

287
00:06:50 --> 00:06:52
Well, look at it this way, boys.

288
00:06:52 --> 00:06:53
We might all fit on one ship now.

289
00:06:53 --> 00:06:53
Diaz!

290
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
Get those other traps back there.

291
00:06:54 --> 00:06:57
Luna, say something Bible-like
over these bodies.

292
00:06:57 --> 00:06:58
Okay, maybe...

293
00:06:58 --> 00:06:59
we zero this out.

294
00:06:59 --> 00:07:00
What is your tag anyway?

295
00:07:00 --> 00:07:01
So now you wanna know my name.

296
00:07:01 --> 00:07:02
Well, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m gonna say.

297
00:07:02 --> 00:07:04
Because everyone you know by name,
Santana, winds up dead.

298
00:07:04 --> 00:07:05
You gonna clean this shit up?

299
00:07:05 --> 00:07:06
Shut up, fucking bitch!

300
00:07:06 --> 00:07:06
Excuse me.

301
00:07:06 --> 00:07:07
Watch out for surprise attacks.

302
00:07:07 --> 00:07:07
Maybe...

303
00:07:07 --> 00:07:10
Maybe it&#39;s time to start
merging assets, right?

304
00:07:10 --> 00:07:11
So this is you asking for my help?

305
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
This is me saying that
I may need some of your gear.

306
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
If some of your guys happen
to come attached to that gear...

307
00:07:17 --> 00:07:20
I will understand
that&#39;s the way it&#39;s gotta be.

308
00:07:20 --> 00:07:21
So you&#39;re asking for my gear&#39;s help?

309
00:07:21 --> 00:07:22
More like that.

310
00:07:22 --> 00:07:22
Moss...?

311
00:07:22 --> 00:07:24
The gear says &quot;nah&quot;. Bitch.

312
00:07:24 --> 00:07:24
There&#39;s your answer.

313
00:07:24 --> 00:07:25
What the fuck do you want, man?

314
00:07:25 --> 00:07:28
You know what?
I&#39;m gonna fold you in, Santana.

315
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
But I give orders to Dahl.
And Dahl&#39;s gonna give orders to you.

316
00:07:31 --> 00:07:33
And that&#39;s the chain of command
from this point forward.

317
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
Why am I not loving this plan so far?

318
00:07:35 --> 00:07:37
Oh, I know.
You know why?

319
00:07:37 --> 00:07:39
Because it sucks ass and swallows!

320
00:07:39 --> 00:07:42
I&#39;m not taking orders from your pet whore
who thinks I won&#39;t smack her right back...

321
00:07:42 --> 00:07:43
I don&#39;t fuck guys.

322
00:07:43 --> 00:07:44
Occasionally I fuck &#39;em up
if they need it.

323
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
Here&#39;s what&#39;s gonna happen, Santana.
You&#39;re gonna take a back seat.

324
00:07:46 --> 00:07:47
We&#39;ll track Riddick down, I promise.

325
00:07:47 --> 00:07:48
But I want him alive.

326
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
You give me a day
and after that he&#39;s yours to kill.

327
00:07:51 --> 00:07:52
You&#39;re giving me the bounty?

328
00:07:52 --> 00:07:56
You pay my crew, fuel costs,
the rest is yours. That&#39;s the deal.

329
00:07:56 --> 00:08:00
What is Riddick for you?
Not just some convict.

330
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
What do you want?
Why are you here?

331
00:08:02 --> 00:08:03
Who are you?

332
00:08:03 --> 00:08:04
My name is Johns.

333
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
Lock down those ships,
get those hogs on deck.

334
00:08:06 --> 00:08:07
I will ride with Moss and Lockspur.

335
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
I want a non-lethal load-out.
L.O.D.&#39;s and phosphor frags to start with.

336
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
This is a man that hunts by night.
We&#39;ll take it to him by day.

337
00:08:13 --> 00:08:16
Diaz! Vargas!
Show me the spot of the last kill.

338
00:08:16 --> 00:08:17
Some kind of canine.

339
00:08:17 --> 00:08:18
Hey, Diaz, I&#39;ve got a dog here.

340
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
Is it the same dingo-dongo thing
from last night?

341
00:08:20 --> 00:08:21
Nah, I&#39;m pretty sure we killed that one.

342
00:08:21 --> 00:08:21
Could be the same one.

343
00:08:21 --> 00:08:21
The same.

344
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
Dahl, get your sniper rifle
and barium rounds now.

345
00:08:23 --> 00:08:23
1500 meters.

346
00:08:23 --> 00:08:24
Could be just the first hole it found.

347
00:08:24 --> 00:08:26
A stressed animal is gonna run
to ground it knows.

348
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
Besides...
I&#39;m getting human pheromones.

349
00:08:28 --> 00:08:28
Riddick!

350
00:08:28 --> 00:08:29
Dial down, dial down, dial down!

351
00:08:29 --> 00:08:31
- Santana&#39;s guy.
- Falco.

352
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
Shit. Did we just kill a hostage?

353
00:08:33 --> 00:08:34
I&#39;ve been hunting Riddick for ten years.

354
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
The concept of a hostage
has no appeal to him.

355
00:08:36 --> 00:08:37
Falco was already dead.

356
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
This is just some fucking side-show
to buy more time.

357
00:08:39 --> 00:08:40
Fuck!

358
00:08:40 --> 00:08:40
Shit...

359
00:08:40 --> 00:08:41
Just dropped some mud right there.

360
00:08:41 --> 00:08:42
So if Riddick isn&#39;t here...

361
00:08:42 --> 00:08:45
Dahl, do you copy?
Does anyone copy?

362
00:08:45 --> 00:08:46
Dahl, you there?

363
00:08:46 --> 00:08:46
Boom.

364
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
Were you just perving out
on me somehow?

365
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
May all your dreams come true, baby.

366
00:08:50 --> 00:08:53
You&#39;ve got two minutes.
I want you out on fucking watch.

367
00:08:53 --> 00:08:53
Luna!

368
00:08:53 --> 00:08:56
Don&#39;t watch me. Watch my back.
That&#39;s what you&#39;re here for.

369
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
Take two steps forward. Two.

370
00:08:58 --> 00:08:59
Remember, he could be anywhere.

371
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
This is Johns to any-goddamn-body
at the station.

372
00:09:01 --> 00:09:05
I want you to keep an ey e on that locker.
Keep an eye on the node.

373
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
Riddick may have made an end run.

374
00:09:07 --> 00:09:10
My ETA is seven minutes.
But watch your back.

375
00:09:10 --> 00:09:11
Where did you go, bitch?

376
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
Your two minutes are up.
You gonna do what I tell you to do?

377
00:09:13 --> 00:09:15
Rumor is Riddick might be
in the vicinity.

378
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
Thought I should just
check on the locker.

379
00:09:17 --> 00:09:21
Get outside, get on your optics,
and get after this fucker!

380
00:09:21 --> 00:09:22
You&#39;re not gonna find him here.

381
00:09:22 --> 00:09:26
Actually, Dahl, I think
we have something in common.

382
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
I don&#39;t fuck guys either.

383
00:09:29 --> 00:09:30
You need to see this.

384
00:09:30 --> 00:09:31
He wrote that?

385
00:09:31 --> 00:09:34
He took out our deep
space communications. All of it.

386
00:09:34 --> 00:09:37
And whose blood is that?
There...? Here...?

387
00:09:37 --> 00:09:38
Over there...?

388
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
I had to kick his ass again.
Sorry.

389
00:09:40 --> 00:09:40
Not really.

390
00:09:40 --> 00:09:40
Fuck it.

391
00:09:40 --> 00:09:41
Let&#39;s take a look at this.

392
00:09:41 --> 00:09:41
Stop.

393
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
That key leave your neck?

394
00:09:42 --> 00:09:42
Never.

395
00:09:42 --> 00:09:44
Well, the only reason to write
&quot;fair trade&quot;...

396
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
is if he got into that locker
and he took something out.

397
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
Something that we need,
like a power node...

398
00:09:49 --> 00:09:51
which he could then
swap for something he needs.

399
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
All that? Wow.

400
00:09:53 --> 00:09:54
Highly unlikely.

401
00:09:54 --> 00:09:55
Let me connect
the fucking dots, Santana.

402
00:09:55 --> 00:09:56
Here&#39;s what I&#39;m saying.
If he did get in there somehow,

403
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
he was in a position to relock it
and change the code.

404
00:09:59 --> 00:10:01
Could be entering
the wrong shit, Santana.

405
00:10:01 --> 00:10:02
So...

406
00:10:02 --> 00:10:06
do you think sometime
during the last few hours...

407
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
he got this off my neck
without me noticing...

408
00:10:09 --> 00:10:11
did whatever he did,
put the fucking key back

409
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
on my fucking neck
without me fucking noticing?

410
00:10:13 --> 00:10:14
Is that what you&#39;re saying?

411
00:10:14 --> 00:10:17
Where did you get that theory from?
A unicorn&#39;s ass?

412
00:10:17 --> 00:10:18
There&#39;s a reason he is who he is.

413
00:10:18 --> 00:10:21
He&#39;s a convict.
Not some Zulu warlock.

414
00:10:21 --> 00:10:22
You know what you know.

415
00:10:22 --> 00:10:22
This is crazy.

416
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
This is fucking crazy.
The first three clicks were good.

417
00:10:24 --> 00:10:25
It did not go off.

418
00:10:25 --> 00:10:26
You can get three clicks
in Russian Roulette.

419
00:10:26 --> 00:10:27
Don&#39;t mean you get four, motherfucker.

420
00:10:27 --> 00:10:31
You know what, Santana?
For once I actually agree with you.

421
00:10:31 --> 00:10:31
Shut up.

422
00:10:31 --> 00:10:33
You... Do you think we&#39;re good?

423
00:10:33 --> 00:10:33
Yeah.

424
00:10:33 --> 00:10:34
I think you&#39;re good, cuz.

425
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
You&#39;re fucking good.
Just butch up.

426
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
Sounds like your department, lesbo.

427
00:10:39 --> 00:10:40
I&#39;m not opening that thing.

428
00:10:40 --> 00:10:42
- Oh yes, you fucking are!
- I&#39;m so fucking not!

429
00:10:42 --> 00:10:45
Hey, hey!
Use your fucking brains!

430
00:10:45 --> 00:10:47
We are not gonna do
Riddick&#39;s work for him!

431
00:10:47 --> 00:10:48
Put your weapons down.

432
00:10:48 --> 00:10:49
And have a look at that.

433
00:10:49 --> 00:10:49
He was here.

434
00:10:49 --> 00:10:49
Right fucking there.

435
00:10:49 --> 00:10:50
Santana, put your fucking sword away.

436
00:10:50 --> 00:10:51
Don&#39;t fucking open it, then.

437
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
Well, the problem with that, Santana,
we never open that locker...

438
00:10:53 --> 00:10:54
and we never leave.

439
00:10:54 --> 00:10:57
...of my life and my salvation
Whom shall I fear.

440
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
The strength of my life
of Whom shall I be afraid.

441
00:10:59 --> 00:10:59
Four.

442
00:10:59 --> 00:10:59
Try five.

443
00:10:59 --> 00:10:59
Five.

444
00:10:59 --> 00:10:59
And...

445
00:10:59 --> 00:10:59
Oops.

446
00:10:59 --> 00:11:00
Wish I&#39;d have thought of that.

447
00:11:00 --> 00:11:00
Six!

448
00:11:00 --> 00:11:00
Six.

449
00:11:00 --> 00:11:00
Six.

450
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
You are a shit storm trooper, Santana.
I&#39;ll give you that.

451
00:11:03 --> 00:11:04
You beat the devil this time.

452
00:11:04 --> 00:11:05
Didn&#39;t actually think
he was gonna do it.

453
00:11:05 --> 00:11:05
This is a sign.

454
00:11:05 --> 00:11:06
Sweet.

455
00:11:06 --> 00:11:07
I believe this is a sign.

456
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
It may be the good Lord
wants us to take these nodes...

457
00:11:09 --> 00:11:11
and flee this planet
just as soon as we can.

458
00:11:11 --> 00:11:12
That&#39;s my good luck charm.

459
00:11:12 --> 00:11:13
Wrong business, kid.

460
00:11:13 --> 00:11:14
You know, I was kind of hoping
the bomb would go off.

461
00:11:14 --> 00:11:18
So we sealed up his cave with some
phosphor frags here, so he can&#39;t go back.

462
00:11:18 --> 00:11:20
And just like an animal,
he&#39;s gonna head to known ground.

463
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
But we&#39;re gonna find he&#39;s got
three or four layers out there.

464
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
So we&#39;ll radius out
from this point... here.

465
00:11:24 --> 00:11:27
That radio counts. I saw three
repeaters listed in inventory.

466
00:11:27 --> 00:11:29
Find them.
Set them up at regular intervals.

467
00:11:29 --> 00:11:30
I never want to be out of
communication like that again.

468
00:11:30 --> 00:11:31
Are you scared of me?

469
00:11:31 --> 00:11:31
Yeah.

470
00:11:31 --> 00:11:32
Are they scared of me?

471
00:11:32 --> 00:11:33
Yes, they&#39;re scared of you.

472
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
Maybe you&#39;re all scared
of the wrong thing.

473
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37
Lockspur, I want you to lock
down those hogs, alright?

474
00:11:37 --> 00:11:39
I don&#39;t want this guy any
more mobile than he already is.

475
00:11:39 --> 00:11:41
Dahl, I spotted a nice
little nest for you.

476
00:11:41 --> 00:11:42
Right here and in these low hills.

477
00:11:42 --> 00:11:42
Moss?

478
00:11:42 --> 00:11:43
I just saw him.

479
00:11:43 --> 00:11:43
Say it again?

480
00:11:43 --> 00:11:44
I just saw him.

481
00:11:44 --> 00:11:45
Dahl, I want you to sit on this ship!

482
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
Diaz, make sure your ship
is locked down!

483
00:11:47 --> 00:11:51
The rest of you get on the fucking perimeter
and keep your eyes on each other!

484
00:11:51 --> 00:11:54
Santana!
He got the fucking nodes!

485
00:11:54 --> 00:11:56
I know.
It&#39;s coming.

486
00:11:56 --> 00:11:57
So then we just combine nodes.

487
00:11:57 --> 00:11:58
Pull one from that ship,
put it in this ship, you know?

488
00:11:58 --> 00:11:58
Amps is amps, right?

489
00:11:58 --> 00:12:00
It&#39;s not about amps. It&#39;s about
what each ship is rated to handle.

490
00:12:00 --> 00:12:02
You miss by even a few milli-joules,
you fry every chip you&#39;ve got.

491
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
Okay, so figure out the difference,
and just do it.

492
00:12:04 --> 00:12:05
Jailbreak the fucking thing.

493
00:12:05 --> 00:12:06
I could give you a crash course

494
00:12:06 --> 00:12:09
on thermodynamic equilibrium
and energy exchange right now...

495
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
or maybe you just want to take
my goddamn word for it.

496
00:12:11 --> 00:12:11
I get it, I get it.

497
00:12:11 --> 00:12:14
The ships are incompatible. We&#39;re not
gonna fly without the nodes back.

498
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
Why do I feel like we just
cut off our own nuts here?

499
00:12:16 --> 00:12:17
Probably because we did.

500
00:12:17 --> 00:12:19
How about I take one of those jet hogs,
two days worth of food...

501
00:12:19 --> 00:12:20
and go out and hunt
this fucker down myself.

502
00:12:20 --> 00:12:22
Bad idea, Diaz.
One-on-one with Riddick?

503
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
I might be able to get
the emergency beacon working again.

504
00:12:24 --> 00:12:26
That&#39;s like an ambulance
calling for an ambulance, isn&#39;t it?

505
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
It&#39;s back-up for the fucking back-up.
We can&#39;t.

506
00:12:28 --> 00:12:29
I thought he was the one stranded here.

507
00:12:29 --> 00:12:30
Yeah, well, looks like
you thought wrong.

508
00:12:30 --> 00:12:31
Long wait for back-up.

509
00:12:31 --> 00:12:35
In case you were thinking about fixing
the beacon and calling for help.

510
00:12:35 --> 00:12:36
Falco&#39;s radio.

511
00:12:36 --> 00:12:38
Riddick, I don&#39;t give a fuck
about the back-up.

512
00:12:38 --> 00:12:41
Because I&#39;ve still got all kinds of gear
that can ruin your day in a hurry.

513
00:12:41 --> 00:12:43
So you go find another fucking cave.

514
00:12:43 --> 00:12:44
You keep running, you keep hiding.

515
00:12:44 --> 00:12:45
Doesn&#39;t matter to me.

516
00:12:45 --> 00:12:47
Because in the end, I will find you!!

517
00:12:47 --> 00:12:47
Look south.

518
00:12:47 --> 00:12:48
I don&#39;t believe it.

519
00:12:48 --> 00:12:49
The balls on this fucking guy.

520
00:12:49 --> 00:12:50
Dahl, keep an eye on things here.

521
00:12:50 --> 00:12:51
- What should I do?
- Stay low.

522
00:12:51 --> 00:12:52
Come on. Come on.

523
00:12:52 --> 00:12:52
Both of you drop.

524
00:12:52 --> 00:12:53
So what&#39;s the bounty at?

525
00:12:53 --> 00:12:55
I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t care.
It&#39;s not why I&#39;m here.

526
00:12:55 --> 00:12:56
I bet the big jamoke knows.

527
00:12:56 --> 00:12:58
Yeah. I know exactly what it is.

528
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
What I do know is that it&#39;s double
if you&#39;re brought back dead.

529
00:13:01 --> 00:13:02
That&#39;s new.

530
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
Will it be enough to pay
for your funerals?

531
00:13:04 --> 00:13:05
What I&#39;m interested in...

532
00:13:05 --> 00:13:09
is a little backwater place
with a system code M-344-G.

533
00:13:09 --> 00:13:11
I want to know what happened
there ten years ago.

534
00:13:11 --> 00:13:11
The father.

535
00:13:11 --> 00:13:13
- Big Daddy Johns.
- Yeah, that&#39;s right.

536
00:13:13 --> 00:13:16
And you traveled all this way
just to see me.

537
00:13:16 --> 00:13:16
I&#39;m flattered.

538
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
Well, it&#39;s kind of strange not knowing
what to put down in the family Bible.

539
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
It&#39;s kinda strange three guys
have to die just to you can hear...

540
00:13:20 --> 00:13:22
No, no, no.
You don&#39;t get to put that shit on me.

541
00:13:22 --> 00:13:23
Those kills are on you.

542
00:13:23 --> 00:13:25
I have a feeling that&#39;s not
the only thing on me right now.

543
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
Okay, got barium shells,
stab-shock, explosive tip...

544
00:13:27 --> 00:13:28
What do you want, barium or stab-shock?

545
00:13:28 --> 00:13:28
Horse tranq.

546
00:13:28 --> 00:13:31
I hate to interrupt this discussion
about ancient history,

547
00:13:31 --> 00:13:34
but maybe I should step in right here
and introduce myself.

548
00:13:34 --> 00:13:35
- My name is...
- Box Boy.

549
00:13:35 --> 00:13:35
Say what?

550
00:13:35 --> 00:13:39
You are the guy who said that he was
gonna put my head in a box. Right?

551
00:13:39 --> 00:13:42
Well, that was me...
spitting noise.

552
00:13:42 --> 00:13:43
But you do have a box.

553
00:13:43 --> 00:13:44
Do I have a box?

554
00:13:44 --> 00:13:45
Thought I saw one.

555
00:13:45 --> 00:13:47
I mean, of course I&#39;ve got a box.
Everyone&#39;s got a box, man.

556
00:13:47 --> 00:13:49
Even Diaz has a fucking huge box.

557
00:13:49 --> 00:13:49
Good.

558
00:13:49 --> 00:13:50
We&#39;re gonna use it.

559
00:13:50 --> 00:13:52
Three down, eight left.

560
00:13:52 --> 00:13:53
Now, normally I&#39;d just keep going.

561
00:13:53 --> 00:13:56
Six down... nine down...

562
00:13:56 --> 00:13:57
You get where I&#39;m going with this.

563
00:13:57 --> 00:13:58
But things are changing here...

564
00:13:58 --> 00:14:01
and nobody wants to be
on this planet 24 hours from now.

565
00:14:01 --> 00:14:02
So I suggest we make it work.

566
00:14:02 --> 00:14:03
What do you want,
a &quot;gentleman’s agreement&quot;?

567
00:14:03 --> 00:14:06
I&#39;ll leave one node out in the open.
You take it.

568
00:14:06 --> 00:14:09
The other node
and the other ship are mine.

569
00:14:09 --> 00:14:10
Hey, wait, wait.

570
00:14:10 --> 00:14:14
What are we playing here,
Retard Bingo? What?

571
00:14:14 --> 00:14:16
- That was on the table from the start...
- Forget the start.

572
00:14:16 --> 00:14:18
It&#39;s the end you want
to think about now.

573
00:14:18 --> 00:14:18
See that?

574
00:14:18 --> 00:14:21
I&#39;ll give you till that rain
hits that station.

575
00:14:21 --> 00:14:22
That&#39;s your clock.

576
00:14:22 --> 00:14:22
&quot;Box Boy&quot;.

577
00:14:22 --> 00:14:24
Dahl! Do it now! Now!

578
00:14:24 --> 00:14:24
Again!

579
00:14:24 --> 00:14:25
He&#39;s not going down.

580
00:14:25 --> 00:14:25
Do it again, Dahl!

581
00:14:25 --> 00:14:26
Just go down.

582
00:14:26 --> 00:14:27
I got this, Dahl.

583
00:14:27 --> 00:14:27
Riddick.

584
00:14:27 --> 00:14:27
Riddick?

585
00:14:27 --> 00:14:27
Johns?

586
00:14:27 --> 00:14:28
You beating men in chains now?

587
00:14:28 --> 00:14:31
Okay, from the beginning.
For the historical record...

588
00:14:31 --> 00:14:31
The Hunter Gratzner.

589
00:14:31 --> 00:14:33
That&#39;s the commercial vessel my son uses
to transport you back to the slammer.

590
00:14:33 --> 00:14:37
But that ship sends a distress call
somewhere near M-344/G.

591
00:14:37 --> 00:14:40
It&#39;s a backwater system, two suns,
one habitable planet.

592
00:14:40 --> 00:14:41
Does he survive the crash?

593
00:14:41 --> 00:14:42
Big drama the next few hours.

594
00:14:42 --> 00:14:46
But whatever happens,
no matter what they tell you...

595
00:14:46 --> 00:14:48
don&#39;t let &#39;em take these chains off me.

596
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
&quot;Them?&quot; Who&#39;s &quot;them?&quot; Who&#39;re you talking...
Do you know who you&#39;re talking to here?

597
00:14:51 --> 00:14:52
That was for me?

598
00:14:52 --> 00:14:53
When the chains come off...

599
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
- Jesus Christ!
- Box Boy...

600
00:14:55 --> 00:14:58
you go in the first five seconds.

601
00:14:58 --> 00:14:58
Really?

602
00:14:58 --> 00:14:59
And you plan on killing me with what,
your mouth?

603
00:14:59 --> 00:15:00
That shiny blade.

604
00:15:00 --> 00:15:01
I&#39;d love to see you try.

605
00:15:01 --> 00:15:02
For the historical record...

606
00:15:02 --> 00:15:03
he made it.

607
00:15:03 --> 00:15:04
So it&#39;s just you and him?

608
00:15:04 --> 00:15:05
Was, uh...

609
00:15:05 --> 00:15:07
about the same number
you see here in this room.

610
00:15:07 --> 00:15:08
So now many made it off?

611
00:15:08 --> 00:15:09
Three.

612
00:15:09 --> 00:15:10
But not him?

613
00:15:10 --> 00:15:11
No.

614
00:15:11 --> 00:15:14
So between the time of the crash
and the time you leave that planet...

615
00:15:14 --> 00:15:15
my son dies.

616
00:15:15 --> 00:15:19
And I can safely assume
it&#39;s at your hands. Is that right?

617
00:15:19 --> 00:15:20
I&#39;m wasting my fucking time here!

618
00:15:20 --> 00:15:21
You grant any last wishes?

619
00:15:21 --> 00:15:22
I was referring to you.

620
00:15:22 --> 00:15:26
Not that the chains aren&#39;t
a hot look, but no.

621
00:15:26 --> 00:15:28
I&#39;m not gonna straddle you
in front of all these guys.

622
00:15:28 --> 00:15:29
What if I killed all of &#39;em first?

623
00:15:29 --> 00:15:29
Easy, boy.

624
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
There&#39;s a lot more tranq
where that came from.

625
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
Tell me what you see outside
that window, Dahl.

626
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
Cyclps unit, two ships...

627
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
couple dead guys in plastic.

628
00:15:37 --> 00:15:38
And you don&#39;t see anything else?

629
00:15:38 --> 00:15:38
Nothing else.

630
00:15:38 --> 00:15:39
Let me know when you do.

631
00:15:39 --> 00:15:41
Love those toenails, by the way.

632
00:15:41 --> 00:15:41
Yeah?

633
00:15:41 --> 00:15:42
Predator Pink.

634
00:15:42 --> 00:15:43
Matches your nipples.

635
00:15:43 --> 00:15:46
Why are we even listening
to this big fuckstick?

636
00:15:46 --> 00:15:49
Can we just detach his head, please?

637
00:15:49 --> 00:15:50
Here&#39;s what&#39;s gonna happen.

638
00:15:50 --> 00:15:53
The next 60 seconds, you&#39;re gonna watch
your own head drop into that box.

639
00:15:53 --> 00:15:53
Nothing...

640
00:15:53 --> 00:15:55
nothing is gonna keep you
from that special place in Hell.

641
00:15:55 --> 00:15:57
Maybe in the last minute of your life,
you want to be something more...

642
00:15:57 --> 00:15:59
than a goddamn savage!!

643
00:15:59 --> 00:16:00
Gimme some fucking answers!

644
00:16:00 --> 00:16:00
Please!

645
00:16:00 --> 00:16:03
Well, is there anything you&#39;d like
to add on the subject I just raised?

646
00:16:03 --> 00:16:03
Time&#39;s up.

647
00:16:03 --> 00:16:03
Time&#39;s up.

648
00:16:03 --> 00:16:03
He&#39;s all yours.

649
00:16:03 --> 00:16:03
Hold him down.

650
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
End of game, dude.

651
00:16:05 --> 00:16:06
More dingo-dongos maybe.

652
00:16:06 --> 00:16:06
Fuck it.

653
00:16:06 --> 00:16:07
I know what&#39;s coming.

654
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
Called to find you.
The serpents...

655
00:16:10 --> 00:16:11
Spotlight!

656
00:16:11 --> 00:16:12
Like I said...

657
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
it ain&#39;t me you gotta worry about.

658
00:16:14 --> 00:16:15
What is it?
What&#39;s out there?

659
00:16:15 --> 00:16:15
I don&#39;t know.

660
00:16:15 --> 00:16:16
Fucked up or something out there.

661
00:16:16 --> 00:16:19
It ain&#39;t right.
It&#39;s coming our way.

662
00:16:19 --> 00:16:21
Whatever they are,
they ain&#39;t so hard to kill.

663
00:16:21 --> 00:16:21
What the fuck?!

664
00:16:21 --> 00:16:21
Fuck!

665
00:16:21 --> 00:16:22
No more holes, please.

666
00:16:22 --> 00:16:23
Now here&#39;s what&#39;s gonna happen.

667
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
In 60 seconds you&#39;re gonna
take these chains off me.

668
00:16:25 --> 00:16:27
We&#39;re gonna make a play for
those nodes and get off this rock.

669
00:16:27 --> 00:16:28
But somewhere along the line...

670
00:16:28 --> 00:16:29
when it gets really bad...

671
00:16:29 --> 00:16:30
Johns...

672
00:16:30 --> 00:16:33
is gonna fold
just like Little Johns did.

673
00:16:33 --> 00:16:34
Then when it&#39;s all over...

674
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
and the rest of you are ready
for Dead Animal Pickup...

675
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
I&#39;m gonna go balls deep into Dahl.

676
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
But only because she asked me to.

677
00:16:40 --> 00:16:41
Sweet-like.

678
00:16:41 --> 00:16:44
What does he mean, &quot;When things go bad&quot;?
This doesn&#39;t qualify as bad?!

679
00:16:44 --> 00:16:46
What the fuck is happening?
How fucked are we?

680
00:16:46 --> 00:16:47
Who knows how long it will rain?

681
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
Or just how many of them
are buried out there?

682
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
He saw it. He saw it with those eyes
of his and he didn&#39;t tell us what.

683
00:16:53 --> 00:16:55
One ship for you, one for me.

684
00:16:55 --> 00:16:57
I need to know that
these nodes are retrievable.

685
00:16:57 --> 00:16:58
And I need to know we have a deal.

686
00:16:58 --> 00:16:59
We got a deal.

687
00:16:59 --> 00:17:01
The chains stay on.

688
00:17:01 --> 00:17:02
Why don&#39;t we sit this one out?

689
00:17:02 --> 00:17:02
Okay, okay.

690
00:17:02 --> 00:17:03
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up...

691
00:17:03 --> 00:17:03
Good doggie.

692
00:17:03 --> 00:17:05
Holy... shit.

693
00:17:05 --> 00:17:06
Yeah.

694
00:17:06 --> 00:17:07
Let&#39;s cut him loose.

695
00:17:07 --> 00:17:08
That was five seconds.

696
00:17:08 --> 00:17:10
I like to be a man of my word.

697
00:17:10 --> 00:17:12
How about you, Johns?

698
00:17:12 --> 00:17:14
He shall give His angels charge over me,
keep me in all His grace...

699
00:17:14 --> 00:17:15
- Shut the noise, Luna!
- as long as I live.

700
00:17:15 --> 00:17:19
You know, I think the angels
are here protecting me.

701
00:17:19 --> 00:17:20
And if they&#39;re here,
watching over me...

702
00:17:20 --> 00:17:20
Maybe they&#39;ll deliver us...

703
00:17:20 --> 00:17:21
- all from this crazy-shit place.
- That shit is creeping everybody out...

704
00:17:21 --> 00:17:23
- so shut the fuck up!
- You shut the fuck up, Vargas!

705
00:17:23 --> 00:17:24
Leave the kid alone.

706
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
Where the hell did that...?
Jesus Christ!

707
00:17:26 --> 00:17:26
No, no, no, no!

708
00:17:26 --> 00:17:28
What the fuck is wrong with you,
you crazy bastard!

709
00:17:28 --> 00:17:28
You could have killed me!

710
00:17:28 --> 00:17:28
Got it, didn&#39;t I?

711
00:17:28 --> 00:17:29
Vargas, get up.

712
00:17:29 --> 00:17:30
Vargas, get up.
Come on, let&#39;s go!

713
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
Vargas, come on, man. Walk it off.
Let&#39;s go. It&#39;s just a little one.

714
00:17:33 --> 00:17:34
Small ones are the worst.

715
00:17:34 --> 00:17:35
They save the most venom.

716
00:17:35 --> 00:17:35
And kid?

717
00:17:35 --> 00:17:36
Leave God out of this.

718
00:17:36 --> 00:17:38
He wants no part of what happens next.

719
00:17:38 --> 00:17:39
I forgot to mention...

720
00:17:39 --> 00:17:40
there&#39;s no weapons for you.

721
00:17:40 --> 00:17:41
You think you can ride
one of these things?

722
00:17:41 --> 00:17:42
I&#39;ll ride it like I stole it.

723
00:17:42 --> 00:17:42
I&#39;ll take flank.

724
00:17:42 --> 00:17:43
If Riddick comes back here
without us...

725
00:17:43 --> 00:17:45
you go ahead,
you kill him on general principle.

726
00:17:45 --> 00:17:47
Is that before or after
I&#39;m supposed to fuck him?

727
00:17:47 --> 00:17:49
You asshole motherfucker!
Just sitting there watching!

728
00:17:49 --> 00:17:52
Would have covered you,
but you said &quot;no weapons&quot;.

729
00:17:52 --> 00:17:54
I bet you want those nodes, Johns.

730
00:17:54 --> 00:17:56
Hey, I don&#39;t suppose you took
the time to do this for him, huh?

731
00:17:56 --> 00:17:58
This may come
as a shock to you, Johns...

732
00:17:58 --> 00:17:59
but I didn&#39;t ghost your son.

733
00:17:59 --> 00:18:01
He seemed set on killing himself.

734
00:18:01 --> 00:18:02
What the fuck does that mean?

735
00:18:02 --> 00:18:02
Morphine.

736
00:18:02 --> 00:18:03
Your son liked his morphine.

737
00:18:03 --> 00:18:04
Liked it twice a day.

738
00:18:04 --> 00:18:05
Didn&#39;t know your son was a junkie?

739
00:18:05 --> 00:18:06
Johns was like most mercs.

740
00:18:06 --> 00:18:09
They look all stand-up and do-right...

741
00:18:09 --> 00:18:11
until you cut them open
and you find something missing.

742
00:18:11 --> 00:18:12
In his case, a spine.

743
00:18:12 --> 00:18:14
I don&#39;t have to listen to this shit!
That&#39;s not the man I knew.

744
00:18:14 --> 00:18:15
Then you didn&#39;t know your son.

745
00:18:15 --> 00:18:16
He wanted to kill a kid.

746
00:18:16 --> 00:18:17
To save his own skin.

747
00:18:17 --> 00:18:18
I had a problem with that.

748
00:18:18 --> 00:18:19
You expect me to believe...

749
00:18:19 --> 00:18:21
my son was gonna kill
a child to save his own life?

750
00:18:21 --> 00:18:24
Morphine makes the brain soft.
Heart wrong.

751
00:18:24 --> 00:18:25
I don&#39;t fucking buy it!

752
00:18:25 --> 00:18:27
I just can&#39;t believe
that my son&#39;s the bad guy

753
00:18:27 --> 00:18:30
in this fucking demented
fairy tale of yours.

754
00:18:30 --> 00:18:31
No reason to lie now...

755
00:18:31 --> 00:18:31
Johns.

756
00:18:31 --> 00:18:32
Either one of us.

757
00:18:32 --> 00:18:34
Thanks for starting
the killing spree for me, Riddick.

758
00:18:34 --> 00:18:35
But I&#39;ll take it from here.

759
00:18:35 --> 00:18:36
Jamoke.

760
00:18:36 --> 00:18:38
So that blade you buried
was meant for me?

761
00:18:38 --> 00:18:40
Anyone who deserved it, really.

762
00:18:40 --> 00:18:41
We&#39;ve got a problem, Riddick...

763
00:18:41 --> 00:18:42
because I&#39;ve got two nodes here.

764
00:18:42 --> 00:18:43
We&#39;ve got one hog.

765
00:18:43 --> 00:18:47
And I sure as shit am not
riding bitch with you again.

766
00:18:47 --> 00:18:48
One hog?

767
00:18:48 --> 00:18:49
You sure about that, Johns?

768
00:18:49 --> 00:18:51
He pulled the goddamn turbine pin!

769
00:18:51 --> 00:18:52
You just figured that out?

770
00:18:52 --> 00:18:55
Diaz was gonna take the nodes
for himself and ghost me.

771
00:18:55 --> 00:18:56
He was gonna leave you out here alone.

772
00:18:56 --> 00:18:57
So what now?

773
00:18:57 --> 00:18:58
Now we switch to our ground game.

774
00:18:58 --> 00:19:00
Let&#39;s see if that lack of spine
runs in the family.

775
00:19:00 --> 00:19:00
Reload!

776
00:19:00 --> 00:19:00
Watch your head.

777
00:19:00 --> 00:19:00
Go!

778
00:19:00 --> 00:19:00
I got inbound.

779
00:19:00 --> 00:19:00
Take this!

780
00:19:00 --> 00:19:00
Is it just you?

781
00:19:00 --> 00:19:02
Just slam this thing in.
See if it&#39;s still good.

782
00:19:02 --> 00:19:02
Boss...

783
00:19:02 --> 00:19:04
Just see if the fucking thing works!
We need to get outta here.

784
00:19:04 --> 00:19:07
Extraction, 30 seconds or less.
Let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go!

785
00:19:07 --> 00:19:08
Let me ask you something...

786
00:19:08 --> 00:19:08
sweet-like...

787
00:19:08 --> 00:19:09
Lot of good men died here, Riddick.

788
00:19:09 --> 00:19:12
Not sure how I&#39;m supposed
to overlook that. Next time.

789
00:19:12 --> 00:19:13
Yeah. Things would
have been different

790
00:19:13 --> 00:19:15
if they weren&#39;t trying
to put my head in a box.

791
00:19:15 --> 00:19:16
So where to now, Riddick?

792
00:19:16 --> 00:19:19
You know what? Fuck that. Don&#39;t tell me.
I don&#39;t wanna know.

793
00:19:19 --> 00:19:20
I&#39;ll tell you this, Johns.

794
00:19:20 --> 00:19:23
Sooner or later,
we all have to head home.

795
00:19:23 --> 00:19:25
Tell Dahl to keep it warm for me.

796
00:19:25 --> 00:19:26
And Johns...

797
00:19:26 --> 00:19:27
you keep a strong spine.

fire

3
00:00:01 --> 00:00:04
Quick! Quick!

4
00:00:04 --> 00:00:05
Quick!

5
00:00:05 --> 00:00:06
Fire!

6
00:00:06 --> 00:00:06
Fire!

7
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
Hurry up! Move quickly!

8
00:00:08 --> 00:00:10
Go! Go now!

9
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
Come on! Hurry up!

10
00:00:13 --> 00:00:16
Quick! Shoot them!

11
00:00:16 --> 00:00:17
Fire!

12
00:00:17 --> 00:00:24
The enemy is retreating!

13
00:00:24 --> 00:00:25
Look, general

14
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
Kaifeng Fortress is endangered!

15
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
I&#39;m innocent!

16
00:00:29 --> 00:00:31
My Lord, I&#39;m not guilty!

17
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
Shut up!

18
00:00:33 --> 00:00:37
General Sun, you&#39;ve suffered enough!

19
00:00:37 --> 00:00:42
The Emperor calls for you, I&#39;m here to inform

20
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
Congrat, general! You are free now

21
00:00:45 --> 00:00:54
General Sun, this is urgent, please come to see the Emperor immediately!

22
00:00:54 --> 00:01:01
Sun Chuanting come to see the Emperor, long live the Emperor! (Three times)

23
00:01:01 --> 00:01:02
hostilities endangered

24
00:01:02 --> 00:01:04
Tell me your opinion

25
00:01:04 --> 00:01:08
How many soldiers we need to defeat the enemy?

26
00:01:08 --> 00:01:11
5,000 elite troops are enough.

27
00:01:11 --> 00:01:14
5,000 horsemen and footmen?

28
00:01:14 --> 00:01:16
Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s not enough?

29
00:01:16 --> 00:01:19
Including the troops at Kaifeng is enough

30
00:01:19 --> 00:01:22
The rebels are just a bunch of untrained groups, there&#39;s nothing to worry about!

31
00:01:22 --> 00:01:28
If the troops there listened to me in the first place, today would be different.

32
00:01:28 --> 00:01:30
Father!

33
00:01:30 --> 00:01:33
Father!

34
00:01:33 --> 00:01:34
Grandpa!

35
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
It&#39;s him!

36
00:01:36 --> 00:01:40
My father took his herbs and died, take him!

37
00:01:40 --> 00:01:41
Wu Youke!

38
00:01:41 --> 00:01:43
I&#39;ve never learnt about medicine

39
00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
But I do know how to use orchid

40
00:01:46 --> 00:01:50
That much of quantity could kill a person

41
00:01:50 --> 00:01:52
Do you have any explanation?

42
00:01:52 --> 00:01:54
Thiis is the used herbs I&#39;ve collected at their house

43
00:01:54 --> 00:01:56
This is absolutely not the recipe I gave them

44
00:01:56 --> 00:01:57
Please take a look

45
00:01:57 --> 00:02:00
I&#39;ve already checked them. There is ginseng, huangpu

46
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
They are supplement herbs

47
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
However, when I came to their house for medical examination

48
00:02:04 --> 00:02:07
His father&#39;s tounge had a yellow thick layer, artery was weak

49
00:02:07 --> 00:02:08
Obviously there was a harmful gas inside

50
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
Hence, I gave him herbs to make him throw up

51
00:02:11 --> 00:02:13
My lord, my father took his herbs

52
00:02:13 --> 00:02:14
and threw up many times, without supplements...

53
00:02:14 --> 00:02:14
Nonsense!

54
00:02:14 --> 00:02:17
How can those supplement herbs can eliminate harmful gas

55
00:02:17 --> 00:02:19
Your father was very weak

56
00:02:19 --> 00:02:21
Providing supplements would be poisoning him

57
00:02:21 --> 00:02:22
You&#39;re wrong, my father just took a little

58
00:02:22 --> 00:02:22
How could...

59
00:02:22 --> 00:02:23
Sassy!

60
00:02:23 --> 00:02:27
If you were skeptical in the first place, why didn&#39;t come to see me ealier?

61
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
Alright. go home and bury your father. Case dismissed!

62
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
Thank you, my lord!

63
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
Wu Youke

64
00:02:33 --> 00:02:36
You gave strange herb recipe to my people

65
00:02:36 --> 00:02:38
You are lucky this time

66
00:02:38 --> 00:02:41
From now on, you are not allowed to work in my area

67
00:02:41 --> 00:02:45
Think carefully before doing something...

68
00:02:45 --> 00:02:54
Before saying something...

69
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
Your hands

70
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
No meal until you remember

71
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
You just play all day, lack of spirit!

72
00:03:00 --> 00:03:01
I understand, mom!

73
00:03:01 --> 00:03:03
My lord

74
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
Lord Sun came home!

75
00:03:05 --> 00:03:10
My lady, lord Sun is home

76
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
Tell me, how many troops are there in your group?

77
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
Remain silence and I will kill you

78
00:03:14 --> 00:03:18
You dare to throw up on my shoes!

79
00:03:18 --> 00:03:20
You scum bag, want to rebel?

80
00:03:20 --> 00:03:21
Someone is coming

81
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
Prepare your weapons

82
00:03:23 --> 00:03:24
What are you doing?

83
00:03:24 --> 00:03:25
I&#39;m a healer

84
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
A healer? Take him!

85
00:03:27 --> 00:03:29
I&#39;m truly a healer

86
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
not a thief nor traitor

87
00:03:31 --> 00:03:35
Why do you people hit me like this? I&#39;m not a criminal

88
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
Where are you from? Tell me your name

89
00:03:37 --> 00:03:40
Wu Youke, from Kunshan, Suzhou

90
00:03:40 --> 00:03:41
Where are you going to?

91
00:03:41 --> 00:03:43
To Shaanxi, to find a friend

92
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
Brother, let him check your wound

93
00:03:45 --> 00:03:46
Let&#39;s see is he a real healer

94
00:03:46 --> 00:03:47
Come here

95
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
Officier, there are 6 types of people a healer won&#39;t help

96
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
Man has power and bully the others, I won&#39;t cure!

97
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
This guy has some valor

98
00:03:54 --> 00:03:56
I will flay your skin and take your bones

99
00:03:56 --> 00:03:58
Tell me do you still refuse?

100
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
Doctor, I&#39;m sorry for that

101
00:04:00 --> 00:04:01
It is war time now

102
00:04:01 --> 00:04:05
We&#39;ve just captured a traitor, we thought that your were his friend

103
00:04:05 --> 00:04:08
My brothers were a little bit serious, please forgive them

104
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
Your wound is very deep

105
00:04:10 --> 00:04:12
You look like a gentleman, not a bandit

106
00:04:12 --> 00:04:14
Not just a normal bandit, he is one of their leaders

107
00:04:14 --> 00:04:17
Without treatment, he will die soon in that condition

108
00:04:17 --> 00:04:18
You want to help a bandit now

109
00:04:18 --> 00:04:19
I think you don&#39;t want to live anymore

110
00:04:19 --> 00:04:20
Even if you help him

111
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
Tommorow he&#39;s going to be a dead man anyway

112
00:04:22 --> 00:04:23
The rain is over

113
00:04:23 --> 00:04:24
They are here

114
00:04:24 --> 00:04:25
Grab your weapons

115
00:04:25 --> 00:04:26
We found them, hurry up!

116
00:04:26 --> 00:04:29
One of them is running away, follow him

117
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
I&#39;m not a soldier, I&#39;m a healer

118
00:04:31 --> 00:04:32
He&#39;s just helped that soldier

119
00:04:32 --> 00:04:33
Kill him

120
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
Do not kill him

121
00:04:36 --> 00:04:41
Greeting, Field Marshal

122
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
Where is general He Renlong?

123
00:04:43 --> 00:04:49
As your command, except He Renlong, other generals are gathering at Tongguan

124
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
Drink, my brothers

125
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
I feel very good today, cheers!

126
00:04:54 --> 00:04:57
Welcome lord commander

127
00:04:57 --> 00:04:58
Commander

128
00:04:58 --> 00:04:59
Stand up

129
00:04:59 --> 00:05:01
Sun Chaunting has arrived, let&#39;s go

130
00:05:01 --> 00:05:02
Got it! Let&#39;s go!

131
00:05:02 --> 00:05:04
Move

132
00:05:04 --> 00:05:10
Your brothers spare me a live, I am so lucky

133
00:05:10 --> 00:05:12
You look like a literature man

134
00:05:12 --> 00:05:14
Why do you want to rebel?

135
00:05:14 --> 00:05:17
My name is Li Tian Wu, I&#39;m a bachelor

136
00:05:17 --> 00:05:18
calamities happens all year

137
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
taxes doesn&#39;t reduce, the government even  rises them up

138
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
People in my village can&#39;t stand anymore

139
00:05:22 --> 00:05:24
We were going to join Dashing King (Li Zicheng)&#39;s army

140
00:05:24 --> 00:05:27
However, on the way, we met the imperial troops

141
00:05:27 --> 00:05:29
You have healing skill

142
00:05:29 --> 00:05:32
Why don&#39;t you come with us to meet the Dashing King?

143
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
After winning the war, you can go home with wealth

144
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
Our world is changing

145
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
Who knows it&#39;s good or bad luck. Come on, drink this

146
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
Commander He Renlong has arrived

147
00:05:43 --> 00:05:44
My lord, sword is not allowed...

148
00:05:44 --> 00:05:44
Fuck off

149
00:05:44 --> 00:05:45
Greeting, Field Marshal

150
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
Lord He, I really miss you

151
00:05:48 --> 00:05:49
When I was in jail

152
00:05:49 --> 00:05:52
I was just thinking about the days you and I fought side by side

153
00:05:52 --> 00:05:54
Field Marshal, I&#39;m not intent to be late

154
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
I met a bunch of bandits on the way

155
00:05:56 --> 00:05:58
Quick, bring them in

156
00:05:58 --> 00:06:00
Take a look

157
00:06:00 --> 00:06:01
Well done

158
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
Lord commander made a great credit, let&#39;s reward him!

159
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
The Emperor is pleased

160
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
He gives you a gift

161
00:06:08 --> 00:06:09
Really?

162
00:06:09 --> 00:06:12
Good job, brothers

163
00:06:12 --> 00:06:13
Lord commander is drinking with lord Field Marshal

164
00:06:13 --> 00:06:16
They tell me to treat you nicely

165
00:06:16 --> 00:06:17
Thank you, lord Field Marshal

166
00:06:17 --> 00:06:19
Come on, let&#39;s party

167
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
He Renlong don&#39;t respect anyone, except lord Field Marshal

168
00:06:22 --> 00:06:23
Well said!

169
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
Prepare to hear the Emperor&#39;s words

170
00:06:25 --> 00:06:26
He Renlong, listen

171
00:06:26 --> 00:06:27
Here I am

172
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
Here are the Emperor words,

173
00:06:29 --> 00:06:30
Lord commander He Renlong

174
00:06:30 --> 00:06:32
is magisterial and misusing authority

175
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
Disrespected the Emperor

176
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
Ran away when enemy was advancing

177
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
Once again refused to advance the troops

178
00:06:39 --> 00:06:42
Made my people hateful, can&#39;t not be spared

179
00:06:42 --> 00:06:44
Let&#39;s drink

180
00:06:44 --> 00:06:45
oh shit

181
00:06:45 --> 00:06:46
Come forward

182
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
go!

183
00:06:49 --> 00:06:50
This way

184
00:06:50 --> 00:06:53
Sun Chuanting, you think you can kill me?

185
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
Let me tell you

186
00:06:54 --> 00:06:55
The troops comming with you...

187
00:06:55 --> 00:06:56
From now on

188
00:06:56 --> 00:06:58
I don&#39;t give a shit about you

189
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
I ony care about Ming&#39;s soldiery

190
00:07:00 --> 00:07:01
Sun Chuanting!

191
00:07:01 --> 00:07:05
By this time, I guess He Renlong has lost his head

192
00:07:05 --> 00:07:09
Now Sun Chuanting has all the power

193
00:07:09 --> 00:07:13
What will happen if we can&#39;t not control him

194
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
My Emperor is clever

195
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
I do not dare to comment

196
00:07:17 --> 00:07:21
Lord commander He Renlong is beheaded

197
00:07:21 --> 00:07:23
This notice really writing about He Renlong?

198
00:07:23 --> 00:07:24
Correct!

199
00:07:24 --> 00:07:25
What did you do?

200
00:07:25 --> 00:07:28
Even a powerful general like him can be beheaded

201
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
In the morning,  I tried to wake him up several times but he didn&#39;t move

202
00:07:31 --> 00:07:34
Checking again, he was dead long ago

203
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
Did he act anything strange yesterday evening?

204
00:07:36 --> 00:07:38
He had a fever and threw up

205
00:07:38 --> 00:07:40
We thought that it was because of the weather, so we didn&#39;t pay much attention

206
00:07:40 --> 00:07:41
Nonsense!

207
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
How can bad weather kill a person

208
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
Yes Sir, I think so too.

209
00:07:45 --> 00:07:46
From his conditions, we can see that

210
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
His dead is caused by typhoid

211
00:07:48 --> 00:07:49
This is the season changing time

212
00:07:49 --> 00:07:50
The weather is unstable

213
00:07:50 --> 00:07:53
Your soldiers having typhoid is not a strange thing

214
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
Thanks to your words, I feel ok now

215
00:07:55 --> 00:07:57
But if the disease still continues,

216
00:07:57 --> 00:07:58
I hope that you will help us

217
00:07:58 --> 00:07:59
Don&#39;t worry, general

218
00:07:59 --> 00:08:01
I will be there anytime you need

219
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
Quick, bury him now, try not to be noticed

220
00:08:04 --> 00:08:06
I don&#39;t want this affect the army&#39;s spirit

221
00:08:06 --> 00:08:07
Yes sir

222
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
Tofu, buy some good tofu

223
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
Come, take a look

224
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
Get in, quick

225
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
Grandpa!

226
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
Master

227
00:08:18 --> 00:08:23
You are...Youke!

228
00:08:23 --> 00:08:24
Master

229
00:08:24 --> 00:08:25
Long time no see, please take a invocation from me

230
00:08:25 --> 00:08:26
Alright, stand up

231
00:08:26 --> 00:08:29
Van Thu, look who&#39;s here

232
00:08:29 --> 00:08:33
Your daughter is so young when becoming a widow

233
00:08:33 --> 00:08:35
It&#39;s unfortunate

234
00:08:35 --> 00:08:37
Poor my son in law

235
00:08:37 --> 00:08:38
He was just a petty guard

236
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
Killed by bandits last year

237
00:08:41 --> 00:08:44
If my daughter married you instead...

238
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
Nevermind

239
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
I only know that you resigned your position at court and work independently

240
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
But I don&#39;t know why

241
00:08:50 --> 00:08:53
In the time I worked at Medical Deparment, I found out my colleagues are all liars

242
00:08:53 --> 00:08:54
I could not stand them

243
00:08:54 --> 00:08:59
And I was afraid to forget a doctor&#39;s duties

244
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
It is so

245
00:09:01 --> 00:09:04
Leaving the Medical Department to become a normal healer

246
00:09:04 --> 00:09:10
Not many people can do that

247
00:09:10 --> 00:09:11
I remember that year

248
00:09:11 --> 00:09:15
When I defeated Li Zicheng

249
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
I wore this same armor

250
00:09:18 --> 00:09:23
If the rebels are not becoming more and more powerful

251
00:09:23 --> 00:09:28
I think I don&#39;t need this armor anymore

252
00:09:28 --> 00:09:33
Lord Field Marshal is coming, gather the troops now

253
00:09:33 --> 00:09:36
All the group pay attention to the signals

254
00:09:36 --> 00:09:37
Captain

255
00:09:37 --> 00:09:38
Here I am

256
00:09:38 --> 00:09:39
Let&#39;s begin

257
00:09:39 --> 00:09:40
Yes sir

258
00:09:40 --> 00:09:42
Steady

259
00:09:42 --> 00:09:43
Fire!

260
00:09:43 --> 00:09:44
Steady

261
00:09:44 --> 00:09:45
Fire

262
00:09:45 --> 00:09:47
Complete

263
00:09:47 --> 00:09:48
Steady

264
00:09:48 --> 00:09:49
Fire

265
00:09:49 --> 00:09:51
Stop!

266
00:09:51 --> 00:09:52
How can you use this?

267
00:09:52 --> 00:09:55
They gave me this gun

268
00:09:55 --> 00:09:57
Captain Nham, tell me why

269
00:09:57 --> 00:10:00
When I came here, this situation had already happened

270
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
There is still no solution

271
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
This problem can not be solved in a short time

272
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
Brother, what&#39;s wrong with you?

273
00:10:06 --> 00:10:07
Wake up

274
00:10:07 --> 00:10:08
Brother

275
00:10:08 --> 00:10:09
Wake up

276
00:10:09 --> 00:10:10
What happened?

277
00:10:10 --> 00:10:11
Lord Field Marshal

278
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
The weather is changing recently

279
00:10:13 --> 00:10:14
They&#39;re sick for several days

280
00:10:14 --> 00:10:16
I&#39;ve already invite a healer to the camp

281
00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
Lord Field Marshal

282
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
Lord Field Marshal

283
00:10:22 --> 00:10:24
My lord, the Emperor send you his words

284
00:10:24 --> 00:10:27
Please come back to the head quarter camp to listen

285
00:10:27 --> 00:10:30
Field Marshal Sun, the Emperor&#39;s will is obvious

286
00:10:30 --> 00:10:33
He wants you to advance your troops immediately

287
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
In order to help Keifong

288
00:10:35 --> 00:10:36
Tell him not to worry about this

289
00:10:36 --> 00:10:42
I&#39;m preparing the food supply, the dispatching day is comming soon

290
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
Dad, we run out of herb

291
00:10:44 --> 00:10:45
Again?

292
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
My fellow, we run out of herb

293
00:10:48 --> 00:10:49
Please come back later

294
00:10:49 --> 00:10:50
We&#39;ve been waiting for all day

295
00:10:50 --> 00:10:51
People

296
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
Our country is at war, we all have difficulties

297
00:10:53 --> 00:10:54
I can&#39;t not do much

298
00:10:54 --> 00:10:55
Please go home

299
00:10:55 --> 00:10:56
Go home, please

300
00:10:56 --> 00:10:57
Out of herb again

301
00:10:57 --> 00:11:00
Herb supply is shortening in recent years

302
00:11:00 --> 00:11:02
Some herbs even run out for a long time

303
00:11:02 --> 00:11:07
I think that our job is at recession stage now

304
00:11:07 --> 00:11:10
Doctor Trieu,  my captain asks for your present

305
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
The amount of infected people is rising everyday

306
00:11:12 --> 00:11:15
The disease seems to be spreading out, there are infected soldiers in almost all the camps

307
00:11:15 --> 00:11:17
Doctor, which camp do we visit first?

308
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
Let&#39;s go to the White Tiger camp first

309
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
Show me your tounge

310
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
Your tounge

311
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
Take this recipe and collect the herbs

312
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
Collect the herbs now, as soon as possible

313
00:11:28 --> 00:11:29
Got it

314
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
Captain, you should see this

315
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
Doctor Trieu, my two soldiers have the same condition

316
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
However, the recipes are different, are there any mistakes?

317
00:11:37 --> 00:11:40
Ah, a disease can be cured by different recipes, it&#39;s normal thing

318
00:11:40 --> 00:11:43
Perhaps it is due to the way we use herbs

319
00:11:43 --> 00:11:48
Youke, why don&#39;t you use the typhoid treatment recipe?

320
00:11:48 --> 00:11:52
Master, I don&#39;t think they have typhoid

321
00:11:52 --> 00:11:54
So it&#39;s my mistake?

322
00:11:54 --> 00:11:55
Come, let me check again

323
00:11:55 --> 00:11:56
His pulse rates

324
00:11:56 --> 00:11:58
Tell me that it&#39;s typhoid

325
00:11:58 --> 00:12:00
How can you deny it?

326
00:12:00 --> 00:12:03
Typhoid&#39;s symptoms, hot inside the body and chill outside

327
00:12:03 --> 00:12:05
Unstable pulse rates

328
00:12:05 --> 00:12:07
But they only feel hot, not cold

329
00:12:07 --> 00:12:10
It&#39;s definately another disease

330
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
They did not get sick when matching

331
00:12:12 --> 00:12:14
The conditions began when they came here

332
00:12:14 --> 00:12:16
If it is because of the cold wind

333
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
A few people have a cold or typhoid

334
00:12:18 --> 00:12:19
There is nothing to worry about

335
00:12:19 --> 00:12:20
It&#39;&#39;s impossible that within 1 day

336
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
People in a whole camp all get sick

337
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
In my opinion, it looks like a epidemic

338
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
It&#39;s easy to have typhoid in this season

339
00:12:28 --> 00:12:29
It&#39;s obvious

340
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
My ancestors also tell me that

341
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
There is no epidemic here

342
00:12:33 --> 00:12:36
I only guess base on what I&#39;ve seen

343
00:12:36 --> 00:12:37
I&#39;m not sure

344
00:12:37 --> 00:12:40
Even though you are not confident, you dare to give people your remedy?

345
00:12:40 --> 00:12:44
I only.... gentlemens, can you discuss later?

346
00:12:44 --> 00:12:46
I ought to collect the herbs quickly

347
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
So tell me which one of you should I listen to?

348
00:12:49 --> 00:12:50
Captain

349
00:12:50 --> 00:12:51
It&#39;s the first time Youke come here

350
00:12:51 --> 00:12:53
He doesn&#39;t have enough understanding in this area

351
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
I will take full responsibility here

352
00:12:56 --> 00:13:00
Follow my remedy to collect the herbs

353
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
Go now

354
00:13:02 --> 00:13:03
Master

355
00:13:03 --> 00:13:07
I can not prove that the epidemic is existing

356
00:13:07 --> 00:13:11
However, I&#39;ve cured for many patients recently

357
00:13:11 --> 00:13:15
I&#39;ve gained some knowledge about this epidemic

358
00:13:15 --> 00:13:18
Youke, &quot;Typhoid Study&quot; has more than a thousand years history

359
00:13:18 --> 00:13:22
You can not say successfully curing for some people

360
00:13:22 --> 00:13:25
And think that you are a god healer

361
00:13:25 --> 00:13:27
Using herbs in an abnormal method

362
00:13:27 --> 00:13:30
is forbidden in our healing practice

363
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
The Tao of healing is the greatest thing in our life

364
00:13:33 --> 00:13:35
You can&#39;t not use the term &quot;epidemic&quot;

365
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
to explain for this?

366
00:13:37 --> 00:13:41
It is because the Tao of healing is the greatest thing

367
00:13:41 --> 00:13:46
Therefore, I can not let master making more serious mistakes

368
00:13:46 --> 00:13:47
Youke

369
00:13:47 --> 00:13:52
You do not need to go to the camp tomorrow morning

370
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
How can we use these weapons?

371
00:13:54 --> 00:13:55
Why don&#39;t you ask for others?

372
00:13:55 --> 00:13:57
My lord, I&#39;ve already tried many times

373
00:13:57 --> 00:14:00
But there is no response

374
00:14:00 --> 00:14:02
Please forgive us

375
00:14:02 --> 00:14:04
Wang Wang, I saw you

376
00:14:04 --> 00:14:08
Wang Wang, I will catch you

377
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
My lord, lord Field Marshal is here

378
00:14:10 --> 00:14:13
Hide yourself now

379
00:14:13 --> 00:14:15
Lord Field Marshal

380
00:14:15 --> 00:14:19
Your petty servant greeting lord Field Marshal

381
00:14:19 --> 00:14:20
Come

382
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
Have some tea, my lord

383
00:14:22 --> 00:14:25
My lord, here&#39;s the record

384
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
Please take a look

385
00:14:27 --> 00:14:28
This way, my lord

386
00:14:28 --> 00:14:32
This place is the food supply center of our whole army

387
00:14:32 --> 00:14:36
This is the most important place

388
00:14:36 --> 00:14:39
You manage the food warehouse in a good process

389
00:14:39 --> 00:14:43
Very good, this guy is our valuable asset

390
00:14:43 --> 00:14:45
Move

391
00:14:45 --> 00:14:47
I&#39;m sorry, my lord

392
00:14:47 --> 00:14:48
Knowing that you are going to investigate

393
00:14:48 --> 00:14:49
I was scared and confused

394
00:14:49 --> 00:14:53
The food supply has been shortened for years

395
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
Die

396
00:14:55 --> 00:14:57
Daddy

397
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
My husband

398
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
Daddy

399
00:15:01 --> 00:15:06
Tia Ninh, let&#39;s play outside

400
00:15:06 --> 00:15:07
Daddy

401
00:15:07 --> 00:15:10
You&#39;re not allowed to kill horses, you mustn&#39;t eat them

402
00:15:10 --> 00:15:13
Fuck off, or I will eat you instead

403
00:15:13 --> 00:15:16
You must not kill the horses

404
00:15:16 --> 00:15:19
They are not your food. Fuck off

405
00:15:19 --> 00:15:20
Die, bitch

406
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
These pigeons are sending messages

407
00:15:23 --> 00:15:25
Quick

408
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
Damn it!

409
00:15:27 --> 00:15:30
Please come down, Your Majesty

410
00:15:30 --> 00:15:32
He confidently told me that 5,000 elite troops are enough

411
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
Now he&#39;s asking me to supply more food

412
00:15:34 --> 00:15:37
And weapons are rotted, can&#39;t be used

413
00:15:37 --> 00:15:39
Kaifeng is being besieged for a long time

414
00:15:39 --> 00:15:40
My people is dieing everyday

415
00:15:40 --> 00:15:42
And he&#39;s there doing nothing?

416
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
My Emperor

417
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
If he is telling the truth

418
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
Food is not enough, weapons are rotted

419
00:15:48 --> 00:15:52
We can not win the battle even though he agrees to dispatch all the troops

420
00:15:52 --> 00:15:57
Sun Chuanting&#39;s army is my elitist force

421
00:15:57 --> 00:16:01
Losing Kaifeng, we can not hold the capital

422
00:16:01 --> 00:16:03
If Sun Chuanting doesn&#39;t dispatch the troops

423
00:16:03 --> 00:16:05
then I have to take his head just like He Renlong?

424
00:16:05 --> 00:16:08
Keep sending my words, push him to dispatch

425
00:16:08 --> 00:16:08
Ok

426
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
Quick

427
00:16:10 --> 00:16:11
Hold his body

428
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
Hold him tight

429
00:16:13 --> 00:16:15
You&#39;re gonna be okay

430
00:16:15 --> 00:16:16
How&#39;s he?

431
00:16:16 --> 00:16:18
His arms and legs are cold

432
00:16:18 --> 00:16:20
Eyes turn dark, unstable pulse rates

433
00:16:20 --> 00:16:21
This is typhoid

434
00:16:21 --> 00:16:26
We use herbs to warm their body and they will be fine

435
00:16:26 --> 00:16:27
Day by day

436
00:16:27 --> 00:16:31
More soldiers are dieing

437
00:16:31 --> 00:16:32
If you can not cure this quick,

438
00:16:32 --> 00:16:35
I&#39;m afraid that we can not hide this situation any longer

439
00:16:35 --> 00:16:36
This is all we have

440
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
Now we have to depend on them

441
00:16:38 --> 00:16:39
Do not stop working

442
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
Have we received any news from the Court yet?

443
00:16:42 --> 00:16:43
My lord

444
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
You have message from the War Deparment

445
00:16:45 --> 00:16:47
Again, they push us to  dispatch

446
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
How about more food supply and the weapons?

447
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
No mention

448
00:16:52 --> 00:16:54
Be careful

449
00:16:54 --> 00:16:55
Docter Trieu

450
00:16:55 --> 00:16:58
At first, you told me that you only need a few days

451
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
Now I have more and more dead soldiers

452
00:17:01 --> 00:17:02
Can you explain?

453
00:17:02 --> 00:17:06
The environment in military camp is different from the outside

454
00:17:06 --> 00:17:08
I tried my best

455
00:17:08 --> 00:17:11
You see, these herbs

456
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
Follow the typhoid treating recipe

457
00:17:13 --> 00:17:15
Of my ancestors

458
00:17:15 --> 00:17:17
I don&#39;t care about your ancestors

459
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
I give you 3 more days

460
00:17:19 --> 00:17:23
After 3 days, if there is no good result

461
00:17:23 --> 00:17:31
Even though the Field Marshal doesn&#39;t blame you, these soldiers will not spare you life

462
00:17:31 --> 00:17:36
Lord Field Marshal, here are our little gifts for you

463
00:17:36 --> 00:17:40
They will be brought to your house later, please receive them

464
00:17:40 --> 00:17:42
Thank you, gentlemen

465
00:17:42 --> 00:17:47
Our government is fighting the rebels, we hope that you keep supporting us

466
00:17:47 --> 00:17:48
Definately

467
00:17:48 --> 00:17:53
Helping the realm and people is our duty

468
00:17:53 --> 00:17:55
Gentlemen

469
00:17:55 --> 00:17:56
Stop

470
00:17:56 --> 00:18:00
To be honest, our army is lacking of funds significantly

471
00:18:00 --> 00:18:05
However, the Nation Treasury has no gold now, the Emperor can&#39;t help us

472
00:18:05 --> 00:18:09
The reason I am here today

473
00:18:09 --> 00:18:13
is to ask you to help us on this problem

474
00:18:13 --> 00:18:17
The country is at risk, we all have responsibilities

475
00:18:17 --> 00:18:21
Can you tell me how much gold you need?

476
00:18:21 --> 00:18:26
At least 10,000 gold unit (FYI: 1 Chinese gold unit = 1.20556 ounce)

477
00:18:26 --> 00:18:28
10,000?

478
00:18:28 --> 00:18:30
That&#39;s too much

479
00:18:30 --> 00:18:33
My lord, we really want to help

480
00:18:33 --> 00:18:36
But we produce less in several years

481
00:18:36 --> 00:18:41
Although we have some fortune, but it&#39;s decreasing to a small amount

482
00:18:41 --> 00:18:44
We paid a large amount of tax

483
00:18:44 --> 00:18:47
Your request is very difficult to fulfill

484
00:18:47 --> 00:18:49
If we lose the Tong Pass

485
00:18:49 --> 00:18:55
then your lands, treasure, even your live and your families will be lost

486
00:18:55 --> 00:19:00
Does gold still meaning anything in that scenario?

487
00:19:00 --> 00:19:03
Lord Field Marshal is right!

488
00:19:03 --> 00:19:05
Bring me the checks

489
00:19:05 --> 00:19:08
500 gold unit

490
00:19:08 --> 00:19:10
100

491
00:19:10 --> 00:19:11
50

492
00:19:11 --> 00:19:16
We will send words to the Court

493
00:19:16 --> 00:19:23
Maybe the Emperor will provide you more budget

494
00:19:23 --> 00:19:29
These are what you give me

495
00:19:29 --> 00:19:33
These are what you give to the Great Ming

496
00:19:33 --> 00:19:35
If Ming dynasty is destroyed

497
00:19:35 --> 00:19:39
Then what is the use of the gifts you give?

498
00:19:39 --> 00:19:40
20% of land used for breed

499
00:19:40 --> 00:19:41
80% for farming

500
00:19:41 --> 00:19:45
This is the main income of National Treasury since the time of the Great Ming began

501
00:19:45 --> 00:19:47
A combine of breeding any farming

502
00:19:47 --> 00:19:49
Rising the military force, then argriculture must be weakened

503
00:19:49 --> 00:19:52
All these lands are belong to the rich

504
00:19:52 --> 00:19:54
Farm for soldiers is not a real thing

505
00:19:54 --> 00:19:57
In order to have enough food supply to keep fighting

506
00:19:57 --> 00:20:02
We have to take back all those farming land from the landlords

507
00:20:02 --> 00:20:04
Who&#39;s that

508
00:20:04 --> 00:20:05
Brother

509
00:20:05 --> 00:20:07
Why do you come back?

510
00:20:07 --> 00:20:08
Van Thu

511
00:20:08 --> 00:20:09
Where is master?

512
00:20:09 --> 00:20:10
My father went to the camp

513
00:20:10 --> 00:20:12
The number of soldiers got sick is rising everday

514
00:20:12 --> 00:20:13
He haven&#39;t gone home for days

515
00:20:13 --> 00:20:15
I will go to his place then

516
00:20:15 --> 00:20:16
Van Thu

517
00:20:16 --> 00:20:20
Now I can prove how the epidemic can be infected

518
00:20:20 --> 00:20:21
What do you mean?

519
00:20:21 --> 00:20:22
Come

520
00:20:22 --> 00:20:23
Do you see that?

521
00:20:23 --> 00:20:24
See what?

522
00:20:24 --> 00:20:25
The dust

523
00:20:25 --> 00:20:26
Look

524
00:20:26 --> 00:20:28
Normally we can not see them

525
00:20:28 --> 00:20:29
But they do exist in the air

526
00:20:29 --> 00:20:31
The pathogens are the same as dust

527
00:20:31 --> 00:20:32
They fly in the air

528
00:20:32 --> 00:20:33
We can&#39;t see and hear them

529
00:20:33 --> 00:20:35
I named them &quot;Air Disease&quot;

530
00:20:35 --> 00:20:36
If I breath the air having pathogens

531
00:20:36 --> 00:20:37
and get sick

532
00:20:37 --> 00:20:39
By breathing, I will infect you

533
00:20:39 --> 00:20:41
then you infect other people

534
00:20:41 --> 00:20:44
That&#39;s the way this epidemic is spreading out

535
00:20:44 --> 00:20:46
Drink your drug

536
00:20:46 --> 00:20:50
Go away. Everyone took your drug and died. Go away

537
00:20:50 --> 00:20:52
Come on, drink it

538
00:20:52 --> 00:20:53
What&#39;s wrong with you?

539
00:20:53 --> 00:20:54
I don&#39;t want it

540
00:20:54 --> 00:20:55
What&#39;s your problem?

541
00:20:55 --> 00:20:57
The doctor only gives you herbs

542
00:20:57 --> 00:20:58
What&#39;s wrong?

543
00:20:58 --> 00:20:59
Help him to stand up

544
00:20:59 --> 00:21:01
Drink your drug now

545
00:21:01 --> 00:21:02
Brother Ma Tam

546
00:21:02 --> 00:21:05
What are you doing? Give him my drug now

547
00:21:05 --> 00:21:07
Brother, don&#39;t scare me

548
00:21:07 --> 00:21:09
Everyone is panic

549
00:21:09 --> 00:21:12
Is the God punishing us?

550
00:21:12 --> 00:21:14
If it is dark magic, we can not cure this

551
00:21:14 --> 00:21:17
That&#39;s why they died no matter how much drug they drank

552
00:21:17 --> 00:21:18
What are you talking about?

553
00:21:18 --> 00:21:19
Captain!

554
00:21:19 --> 00:21:21
Trieu Xuyen

555
00:21:21 --> 00:21:23
Why do you come here?

556
00:21:23 --> 00:21:29
The soldiers in your camp, they don&#39;t want to take my drugs

557
00:21:29 --> 00:21:31
Oh shit, he got sick too

558
00:21:31 --> 00:21:32
I can not help them

559
00:21:32 --> 00:21:36
I can&#39;t allow it

560
00:21:36 --> 00:21:37
Cease him now

561
00:21:37 --> 00:21:39
You, tell me

562
00:21:39 --> 00:21:40
Tell me

563
00:21:40 --> 00:21:42
That&#39;s the recipe my ancestors give me

564
00:21:42 --> 00:21:47
Even though it failed help them, it can&#39;t kill people

565
00:21:47 --> 00:21:51
Finally, what is the problem?

566
00:21:51 --> 00:21:53
Captain, what should we do now?

567
00:21:53 --> 00:21:55
Find another healer now

568
00:21:55 --> 00:21:55
Got it

569
00:21:55 --> 00:21:58
I want to meet doctor Trieu. Where is he? I want to see him

570
00:21:58 --> 00:21:59
Where is master Trieu?

571
00:21:59 --> 00:22:00
Why do you want to see him?

572
00:22:00 --> 00:22:02
I want to tell him how the epidemic is spreading out

573
00:22:02 --> 00:22:03
Epidemic? What are you talking about?

574
00:22:03 --> 00:22:04
Everything has a life

575
00:22:04 --> 00:22:05
Air is an essential element

576
00:22:05 --> 00:22:07
It helps to maintain living

577
00:22:07 --> 00:22:08
If a pathogen appears

578
00:22:08 --> 00:22:09
It will spread out in the air

579
00:22:09 --> 00:22:13
This is the reason why your soldiers constantly get sick

580
00:22:13 --> 00:22:14
Can you cure?

581
00:22:14 --> 00:22:16
I come here to tell you

582
00:22:16 --> 00:22:17
Because of your carelessness

583
00:22:17 --> 00:22:19
The pathogens have been spreading out of the camps

584
00:22:19 --> 00:22:22
Now the people living around here are all infected

585
00:22:22 --> 00:22:23
Nonsense

586
00:22:23 --> 00:22:25
Your words are not logical at all

587
00:22:25 --> 00:22:27
You are making my soldiers panic

588
00:22:27 --> 00:22:29
With this situation, we&#39;ve already lost before having a fight, haven&#39;t we?

589
00:22:29 --> 00:22:30
Do you know

590
00:22:30 --> 00:22:32
Almost everyone in the village nearby is dieing

591
00:22:32 --> 00:22:33
If you don&#39;t make your decision now

592
00:22:33 --> 00:22:37
Then all the soldiers and people in this area will be dead, including you and me

593
00:22:37 --> 00:22:45
Give away underworld money (FYI: Chinese believe that dead people also use money in the underworld)

594
00:22:45 --> 00:22:48
We praise for your soul

595
00:22:48 --> 00:22:52
Whose&#39;s fault is it? Tell me now!

596
00:22:52 --> 00:22:54
At first there were only a few soldiers

597
00:22:54 --> 00:22:57
After taking drugs, the number went up everday

598
00:22:57 --> 00:22:58
There are more than 10 men die daily

599
00:22:58 --> 00:22:59
Damn you

600
00:22:59 --> 00:22:59
My lord

601
00:22:59 --> 00:23:01
I am sorry, I am unable to cure this

602
00:23:01 --> 00:23:03
Useless, why should I keep your life?

603
00:23:03 --> 00:23:04
Kill him

604
00:23:04 --> 00:23:06
Mercy, my lord

605
00:23:06 --> 00:23:08
Take me to other camps

606
00:23:08 --> 00:23:12
Lord Field Marshal, this is the last camp

607
00:23:12 --> 00:23:17
My lord, there is something, I&#39;m wondering should I tell you or not

608
00:23:17 --> 00:23:20
Uncle, is Suzhou far away from here?

609
00:23:20 --> 00:23:22
I have to walk for a while to be there

610
00:23:22 --> 00:23:23
Do you want to go with me?

611
00:23:23 --> 00:23:25
Suzhou is very interesting

612
00:23:25 --> 00:23:27
You really need to leave?

613
00:23:27 --> 00:23:31
After master&#39;s funeral finishes, I will go

614
00:23:31 --> 00:23:32
Van Thu

615
00:23:32 --> 00:23:34
There is an epidemic here

616
00:23:34 --> 00:23:37
It&#39;s too dangerous for you two to stay here

617
00:23:37 --> 00:23:39
Why don&#39;t you come with me?

618
00:23:39 --> 00:23:41
Don&#39;t you think I am a bad luck?

619
00:23:41 --> 00:23:42
My husband died few years ago

620
00:23:42 --> 00:23:44
Now I bury my father

621
00:23:44 --> 00:23:47
Quick! It&#39;s here. This is the place

622
00:23:47 --> 00:23:49
Who is Wu Youke?

623
00:23:49 --> 00:23:50
I am

624
00:23:50 --> 00:23:53
Stand up, lord Field Marshal is coming

625
00:23:53 --> 00:23:54
According to you

626
00:23:54 --> 00:23:59
Pathogens really can fly in the air?

627
00:23:59 --> 00:24:00
Correct

628
00:24:00 --> 00:24:03
When we breath, beside the air

629
00:24:03 --> 00:24:05
We also take other tiny things into our body

630
00:24:05 --> 00:24:08
These little things can be a pathogen

631
00:24:08 --> 00:24:11
If it&#39;s typhoid, there will be no pathogen

632
00:24:11 --> 00:24:14
And the disease could not be infected

633
00:24:14 --> 00:24:16
The herbs could cure easily

634
00:24:16 --> 00:24:19
However, if this is a epidemic spreading in the air

635
00:24:19 --> 00:24:21
It will be much different

636
00:24:21 --> 00:24:24
7 years ago, in the battle of Tong Pass, general Long The Uy&#39;s army

637
00:24:24 --> 00:24:28
also had a epidemic and lost the battle

638
00:24:28 --> 00:24:31
Now it&#39;s happening right here

639
00:24:31 --> 00:24:34
Does the God want to destroy us?

640
00:24:34 --> 00:24:35
I ask you

641
00:24:35 --> 00:24:40
If I allow you to cure this disease, can you do it?

642
00:24:40 --> 00:24:41
Lord Field Marshal

643
00:24:41 --> 00:24:43
I&#39;m not an experienced healer

644
00:24:43 --> 00:24:44
My skill is poor

645
00:24:44 --> 00:24:46
I can not take this responsibility

646
00:24:46 --> 00:24:48
You are just a talker then

647
00:24:48 --> 00:24:52
When it&#39;s the time to act, you run away

648
00:24:52 --> 00:24:54
This is the reason why Ming dynasty is falling

649
00:24:54 --> 00:24:55
Because of people like you

650
00:24:55 --> 00:24:58
Don&#39;t have to gut to stand out and help your country

651
00:24:58 --> 00:25:00
You tell me that in recent years

652
00:25:00 --> 00:25:02
You&#39;re trying to learn healing skill

653
00:25:02 --> 00:25:04
Then what&#39;s the point?

654
00:25:04 --> 00:25:06
You don&#39;t apply the knowledge you&#39;ve learnt

655
00:25:06 --> 00:25:09
What is your purpose then?

656
00:25:09 --> 00:25:12
But this is an epidemic

657
00:25:12 --> 00:25:19
I&#39;ve only cured for some people, not too many like this

658
00:25:19 --> 00:25:25
It&#39;s too difficult to save all the patients now

659
00:25:25 --> 00:25:27
I&#39;ve never met doctor Trieu before

660
00:25:27 --> 00:25:31
But I know he is a brave man

661
00:25:31 --> 00:25:34
You learnt his healing skill

662
00:25:34 --> 00:25:40
But you didn&#39;t learn his Tao and spirit, what a pity

663
00:25:40 --> 00:25:42
Tonight, pack up your stuff

664
00:25:42 --> 00:25:45
And come to my camp tomorrow morning

665
00:25:45 --> 00:25:46
Let&#39;s return

666
00:25:46 --> 00:25:47
Soldiers

667
00:25:47 --> 00:25:47
Yes, my lord

668
00:25:47 --> 00:25:49
Put some men to guard this place

669
00:25:49 --> 00:25:51
And bring him to me tomorrow morning

670
00:25:51 --> 00:25:52
Yes sir

671
00:25:52 --> 00:25:54
Prepare the horses

672
00:25:54 --> 00:25:55
Go

673
00:25:55 --> 00:25:58
Don&#39;t believe in those words of lord Field Marshal

674
00:25:58 --> 00:26:02
He said that to make you going to the camp

675
00:26:02 --> 00:26:03
This time

676
00:26:03 --> 00:26:06
Going to the camp is very risky

677
00:26:06 --> 00:26:09
Probably I&#39;m following the master to the death

678
00:26:09 --> 00:26:11
and never come back

679
00:26:11 --> 00:26:14
They always say: for the country, for the people

680
00:26:14 --> 00:26:18
But why we always have to suffer in the end?

681
00:26:18 --> 00:26:20
This epidemic

682
00:26:20 --> 00:26:24
Could be the God&#39;s will

683
00:26:24 --> 00:26:26
Drink

684
00:26:26 --> 00:26:28
Take it

685
00:26:28 --> 00:26:30
You really have to go?

686
00:26:30 --> 00:26:31
I wrote a recipe

687
00:26:31 --> 00:26:34
You must keep it

688
00:26:34 --> 00:26:36
Just in case

689
00:26:36 --> 00:26:38
This is the recipe?

690
00:26:38 --> 00:26:43
Sun Chuanting&#39;s words make sense to me

691
00:26:43 --> 00:26:45
I&#39;ve learnt for years

692
00:26:45 --> 00:26:47
In the end, what&#39;s the point?

693
00:26:47 --> 00:26:49
You should sleep now

694
00:26:49 --> 00:26:54
I have to think carefully about what should I do tomorrow

695
00:26:54 --> 00:26:58
we stuck in this situation, now it depends on the fate now

696
00:26:58 --> 00:27:00
Take me to the camp

697
00:27:00 --> 00:27:02
Wake up

698
00:27:02 --> 00:27:03
You want me to cure this epidemic

699
00:27:03 --> 00:27:05
I have some conditions

700
00:27:05 --> 00:27:07
Say it

701
00:27:07 --> 00:27:08
Firstly

702
00:27:08 --> 00:27:11
I&#39;m the only one who decides the use of herbs

703
00:27:11 --> 00:27:14
You can not interfere

704
00:27:14 --> 00:27:15
Ok

705
00:27:15 --> 00:27:16
What&#39;s else

706
00:27:16 --> 00:27:17
During my treatment

707
00:27:17 --> 00:27:21
No matter how ridiculous my method is

708
00:27:21 --> 00:27:23
I can not be replaced by someone else

709
00:27:23 --> 00:27:25
Ok

710
00:27:25 --> 00:27:27
I, Wu Youke

711
00:27:27 --> 00:27:30
Will try my best

712
00:27:30 --> 00:27:32
Never back down

713
00:27:32 --> 00:27:34
Wu Youke

714
00:27:34 --> 00:27:36
Do you know the term

715
00:27:36 --> 00:27:39
&quot;Military action is not a joke&quot;?

716
00:27:39 --> 00:27:41
I understand

717
00:27:41 --> 00:27:45
Good. Just confidently do your work

718
00:27:45 --> 00:27:46
Captain Nham

719
00:27:46 --> 00:27:46
Present

720
00:27:46 --> 00:27:48
You must support him with all the resources

721
00:27:48 --> 00:27:50
I got it

722
00:27:50 --> 00:27:51
This epidemic

723
00:27:51 --> 00:27:54
affects the result in the battle and the fate of Ming dynasty

724
00:27:54 --> 00:27:57
If you succeed, your name will be remembered for a thousand years

725
00:27:57 --> 00:28:07
If you fail, you, me and these soldiers will die without being buried

726
00:28:07 --> 00:28:10
Round up

727
00:28:10 --> 00:28:12
Show your tongues

728
00:28:12 --> 00:28:14
Let me see your tongue

729
00:28:14 --> 00:28:16
Wear him the yellow ribbon

730
00:28:16 --> 00:28:18
Show me your tongue

731
00:28:18 --> 00:28:19
Give it to me

732
00:28:19 --> 00:28:21
Your arm

733
00:28:21 --> 00:28:22
People, listen

734
00:28:22 --> 00:28:23
Look at the ribbon&#39;s coulor on the arm

735
00:28:23 --> 00:28:25
and go to your group

736
00:28:25 --> 00:28:27
You can not make mistake

737
00:28:27 --> 00:28:28
My lord, please wear this mask

738
00:28:28 --> 00:28:31
I&#39;m the Field Marshal, how can I wear this piece of shit?

739
00:28:31 --> 00:28:32
How long?

740
00:28:32 --> 00:28:33
3 days

741
00:28:33 --> 00:28:34
Look at his tongue

742
00:28:34 --> 00:28:36
Tongue plaque is very thick

743
00:28:36 --> 00:28:37
His condition is serious

744
00:28:37 --> 00:28:38
Very dangerous

745
00:28:38 --> 00:28:39
Give him the white ribbon

746
00:28:39 --> 00:28:44
Collect the bodies, no mistake is allowed

747
00:28:44 --> 00:28:44
Wait for me

748
00:28:44 --> 00:28:44
Tia Ninh, be careful

749
00:28:44 --> 00:28:45
You will die if you are infected

750
00:28:45 --> 00:28:46
I know

751
00:28:46 --> 00:28:48
Tia Ninh is still young

752
00:28:48 --> 00:28:53
Let him stay here, I can&#39;t be assured

753
00:28:53 --> 00:28:56
You two should go home, stay away for a while

754
00:28:56 --> 00:29:01
If you wear mask in the camp like the others, I will be happier

755
00:29:01 --> 00:29:02
Who told you to put that in?

756
00:29:02 --> 00:29:04
It is not the right herb

757
00:29:04 --> 00:29:05
Why you make a big fire like this?

758
00:29:05 --> 00:29:06
How can they drink now

759
00:29:06 --> 00:29:08
We must make a small fire, cook the herbs slowly

760
00:29:08 --> 00:29:10
Throw away, do it again

761
00:29:10 --> 00:29:14
How many times did I tell you? You must keep this place ventilated

762
00:29:14 --> 00:29:16
Mom, I want to eat

763
00:29:16 --> 00:29:18
Be careful

764
00:29:18 --> 00:29:20
Tofu&#39;s here

765
00:29:20 --> 00:29:22
Who wants tofu?

766
00:29:22 --> 00:29:24
Tofu&#39;s here

767
00:29:24 --> 00:29:25
Drink this

768
00:29:25 --> 00:29:27
No, I don&#39;t want to drink anymore

769
00:29:27 --> 00:29:28
You must drink

770
00:29:28 --> 00:29:30
People either vomit or get diarrhea after taking your drug

771
00:29:30 --> 00:29:33
That&#39;s good, it helps your digestion

772
00:29:33 --> 00:29:34
Then you can eat something

773
00:29:34 --> 00:29:35
and your health will recover

774
00:29:35 --> 00:29:36
Come on, drink

775
00:29:36 --> 00:29:39
Brother, it&#39;s time to take drug

776
00:29:39 --> 00:29:41
How can you recover without medicinal herbs?

777
00:29:41 --> 00:29:43
Let me do it

778
00:29:43 --> 00:29:45
You can&#39;t be cured without using drug

779
00:29:45 --> 00:29:46
Drink

780
00:29:46 --> 00:29:47
Drink it

781
00:29:47 --> 00:29:48
You don&#39;t want to drink

782
00:29:48 --> 00:29:51
How can you get well?

783
00:29:51 --> 00:29:53
Your treatment has been going for days

784
00:29:53 --> 00:29:55
How long does the result take?

785
00:29:55 --> 00:29:56
All of them do not trust me

786
00:29:56 --> 00:29:57
They don&#39;t want to take drug

787
00:29:57 --> 00:29:58
How can they recover?

788
00:29:58 --> 00:30:01
Brother, are you getting better now?

789
00:30:01 --> 00:30:02
Who allowed you to come here? Get out

790
00:30:02 --> 00:30:04
No access without permission

791
00:30:04 --> 00:30:05
Go

792
00:30:05 --> 00:30:09
Brother, you mustn&#39;t die

793
00:30:09 --> 00:30:11
My brother is dead thank to your drug

794
00:30:11 --> 00:30:13
Now you make us drink it

795
00:30:13 --> 00:30:14
I will kill you

796
00:30:14 --> 00:30:15
Damn you!

797
00:30:15 --> 00:30:17
You really want to die?

798
00:30:17 --> 00:30:19
I will help you on that

799
00:30:19 --> 00:30:22
Docter Wo, is invited by lord Field Marshal

800
00:30:22 --> 00:30:24
Who dare to kill him?

801
00:30:24 --> 00:30:27
Doctor, do we need to keep giving them drugs?

802
00:30:27 --> 00:30:28
Doctor

803
00:30:28 --> 00:30:30
How&#39;s the situation?

804
00:30:30 --> 00:30:32
More than 10 people are dead today

805
00:30:32 --> 00:30:36
But the number of new infected soldiers

806
00:30:36 --> 00:30:39
is decreasing in recent days

807
00:30:39 --> 00:30:43
However, the infected soldiers, they are becoming aggressive

808
00:30:43 --> 00:30:46
We must make them calm

809
00:30:46 --> 00:30:47
Announce my order

810
00:30:47 --> 00:30:49
All the soldiers who are dead

811
00:30:49 --> 00:30:51
Their families will be tax-exempt

812
00:30:51 --> 00:30:52
Yes sir

813
00:30:52 --> 00:30:55
There are so many infected people here, can you live alone like this?

814
00:30:55 --> 00:30:58
I&#39;ve never cure so many people like this

815
00:30:58 --> 00:31:02
No matter what happens, I will do as much as I can

816
00:31:02 --> 00:31:04
I can not fail them

817
00:31:04 --> 00:31:07
Nearly there are soldiers brought me some food

818
00:31:07 --> 00:31:09
Thank you for still remembering us

819
00:31:09 --> 00:31:11
If you need someone to help...

820
00:31:11 --> 00:31:12
You are a woman

821
00:31:12 --> 00:31:15
Staying in the camp is inappropriate

822
00:31:15 --> 00:31:17
Wait

823
00:31:17 --> 00:31:22
Here are some medical documents

824
00:31:22 --> 00:31:24
I&#39;ve collected

825
00:31:24 --> 00:31:26
You keep them

826
00:31:26 --> 00:31:27
In case I can&#39;t make it

827
00:31:27 --> 00:31:29
You will edit and make a book for me

828
00:31:29 --> 00:31:31
Perhaps It will be useful in the future

829
00:31:31 --> 00:31:33
This time I am here to cure the epidemic

830
00:31:33 --> 00:31:35
If a fail

831
00:31:35 --> 00:31:38
I am not sure that I can come out

832
00:31:38 --> 00:31:41
Don&#39;t you say such unfortunate thing

833
00:31:41 --> 00:31:43
I have to check the patients now

834
00:31:43 --> 00:31:44
Wear this

835
00:31:44 --> 00:31:47
You shouldn&#39;t come here

836
00:31:47 --> 00:31:50
Having this ribbon, the soldiers won&#39;t stop you

837
00:31:50 --> 00:31:53
Do not tell anyone, leave now

838
00:31:53 --> 00:31:55
If I fail

839
00:31:55 --> 00:31:56
The epidemic spread out

840
00:31:56 --> 00:31:58
Many people will be dead

841
00:31:58 --> 00:32:00
Hurry up

842
00:32:00 --> 00:32:02
If I can come out this place

843
00:32:02 --> 00:32:06
I will definately bring you two to Suzhou

844
00:32:06 --> 00:32:07
According to your calculation

845
00:32:07 --> 00:32:09
All the food we have

846
00:32:09 --> 00:32:11
How long can it feed my army?

847
00:32:11 --> 00:32:14
Maximum 3 months

848
00:32:14 --> 00:32:16
Damn it

849
00:32:16 --> 00:32:18
My lord, we can&#39;t blame him

850
00:32:18 --> 00:32:19
We&#39;ve tried our best

851
00:32:19 --> 00:32:21
Those land lords still don&#39;t want to help

852
00:32:21 --> 00:32:22
I sent men to observe those farms

853
00:32:22 --> 00:32:24
but they were harassed by the landlords servants

854
00:32:24 --> 00:32:30
If we can&#39;t collect those farm land, we will collect &quot;people&quot; then

855
00:32:30 --> 00:32:33
Last days, there are some soldiers occupy our farmland

856
00:32:33 --> 00:32:35
They even assaulted our servants

857
00:32:35 --> 00:32:37
Sun Chuanting&#39;s man told me

858
00:32:37 --> 00:32:39
If we keep holding the food

859
00:32:39 --> 00:32:40
They will arrest us

860
00:32:40 --> 00:32:42
No more food in my house

861
00:32:42 --> 00:32:44
My house neither

862
00:32:44 --> 00:32:45
Damn it!

863
00:32:45 --> 00:32:47
I think he really wants to go against us

864
00:32:47 --> 00:32:48
This is crazy

865
00:32:48 --> 00:32:52
The letter we sent, the Emperor&#39;ve probably received

866
00:32:52 --> 00:32:53
I really want to see

867
00:32:53 --> 00:32:55
Whether the Great Ming still has laws and regulations or not

868
00:32:55 --> 00:32:57
If we do not do it quick

869
00:32:57 --> 00:32:58
Gentlemen

870
00:32:58 --> 00:33:01
The ledger of those farmland we occupied

871
00:33:01 --> 00:33:04
is being kept in The Library

872
00:33:04 --> 00:33:06
I&#39;m afraid that

873
00:33:06 --> 00:33:08
If Sun Chuanting has it

874
00:33:08 --> 00:33:11
What will happen?

875
00:33:11 --> 00:33:14
This is very serious

876
00:33:14 --> 00:33:15
So what do you intend to do?

877
00:33:15 --> 00:33:16
Come out

878
00:33:16 --> 00:33:17
In recent years

879
00:33:17 --> 00:33:20
You&#39;ve received from us lots of wealth

880
00:33:20 --> 00:33:23
Now you should do something for us in return

881
00:33:23 --> 00:33:25
Doctor

882
00:33:25 --> 00:33:28
Let me see you tongue

883
00:33:28 --> 00:33:30
Your condition is worse than the other&#39;s

884
00:33:30 --> 00:33:31
You are infected but you didn&#39;t inform us

885
00:33:31 --> 00:33:33
Now it&#39;s very serious

886
00:33:33 --> 00:33:35
What should I do?

887
00:33:35 --> 00:33:38
Did you come out the camp without permision?

888
00:33:38 --> 00:33:40
Where did you take this?

889
00:33:40 --> 00:33:42
You don&#39;t want to say?

890
00:33:42 --> 00:33:44
I won&#39;t help. I don&#39;t want to cure your illness

891
00:33:44 --> 00:33:45
Get out

892
00:33:45 --> 00:33:46
Doctor

893
00:33:46 --> 00:33:47
I say

894
00:33:47 --> 00:33:49
I found this clothes&#39;s quality so good

895
00:33:49 --> 00:33:50
So I wore them

896
00:33:50 --> 00:33:52
I beg you, please help me

897
00:33:52 --> 00:33:54
You&#39;re wearing the death&#39;s clothes?

898
00:33:54 --> 00:33:56
Hurry up

899
00:33:56 --> 00:33:58
Make it quick

900
00:33:58 --> 00:33:59
I don&#39;t want to live?

901
00:33:59 --> 00:34:00
Keep going

902
00:34:00 --> 00:34:03
Quick, do it

903
00:34:03 --> 00:34:06
Do it quickly

904
00:34:06 --> 00:34:11
Fire. The Library is on fire

905
00:34:11 --> 00:34:15
Extinguish the fire now. Quick, turn it off

906
00:34:15 --> 00:34:17
Call for more men now

907
00:34:17 --> 00:34:19
Hurry up, call the others

908
00:34:19 --> 00:34:21
Quick

909
00:34:21 --> 00:34:25
Turn the fire off

910
00:34:25 --> 00:34:27
Where is Wan Lin Lin?

911
00:34:27 --> 00:34:29
Field Marshal, we&#39;ve just found a burned body

912
00:34:29 --> 00:34:31
That&#39;s Wan Lin Lin

913
00:34:31 --> 00:34:34
Death without witness

914
00:34:34 --> 00:34:37
This is my life&#39;s biggest frustration!

915
00:34:37 --> 00:34:42
Can&#39;t fix things need to be fixed, can&#39;t kill those must be killed!

916
00:34:42 --> 00:34:44
All these years

917
00:34:44 --> 00:34:47
Who did I fight for?

918
00:34:47 --> 00:34:49
For who?

919
00:34:49 --> 00:34:52
Who gave you the order?

920
00:34:52 --> 00:34:54
Who?

921
00:34:54 --> 00:34:56
Captain

922
00:34:56 --> 00:34:59
Impersonating as civilian to steal soldier&#39;s uniform

923
00:34:59 --> 00:35:03
What is the punishment for that crime?

924
00:35:03 --> 00:35:04
Come on

925
00:35:04 --> 00:35:08
Hold it tight

926
00:35:08 --> 00:35:09
You go back first

927
00:35:09 --> 00:35:13
There are other plants, I have to collect some more

928
00:35:13 --> 00:35:15
Go

929
00:35:15 --> 00:35:16
That&#39;s right

930
00:35:16 --> 00:35:19
Now that healer is helping the imperial troops

931
00:35:19 --> 00:35:22
Because of that, the Dashing King is frustrating

932
00:35:22 --> 00:35:26
If anyone catch him, the reward is very large

933
00:35:26 --> 00:35:28
Doctor Wu

934
00:35:28 --> 00:35:29
Lord Field Marshal

935
00:35:29 --> 00:35:31
It&#39;s late, you still working?

936
00:35:31 --> 00:35:34
A soldier&#39;s bone is broken

937
00:35:34 --> 00:35:36
I&#39;m going to see him

938
00:35:36 --> 00:35:38
Why haven&#39;t you go to sleep?

939
00:35:38 --> 00:35:40
It&#39;s boiling hot

940
00:35:40 --> 00:35:42
I come out to take some fresh air

941
00:35:42 --> 00:35:43
Doctor Wu

942
00:35:43 --> 00:35:44
According to my knowledge

943
00:35:44 --> 00:35:46
Orchid is a dangerous herb

944
00:35:46 --> 00:35:49
I saw that you&#39;ve been using a lot

945
00:35:49 --> 00:35:52
Can you tell me the reason?

946
00:35:52 --> 00:35:54
Orchid is dangerous, can kill a person

947
00:35:54 --> 00:35:57
But if you know how to use correctly

948
00:35:57 --> 00:35:59
It can save lives

949
00:35:59 --> 00:36:02
It is like taking a risk to keep living

950
00:36:02 --> 00:36:05
If you make mistake, what then?

951
00:36:05 --> 00:36:06
Lord Field Marshal

952
00:36:06 --> 00:36:08
There are many medicines in this world

953
00:36:08 --> 00:36:10
But there is nothing can cure regret

954
00:36:10 --> 00:36:11
Decisions need to be made if necessary

955
00:36:11 --> 00:36:13
If you miss the opportunity

956
00:36:13 --> 00:36:15
regret will be meaningless

957
00:36:15 --> 00:36:16
Well said

958
00:36:16 --> 00:36:18
Very well said!

959
00:36:18 --> 00:36:20
Using herbs is same as managing an army

960
00:36:20 --> 00:36:22
You can&#39;t not let the chance go

961
00:36:22 --> 00:36:23
In this chaos

962
00:36:23 --> 00:36:26
It&#39;s fortunate to meet someone like you

963
00:36:26 --> 00:36:29
I just know some knowledge of healing

964
00:36:29 --> 00:36:31
I can not compare myself to you

965
00:36:31 --> 00:36:34
You put your faith in me

966
00:36:34 --> 00:36:37
I really appreciate

967
00:36:37 --> 00:36:40
It&#39;s chaos time now

968
00:36:40 --> 00:36:41
I trust you

969
00:36:41 --> 00:36:46
But who will trust me?

970
00:36:46 --> 00:36:50
Who&#39;s that?

971
00:36:50 --> 00:36:51
Brother

972
00:36:51 --> 00:36:53
I can&#39;t go with you this time

973
00:36:53 --> 00:36:55
There are patients waiting for me

974
00:36:55 --> 00:36:56
You guys should go now

975
00:36:56 --> 00:36:58
In this situation

976
00:36:58 --> 00:37:00
You still think about that though

977
00:37:00 --> 00:37:02
No matter what situation is

978
00:37:02 --> 00:37:03
I have to come back

979
00:37:03 --> 00:37:04
to take care my patients

980
00:37:04 --> 00:37:05
Nonsense words

981
00:37:05 --> 00:37:06
Let&#39;s go

982
00:37:06 --> 00:37:10
Brother, please bring us with you

983
00:37:10 --> 00:37:11
Brothers

984
00:37:11 --> 00:37:13
I don&#39;t want to die here

985
00:37:13 --> 00:37:15
My lady, it&#39;s here

986
00:37:15 --> 00:37:18
My lady, this is the place your father sacrificed his life

987
00:37:18 --> 00:37:20
Bring me my stuff

988
00:37:20 --> 00:37:24
Release the doctor, I will spare your lives

989
00:37:24 --> 00:37:26
Go forward!

990
00:37:26 --> 00:37:27
Fire

991
00:37:27 --> 00:37:29
Please spare the doctor&#39;s life

992
00:37:29 --> 00:37:32
Take him back to the camp

993
00:37:32 --> 00:37:37
Father, your daughter comes to see you

994
00:37:37 --> 00:37:39
In few more days

995
00:37:39 --> 00:37:42
Chuanting will fight with Li Zicheng

996
00:37:42 --> 00:37:44
and avenge you

997
00:37:44 --> 00:37:45
If you are listening

998
00:37:45 --> 00:37:47
Please bless for him

999
00:37:47 --> 00:37:48
Who&#39;s that?

1000
00:37:48 --> 00:37:49
Go

1001
00:37:49 --> 00:37:50
Who?

1002
00:37:50 --> 00:37:52
Who are you?

1003
00:37:52 --> 00:37:54
He&#39;s infected

1004
00:37:54 --> 00:37:55
Don&#39;t kill me

1005
00:37:55 --> 00:37:57
My lady, don&#39;t come there

1006
00:37:57 --> 00:38:01
My lady, don&#39;t. My lady

1007
00:38:01 --> 00:38:04
Bring water

1008
00:38:04 --> 00:38:06
You are lord Field Marshal&#39;s soldier?

1009
00:38:06 --> 00:38:08
I&#39;m his footman

1010
00:38:08 --> 00:38:11
Take him

1011
00:38:11 --> 00:38:12
Stay away

1012
00:38:12 --> 00:38:15
Don&#39;t come here, or I&#39;ll kill her

1013
00:38:15 --> 00:38:17
I&#39;ll kill her

1014
00:38:17 --> 00:38:19
Don&#39;t come here

1015
00:38:19 --> 00:38:22
Don&#39;t come here, or I will kill her

1016
00:38:22 --> 00:38:23
Damn you

1017
00:38:23 --> 00:38:25
I only want to bring you back for treatment

1018
00:38:25 --> 00:38:26
Let her go

1019
00:38:26 --> 00:38:28
Brother, don&#39;t be afraid

1020
00:38:28 --> 00:38:30
Lord Field Marshal won&#39;t kill you

1021
00:38:30 --> 00:38:32
Take him

1022
00:38:32 --> 00:38:34
Move

1023
00:38:34 --> 00:38:36
Damn you!

1024
00:38:36 --> 00:38:38
My lord

1025
00:38:38 --> 00:38:40
My lord

1026
00:38:40 --> 00:38:42
Back to the camp

1027
00:38:42 --> 00:38:43
Lord Field Marshal&#39;s order

1028
00:38:43 --> 00:38:45
All the infected

1029
00:38:45 --> 00:38:46
Must stay in this camp

1030
00:38:46 --> 00:38:48
And can not go out

1031
00:38:48 --> 00:38:50
Get in

1032
00:38:50 --> 00:38:51
Let us out

1033
00:38:51 --> 00:38:52
You can&#39;t lock us here

1034
00:38:52 --> 00:38:53
I want to see my Field Marshal

1035
00:38:53 --> 00:38:57
Let us out

1036
00:38:57 --> 00:38:58
My lord is ready to dispatch

1037
00:38:58 --> 00:39:01
We prepared some alcohol to say good bye

1038
00:39:01 --> 00:39:06
We wish you win every battle, collect all the lost territories

1039
00:39:06 --> 00:39:07
Good

1040
00:39:07 --> 00:39:11
Let&#39;s drink for taking back all the lost land then

1041
00:39:11 --> 00:39:14
Cheers!

1042
00:39:14 --> 00:39:17
Collecting all the lost land

1043
00:39:17 --> 00:39:20
Collecting all the lost land

1044
00:39:20 --> 00:39:21
Tonight

1045
00:39:21 --> 00:39:23
I&#39;m gonna do it

1046
00:39:23 --> 00:39:26
Take back the stolen land from you first

1047
00:39:26 --> 00:39:27
Soldiers

1048
00:39:27 --> 00:39:29
Move

1049
00:39:29 --> 00:39:31
Freeze

1050
00:39:31 --> 00:39:36
All of you, freeze

1051
00:39:36 --> 00:39:38
I gave order to collect the farm land&#39;s ledger

1052
00:39:38 --> 00:39:42
But someone snuck in to the camp

1053
00:39:42 --> 00:39:44
Burned down the Libraby

1054
00:39:44 --> 00:39:46
Fuck it

1055
00:39:46 --> 00:39:47
Take him out

1056
00:39:47 --> 00:39:48
Mercy, my lord

1057
00:39:48 --> 00:39:51
Only with his one-side words

1058
00:39:51 --> 00:39:53
What do you want to do?

1059
00:39:53 --> 00:39:55
What can you do?

1060
00:39:55 --> 00:39:56
Well said

1061
00:39:56 --> 00:39:58
Murderers

1062
00:39:58 --> 00:40:00
Read it

1063
00:40:00 --> 00:40:04
According to the investigation, Tung Kua Ja

1064
00:40:04 --> 00:40:08
Usurped imperial farm land. Behead!

1065
00:40:08 --> 00:40:10
All the farm land, wealth are seized!

1066
00:40:10 --> 00:40:12
Bring the to National Treasury (FYI: the announcer keeps speaking all the richman&#39;s names. They&#39;re all beheaded)

1067
00:40:12 --> 00:40:13
You scumbag

1068
00:40:13 --> 00:40:15
Are all traitors

1069
00:40:15 --> 00:40:16
Seize their farmland

1070
00:40:16 --> 00:40:18
Bring all the wealth to National Treasury

1071
00:40:18 --> 00:40:20
My lord, mercy please

1072
00:40:20 --> 00:40:21
The country is in chaos

1073
00:40:21 --> 00:40:22
People rebel

1074
00:40:22 --> 00:40:24
Because they are starving

1075
00:40:24 --> 00:40:25
Starving men

1076
00:40:25 --> 00:40:28
Obviously will stand up

1077
00:40:28 --> 00:40:30
Man who has people&#39;s heart, owns the country

1078
00:40:30 --> 00:40:32
Do you have any idea what people&#39;s heart is?

1079
00:40:32 --> 00:40:35
People&#39;s heart, It is the food

1080
00:40:35 --> 00:40:38
That is the root

1081
00:40:38 --> 00:40:42
That&#39;s the reason why Li Zicheng can lose for 8 or 10 times but I can&#39;t lose even if once

1082
00:40:42 --> 00:40:46
And we are becoming weaker everyday

1083
00:40:46 --> 00:40:48
Drink this

1084
00:40:48 --> 00:40:51
You recover very fast, you can go out now

1085
00:40:51 --> 00:40:53
Doctor, wait

1086
00:40:53 --> 00:40:57
Doctor, I hear that the battle is coming soon

1087
00:40:57 --> 00:41:00
My mother is sick, I want go home to see her

1088
00:41:00 --> 00:41:02
I don&#39;t want to fight

1089
00:41:02 --> 00:41:03
My lord

1090
00:41:03 --> 00:41:05
I don&#39;t know about music

1091
00:41:05 --> 00:41:07
But the Guzheng&#39;s sound of my lady is wonderful

1092
00:41:07 --> 00:41:09
But I&#39;m worrying

1093
00:41:09 --> 00:41:11
I&#39;m sorry for bring down your mood

1094
00:41:11 --> 00:41:13
What are you worrying about?

1095
00:41:13 --> 00:41:14
You are about to dispatch

1096
00:41:14 --> 00:41:17
But there are still many ill soldiers

1097
00:41:17 --> 00:41:18
I&#39;m afraid that

1098
00:41:18 --> 00:41:20
When your army matches

1099
00:41:20 --> 00:41:23
The pathogen also moves

1100
00:41:23 --> 00:41:28
If we can&#39;t manage this, the consequence will be catastrophic

1101
00:41:28 --> 00:41:30
Doctor Youke really has a great mind

1102
00:41:30 --> 00:41:32
But today we will not talk about this

1103
00:41:32 --> 00:41:33
No business discussion

1104
00:41:33 --> 00:41:35
Let&#39;s drink!

1105
00:41:35 --> 00:41:37
This is your last chance to expiate

1106
00:41:37 --> 00:41:39
After loading timbers, lock all the gates

1107
00:41:39 --> 00:41:41
Use the fire as signal

1108
00:41:41 --> 00:41:42
Only the west gate can be opened

1109
00:41:42 --> 00:41:44
The signal will be there

1110
00:41:44 --> 00:41:47
General rides through the battle

1111
00:41:47 --> 00:41:53
Mercilessly slash the enemies

1112
00:41:53 --> 00:41:55
How&#39;s it?

1113
00:41:55 --> 00:41:57
You are having a murderous intent

1114
00:41:57 --> 00:41:59
It&#39;s really freaking me out

1115
00:41:59 --> 00:42:01
I have no choice

1116
00:42:01 --> 00:42:05
For the greater good, we must sacrifice

1117
00:42:05 --> 00:42:06
Doctor Youke

1118
00:42:06 --> 00:42:08
Let me ask you a question

1119
00:42:08 --> 00:42:13
Do you think the fate of Ming dynasty is ending?

1120
00:42:13 --> 00:42:15
The book &quot;Emperor&#39;s stories&quot; says:

1121
00:42:15 --> 00:42:17
Man doesn&#39;t cure his current disease, prepares to cure another one

1122
00:42:17 --> 00:42:20
Man doesn&#39;t fix the chaos now, prepares to have others in the future

1123
00:42:20 --> 00:42:24
All the dynasties rise and fall

1124
00:42:24 --> 00:42:25
The Tao inside

1125
00:42:25 --> 00:42:30
I believe it is the art to own this world

1126
00:42:30 --> 00:42:32
A Tao of ruling the world

1127
00:42:32 --> 00:42:34
A man has been sick for a too long

1128
00:42:34 --> 00:42:36
Even a powerful drug

1129
00:42:36 --> 00:42:38
Can&#39;t not help him

1130
00:42:38 --> 00:42:40
Ready

1131
00:42:40 --> 00:42:42
Let&#39;s go

1132
00:42:42 --> 00:42:45
We&#39;re on fire

1133
00:42:45 --> 00:42:47
Fire!

1134
00:42:47 --> 00:42:50
My brothers, they want to kill us

1135
00:42:50 --> 00:42:53
We must rush out

1136
00:42:53 --> 00:42:54
Go forward

1137
00:42:54 --> 00:42:55
Fire!

1138
00:42:55 --> 00:42:56
Doctor Wu

1139
00:42:56 --> 00:42:57
Doctor

1140
00:42:57 --> 00:42:59
They&#39;re dead

1141
00:42:59 --> 00:43:01
Traitor Li Thien Huu

1142
00:43:01 --> 00:43:02
intended to rebel

1143
00:43:02 --> 00:43:04
and colluded with others

1144
00:43:04 --> 00:43:05
can not be spared

1145
00:43:05 --> 00:43:08
His punishment is beheaded

1146
00:43:08 --> 00:43:10
We will dispatch tomorrow

1147
00:43:10 --> 00:43:12
Fortunately, I have your help

1148
00:43:12 --> 00:43:14
To stop the epidemic

1149
00:43:14 --> 00:43:20
Your method is much more effective than mine

1150
00:43:20 --> 00:43:22
Those infected soldiers, If I brought them

1151
00:43:22 --> 00:43:26
They not only couldn&#39;t fight, but also would infect my whole army

1152
00:43:26 --> 00:43:29
If I left them here, it would be very dangerous

1153
00:43:29 --> 00:43:33
The rebels are hanging around here to observe us

1154
00:43:33 --> 00:43:38
If I make a mistake, we will lose the war

1155
00:43:38 --> 00:43:40
I didn&#39;t want to do it

1156
00:43:40 --> 00:43:45
But it was for the greater good

1157
00:43:45 --> 00:43:50
Doctor, go with me

1158
00:43:50 --> 00:43:53
and work as my healing officer

1159
00:43:53 --> 00:43:55
I don&#39;t having military&#39;s understanding

1160
00:43:55 --> 00:43:58
I&#39;m afraid that I can not take this duty

1161
00:43:58 --> 00:44:01
The battle is coming, you can&#39;t back down

1162
00:44:01 --> 00:44:02
Go home and prepare your stuff

1163
00:44:02 --> 00:44:04
Tomorrow, you are going with me

1164
00:44:04 --> 00:44:08
We must find him

1165
00:44:08 --> 00:44:15
Being trusted by lord Field Marshal, I really appreciate

1166
00:44:15 --> 00:44:17
But I can&#39;t help you anymore

1167
00:44:17 --> 00:44:19
Sorry for leaving without saying goodbye

1168
00:44:19 --> 00:44:23
Win or lose, it&#39;s all designated by the fate

1169
00:44:23 --> 00:44:25
My lord, do we need to pursue him?

1170
00:44:25 --> 00:44:27
Don&#39;t

1171
00:44:27 --> 00:44:30
You are not afraid that he will follow the rebels?

1172
00:44:30 --> 00:44:33
He has his own path to follow

1173
00:44:33 --> 00:44:35
Send my order

1174
00:44:35 --> 00:44:37
Dispatch

1175
00:44:37 --> 00:44:43
We will stay at home and wait for your victorious return

1176
00:44:43 --> 00:44:45
Go

1177
00:44:45 --> 00:44:47
Finished?

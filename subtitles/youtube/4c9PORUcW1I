29
00:02:12 --> 00:02:13
yeah

30
00:02:13 --> 00:02:21
this thing in the corner next to the TV
that my parents said it&#39;s for playing

31
00:02:21 --> 00:02:25
and recording movies so this thing I
thought well perhaps it work with sounds

32
00:02:25 --> 00:02:30
like heaven VHS tapes were so widespread
they were so common so prevalent that I

33
00:02:30 --> 00:02:34
think for most people their just sort of
part of the everyday your background of

34
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
your life growing up or you know if
you&#39;re an adult during that time frame

35
00:02:36 --> 00:02:41
they just something you had it wasn&#39;t
until little you know maybe by 84 five

36
00:02:41 --> 00:02:44
where everybody and their mother had the
machine because we had just enough

37
00:02:44 --> 00:02:48
Christmases to get the machines and
everybody&#39;s home video cassette got me

38
00:02:48 --> 00:02:54
hooked on movies you know I love going
to movies as a kid but the VHS tapes and

39
00:02:54 --> 00:02:57
bringing those movies hold I can watch
him anytime I wanted

40
00:02:57 --> 00:03:01
getting us all together to go to the
theater was a big deal and it didn&#39;t

41
00:03:01 --> 00:03:05
happen very often maybe everybody in the
car we&#39;d get their pay good popcorn all

42
00:03:05 --> 00:03:08
that so home video was this is the
standard for me they opened in our

43
00:03:08 --> 00:03:14
neighborhood is a video store and it was
called popping go and my mom is from

44
00:03:14 --> 00:03:19
Mexico and she would call it the people
he didn&#39;t know that you always say all

45
00:03:19 --> 00:03:24
the beautiful single the poppers so good
but i remember going and the giant like

46
00:03:24 --> 00:03:28
cardboard cutouts like movies coming
soon and that&#39;s the first time I saw the

47
00:03:28 --> 00:03:31
toxic avenger like in the giant cut out
and I was a little kid and I was like

48
00:03:31 --> 00:03:31
I&#39;m gonna watch this

49
00:03:31 --> 00:03:35
that&#39;s that was huge it was like the
friday night thing to do and it was you

50
00:03:35 --> 00:03:37
know when you really kind of took your
time thinking because you did its twenty

51
00:03:37 --> 00:03:40
nine dollars to join you know it wasn&#39;t
free to join

52
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
so it&#39;s been my Saturday&#39;s get on my
little bicycle my ninja turtles bicycle

53
00:03:43 --> 00:03:47
and go from one store to the next like
looking for this title whatever it might

54
00:03:47 --> 00:03:53
be and I remember specifically i really
wanted to see basket case and none of

55
00:03:53 --> 00:03:56
the video stores had it and so for like
months I would go to everyone back to

56
00:03:56 --> 00:04:00
you guys get basket case yet i want to
see basket case i saw Apocalypse Now was

57
00:04:00 --> 00:04:00
out

58
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
I want all I need that and then I saw
blood feast was out and I went oh my god

59
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
i need that and I so beyond the valley
of the dolls out oh my god i need that

60
00:04:06 --> 00:04:10
so i bought my first Betamax you know
with the top loader with the big piano

61
00:04:10 --> 00:04:14
keys and the remote was attached to a
wire you know there really wasn&#39;t a

62
00:04:14 --> 00:04:23
remote and then that&#39;ll be over the
video dinner next Saturday Review and

63
00:04:23 --> 00:04:32
there is any quantity of a kind of them
cream or a condom but i&#39;m not really

64
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
dating

65
00:04:34 --> 00:04:42
video to cinema out of the movie theater
so you know it takes a lot of money to

66
00:04:42 --> 00:04:45
build a movie theater takes a lot of
seats these areas put the seats and you

67
00:04:45 --> 00:04:48
have to get all the people who sit in
the seats to make it you know profitable

68
00:04:48 --> 00:04:52
and so I think if you if you say
worldwide

69
00:04:52 --> 00:04:57
yeah i think it was looking like a
democratization it was a form of wider

70
00:04:57 --> 00:05:00
exposure which friday night you&#39;re with
your friends your having a sleepover

71
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02
you&#39;re at the video store you want to
make each other laugh by finding the

72
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
dumbest thing possible i think i was a
huge part of it really like sitting

73
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
around your friends laughing eating
pizza

74
00:05:08 --> 00:05:12
what is better than that it was a very
special time where you could all of a

75
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
sudden be introduced to all of this this
stuff that never never would have been

76
00:05:16 --> 00:05:21
available never would&#39;ve shown on TV
never would have been in your movie

77
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
theater center in a place like
nottingham where I was from which is

78
00:05:24 --> 00:05:28
kind of a small city and in England I
grew up on forty-second Street so I had

79
00:05:28 --> 00:05:32
access to movies the average person
normally wouldn&#39;t have unless I guess

80
00:05:32 --> 00:05:35
you were living next door to a drive-in
or something you know so i love the fact

81
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
that I was seeing crap that no one even
heard of it

82
00:05:37 --> 00:05:42
what surprised me was how much of that
crap came out on VHS

83
00:05:42 --> 00:05:50
I&#39;m very proud to say that i have 82
movies that start with dead death and

84
00:05:50 --> 00:06:02
deadly 82 so I&#39;ve really made it i&#39;m
really a great success in life above you

85
00:06:02 --> 00:06:08
can see that i have my big boxes my
oversized clamshells things like that i

86
00:06:08 --> 00:06:15
have things alphabetical to keep things
simple the way I&#39;ve done it is color

87
00:06:15 --> 00:06:18
because to me it looks the most
aesthetically pleasing

88
00:06:18 --> 00:06:22
I just tired did it in like a Roy Roy g
biv kind of way and just come all the

89
00:06:22 --> 00:06:27
way down to black-and-white and I also
do it looks that way and for me it&#39;s a

90
00:06:27 --> 00:06:31
system that totally works you can ask me
any video and I can be like okay that

91
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
was Green and pick it out and it&#39;s
really easy for me and I think it looks

92
00:06:34 --> 00:06:37
really nice

93
00:06:37 --> 00:06:45
this is one of my all-time favorites so
corey haim me myself and I so good i

94
00:06:45 --> 00:06:49
know Corey past you know and I love corn
I&#39;m not really making fun of them but

95
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
this is the awesomest thing ever the
direction of my life right now that i&#39;m

96
00:06:51 --> 00:06:57
trying to I guess proceed with the
business is gradually from being the

97
00:06:57 --> 00:07:01
little boy from the from the younger you
know brother trying to get to be the

98
00:07:01 --> 00:07:08
older brother or the only brother I
don&#39;t know if this is the pride of my

99
00:07:08 --> 00:07:12
collection but this is the tape I&#39;ve got
the most fun i&#39;ve recently it&#39;s called

100
00:07:12 --> 00:07:19
bubble until it hurts it it&#39;s for men
and women it&#39;s not just another pretty

101
00:07:19 --> 00:07:22
workout

102
00:07:22 --> 00:07:28
6 i&#39;m like many exercise programs but
until it hurts utilize the minimum of

103
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
jumping the lack of jumping up and down
makes this program ideal for apartment

104
00:07:31 --> 00:07:34
house tellers just like why would you
put that on your VHS like why would that

105
00:07:34 --> 00:07:38
ever be a marketing point and at the end

leslie nielsen bad golf made easier

116

signed by leslie nielsen i don&#39;t know if
you can get in on the the gold signature

117
00:08:22 --> 00:08:26
of the man himself stand directly in
your opponent&#39;s line and lean

118
00:08:26 --> 00:08:30
imperceptibly to one side or another as
he tries to read the break

119
00:08:30 --> 00:08:33
and this is what we called death writer

120
00:08:33 --> 00:08:38
this is a shot on video western and it
is really one of the most impossibly

121
00:08:38 --> 00:08:47
hypnotically awkward things that you
will ever see I thought your day like no

122
00:08:47 --> 00:08:51
that&#39;s my brother you&#39;re talking about
and it&#39;s kind of a passion project by

123
00:08:51 --> 00:08:56
this guy Ronald kuntz who was the lead
actor writer director editor cameraman

124
00:08:56 --> 00:09:01
and he prouds to the film probably my
favorite proud sir is Ronald kids now

125
00:09:01 --> 00:09:07
I&#39;m getting into all the ones that I
gasp about the windows 95 easy

126
00:09:07 --> 00:09:11
instruction video guide featuring
Matthew Perry and jennifer aniston in

127
00:09:11 --> 00:09:16
character because this was right when
friends started so it&#39;s all this like oh

128
00:09:16 --> 00:09:19
really you click on the Start window
that is pathetic

129
00:09:19 --> 00:09:41
when I first started I was like all man
do to have 80 movies

130
00:09:41 --> 00:09:44
it was just like phenomenal to me that I
could like pick through 18 movies but

131
00:09:44 --> 00:09:50
then I got to 500 and pretty soon I got
to a thousand zombies the cold

132
00:09:50 --> 00:09:55
supernatural slasher movies i got a
slasher closet over there if there&#39;s at

133
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
least three movies that i can categorize
together i&#39;m like--okay that can be a

134
00:09:58 --> 00:10:03
sub-genre so I have one right now it&#39;s
got four movies and it&#39;s about homeless

135
00:10:03 --> 00:10:07
or get a job loser you shoot your
fucking pants so that&#39;s a little

136
00:10:07 --> 00:10:12
sub-genre of I&#39;ve learned a lot about
culture in general just by doing all

137
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
these little subsections a lot of things
you have to search out a lot of things

138
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
you have to look forward not even know
what you&#39;re looking for and you might

139
00:10:17 --> 00:10:20
find something that you never knew was
out there

140
00:10:20 --> 00:10:28
the video revolution began in japan and
in mid seventies early to mid seventies

141
00:10:28 --> 00:10:34
when the engineers at sony began to
develop a tape format and at the same

142
00:10:34 --> 00:10:39
time the engineers at JCC they developed
their own back then you know everything

143
00:10:39 --> 00:10:43
was Betamax VHS and so you went to a
store there was always both formats

144
00:10:43 --> 00:10:48
ridiculously they used to charge three
dollars more for a VHS tape because you

145
00:10:48 --> 00:10:52
will find more plastic really nothing
happened in any numbers until 79 when it

146
00:10:52 --> 00:10:58
began to explode in both formats were
originally headed head fighting for

147
00:10:58 --> 00:11:03
supremacy and it was sort of thought
that maybe both together not to be the

148
00:11:03 --> 00:11:03
case

149
00:11:03 --> 00:11:10
I of course bought theta so you know
wasted all these millions of videos that

150
00:11:10 --> 00:11:11
i bought on in

151
00:11:11 --> 00:11:17
nevaeh format and of course they didn&#39;t
went bye-bye very soon after if you&#39;re

152
00:11:17 --> 00:11:20
looking at video cassette recorders and
different things by all your choices

153
00:11:20 --> 00:11:23
just look at the most important feature
of all

154
00:11:23 --> 00:11:29
the picture and Sony Betamax record a
sharper picture than VHS beta was

155
00:11:29 --> 00:11:35
technically superior but it had one huge
flaw which was it was only one VHS

156
00:11:35 --> 00:11:38
format was to our flop VHS
videocassettes play longer which can

157
00:11:38 --> 00:11:43
save you money begged a lil one of my
closest friends is robert harris

158
00:11:43 --> 00:11:48
restorations and he was always talking
about the latest technologies he was

159
00:11:48 --> 00:11:54
keeping me alerted about the war between
bethe and VHS and how the cheaper one

160
00:11:54 --> 00:12:00
who&#39;s going to win because public just
doesn&#39;t give a shit he was correct when

161
00:12:00 --> 00:12:04
I rented the last unicorn on theta and
stuck it in my grandmother&#39;s VHS player

162
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
that was not good

163
00:12:06 --> 00:12:10
that&#39;s when I understood the difference
between VHS and data and no i didn&#39;t

164
00:12:10 --> 00:12:13
like because i think it&#39;s much less
important that they for any TV show like

165
00:12:13 --> 00:12:17
you know any whatever any new show
that&#39;s out right now of course their

166
00:12:17 --> 00:12:20
goal is well this is going to be on DVD
it&#39;s gonna be blue it&#39;s going to watch

167
00:12:20 --> 00:12:20
forever and ever

168
00:12:20 --> 00:12:26
but back then they didn&#39;t really realize
that something good though and i started

169
00:12:26 --> 00:12:31
going to sleep instead of time taken
from me

170
00:12:31 --> 00:12:37
because I&#39;m operating controversial
issues have never to grow horizontal

171
00:12:37 --> 00:12:42
refreshment and you mr. football on TV
you mom

172
00:12:42 --> 00:12:48
you are a good boy when you have a
Phillips television recorder you don&#39;t

173
00:12:48 --> 00:12:49
have to miss anything

174
00:12:49 --> 00:12:56
the flips television recorder records TV
when you can watch so you can replay

175
00:12:56 --> 00:13:02
the Phillips television recorder mom&#39;s I
don&#39;t think any member of the audio

176
00:13:02 --> 00:13:07
techniques that gee I need a machine
that will help me control my schedule

177
00:13:07 --> 00:13:11
but once the machine was made and then
they came up with the concept of time

178
00:13:11 --> 00:13:15
shifting and that was the concept that
really worked that you can actually

179
00:13:15 --> 00:13:21
shift the TV schedule around they made
it so simple to use the cat could

180
00:13:21 --> 00:13:25
operate it cost I want you to record and
I TV program at ten

181
00:13:25 --> 00:13:31
76 so simple can using the t-mo age only
exists because we were raised with the

182
00:13:31 --> 00:13:35
agents because we were the first
generation that could be sent to bed

183
00:13:35 --> 00:13:39
with the promise it&#39;ll be here tomorrow
when you get up that changed our

184
00:13:39 --> 00:13:45
relationship with television i
discovered that i could program the VCR

185
00:13:45 --> 00:13:51
that was like a big day in a few enough
for me like as a nine-year-old to to get

186
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
around the parental controls and tape
r-rated things you can watch your TV

187
00:13:55 --> 00:13:59
shows when you want to watch it that&#39;s
the advertising campaign that really

188
00:13:59 --> 00:14:04
pushed Betamax to the top of the E and
was a big success for two years until

189
00:14:04 --> 00:14:09
the HS caught up with them with an even
better reason to buy it because they

190
00:14:09 --> 00:14:20
could record longer three hours special
one VHS is that too actually went out in

191
00:14:20 --> 00:14:24
the format war with Sony at a certain
moment in time people were like I don&#39;t

192
00:14:24 --> 00:14:29
like that you can share this thing with
people i want to control the the

193
00:14:29 --> 00:14:30
mechanism of distribution

194
00:14:30 --> 00:14:34
you know only programmed on television
right you know only available in movie

195
00:14:34 --> 00:14:38
theaters you know so when the VHS tape
comes out for a ton of the people

196
00:14:38 --> 00:14:42
involved on the you know manufacturing
side is a watershed but there&#39;s people

197
00:14:42 --> 00:14:46
in content distribution before everyone
has decks and they can monetize it where

198
00:14:46 --> 00:14:47
like I don&#39;t know if this is a good
thing or not

199
00:14:47 --> 00:14:51
so this whole notion of selling
something where you lost control and

200
00:14:51 --> 00:14:56
Charlie was a new notion of a major
movie studios very very nervous

201
00:14:56 --> 00:15:01
box-office kept increasing so it&#39;s not
like people are staying home and

202
00:15:01 --> 00:15:05
avoiding the movie theater it&#39;s a new
bunch of people are putting new money

203
00:15:05 --> 00:15:11
into home video and that&#39;s what&#39;s really
driving this incredible explosion of the

204
00:15:11 --> 00:15:16
film industry in the 1980&#39;s the guy who
financed brain-damaged me was a man

205
00:15:16 --> 00:15:20
named Andre play and he&#39;s credited with
starting this he had a company in

206
00:15:20 --> 00:15:23
Michigan called magnetic video that was
dealing with mainly three-quarter-inch

207
00:15:23 --> 00:15:28
tapes for industrial use and he got the
idea one day wow i wonder if i could put

208
00:15:28 --> 00:15:32
hollywood movies on half-inch when I
made the decision to buy movie right i

209
00:15:32 --> 00:15:37
said well i gotta go to all the
Hollywood studio and I wrote them of a

210
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
letter saying that the home video
revolution is about to begin and take

211
00:15:41 --> 00:15:45
that helped that the new industry to
write a letter to all the major studios

212
00:15:45 --> 00:15:46
about you know

213
00:15:46 --> 00:15:50
come on give me a film i&#39;ll put it on
tape will see what happened and no

214
00:15:50 --> 00:15:53
studio was interested it was a crazy
idea it was stupid idea they thought

215
00:15:53 --> 00:15:57
they would do the value of the film&#39;s
bubble butt but Fox said yeah fine let

216
00:15:57 --> 00:16:01
this guy do it he fails he fails you
know who cares we will get some money

217
00:16:01 --> 00:16:01
out of it

218
00:16:01 --> 00:16:05
this is pre star wars of the 20th
century fox was probably a company that

219
00:16:05 --> 00:16:10
not doing that well in any case they had
to bet a haven films ever at least four

220
00:16:10 --> 00:16:10
years old

221
00:16:10 --> 00:16:14
sound of music and you know patent and
all that stuff and they sold for an

222
00:16:14 --> 00:16:16
absorbent rate they were like 8999
dollars

223
00:16:16 --> 00:16:24
only world we recognize was getting
their films in theaters Charlie man was

224
00:16:24 --> 00:16:27
the only one in our circle that was
thinking about home video market is what

225
00:16:27 --> 00:16:32
i did was i thought well let me go find
or licensed the rights to other

226
00:16:32 --> 00:16:36
successful independent films even my
lawyer had no real idea of how to write

227
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
the document because no documents have
been written prior to license these

228
00:16:39 --> 00:16:42
video rights you know what is the
territory what is the prize no idea it

229
00:16:42 --> 00:16:46
was a pioneering time because nothing
existed next step let&#39;s not tell the

230
00:16:46 --> 00:16:47
pre-recorded tapes

231
00:16:47 --> 00:16:50
let&#39;s actually rented to them and Ray
never anticipated the rental market and

232
00:16:50 --> 00:16:52
he said he remembers the day he got a
phone call from a store saying hey can I

233
00:16:52 --> 00:16:58
rent this and he went no-good dispose of
what my lawyer said I can I was like

234
00:16:58 --> 00:17:04
I&#39;ll know you know so that started it
and up the punchline to Andre story was

235
00:17:04 --> 00:17:08
eventually all the studios or a
lucrative market was they all came out

236
00:17:08 --> 00:17:11
with your own you know label except for
Fox of course

237
00:17:11 --> 00:17:18
so Fox had to buy Andre out they had
about so he you know whatever he boarded

238
00:17:18 --> 00:17:20
for boy he quadruple that ok

239
00:17:20 --> 00:17:24
the video at that point was kind of
taking over for the drive-in circuit

240
00:17:24 --> 00:17:28
video was the new market for the kids to
rip the horror films of the films that

241
00:17:28 --> 00:17:30
they wouldn&#39;t see at the mainstream
theater

242
00:17:30 --> 00:17:34
well I definitely don&#39;t think that my
career would have gone where it had

243
00:17:34 --> 00:17:38
without video my movie was released in
all kinds of foreign countries on video

244
00:17:38 --> 00:17:43
but was a video for me I know my
popularity would be much much smaller

245
00:17:43 --> 00:17:43
than it

246
00:17:43 --> 00:17:48
it&#39;s now when videocassettes first came
in we we jumped in we loved it we

247
00:17:48 --> 00:17:48
thought it was great

248
00:17:48 --> 00:17:52
and in fact it was great and there were
mom-and-pop shops there were video

249
00:17:52 --> 00:17:57
stores opening up all over the country
all over the world that needed movies in

250
00:17:57 --> 00:18:04
the early days the appetite for video
was so pervasive people could pick the

251
00:18:04 --> 00:18:09
wrong location they could pick the wrong
video cassette titles they could hire

252
00:18:09 --> 00:18:14
surly staff they could have terrible
hours and horrible policies and people

253
00:18:14 --> 00:18:18
were still gravitating to these stores
it was just there was such a hunger for

254
00:18:18 --> 00:18:20
an economy car tonight

255
00:18:20 --> 00:18:26
wilson is look it up there oh no we&#39;re
not there it could take a while you know

256
00:18:26 --> 00:18:32
met on in that brain injury time I don&#39;t
look it&#39;s kind of a very now come

257
00:18:32 --> 00:18:36
together we can i use so the Coptics up
there just about money to get there he

258
00:18:36 --> 00:18:42
made the move with somebody go mean
they&#39;re did so not America into knowing

259
00:18:42 --> 00:18:48
i know oniy india not receive a stair
size of the man that was hired again

260
00:18:48 --> 00:18:51
divided into going on the you

261
00:18:51 --> 00:18:56
on google docs on ok nan doc whatever
you want any coordinate will cut the

262
00:18:56 --> 00:19:01
cable doesn&#39;t want so the idea of having
movies that were at your disposal and

263
00:19:01 --> 00:19:05
when you wanted them was kind of
remarkable and there was no talk of

264
00:19:05 --> 00:19:08
picture quality or aspect ratio or any
of that was just availability so you

265
00:19:08 --> 00:19:11
have to kind of be aware that as much as
you want to use that frame right to the

266
00:19:11 --> 00:19:15
edge you wouldn&#39;t you kinda give
yourself a little cheat on either side

267
00:19:15 --> 00:19:19
could you knew that when it went to
video the edges would be cut off i

268
00:19:19 --> 00:19:25
looked at a few of them I was appalled
at the improper aspect ratios and the

269
00:19:25 --> 00:19:32
lack of rich contrast and resolution and
never did buy one and predicted they

270
00:19:32 --> 00:19:36
wouldn&#39;t catch on original aspect ratio
never called out because people thought

271
00:19:36 --> 00:19:41
they were being jipped i&#39;m not i got
black bars on the top and bottom of my

272
00:19:41 --> 00:19:41
picture

273
00:19:41 --> 00:19:46
yeah that&#39;s how you see the sides then
that never sunken now I know people that

274
00:19:46 --> 00:19:51
have the wide screen TVs so they watch
casablanca they zoom in on it to fill up

275
00:19:51 --> 00:19:57
the picture i sometimes it looks better
than the widescreen you get the VHS of

276
00:19:57 --> 00:20:03
pet gear and Billy the Kid it&#39;s horribly
panic and like a zoom in and times but

277
00:20:03 --> 00:20:06
it&#39;s got this interesting aesthetic to
it which I like and actually prefer that

278
00:20:06 --> 00:20:09
you can&#39;t make that camera movement with
a camera like it&#39;s only exist in like

279
00:20:09 --> 00:20:12
what however they used to make the pain
of skin so many saw stuff like that you

280
00:20:12 --> 00:20:15
thought like that was a weird camera
movement and I enjoy painting scan

281
00:20:15 --> 00:20:19
doesn&#39;t bother me i don&#39;t like it when
it&#39;s completely cropped like where they

282
00:20:19 --> 00:20:22
just cut it like off where they just
don&#39;t give a shit they just cut the left

283
00:20:22 --> 00:20:25
and right off and then this except
missing when i smoosh it i don&#39;t like

284
00:20:25 --> 00:20:27
that but i like that weird

285
00:20:27 --> 00:20:29
there were the weird ones who are most
back-and-forth anything that&#39;s pretty

286
00:20:29 --> 00:20:29
good

287
00:20:29 --> 00:20:37
Patrick closer and closer the war black
this unbelievable this is what it&#39;s all

288
00:20:37 --> 00:20:40
about this will make me famous

289
00:20:40 --> 00:20:44
we got to talk about the HS movement and
I&#39;ve been lucky i&#39;ve been entered all

290
00:20:44 --> 00:20:47
the innovations I&#39;ve been here at all
the changes we went from a qualitative

291
00:20:47 --> 00:20:53
media to a quantitative media the video
concept made it easier but didn&#39;t make

292
00:20:53 --> 00:20:53
it better

293
00:20:53 --> 00:20:59
I don&#39;t know to manage and a tampon in
the world final order to beat oh no no

294
00:20:59 --> 00:21:08
no no a personal video showing from amar
Kumar good out there today but Walter

295
00:21:08 --> 00:21:15
Scott an orphan you didn&#39;t I know she&#39;s
all that on the schedule more hydrogen

296
00:21:15 --> 00:21:20
and I hope they&#39;re home oh we don&#39;t know
what two very different better than

297
00:21:20 --> 00:21:25
you&#39;re giving me Jenny I&#39;m
communitychannel day independent or more

298
00:21:25 --> 00:21:29
and more like to review it was the very
tail end of the theatrical distribution

299
00:21:29 --> 00:21:35
and it was more of a video stores which
is popping up all over so he had a lot

300
00:21:35 --> 00:21:41
of independent adult bookstores and
business was thriving the video boom

301
00:21:41 --> 00:21:46
came out of the facility to watch this
material at home and no longer have to

302
00:21:46 --> 00:21:51
be ashamed theoretically to go to the
theater and I&#39;m you that once this door

303
00:21:51 --> 00:21:53
was open it would never be closed

304
00:21:53 --> 00:21:55
why don&#39;t you

305
00:21:55 --> 00:22:02
no I got a better one of you come over
here party

306
00:22:02 --> 00:22:05
yeah

307
00:22:05 --> 00:22:15
730 classroom their advantage and cut
the gaga over to cutting up . or

308
00:22:15 --> 00:22:21
existing account sooo lot but i don&#39;t
know whether to be their story we take

309
00:22:21 --> 00:22:29
on any major consumer electronics medium
its success or failure the market will

310
00:22:29 --> 00:22:31
be determined based on its relationship
with the adult entertainment business

311
00:22:31 --> 00:22:37
and I think the Justice where we learned
that day that we just get an iphone so

312
00:22:37 --> 00:22:44
today we just want a hole on iphone no
posts on arrow do you skate on it once

313
00:22:44 --> 00:22:50
kept their thumbs so starting with your
bond with their tony award-nominated

314
00:22:50 --> 00:22:57
everyone&#39;s got our boy do I like the way
film looks but i think that video

315
00:22:57 --> 00:23:01
probably makes the end consumer feel
like he&#39;s a part of the experience

316
00:23:01 --> 00:23:06
company will be there with the proper
other or forget the day we go ahead and

317
00:23:06 --> 00:23:11
it&#39;s great deal about you not want to
know nothing and I don&#39;t know

318
00:23:11 --> 00:23:15
look at tickets and second or McLucas
the request a 10

319
00:23:15 --> 00:23:20
honey what you think of more than 260
are going

320
00:23:20 --> 00:23:26
for a pic boat load of a desolate moment
for possession of your opinions and like

321
00:23:26 --> 00:23:32
their what video did change about the
porn industry was the idea that since

322
00:23:32 --> 00:23:36
we&#39;re distributing on video we can shoot
on video change the economics of that

323
00:23:36 --> 00:23:39
business and the business so much bigger
than it ever been before

324
00:23:39 --> 00:23:45
what if we took these big boxes you know
with thick in their trays and made them

325
00:23:45 --> 00:23:51
smaller and maybe even we could attempt
to sell them in alternative markets like

326
00:23:51 --> 00:23:55
airports or bookstores and they were
selling like hotcakes and the business

327
00:23:55 --> 00:24:02
took off and that&#39;s how we created the
sell-through title media had this crazy

328
00:24:02 --> 00:24:08
idea of releasing tapes at the then
shocking price of 1995 they were calling

329
00:24:08 --> 00:24:11
itself through every other company was
going out to stupid idea

330
00:24:11 --> 00:24:13
it&#39;s ridiculous you know because they
thought the more money because the more

331
00:24:13 --> 00:24:16
money you make but I thought gee I wish
they&#39;d sell basket case for that because

332
00:24:16 --> 00:24:21
it would be the only film like that and
just reputable unrated blood and gore

333
00:24:21 --> 00:24:27
film out on the market and teenagers
which with my core audience they could

334
00:24:27 --> 00:24:31
afford 4995 but they get all 4 20 box
media thought it was a terrible idea

335
00:24:31 --> 00:24:35
they thought of such a bad idea they
said look we&#39;ll do it but if it doesn&#39;t

336
00:24:35 --> 00:24:38
move we&#39;re going to go right back to the
regular price

337
00:24:38 --> 00:24:44
a time Halloween came around my god that
your best case was everywhere we made a

338
00:24:44 --> 00:24:45
fortune

339
00:24:45 --> 00:24:49
it did spectacular i mean i bought this
apartment this is my down payment that I

340
00:24:49 --> 00:24:51
needed from the bank to buy this
apartment

341
00:24:51 --> 00:24:54
suddenly the sell-through market was
born I&#39;d like to think best because have

342
00:24:54 --> 00:25:00
a lot to do with it

343
00:25:00 --> 00:25:05
it was great for independence because
the major studios really caught on very

344
00:25:05 --> 00:25:11
slowly to video and there are so many
examples of independent films that were

345
00:25:11 --> 00:25:15
brand-new to that audience that were
more desirable than the big studio film

346
00:25:15 --> 00:25:19
so many times you know those little
pictures would outperform just in terms

347
00:25:19 --> 00:25:23
of video you know not theatrical on TV
and other deals that were happening but

348
00:25:23 --> 00:25:27
when it came to the video market in
those early days it was incredible

349
00:25:27 --> 00:25:31
it&#39;s the return of called hero Freddy
Krueger and for the past two summers

350
00:25:31 --> 00:25:35
Freddy&#39;s nightmares have been the
nation&#39;s top video rental titles now

351
00:25:35 --> 00:25:39
it&#39;s Freddie&#39;s third time around and
he&#39;s all set to claw his way beyond the

352
00:25:39 --> 00:25:42
200,000 mark with the advent of home
video and also made companies very

353
00:25:42 --> 00:25:46
successful very small companies very
successful I think that&#39;s largely why we

354
00:25:46 --> 00:25:50
have so many insane VHS oddities now is
because it would be a huge hollywood

355
00:25:50 --> 00:25:54
movie that would hit like Indiana Jones
or friday the thirteenth and you would

356
00:25:54 --> 00:25:58
get a whole plethora of films that were
taping that made for twelve cents

357
00:25:58 --> 00:26:01
production price tag no Terminator 80
million puppetmaster four hundred

358
00:26:01 --> 00:26:03
thousand dollars it&#39;s like you know it&#39;s
not an even playing field but on the

359
00:26:03 --> 00:26:08
video store they&#39;re all the same shelf
there on the same size boxes look if

360
00:26:08 --> 00:26:11
it&#39;s like trauma can make a movie that
sells millions of millions of dollars of

361
00:26:11 --> 00:26:14
video cassettes well then anybody can do
it

362
00:26:14 --> 00:26:20
distribution was handled very
differently there are a lot more

363
00:26:20 --> 00:26:23
distributors there were people that were
willing to experiment known video it was

364
00:26:23 --> 00:26:27
so new that it felt like the Wild West
only anybody can get a foothold and be a

365
00:26:27 --> 00:26:32
major player in HS distribution and i
was approached by a couple of the

366
00:26:32 --> 00:26:39
producers who wanted to produce a video
which would go straight to home video

367
00:26:39 --> 00:26:40
and this was something new

368
00:26:40 --> 00:26:45
my idea was I&#39;ll create an electronic
aquarium people found this intriguing

369
00:26:45 --> 00:26:49
that here was this new thing that use
this new medium that have been created

370
00:26:49 --> 00:26:54
what really i think caused the extremely
explosion and video was Jane Fonda&#39;s

371
00:26:54 --> 00:27:06
workout so this was a tape that did
something original which was give you an

372
00:27:06 --> 00:27:09
opportunity to exercise in your home in
front of your TV by yourself don&#39;t need

373
00:27:09 --> 00:27:13
to go to a gym it was very good concept
and it never really been done before

374
00:27:13 --> 00:27:16
well the early days of video it was a
seller&#39;s market is great i mean they

375
00:27:16 --> 00:27:18
couldn&#39;t get enough of this was a
worldwide exposure and there was a

376
00:27:18 --> 00:27:22
window where you know if you made a
clever movie and it was relatively well

377
00:27:22 --> 00:27:25
done and it wasn&#39;t the right john r you
know it was action film or horror sci-fi

378
00:27:25 --> 00:27:29
you would make some money so the
stairway which is one of the traditional

379
00:27:29 --> 00:27:34
major studios in Japan that&#39;s have
launched this straight to video market

380
00:27:34 --> 00:27:39
whereas in the u.s. largely video for a
very long time sort of demonized by the

381
00:27:39 --> 00:27:41
traditional studios

382
00:27:41 --> 00:27:47
movado so motivated enough to make wats
car suitable no DNA more the muscle the

383
00:27:47 --> 00:27:53
muscle atrophy excellent is and you&#39;ll
get there so she will take a night got

384
00:27:53 --> 00:27:59

video we all know seeing you and i&#39;ll be

386
00:28:06 --> 00:28:09
doing an open crown talk to you type

387
00:28:09 --> 00:28:12

manikonda I didn&#39;t know you could be
created the dead don&#39;t cool you wanna

389
00:28:20 --> 00:28:25
see naughty asian american 1080 your
stare was on the attack suddenly I was

390
00:28:25 --> 00:28:40
gonna do you concur muy hat I don&#39;t go
there on the pleasure she wanted machine

391
00:28:40 --> 00:28:44
I you know started all also available
today haha

392
00:28:44 --> 00:28:49
oksana go there I know you and doesn&#39;t
get you started with understand that the

393
00:28:49 --> 00:28:53
strong video they were very aggressive
you had a movie he went someplace like a

394
00:28:53 --> 00:28:58
family american film market or calm and
the video drives for your movie was not

395
00:28:58 --> 00:29:02
yet locked up almost immediately used
visited by a salesperson for vest on

396
00:29:02 --> 00:29:06
saying here here&#39;s a million dollars
right upfront give me the movie in the

397
00:29:06 --> 00:29:10
initial stages he would go into a store
and find something that you want you

398
00:29:10 --> 00:29:14
wouldn&#39;t see a commercial you wouldn&#39;t
read anything that magazine or newspaper

399
00:29:14 --> 00:29:19
I mean it was just that new Holy stores
were open up and they needed to fill the

400
00:29:19 --> 00:29:24
shelves with new titles so there was
this huge demand didn&#39;t matter if they

401
00:29:24 --> 00:29:25
were good or bad

402
00:29:25 --> 00:29:30
you have a pretty flourishing industry
that&#39;s based on renting videotapes

403
00:29:30 --> 00:29:35
30 the 35 thousand video rental stores
across the country most often

404
00:29:35 --> 00:29:42
mom-and-pop operation Charlie would have
title contest for his employees and if

405
00:29:42 --> 00:29:45
you came up with the title that he used
could get 500 knowledge so everybody

406
00:29:45 --> 00:29:49
would come up with ten or fifteen miles
and he would narrow it down to like huh

407
00:29:49 --> 00:29:53
Ingrid then he would Commission box are
and then Austin first would come in from

408
00:29:53 --> 00:29:57
best run you just come into the room and
go around and say I&#39;ll take that one and

409
00:29:57 --> 00:30:03
that one and then Charlie would bring
the writers and directors and say want

410
00:30:03 --> 00:30:06
you to do this

411
00:30:06 --> 00:30:09
yeah

412
00:30:09 --> 00:30:12
yeah

413
00:30:12 --> 00:30:19
that was an era of great equivalency of
video stores i think people would write

414
00:30:19 --> 00:30:23
anything going to cover that interested
and it wasn&#39;t about studio wasn&#39;t about

415
00:30:23 --> 00:30:28
movie star wasn&#39;t about budget when
you&#39;re looking at a shelf very

416
00:30:28 --> 00:30:32
democratic the best cover get your drive
one thing i do is go to video stores

417
00:30:32 --> 00:30:35
whenever I&#39;m in them and I find the
movie and I took it out and put it you

418
00:30:35 --> 00:30:40
know flat so it&#39;s facing front like
strategize and can&#39;t hurt that i really

419
00:30:40 --> 00:30:44
do like looking around seeing that we
would a lot of them i pick just on the

420
00:30:44 --> 00:30:49
cover art Malone that&#39;s the cover by my
watch it I&#39;m not gonna lie to you until

421
00:30:49 --> 00:30:53
you have watched this movie but if this
happens somewhere in it then it&#39;s a good

422
00:30:53 --> 00:30:53
movie

423
00:30:53 --> 00:30:58
also there&#39;s something to be said about
something so large you could kill a

424
00:30:58 --> 00:31:01
small child with this like you could
luncheon somebody to death with this I

425
00:31:01 --> 00:31:05
was a handful bought one of those and it
and it left a lot of space for a really

426
00:31:05 --> 00:31:09
good artist to actually create something
that in itself was a work of art I need

427
00:31:09 --> 00:31:11
a major film was fun to see it

428
00:31:11 --> 00:31:16
well it&#39;s a kind of job lot of
illustrators generation of to do it used

429
00:31:16 --> 00:31:19
to have a battery and you press the
button and then frankenberger says one a

430
00:31:19 --> 00:31:24
date because that&#39;s one of our hitch
line it catch phrases in the movie on a

431
00:31:24 --> 00:31:29
date she&#39;s a frankan hooker i have the
box but it doesn&#39;t work anymore but was

432
00:31:29 --> 00:31:32
this talking box and you press here and
you hear a voice girl

433
00:31:32 --> 00:31:35
push the button on the box she goes
wanted a it was obsessive you just SAT

434
00:31:35 --> 00:31:38
there want to be on a date want to be
one of it

435
00:31:38 --> 00:31:44
witness was in the stores people at what
people were doing i think the talking

436
00:31:44 --> 00:31:48
box did more to sell the movies in the
movie if you only see one maybe this

437
00:31:48 --> 00:31:51
year it should be frankenberger but of
course it should be I mean you see

438
00:31:51 --> 00:31:56
things that are like wow this is you
know this box art is not selling and

439
00:31:56 --> 00:31:59
especially being a buyer for as long as
I have I can really i can really look at

440
00:31:59 --> 00:32:03
stuff and go this box are will sell this
neat looking at those like two thousand

441
00:32:03 --> 00:32:08
maniacs just the blood coming out of the
mouth for the Color Me blood-red with

442
00:32:08 --> 00:32:13
women like just Italian plate discipline
guts hanging out just like that is for

443
00:32:13 --> 00:32:13
me

444
00:32:13 --> 00:32:16
people have a certain amount of
nostalgia for kind of old VHS stuff and

445
00:32:16 --> 00:32:19
some of it was pretty great post was
awful and if your objective about your

446
00:32:19 --> 00:32:25
terrible terrible unspeakable a bad
movies that have some of the best covers

447
00:32:25 --> 00:32:25
I&#39;ve ever seen

448
00:32:25 --> 00:32:29
I admire the fact that those companies
figured out and we&#39;ve got to do is wrap

449
00:32:29 --> 00:32:30
it nicely

450
00:32:30 --> 00:32:36
this was ultimately used as a video
cover for Chevy Chase funny farm

451
00:32:36 --> 00:32:41
sometimes it just the simpler image read
that there was a

452
00:32:41 --> 00:32:44
great way for some of the artists living

453
00:32:44 --> 00:32:48
the library are produced especially
during the seventies and eighties we

454
00:32:48 --> 00:32:51
would fight to get our name in there in
somewhat allowing others would take it

455
00:32:51 --> 00:32:55
out and so we hide it in summers my name
is in the hair if you turn it upside

456
00:32:55 --> 00:32:59
down and have a look at it you&#39;ll see
what somebody does like it would kind of

457
00:32:59 --> 00:33:02
cheap fast photoshop here&#39;s a bunch of
floating heads you know buy it because

458
00:33:02 --> 00:33:05
these actors are in it like that our
work isn&#39;t going to move the needle at

459
00:33:05 --> 00:33:09
all i don&#39;t know what happened then they
actually used to use color I don&#39;t see

460
00:33:09 --> 00:33:12
color all that frequently it&#39;s like it&#39;s
like they&#39;re designing shit for dogs I

461
00:33:12 --> 00:33:15
think that everyone forgot how awesome a
painted cover is with a dude with a

462
00:33:15 --> 00:33:18
shirt off holding a machine gun I would
you take a photo that when you can

463
00:33:18 --> 00:33:22
create a beautiful portrait of it that&#39;s
the stuff that&#39;s going to keep it out of

464
00:33:22 --> 00:33:26
the mainstream you know the big box
stores going to work that they don&#39;t

465
00:33:26 --> 00:33:29
want that payment work amount of work i
was going from the movie studios where

466
00:33:29 --> 00:33:36
he started to slow down in the early
nineties and also so that I have to

467
00:33:36 --> 00:33:39
learn how to do it on the computer or
they could you be any more once I master

468
00:33:39 --> 00:33:40
the tool of the computer and I

469
00:33:40 --> 00:33:43
they look great but i did before maybe a
little bit better

470
00:33:43 --> 00:33:47
don&#39;t give me art can&#39;t stand are the
worst covers on the planet criterion I&#39;m

471
00:33:47 --> 00:33:51
sorry guys in the most boring covers
ever made

472
00:33:51 --> 00:33:54
how could you not want to see this how
could you not want to all of this

473
00:33:54 --> 00:33:58
thank God you know this is that you want
to what this cover

474
00:33:58 --> 00:34:02
yeah you know criterion go fuck yourself

475
00:34:02 --> 00:34:05
this is how yourself

476
00:34:05 --> 00:34:08
yeah

477
00:34:08 --> 00:34:17
so by 1986 home video is giving us much
money to Hollywood the box office and

478
00:34:17 --> 00:34:18
it&#39;s all new money

479
00:34:18 --> 00:34:22
20th century fox is brought up by the
news corporation paramount is brought up

480
00:34:22 --> 00:34:26
by viacom very interesting because at
home video you actually have sony

481
00:34:26 --> 00:34:32
electronics manufacturer decided never
to lose the format war again and the way

482
00:34:32 --> 00:34:36
to do that was to buy up a film studio
so they bought Columbia so by the

483
00:34:36 --> 00:34:40
nineteen nineties you have a new
landscape of media conglomerates then

484
00:34:40 --> 00:34:46
they represented that film was switching
over to a major brand and can spin off

485
00:34:46 --> 00:34:51
from film into many different markets
with the sales of videos music boy

486
00:34:51 --> 00:34:58
action figures etc etc etc down ality
the same basic five or six corporate

487
00:34:58 --> 00:35:03
pipelines that supply almost all of our
people and unfortunately they&#39;re not

488
00:35:03 --> 00:35:07
operation enough to sort of reach
outside their own Catalans so you don&#39;t

489
00:35:07 --> 00:35:10
have that that sort of hunger and the
marketplace

490
00:35:10 --> 00:35:15
blockbuster came and they took over in
really got rid of all the mountain

491
00:35:15 --> 00:35:17
chains its name says it all

492
00:35:17 --> 00:35:20
it was about black pastors that&#39;s
probably we&#39;re interested in video

493
00:35:20 --> 00:35:27
rental is you know that was that was the
dominant way for seen films you know 20

494
00:35:27 --> 00:35:31
years ago and it&#39;s dead even though we
lost all that yes we have the internet

495
00:35:31 --> 00:35:33
which is awesome i&#39;m not going to say
that the internet isn&#39;t great

496
00:35:33 --> 00:35:37
it&#39;s incredible like I it&#39;s in some ways
it&#39;s almost worth it

497
00:35:37 --> 00:35:40
yeah there&#39;s definitely sense of loss of
course I think but it&#39;s it&#39;s awesome to

498
00:35:40 --> 00:35:44
see the places that are still around
like a cinephile odd obsession scarecrow

499
00:35:44 --> 00:35:50
I heard video Vulcan they&#39;re still going
strong as our video tape costume that we

500
00:35:50 --> 00:35:55
have someone who gets in and jumps
around during the trivia contest that we

501
00:35:55 --> 00:35:59
do and it&#39;s pretty it&#39;s pretty easy to
get onto it

502
00:35:59 --> 00:36:09
I like this we were thinking of hiring
some guidelines be on the sidewalk in

503
00:36:09 --> 00:36:13
this waving at people but their nobody
wants to do that for minimum wage would

504
00:36:13 --> 00:36:17
be just said because it dominated for so
long was just an appetite

505
00:36:17 --> 00:36:20
they had to fill those shelves they had
to have new product out and so

506
00:36:20 --> 00:36:24
distributors reach deep into their
cattle they had and that was exciting

507
00:36:24 --> 00:36:29
that was I think the greatest error of
discovery VHS had an unusually long life

508
00:36:29 --> 00:36:32
for home video and I think that is
something that will never see happen

509
00:36:32 --> 00:36:36
again will never see blu-ray dominate
the market for 15 years it just won&#39;t

510
00:36:36 --> 00:36:39
happen

511
00:36:39 --> 00:36:52
when I first started it was like i&#39;m a
college grad you know I&#39;ve had a

512
00:36:52 --> 00:36:55
business and now i&#39;m going to work in a
flea market when people would ask me in

513
00:36:55 --> 00:36:56
church or whatever

514
00:36:56 --> 00:36:59
what do you do I say old movies at the
flea market you know in this like the

515
00:36:59 --> 00:37:03
funny thing about digging through all
the great stuff at the house is that

516
00:37:03 --> 00:37:06
there&#39;s no separation whatsoever between
like Jean Rah&#39;s basically you&#39;ll have

517
00:37:06 --> 00:37:10
like the brave little toaster and then
enormous wangs of the northern Yukon or

518
00:37:10 --> 00:37:12
whatever and then just like right next
to each other because they&#39;re both over

519
00:37:12 --> 00:37:15
sized boxes that&#39;s a great feeling to
check that one out

520
00:37:15 --> 00:37:22
we are the picture show been here since
1990 got lots of customers that were

521
00:37:22 --> 00:37:26
kids would come in their parents were
behind kids movies are now married and

522
00:37:26 --> 00:37:30
bring in their kids so that&#39;s the
biggest thing keeps me going and so I

523
00:37:30 --> 00:37:36
have people coming in most of them over
55 or 60 that still like VHS to buy VHS

524
00:37:36 --> 00:37:40
that&#39;s what they want and then young
guys like you your collectors and they

525
00:37:40 --> 00:37:46
want to the old stuff and they want to
get into all that this is a typical VHS

526
00:37:46 --> 00:37:55
buyer kind of low class either way about
a donkey named Paco will steal your

527
00:37:55 --> 00:38:01
heart and your wallets Wayne charges a
lot for his VHS like you know more than

528
00:38:01 --> 00:38:05
anyone else in America play charges for
the VHS it&#39;s like a flat rate of like 9

529
00:38:05 --> 00:38:08
bucks if you like see you ten bucks if
he doesn&#39;t and there&#39;s no way on earth

is stealing my wallets you got to have

531
00:38:11 --> 00:38:16

536
00:38:29 --> 00:38:33
around here but i&#39;ll still end up
watching an old movie to me it&#39;s like an

537
00:38:33 --> 00:38:37
old friend we display about 17,000

538
00:38:37 --> 00:38:41
models on VHS we display about 12,000
titles on DVD

00:38:41 --> 00:38:46
probably a player i have another fifteen
twenty thousand duplicates and around

540
00:38:46 --> 00:38:52
here in the two rooms i probably have
close to another 50,000 DHL so that&#39;s

541
00:38:52 --> 00:38:54
over a hundred years except me

542
00:38:54 --> 00:38:59
yeah probably at least 80 85 maybe and I
don&#39;t really know that I&#39;m not counting

543
00:38:59 --> 00:39:04
this is the video room inside wings
house with six total chaos

544
00:39:04 --> 00:39:10
the earth has vomited up you know 12
video stores you do the best out in the

545
00:39:10 --> 00:39:16
country you don&#39;t want to be in town
you&#39;re fighting all the best buyers and

546
00:39:16 --> 00:39:18
Walmart&#39;s and only known up there

547
00:39:18 --> 00:39:22
I&#39;m the biggest movie thing to a lot of
people coming in from a 40 or 50 mile

548
00:39:22 --> 00:39:27
radius we can talk intelligently about
ninety percent of movies up there and we

549
00:39:27 --> 00:39:32
probably seen three percent of them if
you don&#39;t know then you go here it&#39;s a

550
00:39:32 --> 00:39:36
good movie right or yeah that&#39;s a real
good i was pretty good move

551
00:39:36 --> 00:39:43
are you gonna say hear it it&#39;s terrible
no no no that&#39;s absolutely a no-no and

552
00:39:43 --> 00:39:45
you go even if it&#39;s a pretty box look at
the box

553
00:39:45 --> 00:39:49
even if it sucks web you know most of it
you just heard people tell you it sucks

554
00:39:49 --> 00:39:51
but you don&#39;t know it because i haven&#39;t
seen it

555
00:39:51 --> 00:39:56
nothing more is more depressing to me
into work up on january first and know

556
00:39:56 --> 00:40:00
exactly what you&#39;re going to make for
the whole year I want to at least have

557
00:40:00 --> 00:40:07
the possibility of making 50,000 making
10,000 but at least I don&#39;t know is

558
00:40:07 --> 00:40:09
still have it

559
00:40:09 --> 00:40:13
this VHS home video systems every single
function you let the mood

560
00:40:13 --> 00:40:17
it was made by jvc the people who
invented we&#39;re just a home video system

561
00:40:17 --> 00:40:21
so advanced it&#39;s used in markets around
the world and any other by the best

562
00:40:21 --> 00:40:25
invention ever come up with our quarters
remote control unit which books every

563
00:40:25 --> 00:40:28
function of the machine itself into the
palm of your hand

564
00:40:28 --> 00:40:34
VHS came out and the rewind button was
introduced it just like I was pretty

565
00:40:34 --> 00:40:37
much revolutionary for filmmakers
because you could just easily with the

566
00:40:37 --> 00:40:41
press the button just go back and
constantly rewatch out onto the second

567
00:40:41 --> 00:40:44
arrow to someone&#39;s chest you can go back
and positive

568
00:40:44 --> 00:40:47
yeah look at close it you also
understand dissect the structure of

569
00:40:47 --> 00:40:50
editing because usually you know editing
is designed it often is very seamless

570
00:40:50 --> 00:40:55
and you could figure out how shots with
people together to create a flow

571
00:40:55 --> 00:41:01
effective in a gag special stunt it&#39;s
really increased the ability for people

572
00:41:01 --> 00:41:04
to understand the language of

573
00:41:04 --> 00:41:15
baby i&#39;m going to be doing it so come on
out there captain and I got contact in

574
00:41:15 --> 00:41:21
school so 100 minus and second question
your instructional is your grandmother

575
00:41:21 --> 00:41:27
coming in mr. even able to test video
let&#39;s go make them eating out of the

576
00:41:27 --> 00:41:32
gathering want to do not talk about dr.
VHS can I think taught a lot of people

577
00:41:32 --> 00:41:36
about the nature of film the nature of
editing nature found and have those

578
00:41:36 --> 00:41:36
things matter

579
00:41:36 --> 00:41:41
not on purpose but on accident like okay
so this tape is falling apart why is it

580
00:41:41 --> 00:41:41
doing that

581
00:41:41 --> 00:41:45
ok it&#39;s a physical medium all-wise that
all because it just magnetic oxide stuck

582
00:41:45 --> 00:41:47
to a tape and a predetermined pattern

583
00:41:47 --> 00:41:54
ok instead of having stacks of film
books we had stacks of VHS tapes

584
00:41:54 --> 00:41:58
that&#39;s what helped us discover our love
for cinema is what inspired us to go and

585
00:41:58 --> 00:42:02
start shooting our own movies and I
remember even cutting my first films on

586
00:42:02 --> 00:42:06
to VHS players everyone had a VHS deck
in their house in the nineteen eighties

587
00:42:06 --> 00:42:11
that was I mean everyone that I knew did
so you record something you put it on a

588
00:42:11 --> 00:42:14
VHS tape you can share with everybody
you can just leave the camera running

589
00:42:14 --> 00:42:21
and you were also aware that it was easy
to record sound so that was really

590
00:42:21 --> 00:42:26
revolutionary and for someone who was
raised on home movies on film the idea

591
00:42:26 --> 00:42:31
video was almost magical it felt like
this was too good to be true thing about

592
00:42:31 --> 00:42:34
film history class of film 101 whatever
university you&#39;ve been in whatever

593
00:42:34 --> 00:42:38
highschool the first film&#39;s you looked
at with the lumiere films got a train

594
00:42:38 --> 00:42:39
coming into a station

595
00:42:39 --> 00:42:42
you&#39;ve got factory workers leaving a
factory and you&#39;re feeding a baby

596
00:42:42 --> 00:42:47
maybe these are the canonical titles of
early cinema that every txt but have and

597
00:42:47 --> 00:42:52
they are home movies i made a my first
feature of VHS when i was 12 i would

598
00:42:52 --> 00:42:56
just my brothers and like a gorilla
costume or we made it gets that came out

599
00:42:56 --> 00:43:01
there we did a fake episode of tops it&#39;s
mostly unwatchable it&#39;s mostly deeply

600
00:43:01 --> 00:43:04
embarrassing haha was wrong

601
00:43:04 --> 00:43:13
yes he was wrong before that it seemed
like well making movies like this whole

602
00:43:13 --> 00:43:16
different thing is no way that you could
ever do that to people in Hollywood do

603
00:43:16 --> 00:43:20
but then when I figured out means get a
video cameras make this movie they can

604
00:43:20 --> 00:43:22
show it to your friends like the next
week that was so exciting and then like

605
00:43:22 --> 00:43:36
I was kinda hooked on board waste time
but i think it was the fact that it was

606
00:43:36 --> 00:43:37
so accessible

607
00:43:37 --> 00:43:41
it was the fact that it was universal my
guard let&#39;s go skate and I&#39;m just gonna

608
00:43:41 --> 00:43:44
bring the camera with me it was like
this whole production

609
00:43:44 --> 00:43:47
yeah

610
00:43:47 --> 00:43:50
you know I think in the grand scheme of
things will understand that there was a

611
00:43:50 --> 00:43:54
conventional film and that became
domestic at one point but that

612
00:43:54 --> 00:44:00
distinction between was 8-millimeter
film and what was home video i think was

613
00:44:00 --> 00:44:07
just this weird you know maybe 20-year
blip in our evolution I was ten saw the

614
00:44:07 --> 00:44:13
movie when it first came out and really
was overcome by just Indiana Jones the

615
00:44:13 --> 00:44:17
character himself and the world that he
inhabited you know being a single kid

616
00:44:17 --> 00:44:20
and kind of nerdy you know I wanted to
create worlds for myself

617
00:44:20 --> 00:44:22
that was my motivation and then getting
together with my friend Eric seyla we

618
00:44:22 --> 00:44:27
wanted to recreate this Raiders film and
of course when you have a passion idea

619
00:44:27 --> 00:44:30
you find the tools to do it Eric had
more of a drive to see a shot-for-shot

620
00:44:30 --> 00:44:32
remake of raiders in its entirety

621
00:44:32 --> 00:44:35
I think for myself maybe it was that
idea but I think for me it was more like

622
00:44:35 --> 00:44:38
I just want to play Indiana Jones

623
00:44:38 --> 00:44:42
we worked from memory for the first
three years video stores weren&#39;t as

624
00:44:42 --> 00:44:43
readily available

625
00:44:43 --> 00:44:46
you just couldn&#39;t get stuff and so you
are left your own to go back to the

626
00:44:46 --> 00:44:49
theater and see the film again about the
comic book we bought the script that was

627
00:44:49 --> 00:44:53
published we bought fan magazines i
snuck a tape recorder into the movie

628
00:44:53 --> 00:44:56
theater just get sound effects and ended
up getting thrown out and then when the

629
00:44:56 --> 00:45:00
film came out on laserdisc in 84 85 we
watched it and realize we were pretty

630
00:45:00 --> 00:45:04
close the whole seven-year project
really adjusted it for ourselves but

631
00:45:04 --> 00:45:07
there&#39;s a nostalgia there for this
generation of filmmakers that were

632
00:45:07 --> 00:45:12
teaching themselves on Betamax mean that
could be something as simple as setting

633
00:45:12 --> 00:45:14
up your Barbie dolls you know or that
could be something as complicated as

634
00:45:14 --> 00:45:17
wanting to remake raiders of the lost
ark in its entirety VHS will always have

635
00:45:17 --> 00:45:22
a historical place because it was the
first weigh-in which images were

636
00:45:22 --> 00:45:27
circulated and duplicated in a
cost-effective way there were not the

637
00:45:27 --> 00:45:30
economic constraints that were
associated with image-making before

638
00:45:30 --> 00:45:33
that&#39;s revolutionary I remember renting
some of those little sort of low-rent

639
00:45:33 --> 00:45:36
titles in the mom-and-pop video stores
but then you get them home and they

640
00:45:36 --> 00:45:40
would have this look like this doesn&#39;t
look like real movie this isn&#39;t a real

641
00:45:40 --> 00:45:45
film kinda looks like TV news or
something and you would get like a shot

642
00:45:45 --> 00:45:48
on video movie that will give every
appearance of being a real movie but it

643
00:45:48 --> 00:45:51
wouldn&#39;t be right

644
00:45:51 --> 00:45:53
yeah

645
00:45:53 --> 00:45:58
there&#39;s something about like watching
something shot on video it makes you

646
00:45:58 --> 00:46:01
feel for me makes me feel more like I&#39;m
they&#39;re like it feels more like a

647
00:46:01 --> 00:46:04
voyeuristic things that like you
associated with home movies and so then

648
00:46:04 --> 00:46:07
we see a movie made on video you kind of
get this feeling like you&#39;re seeing

649
00:46:07 --> 00:46:10
something that maybe you weren&#39;t
supposed to everybody was like you know

650
00:46:10 --> 00:46:12
you gotta shoot a film what are you
doing you can&#39;t shoot him you know

651
00:46:12 --> 00:46:15
feature on video i&#39;m gonna take my time
with this we&#39;re going to treat this like

652
00:46:15 --> 00:46:18
a movie just the fact that it&#39;s being
shot in super vhs-c is going to be

653
00:46:18 --> 00:46:25
irrelevant sledgehammer they native full
on VHS for VHS and I think as far as i

654
00:46:25 --> 00:46:29
know it&#39;s the first one like that and
made with a sense of professionalism

655
00:46:29 --> 00:46:32
like maybe this is the new way i was
here at Ohio doing it guys like Tim

656
00:46:32 --> 00:46:34
Ritter were down in Florida you know
doing the same thing he was going

657
00:46:34 --> 00:46:37
door-to-door to video stores but
eventually you had guys that crack the

658
00:46:37 --> 00:46:40
night at Blockbuster and we&#39;re getting
stuff on blockbuster store shelves the

659
00:46:40 --> 00:46:44
unprofessional quality of the shot on
video movies to me is what makes them

660
00:46:44 --> 00:46:47
beautiful and makes them i don&#39;t know
it&#39;s weird it&#39;s like they were trashy

661
00:46:47 --> 00:46:50
back then but now there&#39;s an artistic
quality

662
00:46:50 --> 00:46:58
despite being an ex-boxer on marine the
light finally succumb to the vicious

663
00:46:58 --> 00:47:08
relentlessly what thirsty on yielding
resilient avalanche and have you seen

664
00:47:08 --> 00:47:13

detective Rock to stop the monster you

669
00:47:24 --> 00:47:27
know but who always doesn&#39;t believe in

something if I want it it takes too long
to fast-forward rewind to find that size

704
00:49:54 --> 00:49:58
and just do it over again and it turns
out pretty good the second time

705
00:49:58 --> 00:50:05

chest shot him go ahead right in my

706

with teenage boys there was a big thing

725
00:51:16 --> 00:51:21
back in the eighties watching a video
tape as a kid and you can start see the

726
00:51:21 --> 00:51:24
lines rolling to the picture you know
that someone&#39;s watched it a lot at that

727
00:51:24 --> 00:51:27
point and you know that there&#39;s gonna be
tips coming on soon you get ready you

holy shit some fucking weird pervert has
watched his part so many times that i&#39;m

730
00:51:33 --> 00:51:36
ready for the money shot when you watch
a VHS tape

731
00:51:36 --> 00:51:39
there&#39;s almost like a archaeology that
you can do on it where there&#39;s history

732
00:51:39 --> 00:51:42
written into the physical material of
the thing itself you get to see the

733
00:51:42 --> 00:51:45
parts that are really beat up you know
that someone like rewound and watch it

734
00:51:45 --> 00:51:47
over and over like the part where
there&#39;s boobs and the part where the guy

735
00:51:47 --> 00:51:50
explode like you know that was someone&#39;s
favorite part and they they couldn&#39;t get

736
00:51:50 --> 00:51:53
enough

737
00:51:53 --> 00:52:00
that was the first I think anybody ever
had the power over being able to see

738
00:52:00 --> 00:52:04
boobs again and again and again and
again and again cable had been a reality

739
00:52:04 --> 00:52:08
in our lives so you can see boobs but
they were then they were gone and

740
00:52:08 --> 00:52:12
they&#39;re just a golden memory handed a
videotape of kentucky fried movie and I

741
00:52:12 --> 00:52:15
wanted to the friend and he gave it back
it was like this every ten minutes or

742
00:52:15 --> 00:52:18
something was gonna flip foot and be
like you watched all those nude scenes

743
00:52:18 --> 00:52:22
over and over again and that one weekend
get my tape is ruined

744
00:52:22 --> 00:52:26
but it&#39;s also kind of funny and whenever
i watch it i can think of you being

745
00:52:26 --> 00:52:31
gross and hilarious my Ghostbusters tape
I bet people can&#39;t even make out the

746
00:52:31 --> 00:52:35
whole scene where he goes I came I saw I
kicked some ass because I&#39;m i thought

747
00:52:35 --> 00:52:38
that was the greatest shit ever when I
was a kid I everyone that scene was like

748
00:52:38 --> 00:52:43
well he kicks the math that is what
Ghostbusters do we had a guy at one of

749
00:52:43 --> 00:52:46
our video stores that i worked at where
we eventually to cancel his membership

750
00:52:46 --> 00:52:53
as we figure out was him but his hobby
was renting children&#39;s movies and then

751
00:52:53 --> 00:52:58
splicing in pornography in the middle of
them and returning them to us so they go

752
00:52:58 --> 00:53:02
back on our rental she&#39;ll finish that
detonated we have less than $PERCENT

753
00:53:02 --> 00:53:04
committed

754
00:53:04 --> 00:53:07
yeah

755
00:53:07 --> 00:53:15
it entertained this guy and with VHS
that was a tangible thing you can do it

756
00:53:15 --> 00:53:20
do my friend let me a tape of a movie he
taped for me recently I went all the way

757
00:53:20 --> 00:53:23
to the end of the tape just to see how
many layers of things that he taped over

758
00:53:23 --> 00:53:27
and what were they can&#39;t catch the tail
end of a movie from cinemax are like a

759
00:53:27 --> 00:53:30
music video or like this TV show all the
way to the something that was taped

760
00:53:30 --> 00:53:35
originally from like 1987 and it was
really great to see what does this guy

761
00:53:35 --> 00:53:39
know like what he was watching like for
the past 25 years

762
00:53:39 --> 00:53:42
Lawrence of Arabia&#39;s one of my favorite
films and when I go see a print of that

763
00:53:42 --> 00:53:49
in the theater every scratch every break
every place you see a splice there&#39;s a

764
00:53:49 --> 00:53:52
story behind that something happened
with that movie something happen with

765
00:53:52 --> 00:53:56
that print when it was shown to an
audience and there&#39;s something about

766
00:53:56 --> 00:53:59
that that to me is really kind of
special because you know that prince had

767
00:53:59 --> 00:54:01
some life and some legs on it

768
00:54:01 --> 00:54:06
VHS could do that it&#39;s almost like VHS
has a built-in hit counter and that like

769
00:54:06 --> 00:54:10
you can tell how many times it&#39;s been
copied by the way that it looks and so

770
00:54:10 --> 00:54:15
you knew that when you got a tape if
you&#39;re in tape trading like the shitty

771
00:54:15 --> 00:54:19
rat look and the worst that sounded you
just knew it was gonna be gold because

772
00:54:19 --> 00:54:23
that meant that 10 people before you had
copied it and thought that it was funny

773
00:54:23 --> 00:54:27
enough for great enough for weird enough
to make a copy and then pass it to their

774
00:54:27 --> 00:54:30
friends who thought the same thing so it
was like this vetting process you know

775
00:54:30 --> 00:54:35
where this like distillery of images are
exhibited by the time you got it it was

776
00:54:35 --> 00:54:38
like potent and you know going to get
you high

yeah don&#39;t put the magic hat on the
Snowman Wow

794
00:55:47 --> 00:55:50
because if you do he&#39;s gonna come to
life

795
00:55:50 --> 00:55:57
it&#39;s not cool my sister in Minnesota put
a hat on the Snowman gonna try to killer

796
00:55:57 --> 00:56:02
back and make you anyway yeah I decided
they could to get in this business one

797
00:56:02 --> 00:56:05
it was economics i didn&#39;t have really a
job is working . theater

798
00:56:05 --> 00:56:09
I just had a son what am I gonna do with
my life so the very first thing i do is

799
00:56:09 --> 00:56:13
the obvious i took a little add 30
titles Mexican horror titles and some

800
00:56:13 --> 00:56:17
other obscurities ran that and for a
couple months and I remember how it

801
00:56:17 --> 00:56:20
happened first week i got like five
hundred dollars in the males like oh my

802
00:56:20 --> 00:56:24
god make my copy send them out and the
next week thousand dollars the next week

803
00:56:24 --> 00:56:30
oh my god this is insane slice i quit my
job and I started being a bootlegger

804
00:56:30 --> 00:56:33
this is before the internet you read
someone&#39;s ad in a magazine and you would

805
00:56:33 --> 00:56:34
respond and you would write down what
you

806
00:56:34 --> 00:56:38
and what he had and you would trade and
you make a copy and it was usually bad

807
00:56:38 --> 00:56:41
for five generations later and but you
still get to see the movie you wanted

808
00:56:41 --> 00:56:44
and what started happening as I started
to get more and more extreme type of

809
00:56:44 --> 00:56:47
films is things would be taken by
customs but it was really funny because

810
00:56:47 --> 00:56:50
they got this checklist is that your
your product has been seized by Canada

811
00:56:50 --> 00:56:56
Customs and I remember twice i order
tapes that got these at the border and

812
00:56:56 --> 00:57:00
one of them was not romantic necrophilia
boxes checked if you are ordering a

813
00:57:00 --> 00:57:04
movie that was banned or prohibited you
have the guy tape like episode of all in

814
00:57:04 --> 00:57:06
the family for like the first five or
ten minutes and of course you&#39;re not

815
00:57:06 --> 00:57:08
gonna have the tape label degradation of
the shitty you&#39;re going six or something

816
00:57:08 --> 00:57:11
like that is going to put you know all
the family three runs or something like

817
00:57:11 --> 00:57:15
that that was a pretty solid trick to me
I&#39;d it was an offensive in any way

818
00:57:15 --> 00:57:18
because these things are possible to
find what they were doing was helping

819
00:57:18 --> 00:57:21
spread these movies and getting them out
to people to actually see them i think

820
00:57:21 --> 00:57:24
that&#39;s why in the DVD market the
beginning you were seeing large units of

821
00:57:24 --> 00:57:28
things move because they could go to a
convention like this and say okay

822
00:57:28 --> 00:57:32
those guys were moving that many
bootlegs are that many trades amongst

823
00:57:32 --> 00:57:32
them

824
00:57:32 --> 00:57:36
it&#39;s a safe bet to put out a nice
remastered copy but i think it was in an

825
00:57:36 --> 00:57:40
important time and a lot of movies were
discovered by trading and in the case

826
00:57:40 --> 00:57:43
specifically of that next story but
there was such a long window a time from

827
00:57:43 --> 00:57:46
the time it was made to the time it
actually came out that it was bootleg a

828
00:57:46 --> 00:57:49
lot but it benefited the movie because
everybody found out about it that way we

829
00:57:49 --> 00:57:52
didn&#39;t have to go out and do a bunch of
publicity the publicity came to us the

830
00:57:52 --> 00:57:58
classical on the movement took a couple
times are good not present to go bail

831
00:57:58 --> 00:58:07
mecosta type of all my go-to them huh
there goes okay detective is it

832
00:58:07 --> 00:58:13
yeah that&#39;s good maybe I can one get
cooking the time your child together i&#39;m

833
00:58:13 --> 00:58:20
going to do know the secular government
government protocol and this year so

834
00:58:20 --> 00:58:22
real kung

835
00:58:22 --> 00:58:30
guided or very touchy cocaine or econo
air force women are more it is

836
00:58:30 --> 00:58:35
definitely just getting more and more
depressed didn&#39;t you stay at the Muslim

837
00:58:35 --> 00:58:39
they&#39;re kind of funny and on the phone
with these companies i think they know

838
00:58:39 --> 00:58:42
maybe they don&#39;t but I you know I feel
kind of you know I may be good like some

839
00:58:42 --> 00:58:44
of their stuff in the past and I&#39;m
dealing with a lot of professional level

840
00:58:44 --> 00:58:47
playing the movies in the theater but
these guys all know I mean any guy

841
00:58:47 --> 00:58:50
that&#39;s that&#39;s gonna be hypocritical and
say you know your bootleggin cannibal

842
00:58:50 --> 00:58:53
holocaust well the first time you saw
cannibal holocaust was via pirate tape

843
00:58:53 --> 00:58:57
and shocked about cruelty to the animals
McDonald&#39;s has to be on top of the list

844
00:58:57 --> 00:59:00
I&#39;m heat when you think about this poor
little mcchickens walking around without

845
00:59:00 --> 00:59:07
the mcnuggets I think the appeal of this
type of material the VHS definitely

846
00:59:07 --> 00:59:13
encouraged and help spread these viral
videos are that they capture something

847
00:59:13 --> 00:59:16
authentic that wasn&#39;t meant to be
captured

848
00:59:16 --> 00:59:19
we finally got to the point i think in
the last five years we&#39;re just

849
00:59:19 --> 00:59:24
everything truly is ours now we&#39;re when
you put something out there i&#39;m sorry

850
00:59:24 --> 00:59:29
it&#39;s just it&#39;s not yours anymore it&#39;s
everyone&#39;s here before you would have in

851
00:59:29 --> 00:59:32
a way it was patriarchal and it was like
problematic because you would have to

852
00:59:32 --> 00:59:35
wait for someone else to approve of what
you were saying and presenting and have

853
00:59:35 --> 00:59:39
to go through that whole dance but in
that there was a pre-selection process

854
00:59:39 --> 00:59:42
and so that by the time something go out
to a screen you knew that someone

855
00:59:42 --> 00:59:43
thought that it was worth something

856
00:59:43 --> 00:59:46
you look at youtube and you like i love
capital yes I could spend a good portion

857
00:59:46 --> 00:59:49
of and perhaps I do spend a good portion
of my day watching cavities cabins have

858
00:59:49 --> 00:59:54
always been important if you look at
what people were shooting on film for

859
00:59:54 --> 00:59:59
home movies in the fifties and sixties
they were filming their cats but i think

860
00:59:59 --> 01:00:05
the incredible pressure now is to
understand what it is you need to watch

861
01:00:05 --> 01:00:09
and the orthodoxy comes really from what
other people are clicking into and then

862
01:00:09 --> 01:00:12
the question is well how did they find
out how and how is that discovered

863
01:00:12 --> 01:00:20
Tony I don&#39;t for the idea of using not
particularly no no la havana and I doing

864
01:00:20 --> 01:00:26
a home in judo negoita tomaste UTA Hagen
a video to dismantle so lucky you know

865
01:00:26 --> 01:00:31
Michigan I you&#39;re gonna tell me when I
was wondering what fashion trends do you

866
01:00:31 --> 01:00:31
follow

867
01:00:31 --> 01:00:34
well usually look at magazines or and
stupid kids school wearing

868
01:00:34 --> 01:00:40
already you can see a remix culture
appropriating different clips to do

869
01:00:40 --> 01:00:43
different things with it besides just
what the producers in a centralized

870
01:00:43 --> 01:00:48
industry such as Hollywood or the New
York television networks do with it

871
01:00:48 --> 01:00:51
I don&#39;t watch stuff that I hate and then
put it on there which i think a lot of

872
01:00:51 --> 01:00:54
people think for for everything is
terrible they think like oh it sucks you

873
01:00:54 --> 01:00:56
gotta put up there it&#39;s like no I don&#39;t
want to put anything up unless it&#39;s

874
01:00:56 --> 01:01:01
incredible crack cocaine coke and this
is what you smoke it in its awesome

875
01:01:01 --> 01:01:06
yes some of the stuff we do doesn&#39;t show
people the best night ever but they did

876
01:01:06 --> 01:01:09
produce that stuff to begin with we&#39;re
just spitting it back out

877
01:01:09 --> 01:01:12
I&#39;m father Mickey no 1 i&#39;m al my gold
i&#39;m retarded

878
01:01:12 --> 01:01:15
hey Toby you too man haha mr. white

879
01:01:15 --> 01:01:18
I&#39;m just a tire there&#39;s so much
undiscovered stuff still how can we

880
01:01:18 --> 01:01:21
share that with everybody let&#39;s just
organize this as best we can

881
01:01:21 --> 01:01:24
because that&#39;s really all it is is just
kind of taking control over those tapes

882
01:01:24 --> 01:01:33
that&#39;s right little buddy my god so it&#39;s
fascinating that these technologies in a

883
01:01:33 --> 01:01:39
leapfrog each other building new uses
and none of this is driven by people

884
01:01:39 --> 01:01:43
really anticipating what the new use
will be it&#39;s almost like you have to

885
01:01:43 --> 01:01:46
build a machine and density what people
do with it

886
01:01:46 --> 01:01:50
there&#39;s really no need for our cake
things like cable anymore stuff like

887
01:01:50 --> 01:01:55
that it&#39;s like why would you do that
then you can literally watch whatever

888
01:01:55 --> 01:01:59
you want at any time and I guess they&#39;re
people that are collectors and put

889
01:01:59 --> 01:02:02
things on their shelves and it reflects
who they are and I think that that&#39;s a

890
01:02:02 --> 01:02:08
loss but I i think that they&#39;ll be
virtual ways for us to collect and we&#39;re

891
01:02:08 --> 01:02:09
going to figure that out

892
01:02:09 --> 01:02:13
I&#39;m sure studios are really excited
about the way things are going about the

893
01:02:13 --> 01:02:16
fact that there&#39;s not going to be
physical media I mean the Walt Disney

894
01:02:16 --> 01:02:20
Corporation you know it&#39;s made up of
lovely people that whole idea of the

895
01:02:20 --> 01:02:24
disney vault we&#39;re putting the lion king
back of a disney video volt you can try

896
01:02:24 --> 01:02:25
it again for a while

897
01:02:25 --> 01:02:28
it&#39;s a completely artificial sense of
scarcity is going to create a completely

898
01:02:28 --> 01:02:34
artificial sense of demand studios are
now completely dominating what is

899
01:02:34 --> 01:02:37
available to you and they are completely
in control of what you can have and they

900
01:02:37 --> 01:02:41
can give that to you and they can take
that away like a level and God it

901
01:02:41 --> 01:02:42
infuriates me

902
01:02:42 --> 01:02:45
the notion of somebody else having
control over my access to media in

903
01:02:45 --> 01:02:50
general father&#39;s when i read the story
about the kindle and how all the people

904
01:02:50 --> 01:02:53
who had purchased couldn&#39;t have been
more ironic title but George Orwell&#39;s

905
01:02:53 --> 01:02:58
1984 woke up one morning because of
Licensing disagreement it was gone

906
01:02:58 --> 01:03:03
it just wasn&#39;t on there kindling that&#39;s
terrifying that is that is absolutely

907
01:03:03 --> 01:03:07
not in the spirit of purchasing
something that word becomes meaningless

908
01:03:07 --> 01:03:12
that you don&#39;t purchase digital media
rented and it&#39;s at their pleasure

909
01:03:12 --> 01:03:17
the reality is all physical media is
going all of it on a business standpoint

910
01:03:17 --> 01:03:22
it takes off it&#39;ll be good for us
because we won&#39;t have manufacturing we

911
01:03:22 --> 01:03:26
won&#39;t have to do all those extras and
the supplements and the interviews of

912
01:03:26 --> 01:03:32
the documentaries and the paper labeling
and shipping so you think about it it

913
01:03:32 --> 01:03:37
sounds like a great idea but then it
kind of goes against what i like and in

914
01:03:37 --> 01:03:41
on collecting with netflix with
torrenting it&#39;s hard to want to go into

915
01:03:41 --> 01:03:43
a video store like it&#39;s hard for me at
this point I don&#39;t really go to the

916
01:03:43 --> 01:03:44
video store questions I&#39;d like to
anymore

917
01:03:44 --> 01:03:50
this is where we keep most of our video
tapes sadly i had to the other day moved

918
01:03:50 --> 01:03:57
them all to make room for blu-ray
blu-ray DVD was a short lifespan blu-ray

919
01:03:57 --> 01:04:01
is going to be like gone before you know
it already stupid honestly the primary

920
01:04:01 --> 01:04:04
reason to keep something physical is
nostalgia will continue to put out

921
01:04:04 --> 01:04:09
physical media until the the plants
close my 18 19 year-old students who

922
01:04:09 --> 01:04:15
love film are passionate about film seem
to have no interest and having a video

923
01:04:15 --> 01:04:15
collection

924
01:04:15 --> 01:04:20
you can&#39;t begrudge this generation not
wanting to collect this because it&#39;s too

925
01:04:20 --> 01:04:24
accessible it seems to be splitting down
the middle to people that are going to

926
01:04:24 --> 01:04:30
go to the ends of the earth to keep the
old stuff the old ways and then it&#39;s the

927
01:04:30 --> 01:04:34
other side that they&#39;re just they don&#39;t
want anything anymore it&#39;s got to be

928
01:04:34 --> 01:04:35
non-physical media

929
01:04:35 --> 01:04:38
that they can keep on a hard drive or
just have to stream to him forget about

930
01:04:38 --> 01:04:43
it and then the other guys that are
going to build a shrine I have more than

931
01:04:43 --> 01:04:47
enough to keep me busy for 10,000
lifetimes for future generations

932
01:04:47 --> 01:04:51
I don&#39;t give a fuck about those people I
love dreaming of the technology i&#39;m

933
01:04:51 --> 01:04:55
gonna hang on my feet I&#39;m gonna hang on
my blu-rays just as much as I love

934
01:04:55 --> 01:05:01
itunes and spotify myself a record
player i like it before me go almost to

935
01:05:01 --> 01:05:07
remove two still working on a Nocti
sucky weather day we deliver the package

936
01:05:07 --> 01:05:13
Ngila week from the dorms get more
people stopped buying video as soon as

937
01:05:13 --> 01:05:17
the content was cheaper and even easier
to consume and then we found out that

938
01:05:17 --> 01:05:20
the masses don&#39;t care about bonus
features or optimum quality it&#39;s only

939
01:05:20 --> 01:05:23
the collector market that does netflix
instant is a really important step

940
01:05:23 --> 01:05:26
towards what the studio&#39;s want and I
think what you&#39;ll eventually do is

941
01:05:26 --> 01:05:29
you&#39;ll have a pipe that comes into your
house and you will subscribe to

942
01:05:29 --> 01:05:33
whichever libraries you want the MGM
library the Warner Brothers library the

943
01:05:33 --> 01:05:38
sony library that&#39;s where we&#39;re headed
we&#39;re headed towards no money on their

944
01:05:38 --> 01:05:40
end in terms of physical units

945
01:05:40 --> 01:05:44
I mean I imagine it&#39;s all going to be on
access and eventually and technically it

946
01:05:44 --> 01:05:50
already is but some people don&#39;t want to
admit it but soon uncle coreena you can

947
01:05:50 --> 01:05:56
open only gentleman that can I didn&#39;t
see the other not more height H the most

948
01:05:56 --> 01:05:59
of them or what joy and more grandma is
going on

949
01:05:59 --> 01:06:05
not so we don&#39;t we see the ball the was
the only time I don&#39;t contact the video

950
01:06:05 --> 01:06:11
on anymore David in that direction .
amanakara died if we&#39;re different book

951
01:06:11 --> 01:06:16
down vehicle condition no mikata that in
a production different effective

952
01:06:16 --> 01:06:17
connected

953
01:06:17 --> 01:06:21
we&#39;re talking about the HS but i only
have video tapes because that&#39;s the way

954
01:06:21 --> 01:06:26
that i can find that movie and if that
came out in a different manner like that

955
01:06:26 --> 01:06:30
that was available on a DVD or only on
blu-ray I&#39;d watch it

956
01:06:30 --> 01:06:34
I mean now that I&#39;m a film programmer
I&#39;m more aware there&#39;s films with a

957
01:06:34 --> 01:06:37
filmmaker doesn&#39;t have any other
materials so essentially until somebody

958
01:06:37 --> 01:06:43
finds a negative find a print the best
source in the world is of the HS which

959
01:06:43 --> 01:06:47
is a little scary video preservation is
the nightmare in the closet that no one

960
01:06:47 --> 01:06:50
is talking about everybody likes to talk
about film preservation martin

961
01:06:50 --> 01:06:54
scorsese&#39;s out there you know
proclaiming that the love of film and

962
01:06:54 --> 01:06:57
all this but in actual fact everybody
knows that in Chris&#39;s that closet he&#39;s

963
01:06:57 --> 01:07:01
got a lot of videos that are just a hot
mess i think that most people that

964
01:07:01 --> 01:07:05
really started collecting in the
eighties privacy at least two out of ten

965
01:07:05 --> 01:07:07
tapes begin now

966
01:07:07 --> 01:07:13
30 years on 20 years on to really not be
playable maybe that&#39;s one of the reasons

967
01:07:13 --> 01:07:17
that nostalgia for video is going to be
so incredibly poignant i think going

968
01:07:17 --> 01:07:22
forward is that we&#39;re going to have such
a great great statistic of Los it seems

969
01:07:22 --> 01:07:27
like with each iteration in home video
technology we lose a chunk of the

970
01:07:27 --> 01:07:29
library of amazing films that are out
there

971
01:07:29 --> 01:07:33
I don&#39;t understand how people can ignore
VHS because there&#39;s just such a huge

972
01:07:33 --> 01:07:36
huge percentage of movies that never
came out any other way so if you&#39;re even

973
01:07:36 --> 01:07:42
like a casual fan of movies at all you
should have a VCR you should be actively

974
01:07:42 --> 01:07:43
watching stuff on VHS

975
01:07:43 --> 01:07:45
there are hundreds and thousands of
thousands of

976
01:07:45 --> 01:07:48
movies never made the jump to de think
probably a lot of people would think

977
01:07:48 --> 01:07:51
that the fact that never jumped a DVD is
indicative that they were poor quality

978
01:07:51 --> 01:07:55
to begin with him no matter what genre
of film you&#39;re interested in you&#39;re

979
01:07:55 --> 01:07:59
going to find things that are only on
VHS within that realm of interest so if

980
01:07:59 --> 01:08:04
you like silent film there&#39;s gonna be
some obscure Russian short that&#39;s only

981
01:08:04 --> 01:08:08
on some tape on the back shelf of a
video store if you like a tease comedies

982
01:08:08 --> 01:08:13
there&#39;s gonna be hundreds and hundreds
of the most ridiculous boner jams that

983
01:08:13 --> 01:08:20
you can only watch on tape to select
what you love by its format cuts you off

984
01:08:20 --> 01:08:24
from something that you might enjoy more
than anything you&#39;ve ever seen in your

985
01:08:24 --> 01:08:28
entire life i think that stuff is the
stands outside of my objections

986
01:08:28 --> 01:08:33
that&#39;s that&#39;s very important that there
is a document of all those countless

987
01:08:33 --> 01:08:39
hours of rare stuff in any form
whatsoever even VHS when it struck us

988
01:08:39 --> 01:08:42
that other people could have fun
watching movies that were only on video

989
01:08:42 --> 01:08:46
we started video hate squad and we had
our first show and we got the whole

990
01:08:46 --> 01:08:49
audience there we have a VCR on the
stage so we always put the tape in the

991
01:08:49 --> 01:08:52
VCR in front of the audience they&#39;re all
part of that moment even better than

992
01:08:52 --> 01:08:55
that is that all over the world and
other people that did the same thing at

993
01:08:55 --> 01:08:58
the same time because this kind of
zeitgeist where people are realizing hey

994
01:08:58 --> 01:09:01
there&#39;s a lot of value in this stuff
that we&#39;ve been ignoring

995
01:09:01 --> 01:09:04
yeah

996
01:09:04 --> 01:09:08
I mean for example would be like deadly
credit but I was like everyone even do

997
01:09:08 --> 01:09:11
whatever came out it was it was meant to
be this fleeting thing let&#39;s just fill

998
01:09:11 --> 01:09:13
these stores with content we don&#39;t have
to worry about their theatrical releases

999
01:09:13 --> 01:09:23
are not what they didn&#39;t realize there
were so many works of art that&#39;s an

1000
01:09:23 --> 01:09:27
incredible incredible film and was later
VHS copies is not available on film or

1001
01:09:27 --> 01:09:31
DVD or anything there&#39;s no other format
we had Ted prior come and we had talked

1002
01:09:31 --> 01:09:34
with them and it was just incredible to
see this movie with a bunch of people

1003
01:09:34 --> 01:09:37
and just realized no one knows what&#39;s
gonna happen next this is completely

1004
01:09:37 --> 01:09:40
unpredictable

1005
01:09:40 --> 01:09:45
I knew that VHS collecting was kind of
becoming popular again the house of the

1006
01:09:45 --> 01:09:48
devil gotta get a lot of do that just
affected a new movie was released on VHS

1007
01:09:48 --> 01:09:51
it started making me think about a lot
of the films like this you know I had a

1008
01:09:51 --> 01:09:54
modest VHS collection but this kind of
kick started for me a lot

1009
01:09:54 --> 01:09:57
they&#39;re finally going ok well there&#39;s
people who have this kind of interest so

1010
01:09:57 --> 01:09:58
let&#39;s market to them as well

1011
01:09:58 --> 01:10:03
the revolution is still evolving I think
I mean you&#39;re making a documentary about

1012
01:10:03 --> 01:10:07
video tapes right now i think that
there&#39;s a huge VHS resurgence for

1013
01:10:07 --> 01:10:11
example mando putting out all these new
video tapes that are selling through

1014
01:10:11 --> 01:10:15
hundreds of copies in a two hour .
clearly there&#39;s still a market out there

1015
01:10:15 --> 01:10:18
for video tapes the boom that&#39;s going on
today with the tapes I really just don&#39;t

1016
01:10:18 --> 01:10:21
get it i&#39;m 14 i&#39;m seeing the state
prices 14 hundred dollars it makes me

1017
01:10:21 --> 01:10:25
regret getting rid of some of the stuff
that i had a one time you know to be put

1018
01:10:25 --> 01:10:30
my kids through college I don&#39;t when LPS
had a resurgence in the nineties what

1019
01:10:30 --> 01:10:33
was amazing about that is it didn&#39;t go
away like there&#39;s still stored that

1020
01:10:33 --> 01:10:39
really just exist to sell records but i
don&#39;t think that VHS is going to have

1021
01:10:39 --> 01:10:45
that same permanent resurgence you can
make arguments for you know the quality

1022
01:10:45 --> 01:10:50
of a vinyl and why that presents a
better experience of the music the VHS

1023
01:10:50 --> 01:10:54
it&#39;s never going to be a better
experience of the raw materials it&#39;s

1024
01:10:54 --> 01:10:55
just

1025
01:10:55 --> 01:11:00
the the qualities associated around so i
think that there&#39;s a nostalgic need to

1026
01:11:00 --> 01:11:05
sort of go back and also reevaluate it
was in 2006 when history of violence

1027
01:11:05 --> 01:11:08
came out of the HS and kind of marked
the end of everything that was the last

1028
01:11:08 --> 01:11:14
widely distributed film on VHS my friend
Zack called me and was like okay we&#39;re

1029
01:11:14 --> 01:11:17
thinking about getting some VHS tattoos
because they suggest they just stopped

1030
01:11:17 --> 01:11:21
making VHS and I&#39;ve never had a tattoo
before but it took me less than two

1031
01:11:21 --> 01:11:25
seconds to be like yep I&#39;m with you guys
I&#39;m getting that right there

1032
01:11:25 --> 01:11:28
we all got our is a little differently
like some got like never forget on it

1033
01:11:28 --> 01:11:31
some got like the year that it started
and ended I just want to just the video

1034
01:11:31 --> 01:11:36
like just like just don&#39;t its own just
like the cold the just a nice likes it

1035
01:11:36 --> 01:11:40
looks so strong and great and people ask
me all the time will be like what is

1036
01:11:40 --> 01:11:41
that on your arm

1037
01:11:41 --> 01:11:44
I&#39;ll just show it to them and they&#39;re
like now what he said I&#39;m Mikey you

1038
01:11:44 --> 01:11:48
forgot obviously when you find some of
these stores that have big box

1039
01:11:48 --> 01:11:53
videotapes you know they&#39;re going to be
meeting owners who have been surrounded

1040
01:11:53 --> 01:11:59
by these relics for so many years and
they are part of their life story and I

1041
01:11:59 --> 01:12:04
am slowly trying to drain them of and
like an archaeologist every once in a

1042
01:12:04 --> 01:12:07
while you&#39;d pull these tapes out at the
very bottom covered in dust i mean

1043
01:12:07 --> 01:12:11
literally your hands we just caked in
this dust you pull out a video that&#39;s

1044
01:12:11 --> 01:12:17
you know pure gold by see a flea market
swap me an antique store a goodwill it&#39;s

1045
01:12:17 --> 01:12:20
getting stopped and it&#39;s getting
pillaged that entails looking in the

1046
01:12:20 --> 01:12:23
phonebook looking on the internet
literally driving up and down every

1047
01:12:23 --> 01:12:28
single streak that I see I&#39;ve driven
probably a three-hour drive radius every

1048
01:12:28 --> 01:12:29
direction

1049
01:12:29 --> 01:12:32
yeah

1050
01:12:32 --> 01:12:35
yeah

1051
01:12:35 --> 01:12:41
and honestly I think that is what legacy
the VHS era is it&#39;s made us all much

1052
01:12:41 --> 01:12:47
more film savvy that gets its kind of
made people much more aware of other

1053
01:12:47 --> 01:12:51
movies beyond the ones that were fed by
the the richest companies home video

1054
01:12:51 --> 01:13:00
we&#39;re testin acara shock go enjoy your
day 90 day a home video crap anymore

1055
01:13:00 --> 01:13:06
quantity to you to your I see the
stakeholders given that home video not

1056
01:13:06 --> 01:13:11
back at the the fact that it made
accessible all these generations of

1057
01:13:11 --> 01:13:15
films which were utterly gone I mean
just no one could see them you know the

1058
01:13:15 --> 01:13:18
studio&#39;s kept in the vault sometimes
they get rid of the negative didn&#39;t

1059
01:13:18 --> 01:13:23
think it mattered anymore you know
homevideo restored all that for us you

1060
01:13:23 --> 01:13:27
know in and perhaps not always in the
greatest looking form and perhaps not

1061
01:13:27 --> 01:13:30
always the way we remembered it was
accessible i don&#39;t think there&#39;s any

1062
01:13:30 --> 01:13:34
lasting impact I think it&#39;s been just a
passing parade transits like what&#39;s the

1063
01:13:34 --> 01:13:38
lasting impact of radio right now

1064
01:13:38 --> 01:13:41
you know it got us to the next step the
next step in excellent

1065
01:13:41 --> 01:13:44
these are not just entertainment but
they&#39;re also memories and there are also

1066
01:13:44 --> 01:13:50
indications of what life was like and is
like and is possibly going to be like

1067
01:13:50 --> 01:13:56
again these movies by being in a way the
record of our dreams are away to look at

1068
01:13:56 --> 01:14:03
our culture and say that&#39;s why that
that&#39;s why that civilization ate itself

1069
01:14:03 --> 01:14:08
spectacularly that&#39;s why it all fell
apart or that&#39;s what it could have been

1070
01:14:08 --> 01:14:11
that&#39;s where the dream could have gone
when you look at the tape and it has the

1071
01:14:11 --> 01:14:15
be kind rewind sticker on it there&#39;s
something deeply moving about that it&#39;s

1072
01:14:15 --> 01:14:20
such a call to arms and a suggestion or
an imperative about a way to live your

1073
01:14:20 --> 01:14:26
life to be kind and rewind go back and
like hang on to these things that are

1074
01:14:26 --> 01:14:29
important to you and not let them
disappear and not let other people take

1075
01:14:29 --> 01:14:33
them away from you but find what&#39;s
important and preserve that and help too

1076
01:14:33 --> 01:14:34
yeah

1077
01:14:34 --> 01:14:37
yeah

1078
01:14:37 --> 01:14:40
gunshots

1079
01:14:40 --> 01:14:43
yeah

1080
01:14:43 --> 01:14:44
yeah

1081
01:14:44 --> 01:14:47

2
00:00:00 --> 00:00:02
Young people from all over the globe
are joining up

3
00:00:02 --> 00:00:05
to fight for the future.
I&#39;m doing my part.

4
00:00:05 --> 00:00:06
I&#39;m doing my part.
I&#39;m doing my part.

5
00:00:06 --> 00:00:12
I&#39;m doing my part too.
They&#39;re doing their part, are you?

6
00:00:12 --> 00:00:14
Join the Mobile Infantry and save the world.

7
00:00:14 --> 00:00:21
Service guarantees citizenship.

8
00:00:21 --> 00:00:24
The bugs send
another meteor our way,

9
00:00:24 --> 00:00:27
but this time we&#39;re ready. Planetary defences are better than ever.

10
00:00:27 --> 00:00:28
Klendathu, source of the bug meteor attacks,

11
00:00:28 --> 00:00:30
orbits a twin star system whose

12
00:00:30 --> 00:00:33
brutal gravitational forces
produce an unlimited supply

13
00:00:33 --> 00:00:34
of bug meteorites
in the form

14
00:00:34 --> 00:00:37
of this asteroid belt.
To ensure the safety

15
00:00:37 --> 00:00:38
of our solar system,

16
00:00:38 --> 00:00:43
Klendathu must be eliminated.
We break net now and take you live

17
00:00:43 --> 00:00:45
to Klendathu, where the invasion has begun.

18
00:00:45 --> 00:00:45
You&#39;re on.

19
00:00:45 --> 00:00:47
We&#39;ve just landed here on what cap troopers
Move, move, move!

20
00:00:47 --> 00:00:48
are calling Big K,
Come on! Move, move!

21
00:00:48 --> 00:00:50
with the 6th Mobile Infantry Division!
Come on!

22
00:00:50 --> 00:00:52
It&#39;s an ugly planet,
a bug planet!

23
00:00:52 --> 00:00:56
A planet hostile to life
as we know it!

24
00:00:56 --> 00:00:59
Help me!

25
00:00:59 --> 00:01:01
Come on! Go, go, go!

26
00:01:01 --> 00:01:03
Keep moving!
Get out of here now!

27
00:01:03 --> 00:01:04
Kitten, no!

28
00:01:04 --> 00:01:06
Oh, God!

29
00:01:06 --> 00:01:07
Oh, God!

30
00:01:07 --> 00:01:08
Rico.

31
00:01:08 --> 00:01:09
Rico.

32
00:01:09 --> 00:01:10
Rico!

33
00:01:10 --> 00:01:11
Pay attention.

34
00:01:11 --> 00:01:12
Sorry, Mr Rasczak.

35
00:01:12 --> 00:01:12
Let&#39;s sum up.

36
00:01:12 --> 00:01:14
This year we explored the failure of democracy,

37
00:01:14 --> 00:01:14
(Bad boy)

38
00:01:14 --> 00:01:16
how the social scientists brought
to the brink of chaos.

39
00:01:16 --> 00:01:17
We talked about the veterans,

40
00:01:17 --> 00:01:19
how they took control
and imposed the stability

41
00:01:19 --> 00:01:22
that has lasted for generations since.
You know these facts,

42
00:01:22 --> 00:01:25
but have I taught you anything
of value this year?

43
00:01:25 --> 00:01:27
Hmm?
You. Why are only citizens

44
00:01:27 --> 00:01:29
allowed to vote?
It&#39;s a reward,

45
00:01:29 --> 00:01:32
what the Federation gives you
for doing Federal Service.

46
00:01:32 --> 00:01:35
No. No.
Something given

47
00:01:35 --> 00:01:38
has no value.
Look, when you vote, you are

48
00:01:38 --> 00:01:42
exercising political authority.
You&#39;re using force. And force,

49
00:01:42 --> 00:01:45
my friends, is violence,
the supreme authority from which

50
00:01:45 --> 00:01:49
all other authority is derived.
Uh, my mother always said

51
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
violence never solves anything.
Really?

52
00:01:51 --> 00:01:54
I wonder what the city fathers
of Hiroshima would say about that.

53
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
You.
They probably wouldn&#39;t say anything.

54
00:01:57 --> 00:02:00
Hiroshima was destroyed.
Correct.

55
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
Naked force has resolved
more issues

56
00:02:02 --> 00:02:03
throughout history
than any other factor.

57
00:02:03 --> 00:02:07
The contrary opinion, that
violence never solves anything,

58
00:02:07 --> 00:02:08
is wishful thinking
at its worst.

59
00:02:08 --> 00:02:10
People who forget that
always pay.

60
00:02:10 --> 00:02:14
Rico, what&#39;s the moral
difference, if any,

61
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
between a civilian
and a citizen?

62
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
A citizen accepts personal
responsibility for the safety

63
00:02:18 --> 00:02:20
of the body politic,
defending it with his life.

64
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
A civilian does not.
The exact words of the text.

65
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
But do you understand it?
Do you believe it?

66
00:02:26 --> 00:02:30
I don&#39;t know.
Of course you don&#39;t.

67
00:02:30 --> 00:02:32
I doubt anyone here would
recognize civic virtue

68
00:02:32 --> 00:02:34
if it reached up
and bit you in the ass.

69
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
Not here.
Come on, let&#39;s see if they

70
00:02:36 --> 00:02:38
posted the math final.
Rico, we gonna take Tesla?

71
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
We&#39;re gonna kill &#39;em.

72
00:02:40 --> 00:02:44
First thing Fleet Academy looks at is your math scores.
Wish me luck.

73
00:02:44 --> 00:02:45
Good job.

74
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
Your turn.
Hold on.

75
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
I want to talk to Marco.
His sister&#39;s at Fleet.

76
00:02:49 --> 00:02:50
Marco.
Hi, Carmen.

77
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
What do you hear about Roxy?
She made pilot.

78
00:02:53 --> 00:02:54
She did?
Oh, yeah.

79
00:02:54 --> 00:02:57
35%.
Very nice.

80
00:02:57 --> 00:02:59
Look at that.

81
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
35%, ladies and gentlemen.

82
00:03:01 --> 00:03:02
Big numbers.
Carl!

83
00:03:02 --> 00:03:03
Sorry.

84
00:03:03 --> 00:03:04
So, you haven&#39;t done it yet, have you?

85
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
Don&#39;t lie.
I&#39;m not in any hurry.

86
00:03:06 --> 00:03:07
Others are waiting.
And?

87
00:03:07 --> 00:03:09
Did you read her mind?
Don&#39;t have to.

88
00:03:09 --> 00:03:10
It&#39;s pretty clear what she wants.

89
00:03:10 --> 00:03:14
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Aw, you got it bad.

90
00:03:14 --> 00:03:16
Bye, Marco.
Hey, don&#39;t forget about this afternoon.

91
00:03:16 --> 00:03:18
He&#39;s always late when he walks you home to fish for a kiss.

92
00:03:18 --> 00:03:19
Get out of here.

93
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
- Marco&#39;s sister made pilot.
- So will you.

94
00:03:21 --> 00:03:24
I mean, imagine flying a half
a million tons of starship.

95
00:03:24 --> 00:03:25
You gotta have
nerves of steel.

96
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
Yeah, you do. Let&#39;s see
how yours hold up.

97
00:03:27 --> 00:03:28
You may begin.

98
00:03:28 --> 00:03:30
Aw, come on, it&#39;s just a bug. You better put your goggles on.

99
00:03:30 --> 00:03:31
&quot;Just a bug.&quot;

100
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
We humans like to think we are
nature&#39;s finest achievement.

101
00:03:34 --> 00:03:36
I&#39;m afraid
it just isn&#39;t true.

102
00:03:36 --> 00:03:41
This Arkellian sand beetle
is superior in many ways.

103
00:03:41 --> 00:03:45
It reproduces in vast
numbers, has no ego...

104
00:03:45 --> 00:03:49
has no fear, doesn&#39;t
now about death...

105
00:03:49 --> 00:03:52
and so is the perfect
selfless member of society.

106
00:03:52 --> 00:03:54
But humans have created
art, mathematics...

107
00:03:54 --> 00:03:57
and interstellar travel.
True. But before you

108
00:03:57 --> 00:04:00
let that go to your head,
take the example of the Arachnids.

109
00:04:00 --> 00:04:02
A highly evolved insect society.

110
00:04:02 --> 00:04:04
By human standards, they are relatively stupid.

111
00:04:04 --> 00:04:05
But their evolution stretches

112
00:04:05 --> 00:04:07
over millions of years.
And now...

113
00:04:07 --> 00:04:09
Here, take this.
they can

114
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
colonize planets...
by hurling their spore

115
00:04:12 --> 00:04:15
into space.
Okay, I think we got it.

116
00:04:15 --> 00:04:17
That&#39;s the heart.

117
00:04:17 --> 00:04:18
And here&#39;s the stomach.

118
00:04:18 --> 00:04:20
Nerves of steel, huh?

119
00:04:20 --> 00:04:21
Don&#39;t think about it.

120
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
Just go on instinct.
Try to visualize it.

121
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
I see the ace of spades.

122
00:04:25 --> 00:04:29
You know, statistically speaking, you should have accidentally guessed right by now.

123
00:04:29 --> 00:04:30
Try another.

124
00:04:30 --> 00:04:33
So my psychic abilities
are zero and I&#39;m unlucky.

125
00:04:33 --> 00:04:36
No, luck&#39;s not a factor.
No one really knows why some people

126
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
are sensitive and some aren&#39;t.
Who knows? Maybe it&#39;s a new

127
00:04:38 --> 00:04:40
stage of human evolution.
That&#39;s why they do these

128
00:04:40 --> 00:04:43
kind of Federal studies.
What.. Cyrano??

129
00:04:43 --> 00:04:46
Oh, shit. Time out.
Oh, he just wants some attention.

130
00:04:46 --> 00:04:47
You don&#39;t play with him any more.

131
00:04:47 --> 00:04:48
Cyrano.

132
00:04:48 --> 00:04:50
Go bug Mom, Cyrano.

133
00:04:50 --> 00:04:51
How do you make him do that?

134
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
Oh, I gave him the impression
there&#39;s a grub crawling up my mom&#39;s leg.

135
00:04:54 --> 00:04:55
He&#39;s on a mission
to go eat it.

136
00:04:55 --> 00:05:00
Ow! Oh! Get out!
Get off my leg! Oh! Carl!

137
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02
I sure hope you don&#39;t do
anything like that to me.

138
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
Don&#39;t be afraid.
Can&#39;t do human.

139
00:05:05 --> 00:05:07
Yet.

140
00:05:07 --> 00:05:08
Yeah!

141
00:05:08 --> 00:05:09
All right!

142
00:05:09 --> 00:05:13
Yeah! Yeah!
Touchdown Tigers.

143
00:05:13 --> 00:05:15
And the score
is now 41 - 38.

144
00:05:15 --> 00:05:16
Tigers lead with 2:46 remaining

145
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
here at the Buenos Aires Sports Arena.

146
00:05:18 --> 00:05:19
Time out Giants.

147
00:05:19 --> 00:05:21
Are you all right?

148
00:05:21 --> 00:05:23
Much better.

149
00:05:23 --> 00:05:24
Now.

150
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
Good. Yeah!
All right! Way to go, team!

151
00:05:26 --> 00:05:27
Hey! Your helmet.

152
00:05:27 --> 00:05:31
So, what are you doing after the game?

153
00:05:31 --> 00:05:34
Well, everyone&#39;s going to the dance, aren&#39;t you?

154
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s my last night as a civilian.

155
00:05:36 --> 00:05:38
Come on, number 12! Let&#39;s go!
Ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.

156
00:05:38 --> 00:05:40
You&#39;re going to the Fleet Academy?
Uh-huh.

157
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
That&#39;s where I wanna go!
Come on, number 12! Let&#39;s play ball!

158
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
Don&#39;t get any ideas about my girlfriend!

159
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
All is fair in love and war.

160
00:05:47 --> 00:05:50
Giants! Giants!
Johnny! Yeah!

161
00:05:50 --> 00:05:52
Hut! Hut!

162
00:05:52 --> 00:05:57
Hey, yeah!
Giants leading 43 - 41. Just over 42 seconds remaining.

163
00:05:57 --> 00:05:58
Yeah!
All right, let&#39;s go.

164
00:05:58 --> 00:05:59
All right, let&#39;s go.
Irvin, Lathom, cover the rush.

165
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
Perry, fake left.
Bertolli, you go long.

166
00:06:01 --> 00:06:03
Rico, flip six three hole.
Got it?

167
00:06:03 --> 00:06:05
Hey, Rico.

168
00:06:05 --> 00:06:05
HEY!

169
00:06:05 --> 00:06:06
WHAT!

170
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
You&#39;re Drifting! Flips six three hole on one! Got It?

171
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
Just throw me the ball, Diz.

172
00:06:11 --> 00:06:13
Ready? Break!
Break!

173
00:06:13 --> 00:06:18
Down. Set. Tight left.
Screen! Hut!

174
00:06:18 --> 00:06:20
Yeah! Go, go, go!

175
00:06:20 --> 00:06:21
All right!

176
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
Yeah!

177
00:06:23 --> 00:06:25
He&#39;s in there. It&#39;s over.

178
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
Who said you could grow up so fast?

179
00:06:27 --> 00:06:29
Mom, don&#39;t get mushy.

180
00:06:29 --> 00:06:32
This came for you today. I presume at your request.

181
00:06:32 --> 00:06:34
A lot of my friends are doing federal service.

182
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
Well, you&#39;re not thinking of applying?

183
00:06:36 --> 00:06:38
Have you lost your mind?

184
00:06:38 --> 00:06:41
I&#39;d rather take ten lashes in Public
Square than see you ruin your life.

185
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
It&#39;s a term of service.
It&#39;s not a career.

186
00:06:44 --> 00:06:48
I just want to get out on my own,
see the galaxy for a couple years.

187
00:06:48 --> 00:06:50
Johnny, people get killed
in the Federal Service.

188
00:06:50 --> 00:06:52
Who gave you this idea?
It&#39;s that teacher, isn&#39;t it?

189
00:06:52 --> 00:06:56
What&#39;s his name? You know
the one I&#39;m talking about.

190
00:06:56 --> 00:07:00
Mr Rasczak.
Rasczak?

191
00:07:00 --> 00:07:05
Silly name. There should be a law against
using a school as a recruiting station.

192
00:07:05 --> 00:07:07
No, Rasczak doesn&#39;t do that
at all.

193
00:07:07 --> 00:07:11
He sort of discourages you.
Well, that&#39;s good.

194
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
&#39;Cause you&#39;re going to Harvard,
and that&#39;s the end of it.

195
00:07:14 --> 00:07:16
It&#39;s my decision,
not yours.

196
00:07:16 --> 00:07:20
Oh, is that how it is, huh?
Wait, you two.

197
00:07:20 --> 00:07:23
Uh, Dad and I have a surprise
for you that will settle this.

198
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
Can you guess what it is?
No.

199
00:07:26 --> 00:07:30
You wanted to see the galaxy?
How about a trip to the Outer Rings?

200
00:07:30 --> 00:07:32
Zegema Beach. Huh?

201
00:07:32 --> 00:07:34
I&#39;ve always wanted
to go there.

202
00:07:34 --> 00:07:36
Good, good.
Then it&#39;s all settled.

203
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
Sure. Don&#39;t go away.
I&#39;m just gonna go see Mr Rasczak.

204
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
Hey, Rico, do you want to dance?

205
00:07:41 --> 00:07:43
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen

206
00:07:43 --> 00:07:45
Aw, come on. Too bad for her if she&#39;s not around.

207
00:07:45 --> 00:07:49
You know, it&#39;s sad.After tonight, most of us probably won&#39;t see each other again.

208
00:07:49 --> 00:07:56
So, you still gonna play for Rio?
Yeah, looks like. Unless Tokyo lets me start.

209
00:07:56 --> 00:07:58
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.

210
00:07:58 --> 00:08:00
Johnny, how come we never got together?

211
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
Can&#39;t we just be friends, Diz?

212
00:08:02 --> 00:08:09
Sure.
Thank you. Good night.

213
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
Look, Diz, I want to talk
to Mr Rasczak.

214
00:08:12 --> 00:08:14
Well, you better hurry up
if you want to catch him.

215
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
You&#39;re the best.

216
00:08:16 --> 00:08:18
Mr Rasczak!
What is it, Rico?

217
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
I want to thank you.

218
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
Your class was the best one
I had this year.

219
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
Well, it&#39;s really not my job to please.
I just hope you learned something.

220
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
Well, I want to join up.
I think I got what it takes to be a citizen.

221
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
Good for you. Go find out.

222
00:08:30 --> 00:08:33
Well, my parents are against it.
And I know it&#39;s my choice.

223
00:08:33 --> 00:08:36
I was wondering
what would you do if you were me?

224
00:08:36 --> 00:08:40
Figuring things out for yourself,
is the only freedom anyone really has.

225
00:08:40 --> 00:08:43
Use that freedom. Make up your own mind, Rico.

226
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
I&#39;m serious. I think you have
really beautiful eyes.

227
00:08:46 --> 00:08:47
Johnny.

228
00:08:47 --> 00:08:50
This is Zander.
Yeah, we know each other from the game.

229
00:08:50 --> 00:08:52
No hard feelings?

230
00:08:52 --> 00:08:55
No, none at all. We won.
Come on, Carmen.

231
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
It&#39;s the last dance.

232
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
Well, maybe I&#39;ll see you at the Academy.

233
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
Yeah. Who knows?

234
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
Good luck.

235
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
Zander&#39;s going for pilot too.

236
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
You two have
so much in common.

237
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
Johnny Rico,
are you jealous?

238
00:09:09 --> 00:09:11
Well, maybe.

239
00:09:11 --> 00:09:13
You don&#39;t have to be jealous.

240
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
Hey, hey, break it up, you two.
There&#39;s a place for that sort of thing.

241
00:09:16 --> 00:09:18
I&#39;ve been thinking, and I&#39;m gonna do it, Carmen.

242
00:09:18 --> 00:09:22
I&#39;m gonna go for Federal Service.
That&#39;s great.

243
00:09:22 --> 00:09:24
Carl and I are signing up
tomorrow. Come with us.

244
00:09:24 --> 00:09:26
I will.

245
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
My father&#39;s not home tonight.

246
00:09:29 --> 00:09:35
I do now, of my own free will,
after having been duly advised and warned,

247
00:09:35 --> 00:09:42
of the meaning and consequences
of this oath...

248
00:09:42 --> 00:09:54
enrol in the Federal Service...
for not less than two years...

249
00:09:54 --> 00:10:03
and as much longer
as may be required...

250
00:10:03 --> 00:10:08
by the needs
of the Federation.

251
00:10:08 --> 00:10:15
- All set?
- Thank you.

252
00:10:15 --> 00:10:30
Fresh meat
for the grinder, eh?

253
00:10:30 --> 00:10:40
- So, how&#39;d you kids do?
- I&#39;m gonna be a pilot.

254
00:10:40 --> 00:10:48
Well, good for you. We need
all the pilots we can get.

255
00:10:48 --> 00:10:57
- Hey, did you get starside R and D?
- No.

256
00:10:57 --> 00:11:04
- I don&#39;t believe it.
- I got Games and Theory.

257
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
Games and Theory?
- That&#39;s military intelligence.

258
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
- Yeah.
Way to go, Carl.

259
00:11:09 --> 00:11:15
Next time we meet,
I&#39;ll probably have to salute you.

260
00:11:15 --> 00:11:20
Hmm.
How about you, son?

261
00:11:20 --> 00:11:25
- Infantry, sir.
- Good for you.

262
00:11:25 --> 00:11:31
Mobile Infantry made me
the man I am today.

263
00:11:31 --> 00:11:35
All recruits must report to the
Federal Transportation Hub...

264
00:11:35 --> 00:11:42
within 2 4 hours.
Welcome to the adventure

265
00:11:42 --> 00:11:47
of Federal Service.
Let&#39;s make a vow.

266
00:11:47 --> 00:11:50
No matter what,
we&#39;ll always be friends.

267
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
I&#39;ll go for that.
Well, chances are we&#39;ll

268
00:11:53 --> 00:12:04
never see each other again.
We&#39;ll be millions of light-years

269
00:12:04 --> 00:12:13
away from each other.
But, uh, yeah, sure.

270
00:12:13 --> 00:12:19
Why not?
You&#39;ll resign, and that&#39;s

271
00:12:19 --> 00:12:23
all there is to it.
It may look bad, but if that&#39;s

272
00:12:23 --> 00:12:30
the worst you suffer, then that&#39;s fine.
- I won&#39;t quit!

273
00:12:30 --> 00:12:38
- I&#39;m telling you, you will.
You&#39;re not going back.

274
00:12:38 --> 00:12:46
You&#39;re going on vacation!
I am not going

275
00:12:46 --> 00:12:52
on vacation!
I want to be a citizen.

276
00:12:52 --> 00:12:53
It&#39;s my decision.
I made it.

277
00:12:53 --> 00:13:02
You walk out that door,
you are cut off, young man.

278
00:13:02 --> 00:13:08
You understand me?
All right, that&#39;s it!

279
00:13:08 --> 00:13:15
You are cut off!
Johnny, why won&#39;t you

280
00:13:15 --> 00:13:19
change your mind?
Does citizenship

281
00:13:19 --> 00:13:26
mean that much to you?
Well, yeah, sure.

282
00:13:26 --> 00:13:32
Well, I hope so.
I hope you don&#39;t ruin your life

283
00:13:32 --> 00:13:36
over some silly little girl...
who wants to look handsome

284
00:13:36 --> 00:13:40
in a uniform.
- Don&#39;t talk about Carmen that way!

285
00:13:40 --> 00:13:41
-Johnny.
Your attention, please.

286
00:13:41 --> 00:13:49
Outbound group 1380,
all hub 29 connections.

287
00:13:49 --> 00:13:50
- Do you have everything?
- Moscow now boarding...

288
00:13:50 --> 00:13:51
- Great.
- at bank 8-A.

289
00:13:51 --> 00:13:55
-Johnny.
- Be a good girl, hear?

290
00:13:55 --> 00:14:07
- You&#39;re late.
- My dad had to help me pack.

291
00:14:07 --> 00:14:21
Suddenly he&#39;s afraid he&#39;s never
gonna see me again or something.

292
00:14:21 --> 00:14:30
It was sweet,
but it took forever.

293
00:14:30 --> 00:14:42
Oh. Anyway, I guess
I&#39;m ready to go.

294
00:14:42 --> 00:15:46
Yeah, me too. I&#39;m wearing
everything I own.

295
00:15:46 --> 00:16:42
I&#39;m sorry your parents
were mad.

296
00:16:42 --> 00:17:07
Who cares? The Federation
will give me...

297
00:17:07 --> 00:17:22
everything I need for
the next two years, right?

298
00:17:22 --> 00:17:28
- You talk to Carl?
- Yeah, he left this morning.

299
00:17:28 --> 00:17:34
- Couldn&#39;t say where.
- Oh, it&#39;s exciting, going away.

300
00:17:34 --> 00:17:38
But I&#39;m scared.
Aren&#39;t you?

301
00:17:38 --> 00:17:47
I&#39;m gonna miss you.
I&#39;m gonna miss you too.

302
00:17:47 --> 00:18:02
I love you.
Outbound group 94B

303
00:18:02 --> 00:18:12
to Tereshkova--
That&#39;s me.

304
00:18:12 --> 00:18:34
Just say it once.
Try it on for size.

305
00:18:34 --> 00:18:51
I love you.
Don&#39;t forget to write.

306
00:18:51 --> 00:19:03
I won&#39;t.
Fully automatic Morita.

307
00:19:03 --> 00:19:28
Who wants to hold it?
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!

308
00:19:28 --> 00:19:45
Citizen rule. People
making a better tomorrow.

309
00:19:45 --> 00:20:01
A murderer was captured
this morning and tried today.

310
00:20:01 --> 00:20:07
Guilty.
Sentence.: death.

311
00:20:07 --> 00:20:23
Execution tonight at 6.:00.
All net. All channels.

312
00:20:23 --> 00:20:39
If you think you&#39;re psychic,
maybe you are.

313
00:20:39 --> 00:20:55
Federal studies are being
conducted in your community.

314
00:20:55 --> 00:21:11
Every school kid knows
that Arachnids are dangerous.

315
00:21:11 --> 00:21:23
However, Mormon extremists
disregarded Federal warnings...

316
00:21:23 --> 00:21:36
and established Fort Joe Smith deep
inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.

317
00:21:36 --> 00:21:50
Too late, they realized that Dantana had
already been chosen by other colonists.:

318
00:21:50 --> 00:21:55
Arachnids.
- One, two, three, four!

319
00:21:55 --> 00:22:00
- Ten-hut!
- One, two, three, four!

320
00:22:00 --> 00:22:08
- Most of you will not...
live to be

321
00:22:08 --> 00:22:15
in the Mobile Infantry.
The trouble is, you are not

322
00:22:15 --> 00:22:32
good enough the way you are.
Hands at your side!

323
00:22:32 --> 00:22:49
Chin up.
I am your senior drill instructor,

324
00:22:49 --> 00:23:13
Career Sergeant Zim!
Suck in that gut!

325
00:23:13 --> 00:23:22
Feet together!
To think this had

326
00:23:22 --> 00:23:28
to happen to me.
What a bunch of apes.

327
00:23:28 --> 00:23:34
No, strike that!
You don&#39;t rate that good.

328
00:23:34 --> 00:23:40
Never in my life
have I seen--

329
00:23:40 --> 00:23:45
Do you think I&#39;m funny?
Do I make you laugh?

330
00:23:45 --> 00:23:54
- Do you think I&#39;m a comedian, son?
- I&#39;m sorry.

331
00:23:54 --> 00:24:04
The first words and the last words out
of your stinking holes will be &quot;Sir&quot;!

332
00:24:04 --> 00:24:19
- Do you get me?
- Sir, yes, sir!

333
00:24:19 --> 00:24:38
You see that armoury?
Run around it.

334
00:24:38 --> 00:24:44
Run, I said!
Run, run, run!

335
00:24:44 --> 00:24:48
- Bronski, keep pace!
- Move! Move!

336
00:24:48 --> 00:24:55
Now, anytime you think
I&#39;m being too tough...

337
00:24:55 --> 00:25:00
anytime you think
I&#39;m being unfair...

338
00:25:00 --> 00:25:05
anytime you miss
your mommy, quit!

339
00:25:05 --> 00:25:08
You sign form 1240-A,
you grab your gear...

340
00:25:08 --> 00:25:11
you take a stroll
down Washout Lane!

341
00:25:11 --> 00:25:15
Do you get me?
- Sir, yes, sir!

342
00:25:15 --> 00:25:25
- Pathetic!
I wonder if there&#39;s a handful of

343
00:25:25 --> 00:25:44
guts in the whole bunch of you.
Now, who here thinks they got

344
00:25:44 --> 00:25:59
what it takes to knock me down?
Sir! I guess

345
00:25:59 --> 00:26:09
maybe I do, sir!
Ow! God! God!

346
00:26:09 --> 00:26:19
- You all right, son?
- Sir, yes, sir!

347
00:26:19 --> 00:26:31
It&#39;s my arm.
I think it&#39;s broken, sir.

348
00:26:31 --> 00:26:34
- Medic!
- God.

349
00:26:34 --> 00:26:44
Pain is in your mind!
- Who&#39;s next?

350
00:26:44 --> 00:26:58
- Sir!
Recruit Flores reporting

351
00:26:58 --> 00:27:48
for duty, sir!
You specifically requested transfer from

352
00:27:48 --> 00:28:10
Fort Cronkite to this training unit?
Sir, I heard

353
00:28:10 --> 00:28:20
it was the best, sir!
It is the best.

354
00:28:20 --> 00:28:25
But what makes you think
you&#39;re good enough?

355
00:28:25 --> 00:28:35
Now that&#39;s the kind of gal
who makes squad leader.

356
00:28:35 --> 00:28:41
That&#39;s my job
you&#39;re talking about.

357
00:28:41 --> 00:28:46
Come on.
- Here we go!

358
00:28:46 --> 00:28:50
- Here we go!
- Roughnecks!

359
00:28:50 --> 00:28:54
- Roughnecks!
- On the go!

360
00:28:54 --> 00:29:01
- On the go!
One, two, three, four...

361
00:29:01 --> 00:29:07
one, two, MI!
You know, I&#39;d like

362
00:29:07 --> 00:29:18
to kill that Sergeant Zim.
- Whoa, improper attitude!

363
00:29:18 --> 00:29:25
- Watch it.
- They&#39;ll kick you out

364
00:29:25 --> 00:29:32
for talking like that.
- Bye-bye.

365
00:29:32 --> 00:29:34
There you go
down Washout Lane.

366
00:29:34 --> 00:29:37
Yup, you either got what
it takes, or you don&#39;t.

367
00:29:37 --> 00:30:06
- Hey, there is a line.
- Wait your turn, Ace.

368
00:30:06 --> 00:30:42
Hey, at ease, little soldier.
It&#39;s all the same muck.

369
00:30:42 --> 00:30:47
Get in line
like everyone else.

370
00:30:47 --> 00:30:54
You got some guts
for a rich kid.

371
00:30:54 --> 00:31:15
I guess you and me could be
buddies. What do

372
00:31:15 --> 00:31:22
you say?
Oh-oh, that is

373
00:31:22 --> 00:31:26
no way to act.
- I&#39;m honoured.

374
00:31:26 --> 00:31:28
- Hey! Of course you are.
Everybody should have

375
00:31:28 --> 00:31:31
a friend like me.
Come on, Ace. Back of the line

376
00:31:31 --> 00:31:37
now! Back of the line!
- Back, back, back, back!

377
00:31:37 --> 00:31:46
- All right. Hurry up, hurry up.
- What a jerk, man.

378
00:31:46 --> 00:31:50
- Tough guy.
Hey, Rico, want

379
00:31:50 --> 00:31:53
to sit together?
No thanks, Diz.

380
00:31:53 --> 00:31:57
What&#39;s your malfunction, Rico?
You are.

381
00:31:57 --> 00:32:03
I joined up to get out on my own,
and you had to tag along.

382
00:32:03 --> 00:32:06
You think I joined the Mobile
Infantry because of you?

383
00:32:06 --> 00:32:09
You saying you didn&#39;t?
Hi.

384
00:32:09 --> 00:32:14
Forget about it, Ace.
You don&#39;t stand a chance.

385
00:32:14 --> 00:32:27
What makes you even think you&#39;re
gonna make squad leader, Rico?

386
00:32:27 --> 00:32:44
- Something I got, you don&#39;t.
- Ha!

387
00:32:44 --> 00:33:11
-You rich kids are all the same.
-It isn&#39;t about that.

388
00:33:11 --> 00:33:25
- It&#39;s about who&#39;s the best.
- Hey!

389
00:33:25 --> 00:33:46
Third squad!
If someone&#39;s hurt, put him on your back

390
00:33:46 --> 00:33:52
and take him out of there!
Let&#39;s go!

391
00:33:52 --> 00:33:57
Go, Simmons!
Go, go, you sissy!

392
00:33:57 --> 00:34:03
Sir, I don&#39;t understand.
Who needs a knife

393
00:34:03 --> 00:34:08
in a nuke fight, anyway?
All you gotta do

394
00:34:08 --> 00:34:15
is push a button, sir.
Cease fire. Put your hand

395
00:34:15 --> 00:34:22
on that wall, trooper.
Put your hand on that wall!

396
00:34:22 --> 00:34:31
Damn it.
The enemy cannot push a button

397
00:34:31 --> 00:34:37
if you disable his hand.
Medic!

398
00:34:37 --> 00:34:41
Hand me that towel, will you?
Ah, well, we all have

399
00:34:41 --> 00:34:45
one thing in common.
We were all stupid enough

400
00:34:45 --> 00:34:45
to sign up for Mobile Infantry.
- Breckinridge, what&#39;s your excuse?

401
00:34:45 --> 00:34:47
- Oh, my family&#39;s all farmers.
I hate farming. I mean,

402
00:34:47 --> 00:34:48
uh, Mobile Infantry--
It&#39;s like pure picnic

403
00:34:48 --> 00:34:51
by comparison.
All right, so they grow &#39;em big and dumb

404
00:34:51 --> 00:34:56
on the farm planet, huh?
- And pretty!

405
00:34:56 --> 00:35:02
- I like big!
- Djana&#39;D, what about you?

406
00:35:02 --> 00:35:13
- Oh, I&#39;m going in for politics...
and, you know, you gotta be

407
00:35:13 --> 00:35:20
a citizen for that.
- So here I am.

408
00:35:20 --> 00:35:30
- Ah, you want some responsibility.
- Yeah.

409
00:35:30 --> 00:35:41
- Shujimi, come on, let&#39;s keep it goin&#39;.
I got into Harvard,

410
00:35:41 --> 00:35:46
but my father says forget it.
It&#39;s gonna cost an arm

411
00:35:46 --> 00:35:51
and a leg, you know?
So, if I serve,

412
00:35:51 --> 00:35:57
Federation pays my way.
I want to have babies.

413
00:35:57 --> 00:36:04
You know, it&#39;s a lot easier to
get a licence if you&#39;ve served.

414
00:36:04 --> 00:36:06
- So--
- I&#39;m going career.

415
00:36:06 --> 00:36:09
- Officer&#39;s training. All the way.
- Ah!

416
00:36:09 --> 00:36:12
Future Sky Marshal.
All right, Rico, your turn.

417
00:36:12 --> 00:36:18
Who asked you to be so nosy?
What? I&#39;m the-the bad guy?

418
00:36:18 --> 00:36:23
I&#39;m gonna be a writer, you know?
A writer&#39;s got

419
00:36:23 --> 00:36:27
a right to be nosy.
Hey, Flores, you know

420
00:36:27 --> 00:36:31
Rico from Buenos Aires.
- What&#39;s his story?

421
00:36:31 --> 00:36:33
- Oh, uh,
he&#39;s here

422
00:36:33 --> 00:36:38
because of a girl.
Oh, Rico! Lover boy!

423
00:36:38 --> 00:36:42
- He&#39;s getting me excited.
- He&#39;s gonna blow.

424
00:36:42 --> 00:36:47
Is it you?
This is where we live.

425
00:36:47 --> 00:36:54
It&#39;s not much, but it&#39;s home.
Right there, that&#39;s my bunk,

426
00:36:54 --> 00:36:57
where I dream about you every night.
Boot&#39;s pretty tough.

427
00:36:57 --> 00:37:00
Sometimes I think I won&#39;t make it.
But then I think about what

428
00:37:00 --> 00:37:03
you&#39;re doing, and I try harder.
- Hey, guys! Do you mind?

429
00:37:03 --> 00:37:05
- Try harder, baby, try harder!
Who knows? They might even

430
00:37:05 --> 00:37:06
make me squad leader.
Uh-oh,

431
00:37:06 --> 00:37:08
I better pack it in.
Oh, I love you, baby,

432
00:37:08 --> 00:37:09
I love you!
- Write me!

433
00:37:09 --> 00:37:12
- I love you so much
- I&#39;m gonna kill you guys!

434
00:37:12 --> 00:37:14
- I love you so much
- Bye! Write me.

435
00:37:14 --> 00:37:15
- Bye!
Orbit in five, Ibanez.

436
00:37:15 --> 00:37:17
First one there
gets to fly.

437
00:37:17 --> 00:37:18
- Locking it down.
- Wait! Wait!

438
00:37:18 --> 00:37:20
Oh, no. Not Ibanez again.
She&#39;s crazy!

439
00:37:20 --> 00:37:21
Ready, go!
Yeah!

440
00:37:21 --> 00:37:22
Deploying wings.
How come you&#39;re

441
00:37:22 --> 00:37:26
in such a good mood, huh?
&#39;Cause today

442
00:37:26 --> 00:37:36
I get to fly that.
Pilot Trainee Ibanez

443
00:37:36 --> 00:37:52
reporting for duty, ma&#39;am.
Take the number two chair,

444
00:37:52 --> 00:37:57
Ibanez.
- Yes, ma&#39;am.

445
00:37:57 --> 00:37:58
- You see that?
- Identify.

446
00:37:58 --> 00:38:02
- Ibanez, T-3 25-A, clear.
What are you doing here?

447
00:38:02 --> 00:38:11
I&#39;m the guy whose gonna
teach you to fly this crate.

448
00:38:11 --> 00:38:18
Oh, Assistant Instructor.
Should I call you &quot;sir&quot;?

449
00:38:18 --> 00:38:26
- Only when I give you an order.
- Prepare for departure.

450
00:38:26 --> 00:38:32
It&#39;s amazing, us running
into each other like this.

451
00:38:32 --> 00:38:35
- Maybe it&#39;s fate.
- Maybe not.

452
00:38:35 --> 00:38:41
Heard about this crazy girl
coming through the Academy.

453
00:38:41 --> 00:38:45
Solid math, a little wild
on the stick, but a natural.

454
00:38:45 --> 00:38:49
And when it turned out
to be you,

455
00:38:49 --> 00:38:54
I just made sure that we
would run into each other.

456
00:38:54 --> 00:38:57
Rodger Young cleared for
undocking and departure.

457
00:38:57 --> 00:39:00
All right, Ibanez.
- Take her out.

458
00:39:00 --> 00:39:02
- Yes, ma&#39;am.
All systems go.

459
00:39:02 --> 00:39:14
In simulation, my supervisors
could never keep up.

460
00:39:14 --> 00:39:34
Well, this isn&#39;t simulation any more...
so take her out easy, cadet.

461
00:39:34 --> 00:39:44
Yes, sir.
Five metres from object.

462
00:39:44 --> 00:40:01
Three metres from object.
Clear.

463
00:40:01 --> 00:40:27
- Don&#39;t exceed port speed.
- Or what?

464
00:40:27 --> 00:40:56
Or they revoke your flight
status, and mine.

465
00:40:56 --> 00:41:16
Your career is
in my hands.

466
00:41:16 --> 00:41:36
Steady as she goes,
Number Two.

467
00:41:36 --> 00:41:53
- Prepare for warp.
- Yes, ma&#39;am.

468
00:41:53 --> 00:42:13
Number One, design
for Jupiter orbit.

469
00:42:13 --> 00:42:47
All crew, all sections,
stand by to cut in C-drive.

470
00:42:47 --> 00:43:35
- Star drive in five, four,
- Five, four...

471
00:43:35 --> 00:43:55
- ready...
- three, two...

472
00:43:55 --> 00:44:08
- steady...
- one--

473
00:44:08 --> 00:44:35
- go!
We&#39;re going in!

474
00:44:35 --> 00:45:02
Move!
Man, they&#39;re defended.

475
00:45:02 --> 00:45:50
No way in.
- Flip six, three hole.

476
00:45:50 --> 00:46:38
- What?
You run a flip six, three

477
00:46:38 --> 00:47:32
hole play, and you can score.
- Cover me.

478
00:47:32 --> 00:47:59
- You got it.
Now!

479
00:47:59 --> 00:48:19
- Thanks, buddy.
- Bastard!

480
00:48:19 --> 00:48:53
Yeah!
Kid&#39;s got some moves.

481
00:48:53 --> 00:49:41
Give him a squad.
See what he can do.

482
00:49:41 --> 00:49:43
Kitty, Kitty.
Someone&#39;s got to teach you guys

483
00:49:43 --> 00:49:46
how to play some pool here.
Look at him.

484
00:49:46 --> 00:49:50
Have you ever seen anybody
so pleased with himself?

485
00:49:50 --> 00:49:53
Well, Zim must have had to choose
someone to be his brownnose.

486
00:49:53 --> 00:49:55
All right, where were we?
Okay, watch and learn.

487
00:49:55 --> 00:49:59
Watch and learn.
I couldn&#39;t have done it

488
00:49:59 --> 00:50:03
without you, Diz.
Friends?

489
00:50:03 --> 00:50:07
Friends.
- Mail call! Levy!

490
00:50:07 --> 00:50:11
- Yeah, that&#39;s me.
- Shujimi!

491
00:50:11 --> 00:50:13
- Here.
- Rico.

492
00:50:13 --> 00:50:15
- Here.
- Breckinridge!

493
00:50:15 --> 00:50:19
- Yeah, right here.
- Niler.

494
00:50:19 --> 00:50:30
- Yeah, here I am. Ah, great, my dad.
That&#39;s all, folks.

495
00:50:30 --> 00:50:43
Hi, Johnny.
I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t

496
00:50:43 --> 00:51:08
written you sooner, but, uh...
- Oh, Rico,

497
00:51:08 --> 00:51:37
- it&#39;s been really busy.
- you don&#39;t deserve that!

498
00:51:37 --> 00:51:59
- Shh, shh.
- They&#39;ve really got us

499
00:51:59 --> 00:52:24
going here.
They must have made you

500
00:52:24 --> 00:52:42
squad leader by now.
And if they haven&#39;t,

501
00:52:42 --> 00:53:07
tell &#39;em to talk to me.
See? All it takes is

502
00:53:07 --> 00:53:13
the love of a good woman.
- Yeah.

503
00:53:13 --> 00:53:18
- That is a woman.
- Beautiful.

504
00:53:18 --> 00:53:24
- Look at that.
- Look at those.

505
00:53:24 --> 00:53:29
- Stop it.
- Isn&#39;t it beautiful?

506
00:53:29 --> 00:53:35
- I&#39;m dying.
I love it out here.

507
00:53:35 --> 00:53:39
- That&#39;s also the problem.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

508
00:53:39 --> 00:53:42
Because I think
I&#39;m gonna go career.

509
00:53:42 --> 00:53:47
I want to command
a ship of my own.

510
00:53:47 --> 00:53:53
And you know...
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s gonna

511
00:53:53 --> 00:54:13
leave a lot of room...
for you and me, Johnny.

512
00:54:13 --> 00:54:14
- Oh, God.
-Jeez.

513
00:54:14 --> 00:54:19
I know that&#39;s not
what you wanted to hear.

514
00:54:19 --> 00:54:23
But, uh...
I have to follow my heart.

515
00:54:23 --> 00:54:26
I&#39;m sorry.
Write me, all right?

516
00:54:26 --> 00:54:31
Write me so that I know
we&#39;ll always be friends.

517
00:54:31 --> 00:54:38
- Let&#39;s get back to the game.
- I feel so sorry for Johnny.

518
00:54:38 --> 00:54:48
Funny how they always
want to be friends...

519
00:54:48 --> 00:55:12
after they rip your guts
out, huh?

520
00:55:12 --> 00:55:32
Yeah. Well,
it&#39;s what I deserve.

521
00:55:32 --> 00:55:48
What are you
talking about?

522
00:55:48 --> 00:56:37
Oh, I joined up for her.
I wouldn&#39;t even be here

523
00:56:37 --> 00:57:26
if it wasn&#39;t for her.
What are you talking about? You

524
00:57:26 --> 00:58:20
made squad leader on your own.
And, hey, you still got me

525
00:58:20 --> 00:58:56
to kick around.
Fun and games are over,

526
00:58:56 --> 00:59:18
children.
You will be firing

527
00:59:18 --> 00:59:45
live ammunition...
in a simulated combat

528
00:59:45 --> 01:00:07
environment.
You will exercise extreme

529
01:00:07 --> 01:00:17
caution on my assault course!
- Do you get me?

530
01:00:17 --> 01:00:29
- Sir, yes, sir!
Rico, take &#39;em out!

531
01:00:29 --> 01:00:46
First fire team with me.
Next team in ten seconds.

532
01:00:46 --> 01:01:21
Maximum score has been 2 80.
- I expect you to do better!

533
01:01:21 --> 01:01:23
- Go!
Shujimi, stay down!

534
01:01:23 --> 01:01:29
Hey! Goddam it, Breckinridge,
clear my line of fire!

535
01:01:29 --> 01:01:49
It&#39;s my helmet!
It&#39;s all screwed up!

536
01:01:49 --> 01:02:20
You&#39;re gonna
blow the score!

537
01:02:20 --> 01:02:38
- Damn!
- Dumb shit!

538
01:02:38 --> 01:03:15
Diz, stay put!
What&#39;s the problem?

539
01:03:15 --> 01:04:11
- Damn thing keeps getting in my way!
- Give it to me.

540
01:04:11 --> 01:04:12
How come whenever something goes wrong,
it&#39;s always you, Breckinridge?

541
01:04:12 --> 01:04:14
It must be &#39;cause
I&#39;m big and dumb!

542
01:04:14 --> 01:04:18
Yeah, right!
Medic!

543
01:04:18 --> 01:04:25
Rico, you are relieved
of squad command!

544
01:04:25 --> 01:04:53
Rico, did you give the recruit
permission to remove his helmet?

545
01:04:53 --> 01:05:13
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge
reported a helmet malfunction...

546
01:05:13 --> 01:05:17
and I asked him
to show it to me, sir.

547
01:05:17 --> 01:05:23
Are you rated to repair
the M-3 Tactical Helmet, Rico?

548
01:05:23 --> 01:05:32
Sir, no, sir!
Then why did you order your man

549
01:05:32 --> 01:05:52
to remove his helmet...
during a live fire

550
01:05:52 --> 01:06:06
exercise?
Sir, I needed everyone in

551
01:06:06 --> 01:06:28
my squad operational, sir!
I wanted to win, sir!

552
01:06:28 --> 01:06:43
Carry on.
Sergeant, we&#39;ve already lost

553
01:06:43 --> 01:07:10
two recruits over this incident.
Do you think there&#39;s any possibility

554
01:07:10 --> 01:07:20
of salvaging this man?
Yes, sir, I do.

555
01:07:20 --> 01:07:21
All right.
We&#39;ll try administrative punishment.

556
01:07:21 --> 01:07:23
Prisoner, halt!
Bite down on this, son.

557
01:07:23 --> 01:07:24
It helps.
I know.

558
01:07:24 --> 01:07:27
For incompetence of command...
for failure to abide

559
01:07:27 --> 01:07:30
by safety regulations...
during a live fire exercise...

560
01:07:30 --> 01:07:35
for negligence which contributed
to the death of a teammate...

561
01:07:35 --> 01:07:44
recruit trainee
John Rico...

562
01:07:44 --> 01:07:58
is sentenced to
administrative punishment.

563
01:07:58 --> 01:08:19
Ten lashes.
You may carry out

564
01:08:19 --> 01:08:23
the sentence.
One!

565
01:08:23 --> 01:08:27
Two!
Three!

566
01:08:27 --> 01:08:31
Four!
Five!

567
01:08:31 --> 01:08:35
Six!
Seven!

568
01:08:35 --> 01:08:39
Eight!
Nine!

569
01:08:39 --> 01:08:47
Ten!
All sections secure.

570
01:08:47 --> 01:09:00
EBS is high normal.
Switching to slave on my mark.

571
01:09:00 --> 01:09:01
Mark.
Thanks.

572
01:09:01 --> 01:09:07
You read my mind.
Oh, third watch always

573
01:09:07 --> 01:09:11
seems to last forever.
I don&#39;t know.

574
01:09:11 --> 01:09:14
It depends on who
you&#39;re spending it with.

575
01:09:14 --> 01:09:16
Something&#39;s wrong.
- There.

576
01:09:16 --> 01:09:19
- No, I replotted the course.
- It&#39;s more efficient this way.

577
01:09:19 --> 01:09:27
- Three weeks aboard a starship...
and you think that you

578
01:09:27 --> 01:09:29
can lick my navs?
Check it.

579
01:09:29 --> 01:09:31
You know, I was talking
with Captain Deladier...

580
01:09:31 --> 01:09:33
and, uh, she said--
Don&#39;t change the subject.

581
01:09:33 --> 01:09:34
Am I right?
Yeah. Yeah.

582
01:09:34 --> 01:09:35
You&#39;re right.
So, what did

583
01:09:35 --> 01:09:36
the captain say?
She thinks that we ought

584
01:09:36 --> 01:09:37
to team up officially...
and crew for her.

585
01:09:37 --> 01:09:39
- You and me, huh?
- We&#39;re good together, Carmen.

586
01:09:39 --> 01:09:40
We&#39;re way ahead of the curve
in every department.

587
01:09:40 --> 01:09:41
I can anticipate you.
You know what I want.

588
01:09:41 --> 01:09:43
No. What do you want?
There&#39;s a gravity field

589
01:09:43 --> 01:09:45
out there.
- Run a scan. Sensors on.

590
01:09:45 --> 01:09:46
- There.
- Gravity at 225 and rising.

591
01:09:46 --> 01:09:51
- Report.
Captain, we&#39;re in the path

592
01:09:51 --> 01:10:23
of an unidentified object...
moving toward us

593
01:10:23 --> 01:10:45
at high speed.
Profile suggests

594
01:10:45 --> 01:11:12
an asteroid, ma&#39;am.
- Impact, six seconds!

595
01:11:12 --> 01:11:30
- Emergency evasion!
Three, two,

596
01:11:30 --> 01:11:48
fire!
Close compartment 21!

597
01:11:48 --> 01:12:21
Where&#39;d it come from?
It came out of the Arachnid

598
01:12:21 --> 01:12:26
Quarantine Zone, ma&#39;am.
Number Four, contact Fleet.

599
01:12:26 --> 01:13:57
Tell &#39;em there&#39;s a loose asteroid
headed their way.

600
01:13:57 --> 01:15:44
Communications are down,
ma&#39;am. They&#39;re gone.

601
01:15:44 --> 01:16:55
- Damage assessment.
- Hull&#39;s compromised.

602
01:16:55 --> 01:17:42
We&#39;re lucky
to be alive, ma&#39;am.

603
01:17:42 --> 01:18:27
Luck didn&#39;t have anything
to do with it.

604
01:18:27 --> 01:18:38
We have a hell
of a flight team.

605
01:18:38 --> 01:18:43
It really stinks, you going.
Yeah, well, the Mobile Infantry

606
01:18:43 --> 01:18:51
will just have to get along without me.
I don&#39;t get it, Rico.

607
01:18:51 --> 01:18:56
You took your licks.
If they didn&#39;t want you,

608
01:18:56 --> 01:19:00
they would have kicked you out.
Hey--

609
01:19:00 --> 01:19:43
I joined up for the wrong reasons.
I got a guy killed.

610
01:19:43 --> 01:19:59
I figure that kind of proves
I don&#39;t have what it takes.

611
01:19:59 --> 01:20:10
Rico, your call&#39;s going through.
Take it there.

612
01:20:10 --> 01:20:17
- Hello? Oh, Johnny!
- Hi, Mom.

613
01:20:17 --> 01:20:25
B-Bill, pick it up.
It&#39;s Johnny!

614
01:20:25 --> 01:20:27
-Johnny?
- Dad.

615
01:20:27 --> 01:20:32
- Where&#39;s your uniform?
- Bill.

616
01:20:32 --> 01:20:42
It&#39;s just good
to hear from you.

617
01:20:42 --> 01:20:55
How are you, son?
It&#39;s not really working out

618
01:20:55 --> 01:21:05
here for me, Dad.
I was thinking--

619
01:21:05 --> 01:21:12
I was hoping it would be
all right if I came home.

620
01:21:12 --> 01:21:16
Well, of-of course. You should
come home immediately.

621
01:21:16 --> 01:21:19
I&#39;m sorry.
I&#39;ve been an idiot.

622
01:21:19 --> 01:21:22
Don&#39;t talk like that.
You just come on home...

623
01:21:22 --> 01:21:23
talk things out.
We love you, son.

624
01:21:23 --> 01:21:25
- My, what&#39;s that?
- Looks like rain.

625
01:21:25 --> 01:21:27
- This time of year?
- Sure is dark.

626
01:21:27 --> 01:21:28
Your transmission
has been terminated...

627
01:21:28 --> 01:21:29
due to atmospheric
interference.

628
01:21:29 --> 01:21:30
Please try your call
again later.

629
01:21:30 --> 01:21:31
Sanchez!
Well, see ya.

630
01:21:31 --> 01:21:33
Hey, you take that stroll
down Washout Lane...

631
01:21:33 --> 01:21:34
you&#39;re only proving
one thing,Johnny.

632
01:21:34 --> 01:21:36
What&#39;s that, Diz?
That you don&#39;t have what

633
01:21:36 --> 01:21:39
it takes to be a citizen.
Mobile Infantry

634
01:21:39 --> 01:21:40
is passing by
Mobile Infantry

635
01:21:40 --> 01:21:42
is passing by
- Well, sound off

636
01:21:42 --> 01:21:43
- MI
- Sound off

637
01:21:43 --> 01:21:44
- Passing by
- Count now

638
01:21:44 --> 01:21:47
- One, two, three, four
- That&#39;s it! That&#39;s it!

639
01:21:47 --> 01:21:49
- Left. Left.
- Left, right, left.

640
01:21:49 --> 01:21:51
- Do you get me?
- Sir, yes, sir!

641
01:21:51 --> 01:21:54
- I can&#39;t hear you!
- What&#39;s going on, you guys?

642
01:21:54 --> 01:21:56
Move, move, move!
What&#39;s happening?

643
01:21:56 --> 01:21:59
Hey, hey, what&#39;s going on?
Wh-What&#39;s going on?

644
01:21:59 --> 01:22:19
- Hey, Kitten, what&#39;s going on?
- It&#39;s war! We&#39;re going to war!

645
01:22:19 --> 01:22:24
The devastation we are seeing
is unparalleled.

646
01:22:24 --> 01:22:32
Judging from early estimates,
millions dead, a city in ruins.

647
01:22:32 --> 01:22:37
Is that Geneva?
Goddam bugs whacked us,

648
01:22:37 --> 01:22:41
Johnny.
The meteor was shot out

649
01:22:41 --> 01:22:41
of orbit by bug plasma...
that derived from Klendathu,

650
01:22:41 --> 01:22:41
the Arachnids&#39;home planet.
Nothing lives in what was once

651
01:22:41 --> 01:22:41
called the Latin Paradise.
Oh,Johnny, it&#39;s us.

652
01:22:41 --> 01:22:41
Buenos Aires has been
wiped off the Earth.

653
01:22:41 --> 01:22:41
That&#39;s home.
The Federal Council met moments

654
01:22:41 --> 01:22:41
ago and voted unanimously...
for mobilization to destroy

655
01:22:41 --> 01:22:41
the Arachnid threat.
- I&#39;m serious. I&#39;ll go anywhere.

656
01:22:41 --> 01:22:41
- Forget it, Zim. We need you here.
-I want combat, sir.

657
01:22:41 --> 01:22:42
-The only way you&#39;re gonna see combat...
is if you bust yourself

658
01:22:42 --> 01:22:42
my request to drop out, sir.
You already signed

659
01:22:42 --> 01:22:45
- Major, I know it was wrong.
I didn&#39;t learn from one mistake,

660
01:22:45 --> 01:22:47
- Major, I know it was wrong.
I didn&#39;t learn from one mistake,
- Major, I know it was wrong.
I didn&#39;t learn from one mistake,
- Major, I know it was wrong.
I didn&#39;t learn from one mistake,
- Major, I know it was wrong.
I didn&#39;t learn from one mistake,
- Major, I know it was wrong.
I didn&#39;t learn from one mistake,

661
01:22:47 --> 01:22:50
and I made another, sir.
You made your decision, son.

662
01:22:50 --> 01:22:52
Sir, my family, my whole family,
was in Buenos Aires, sir.

663
01:22:52 --> 01:22:55
Is this your signature, Rico?
Sir, yes, it is, sir!

664
01:22:55 --> 01:22:57
Doesn&#39;t look like it to me.
- Carry on, Private!

665
01:22:57 --> 01:22:57
- Yes, sir!
Out of the ashes of Buenos Aires

666
01:22:57 --> 01:22:57
comes first sorrow...
then anger.

667
01:22:57 --> 01:23:00
The only good bug
is a dead bug.

668
01:23:00 --> 01:23:02
In Geneva,
the Federal Council convenes.

669
01:23:02 --> 01:23:02
are looking for new ways to kill bugs.
Your basic Arachnid warrior

670
01:23:02 --> 01:23:02
not insect...
dominates this galaxy,

671
01:23:02 --> 01:23:02
announces plans...
for an offensive

672
01:23:02 --> 01:23:02
that destroyed Buenos Aires.
Every day, Federal scientists

673
01:23:02 --> 01:23:02
are looking for new ways to kill bugs.
Your basic Arachnid warrior

674
01:23:02 --> 01:23:02
are looking for new ways to kill bugs.
Your basic Arachnid warrior

675
01:23:02 --> 01:23:02
are looking for new ways to kill bugs.
Your basic Arachnid warrior

676
01:23:02 --> 01:23:02
are looking for new ways to kill bugs.
Your basic Arachnid warrior

677
01:23:02 --> 01:23:02
are looking for new ways to kill bugs.
Your basic Arachnid warrior

678
01:23:02 --> 01:23:02
isn&#39;t too smart...
but you can

679
01:23:02 --> 01:23:02
blow off a limb...
and it&#39;s still 86 percent

680
01:23:02 --> 01:23:12
combat effective.
Here&#39;s a tip.:Aim for the nerve stem,

681
01:23:12 --> 01:23:50
and put it down for good.
Everyone&#39;s doing their part. Are you?

682
01:23:50 --> 01:23:59
- Die! Die!
- The war effort needs your effort...

683
01:23:59 --> 01:24:40
at work, at home,
in your community.

684
01:24:40 --> 01:26:56
We now break net and take you live...
to Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga...

685
01:26:56 --> 01:27:03
deep inside
the Arachnid Quarantine Zone...

686
01:27:03 --> 01:27:08
where the men and women of the Federal
Armed Services prepare to attack.

687
01:27:08 --> 01:27:09
D XQ uplink on two, one.
You&#39;re on.

688
01:27:09 --> 01:27:10
No one here in the AQZ
knows exactly...

689
01:27:10 --> 01:27:11
when the invasion
of Klendathu will occur.

690
01:27:11 --> 01:27:19
But everyone&#39;s
talking about it...

691
01:27:19 --> 01:28:05
and the talk says tomorrow.
Here&#39;s a bunch of MI kids that look

692
01:28:05 --> 01:28:09
like they could eat bugs for lunch.
- Yum, yum, yum.

693
01:28:09 --> 01:28:11
- So, trooper,
you&#39;re not too worried

694
01:28:11 --> 01:28:17
about fighting the Arachnids?
Hey, shoot a nuke down a bug hole,

695
01:28:17 --> 01:28:23
you got a lot of dead bugs.
-Am I right?

696
01:28:23 --> 01:28:30
- I just hope it&#39;s not over
before we get some.

697
01:28:30 --> 01:28:31
- Okay, come on.
- Some say the bugs were provoked...

698
01:28:31 --> 01:28:34
by the intrusion of humans
into their natural habitat...

699
01:28:34 --> 01:28:54
that a &quot;live and let live policy&quot;
is preferable to war with the bugs.

700
01:28:54 --> 01:28:59
Let me tell you something.
I&#39;m from Buenos Aires,

701
01:28:59 --> 01:29:00
and I say kill them all!
- Yeah!

702
01:29:00 --> 01:29:00
- Go on, trooper!
- Yeah!

703
01:29:00 --> 01:29:00
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

704
01:29:00 --> 01:29:01
Big bad bugs, huh?
Hey, guys,

705
01:29:01 --> 01:29:04
we ought to get tattoos.
- Hey, let&#39;s all get cut together.

706
01:29:04 --> 01:29:05
- Yeah.
- What do I want a tattoo for?

707
01:29:05 --> 01:29:21
- Oh, what?
Your skin&#39;s too pretty?

708
01:29:21 --> 01:29:53
Come on, everybody&#39;s doing it.
Hey,Johnny!

709
01:29:53 --> 01:30:09
Johnny Rico.
Carmen?

710
01:30:09 --> 01:30:43
Oh. At ease.
Guess I ought to lose the hat

711
01:30:43 --> 01:30:46
when I&#39;m off duty.
- Hi, Diz.

712
01:30:46 --> 01:30:50
- Carmen.
My mother was right about you.

713
01:30:50 --> 01:30:58
You look great in a uniform.
You look pretty good yourself.

714
01:30:58 --> 01:31:00
So, what do you hear?
You know about anyone

715
01:31:00 --> 01:31:01
who made it out of BA alive?
Most of the time

716
01:31:01 --> 01:31:02
I don&#39;t think about it.
Like it happened

717
01:31:02 --> 01:31:31
to someone else.
Then it hits me,

718
01:31:31 --> 01:32:20
and I, uh, can&#39;t stop crying.
Well, we&#39;re still alive.

719
01:32:20 --> 01:33:04
Got to be happy about that.
You don&#39;t look

720
01:33:04 --> 01:33:44
very happy to see me.
Should I be?

721
01:33:44 --> 01:34:56
Johnny, it&#39;s different now.
We&#39;re at war.

722
01:34:56 --> 01:36:01
I mean, I think what

723
01:36:01 --> 01:36:48
I did was
probably the best thing for both of us.

724
01:36:48 --> 01:36:57
Everything copacetic,
Lieutenant?

725
01:36:57 --> 01:37:18
Zander, you remember Johnny.
Zander and I

726
01:37:18 --> 01:37:22
are a flight team now.
Yeah, and we&#39;re best in the fleet.

727
01:37:22 --> 01:37:31
I get it.
This is the part that&#39;s

728
01:37:31 --> 01:37:35
best for both of us.
- Don&#39;t do me any more favours.

729
01:37:35 --> 01:37:35
-Johnny, wait.
No, forget it, Lieutenant.

730
01:37:35 --> 01:37:35
He&#39;s Mobile Infantry.
See, when you&#39;re

731
01:37:35 --> 01:37:35
trained to kill...
it just doesn&#39;t pay

732
01:37:35 --> 01:37:35
to be polite.
You got something to say

733
01:37:35 --> 01:37:36
about the Mobile Infantry?
I think you heard me.

734
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
You want to make
something of it, Private?

735
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
Not with an officer.
No, sir.

736
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
- The MI doesn&#39;t mint stupid troopers.
- Well, let&#39;s disregard rank.

737
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
- Zander, please.
- Let it go, Rico.

738
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
- Let it go.
Everybody hear that?

739
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
Rank is not an issue here.
- Don&#39;t do this.

740
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
- Come on. What&#39;s he gonna do?
Come on, jarheads!

741
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
Let go of me! Come on!
I&#39;m gonna kill you!

742
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
I&#39;m gonna kill you!
I&#39;ll kill you!

743
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
- Guys! Guys! Quit it!
- Come on! Come on!

744
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
- He&#39;s not worth it!
- Come on!

745
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
- Come on!
- Let&#39;s get--

746
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
- Come on!
Forget it, Rico! Mobile Infantry

747
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
and Fleet don&#39;t mix. Come on.
Come on, let&#39;s go.

748
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
Jarheads.
- Mobile Infantry rules!

749
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
- Yeah!
Oh, God, that hurts.

750
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
Hey, well, I got something that might
hurt just a little bit more, buddy.

751
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
Oh, yeah! We&#39;re gonna fight,
and we&#39;re gonna win!

752
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

753
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
This is the captain speaking.
All personnel

754
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
prepare for drop.
We are at D-minus three

755
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
and counting.
We are going in

756
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
with first wave.
Means more bugs

757
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
for us to kill.
You smash the entire area.

758
01:37:36 --> 01:37:36
You kill anything that has
more than two legs.

759
01:37:36 --> 01:37:39
- You get me?
- We get you, sir!

760
01:37:39 --> 01:37:41
-Plasma, ma&#39;am, from the planet.
-Bug batteries.

761
01:37:41 --> 01:37:41
According to military intelligence,
it&#39;ll be random and light.

762
01:37:41 --> 01:37:41
- Drop status?
- Drop is...

763
01:37:41 --> 01:37:41
Steady as she goes,
Number Two.

764
01:37:41 --> 01:37:42
Remember your training,
and you will make it back alive!

765
01:37:42 --> 01:37:47
This isn&#39;t random or light.
Someone made a mistake.

766
01:37:47 --> 01:37:47
That&#39;s it.
We&#39;re empty, ma&#39;am.

767
01:37:47 --> 01:37:47
Someone made
a big goddam mistake!

768
01:37:47 --> 01:37:48
Break for high orbit!
Let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go!

769
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
Johnny!
- Rockets up!

770
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
- Rocket crew, move up!
- Nuke &#39;em! Levy! Rico!

771
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
- Heat &#39;em up!
- Set.

772
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
- Fire!
Down!

773
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
- Follow me!
- Let&#39;s go!

774
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
First platoon, left flank!
Split up! First and

775
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
second squads, follow me.
Two, cover!

776
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
One, with me!
Along side! Side to side!

777
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
Fire!
Here they come!

778
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
- Ace, what are we doing?
- Uh, I don&#39;t know.

779
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
- I don&#39;t know.
- Kill them! Kill them all!

780
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

781
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
You want some?
Here&#39;s some! Yeah!

782
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
Here&#39;s some of this!
Oh, my God!

783
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
Shujimi!
No, no, no!

784
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
Help! Help! Help!
No! God!

785
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
Let&#39;s get out of here!
Fall back!

786
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
Mayday!
-All units,

787
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
- What&#39;s going on?
- fall back to retrieval.

788
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
- Repeat.
- You got com?

789
01:37:48 --> 01:37:48
-All units...
- fall back to retrieval.

790
01:37:48 --> 01:37:53
- It&#39;s a general retreat!
- Back to the boats!

791
01:37:53 --> 01:37:53
- Come on!
Come on, let&#39;s go!

792
01:37:53 --> 01:37:53
We&#39;ve just landed here
on what cap troopers...

793
01:37:53 --> 01:37:53
are calling Big K...
with the 6th Mobile

794
01:37:53 --> 01:37:53
Infantry Division.
It&#39;s an ugly planet,

795
01:37:53 --> 01:37:53
a bug planet.
A planet hostile

796
01:37:53 --> 01:37:53
to life as we--
Help me!

797
01:37:53 --> 01:37:53
Squad right!
Come on! Go, go, go!

798
01:37:53 --> 01:37:53
Get out of here now!
- Watch your step!

799
01:37:53 --> 01:37:53
- Watch your flank! Watch your flank!
GXR, we&#39;re being overrun.

800
01:37:53 --> 01:37:53
Kitten, no!
Oh, God!

801
01:37:53 --> 01:37:53
Oh, God! Oh! Oh!
Crisis for humankind.

802
01:37:53 --> 01:37:53
Fleet officials admit
they underestimated...

803
01:37:53 --> 01:37:54
the Arachnids&#39;
defensive capability.

804
01:37:54 --> 01:37:56
Accepting responsibility
for Klendathu...

805
01:37:56 --> 01:37:59
Sky Marshal Dienes resigns.
His successor,

806
01:37:59 --> 01:38:03
Sky Marshal Tahat Meru...
outlines her new strategy.

807
01:38:03 --> 01:38:05
To fight the bug...
we must understand the bug.

808
01:38:05 --> 01:38:05
We can ill afford
another Klendathu.

809
01:38:05 --> 01:38:06
Federal scientists
struggle to explain...

810
01:38:06 --> 01:38:09
the intelligent military actions
of the Arachnids.

811
01:38:09 --> 01:38:10
When a colony reaches
a certain size...

812
01:38:10 --> 01:38:10
it gets smarter.
- Insects with intelligence?

813
01:38:10 --> 01:38:10
- Now, wait--
Have you ever met one?
I can&#39;t believe...
- I am hearing this nonsense.
I can&#39;t believe...
- I am hearing this nonsense.
I can&#39;t believe...
- I am hearing this nonsense.
I can&#39;t believe...
- I am hearing this nonsense.
I can&#39;t believe...
- I am hearing this nonsense.
I can&#39;t believe...
- I am hearing this nonsense.
I can&#39;t believe...
- I am hearing this nonsense.
I can&#39;t believe...
- I am hearing this nonsense.

814
01:38:10 --> 01:38:10
I can&#39;t believe...
- I am hearing this nonsense.

815
01:38:10 --> 01:38:10
- Would you just wait a moment?
- This is the most ridiculous

816
01:38:10 --> 01:38:10
conversation I have ever had.
- Maybe-- Maybe...

817
01:38:10 --> 01:38:11
there is some kind of bug
that we haven&#39;t seen yet.:

818
01:38:11 --> 01:38:13
a leadership caste,
a-a hive brain.

819
01:38:13 --> 01:38:17
Brain Bugs? Frankly, I find the idea
of a bug that thinks offensive!

820
01:38:17 --> 01:38:18
Ticonderoga, this is Rodger Young
requesting approach vector.

821
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
Affirmative, Rodger Young.
One-zero-zero-niner-five-two.

822
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
Welcome back.
My God.

823
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
How could this happen?
We thought we were smarter

824
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
than the bugs.
Give me something, please!

825
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
It hurts!
Be right with you.

826
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
Help me.
It&#39;s strange. There&#39;s

827
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
almost no wounded at all.
Bugs don&#39;t take prisoners.

828
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
Oh, no.
Look.

829
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
- Carmen--
- See it? Right there.

830
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
- There he is.
- Come on, we&#39;ll just wake him up.

831
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
Hey,Johnny! Hey!
- Hey, Rico!

832
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
- Hey,Johnny!
- Hey, Rico!

833
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
- Wake up!
- How you doin&#39;, fish boy?

834
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
Hey, look.
You&#39;re dead!

835
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
Killed in action!
- Three more days.

836
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
- Three days.
- And you&#39;re out.

837
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
- Good as new. See you later.
Bye.

838
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
So what do you hear
about our new unit?

839
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
Roughnecks killed more bugs
than any other outfit on Big K.

840
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
Yeah, well, I hear their
lieutenant&#39;s a real nutbuster.

841
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
Who&#39;s top kick?
You want the job, huh?

842
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
I wouldn&#39;t mind.
I would.

843
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
Just doing my part.
Orders.

844
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
Yours?
Where you been

845
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
besides Big K?
- Outer rings, Zegema Beach.

846
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
- Zegema Beach?
- I always wanted to go there.

847
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
- Good luck.
- It&#39;s not there any more.

848
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
- So, I hear your lieutenant&#39;s
a real nutbuster.

849
01:38:18 --> 01:38:18
No one talks about
the lieutenant that way.

850
01:38:18 --> 01:38:20
- He saved my life.
- Mine too.

851
01:38:20 --> 01:38:24
- Same for me.
- Me too.

852
01:38:24 --> 01:38:25
Well, sounds like
he&#39;s quite a guy.

853
01:38:25 --> 01:38:25
We don&#39;t have a minute!
Battlegroup, this is Roughneck 2-0.

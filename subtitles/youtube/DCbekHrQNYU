2
00:00:00 --> 00:00:04
yeah

3
00:00:04 --> 00:00:12
yeah

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:15
at some level

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:20
this is clearly a man of immense
personal charm you want to engage him

6
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
when you hear this voice coming out of
the speakers

7
00:00:22 --> 00:00:25
he has that quality

8
00:00:25 --> 00:00:28
he has a wonderful wine and I think it&#39;s
from a book of mercy

9
00:00:28 --> 00:00:33
where he says the heart is a rage of
afflictions and that&#39;s to me very close

10
00:00:33 --> 00:00:37
to what Leonard is engaged with not just
in the poetry but in the song

11
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
yeah

12
00:00:40 --> 00:00:44
then the Cohens early body of work is
unique in popular music

13
00:00:44 --> 00:00:48
I think the parallels you have to look
outside music

14
00:00:48 --> 00:00:53
he&#39;s actually a poet putting poems to
music rather than a song writer writing

15
00:00:53 --> 00:00:58
songs that was really what made him
stand out from the crowd that made you

16
00:00:58 --> 00:01:01
want to sit up and take notice

17
00:01:01 --> 00:01:04
yeah

18
00:01:04 --> 00:01:08
my mind was growing in leaps and bounds
by just being with somebody like living

19
00:01:08 --> 00:01:12
you&#39;re talking about a very special a
very special deep person

20
00:01:12 --> 00:01:16
ok

21
00:01:16 --> 00:01:22
Leonard Cohen was born in Montreal
Canada in 1934 raised within the cities

22
00:01:22 --> 00:01:23
large Jewish community

23
00:01:23 --> 00:01:26
he was brought up in an affluent
middle-class household as the son of a

24
00:01:26 --> 00:01:32
prominent businessman he took an early
interest in literature and also in his

25
00:01:32 --> 00:01:35
Jewish heritage and the Holocaust in
particular

26
00:01:35 --> 00:01:40
in 1951 Cohen graduated from high school
and rolling at the prestigious mcgill

27
00:01:40 --> 00:01:44
university his interest in literature
had evolved and he was particularly

28
00:01:44 --> 00:01:50
drawn to poetry and the work of Locker
yates and Elliot notable college

29
00:01:50 --> 00:01:54
lecturers and alumni also began exerting
strong influence upon his writing

30
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
particularly Canadian perches on fun to
read

31
00:01:57 --> 00:02:00
Irving Layton

32
00:02:00 --> 00:02:03
in 1955

33
00:02:03 --> 00:02:06
after a series of his poems have been
published in various magazines Collins

34
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
first collection was released under the
title

35
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
let us compare mythologies

36
00:02:11 --> 00:02:16
during the first program they met behind
the ruins of their homes

37
00:02:16 --> 00:02:23
sweet merchants trading her love for a
history full of poems and at the heart

38
00:02:23 --> 00:02:26
of ins they cunningly managed to breathe

39
00:02:26 --> 00:02:30
kiss before the soldier came to knock
out her golden teeth

40
00:02:30 --> 00:02:35
not only did the book&#39;s publication spur
Cohen honors a poet

41
00:02:35 --> 00:02:40
its success gave him confidence in
another area women he tells the story

42
00:02:40 --> 00:02:45
himself he said one of the ways of
moving the lady was to quote poetry and

43
00:02:45 --> 00:02:49
if you could call his own on the better
but obviously mean that there&#39;s a wider

44
00:02:49 --> 00:02:51
wider scenario here

45
00:02:51 --> 00:02:55
he&#39;s a he had great friends in Montreal
those that there&#39;s a writing scene in

46
00:02:55 --> 00:02:56
Montreal

47
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
I don&#39;t think they called them pumps but
they met in it of an evening had a drink

48
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
and ready-to-wear poetry and himself a
certain that they were the strictest

49
00:03:04 --> 00:03:06
critics you could ever hope to have

50
00:03:06 --> 00:03:11
you know your friends and that that I
think was was created motivation for him

51
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
you to get it right of it if he
convinced his friends then he could move

52
00:03:14 --> 00:03:20
on in the autumn of 1956 Cohen abandoned
his plans to study law and instead moved

53
00:03:20 --> 00:03:23
south of the border to New York City and
columbia university

54
00:03:23 --> 00:03:26
here he immediately gravitated towards
the coffee houses of greenwich village

55
00:03:26 --> 00:03:32
where the poetry scene was embracing the
dawn of the beats a year later he

56
00:03:32 --> 00:03:34
returned to montreal upon which he
received a three-thousand-dollar

57
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
scholarship from the canadian council
and succeeded in selling his next

58
00:03:37 --> 00:03:45
collection of poetry the spice box of
Earth you tell me that silence is nearer

59
00:03:45 --> 00:03:51
to peace and poles but it&#39;s for my gift
I brought you silence

60
00:03:51 --> 00:03:56
or I know silence you would say this is
not silence

61
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
this is another own and you would hand
it back to me

62
00:03:59 --> 00:04:03
it has some merit I mean if you looked
at in relation to american poetry being

63
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07
published at that time and you&#39;re just
at the cusp of the beat generation how

64
00:04:07 --> 00:04:12
Liz 1956 for example preceding it is
pretty tame stuff but for Canada

65
00:04:12 --> 00:04:20
whoa great here is a young writer found
his voice wasn&#39;t embarrassed to write

66
00:04:20 --> 00:04:26
naked Lee about subjects that other
poets had been much more discreet about

67
00:04:26 --> 00:04:32
that would be the tradition of say EJ
Pratt who writes this wonderful

68
00:04:32 --> 00:04:37
bestseller called the last spike and
it&#39;s this long poem about completing the

69
00:04:37 --> 00:04:38
railway across the country

70
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
that&#39;s the kind of subject you&#39;d find in
Canadian poetry

71
00:04:41 --> 00:04:48
you wouldn&#39;t you know find too much
poetry about being totally zonked on

72
00:04:48 --> 00:04:53
drugs and trying to write you know music
or poetry which is what some of those

73
00:04:53 --> 00:04:57
poems are about a lot of the other poems
are r / very personal and I think that

74
00:04:57 --> 00:05:02
was the other thing that made it unique
a cage is a victim you are sure of you

75
00:05:02 --> 00:05:06
love it because it pulls gentle enough
to call you a master strong enough to

76
00:05:06 --> 00:05:07
call you fool

77
00:05:07 --> 00:05:11
because it lives like a desperate train
falken in the high sweet air and you can

78
00:05:11 --> 00:05:16
always haul it down to tame it in your
drawer if you want to talk in purely

79
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
formal terms about the poetry writing

80
00:05:18 --> 00:05:21
it&#39;s not original it&#39;s not

81
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
gerard manley hopkins suddenly bursting
on the scene nor does it have the

82
00:05:24 --> 00:05:25
content of Yeats

83
00:05:25 --> 00:05:30
but it&#39;s important for the Canadian
poetry scene at that particular time and

84
00:05:30 --> 00:05:36
in a way he was emulating Irving Layton
who was quickly becoming the outrageous

85
00:05:36 --> 00:05:39
bacchus figure of Canadian writing at
that particular time it&#39;s still a little

86
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
early but he had this acquaintance with
late which grew into a powerful

87
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
friendship that lasted until serving
Layton&#39;s death

88
00:05:45 --> 00:05:45
I mean

89
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
and lightness the man and and Leonard
certainly was attracted very powerfully

90
00:05:48 --> 00:05:48
to Irving

91
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
but of course he found his own path

92
00:05:51 --> 00:06:00
after a brief spell in London code moved
to the greek island of Hedra where he

93
00:06:00 --> 00:06:05
immediately identified with the artistic
bohemian my slope in September 1960

94
00:06:05 --> 00:06:09
he bought a house there over the
following five years produce two very

95
00:06:09 --> 00:06:14
different novels get started the first
two favorite game in London and it was

96
00:06:14 --> 00:06:19
released to some acclaim in 1963 the
follow-up Beautiful Losers was

97
00:06:19 --> 00:06:24
eventually released in 1966 after his
publisher insisted on rewrites the far

98
00:06:24 --> 00:06:28
more ambitious and complex work it met
with some controversy on its release

99
00:06:28 --> 00:06:31
favorite game is arrived there

100
00:06:31 --> 00:06:35
conventional coming-of-age novel about a
young man discovering his identity and

101
00:06:35 --> 00:06:39
sexuality and early experiences
Beautiful Losers breaks the mold

102
00:06:39 --> 00:06:43
Beautiful Losers is brilliant brilliant
and i think still underrated canadian

103
00:06:43 --> 00:06:47
novel because it experiments with form
experiments with history

104
00:06:47 --> 00:06:53
it integrates a story from what the 18
17th century at the same time

105
00:06:53 --> 00:06:58
it tells us about the so-called quiet
revolution in Quebec but it does it

106
00:06:58 --> 00:06:59
explosively

107
00:06:59 --> 00:07:00
we are now in the heart

108
00:07:00 --> 00:07:07
of the last feature in the system
theater with in severe limits like smoke

109
00:07:07 --> 00:07:13
in a chimney the dusty projection beam
above our hair twisted and changed like

110
00:07:13 --> 00:07:18
crystals rioting in a test tube
suspension the unstable rate changed and

111
00:07:18 --> 00:07:21
changed in its black confinement

112
00:07:21 --> 00:07:25
it&#39;s often difficult to be persuaded by
the story itself until you read the

113
00:07:25 --> 00:07:26
background of why he wrote it

114
00:07:26 --> 00:07:30
where he was when he loaded who he
rooted for it did take a lot of his

115
00:07:30 --> 00:07:33
audience because they felt after the
part of the beautiful poems and spice

116
00:07:33 --> 00:07:35
box of Earth and flowers friendlier

117
00:07:35 --> 00:07:39
I could have been right this kind of
pros but if you know some of the

118
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
background it

119
00:07:41 --> 00:07:45
it&#39;s a very persuasive argument effect
for her too many reacted very strongly

120
00:07:45 --> 00:07:49
to the novel with a significant critical
backlash denouncing the work as obscene

121
00:07:49 --> 00:07:54
in Canada Cohen was more than happy
defending beautiful roses both in the

122
00:07:54 --> 00:07:55
press and television

123
00:07:55 --> 00:07:58
quote this is among other things the
most revolting book ever written in

124
00:07:58 --> 00:08:02
canada and quote in one of your problems
you think now more than ever I want

125
00:08:02 --> 00:08:02
enemy

126
00:08:02 --> 00:08:05
the thing that Paul about how people
conspire to make you free

127
00:08:05 --> 00:08:08
do you feel that way about the
criticisms of your book oh yes well I

128
00:08:08 --> 00:08:13
feel pretty lousy if I were praised by a
lot of the people that have come down

129
00:08:13 --> 00:08:14
pretty heavy on me

130
00:08:14 --> 00:08:21
the book has been scandalized because of
the overt sexuality of it people today

131
00:08:21 --> 00:08:27
are still somewhat put off by it came
out in 1966 that&#39;s quite a long time ago

132
00:08:27 --> 00:08:33
and yet people are still somewhat
anxious about reading beautiful losers

133
00:08:33 --> 00:08:36
but i think it&#39;s a very very important
book and I think one of the big

134
00:08:36 --> 00:08:39
questions with Leonard is why he never
wrote another novel

135
00:08:39 --> 00:08:42
although it had benefited from its
notoriety

136
00:08:42 --> 00:08:46
the sales of the novel was still
relatively low now 32

137
00:08:46 --> 00:08:50
Cowen&#39;s income from grants prizes and
publishers advances were barely enough

138
00:08:50 --> 00:08:54
to maintain his travels and his life in
Greece assessing his options

139
00:08:54 --> 00:08:57
he looked a songwriting as an escape
from the financial restrictions of

140
00:08:57 --> 00:08:57
poetry

141
00:08:57 --> 00:09:01
despite this late and apparently radical
change in artistic direction

142
00:09:01 --> 00:09:05
music had in fact always been one of
cones major interests especially during

143
00:09:05 --> 00:09:08
his youth he had been drawn to it ever
since he was a teenager I mean he loved

144
00:09:08 --> 00:09:13
folk music he used to listen to lots of
folk music radio stations that he would

145
00:09:13 --> 00:09:16
be able to listen to in Montreal you get
them from New York I mean you know

146
00:09:16 --> 00:09:20
wherever the ages of fourteen fifteen
sixteen he was going to summer camp he

147
00:09:20 --> 00:09:24
was meeting people who played the guitar
and you know introduced him to the sort

148
00:09:24 --> 00:09:29
of funky seen what was interesting was
that it was really folk music then

149
00:09:29 --> 00:09:33
poetry then back to music that i think
is the pattern that one has seen so it

150
00:09:33 --> 00:09:38
wasn&#39;t something that you know happened
unexpectedly in his twenties he had this

151
00:09:38 --> 00:09:43
high school / University band a country
western band called the Buckskin boys

152
00:09:43 --> 00:09:48
they played at bar mitzvahs and parties
and dances and get-togethers and he

153
00:09:48 --> 00:09:51
loved it he thought it was great fun

154
00:09:51 --> 00:09:56
planning to record a country record in
nashville in October 1966 current found

155
00:09:56 --> 00:09:59
himself in new york city and the chelsea
motel

156
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
yeah

157
00:10:02 --> 00:10:05
in a bid to capitalize in the booming
music industry

158
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
he embraced the flourishing
counterculture and befriended key

159
00:10:08 --> 00:10:09
figures within it

160
00:10:09 --> 00:10:13
including Lou Reed and the velvet
underground and their benefactor

161
00:10:13 --> 00:10:16
Andy Warhol

162
00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
in hindsight it seems like a mad
decision that i was going to rectify my

163
00:10:20 --> 00:10:28
economic situation by becoming a ser but
I had been dangerous in country music

164
00:10:28 --> 00:10:31
for a long time and I&#39;ve been writing
songs for a long time I thought I&#39;d go

165
00:10:31 --> 00:10:36
down in Nashville and cut a
country-western record that would take

166
00:10:36 --> 00:10:37
care of everything

167
00:10:37 --> 00:10:41
college starts out as a poet novelist
and he finds he&#39;s not making a living

168
00:10:41 --> 00:10:49
and he gets out of the game and moves
the song which i would argue is where

169
00:10:49 --> 00:10:57
the kind of poetry enjoyed by people who
sit in their backpacks reading yates and

170
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
William Carlos Williams has moved

171
00:10:59 --> 00:11:03
that&#39;s where the interest in that kind
of verbiage has gone and he went with it

172
00:11:03 --> 00:11:08
Cowen&#39;s gambit met with almost instant
success through key associates of Bob

173
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
Dylan&#39;s manager Albert Grossman his
songs were passed to folks about Judy

174
00:11:12 --> 00:11:16
Collins astounded by the unique and
distinctive poetry of the lyrics

175
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
she recorded a version of cohen&#39;s most
famous song

176
00:11:19 --> 00:11:24
Suzanne for her 1966 album in my life
and would record three further Cohen

177
00:11:24 --> 00:11:28
compositions on her follow-up wildflower
or judy collins was a great interpreter

178
00:11:28 --> 00:11:31
of other people&#39;s songs and when Judy
Collins did a song that was obviously

179
00:11:31 --> 00:11:34
completely different from what the way
it&#39;s something like she would do it as

180
00:11:34 --> 00:11:35
is she

181
00:11:35 --> 00:11:39
she proved with with other people that
she covered this story

182
00:11:39 --> 00:11:42
merci they are not departed

183
00:11:42 --> 00:11:45
they were waiting for me

184
00:11:45 --> 00:11:46
when I thought

185
00:11:46 --> 00:11:47
I just

186
00:11:47 --> 00:11:47
and go

187
00:11:47 --> 00:11:48
Oh

188
00:11:48 --> 00:11:52
what it tends to do is it didn&#39;t say
Dylan&#39;s masters of war she she she she

189
00:11:52 --> 00:11:55
decided that he was a kind of the
hundred list of masters of war so that

190
00:11:55 --> 00:11:58
the the bleakness that is implicit in
inland college material would

191
00:11:58 --> 00:12:01
necessarily come through and judy
collins reading would be much sweeter

192
00:12:01 --> 00:12:05
but it&#39;s a transformation job from from
top to bottom I mean you know if you

193
00:12:05 --> 00:12:08
listen to judy collins doing something
like turn to internal or something to

198
00:12:21 --> 00:12:24
I

199
00:12:24 --> 00:12:28
I think anybody listening to her songs
we would have been alerted to learn

200
00:12:28 --> 00:12:32
Conan as an important songwriter and one
to watch but it certainly would have had

201
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
a rude awakening when they heard learn
and cons own version which would have

202
00:12:34 --> 00:12:38
been totally different of course now
close friends in april nineteen

203
00:12:38 --> 00:12:42
sixty-seven Collins invited cohen on
stage at an anti-vietnam war benefit

204
00:12:42 --> 00:12:46
concert to perform Suzanne despite stage
nerves

205
00:12:46 --> 00:12:49
his performance convinced many that he
was not just a composer but a very

206
00:12:49 --> 00:12:53
distinctive singer-songwriter he was
soon signed to columbia by john hammond

207
00:12:53 --> 00:12:56
the man who discovered Bob Dylan and
hurried into the studio to record a

208
00:12:56 --> 00:12:57
debut

209
00:12:57 --> 00:13:00
Hammond intended to take on the role of
producer but unable to find sufficient

210
00:13:00 --> 00:13:01
gaps in his schedule

211
00:13:01 --> 00:13:05
the position was transferred to young
talent John Simon he had been signed by

212
00:13:05 --> 00:13:08
John Hammond and letters complaint at
the time was that

213
00:13:08 --> 00:13:14
Leonard was holed up in the Chelsea
Hotel and he would have a session with

214
00:13:14 --> 00:13:17
john hammond and john hammond would say
some at some point during the session

215
00:13:17 --> 00:13:21
right before the session i&#39;m sorry i had
to stop right to cancel the session and

216
00:13:21 --> 00:13:25
Leonard was there for another month of
the Chelsea Hotel down this session so

217
00:13:25 --> 00:13:29
he had asked columbia I suppose for a
different producer and they paired us up

218
00:13:29 --> 00:13:37
well first I knew him as a poet you know
and then I began to realize the kind of

219
00:13:37 --> 00:13:42
musician he was he wasn&#39;t a guitar
player like most of the artists that i

220
00:13:42 --> 00:13:46
was working with the most of the artists
came up through listen to pop music so

221
00:13:46 --> 00:13:50
they knew how to play in a rock and
roller blue something like that

222
00:13:50 --> 00:13:56
Leonard apparently learned how to play
classical guitar because he did those

223
00:13:56 --> 00:13:59
things like

224
00:13:59 --> 00:14:04
real fast real fast it was very easy to
record and it was a pleasure it was a

225
00:14:04 --> 00:14:08
pleasure to record any smart you know
it&#39;s a lot of these acts that I recorded

226
00:14:08 --> 00:14:13
they weren&#39;t too smart but Leonard was
you know it&#39;s martin and and fun to be

227
00:14:13 --> 00:14:19
with and full of insight about things so
I was an honor to work with letter you

228
00:14:19 --> 00:14:20
know in a pleasure

229
00:14:20 --> 00:14:24
Cowen&#39;s debut songs of leonard cohen was
a distinguished record both in its

230
00:14:24 --> 00:14:28
classical sound and in the remarkable
poetry of the lyrics with its unique

231
00:14:28 --> 00:14:32
opening track Suzanne it heralded the
arrival of an intimate and enigmatic

232
00:14:32 --> 00:14:38
voice in modern music is and takes you
down to a place near

233
00:14:38 --> 00:14:41
the random you can hear

234
00:14:41 --> 00:14:42
go by

235
00:14:42 --> 00:14:43
spin and

236
00:14:43 --> 00:14:51
the side Suzanne as a song I think
epitomizes most of the virtues that you

237
00:14:51 --> 00:14:57
hear in those early leonard cohen songs
in that it is written from life

238
00:14:57 --> 00:15:01
not that you know that necessarily when
you first hear it and not that you need

239
00:15:01 --> 00:15:04
to know it but it is very specific

240
00:15:04 --> 00:15:10
Suzanne was indeed a woman that he knew
in montreal and she did have a place by

241
00:15:10 --> 00:15:14
the water and she did feed UT and
oranges because apparently her

242
00:15:14 --> 00:15:15
speciality was this

243
00:15:15 --> 00:15:20
this T that she brewed with with bits of
orange peel in it so it&#39;s all drawn from

244
00:15:20 --> 00:15:25
experience but then of course it&#39;s for
universal in terms of its romantic

245
00:15:25 --> 00:15:28
message and that was the key

246
00:15:28 --> 00:15:37
I think it was this ability to take very
precisely observe details like the tea

247
00:15:37 --> 00:15:42
and oranges and from that create
something that was totally nonspecific

248
00:15:42 --> 00:15:49
and and entirely universal i was at the
point where i was experimenting

249
00:15:49 --> 00:15:54
I&#39;ll hold it was at the time 24 25
something like that and i had no idea

250
00:15:54 --> 00:15:59
what I was doing so I was using my
producing to experiment on things and

251
00:15:59 --> 00:16:04
one thing I tried with lenders album
that I really liked and I still like to

252
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
this day is the use of women&#39;s voices
instead of instruments

253
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
and you want to travel with

254
00:16:10 --> 00:16:12
and you want to travel

255
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
blind

256
00:16:14 --> 00:16:15
she was

257
00:16:15 --> 00:16:15
trust you

258
00:16:15 --> 00:16:18
for you touched her perfect

259
00:16:18 --> 00:16:23
with your mind I love the first album
and I loved what john simon did to it

260
00:16:23 --> 00:16:28
I always you know people complained
about all the girls and all that stuff

261
00:16:28 --> 00:16:35
I always thought this is cool : is
actually for more vulgar than people

262
00:16:35 --> 00:16:36
think he is

263
00:16:36 --> 00:16:39
and that&#39;s good I like that about him

264
00:16:39 --> 00:16:43
I&#39;m glad he&#39;s not Joni Mitchell his
first album is very spare and to me

265
00:16:43 --> 00:16:48
completely unlistenable I guess the the
critical consensus on the record at the

266
00:16:48 --> 00:16:53
time was a slight disappointment but
ready to give him the benefit of the

267
00:16:53 --> 00:16:55
doubt but to me I thought it magnified
him

268
00:16:55 --> 00:16:57
I thought it made him better and it was
actually the second record that I don&#39;t

269
00:16:57 --> 00:17:01
like so much that&#39;s when he spared down
and I prefer them a little schlock done

270
00:17:01 --> 00:17:02
myself

271
00:17:02 --> 00:17:05
there&#39;s an authority to that first
letter code record in a sense it&#39;s not a

272
00:17:05 --> 00:17:09
debut it&#39;s almost more like the next
collection of stories or poems by

273
00:17:09 --> 00:17:14
Leonard Cohen you know it didn&#39;t have
that tend to feel that even great

274
00:17:14 --> 00:17:20
sixties debut albums have this is
somebody who clearly had an established

275
00:17:20 --> 00:17:24
voice as an artist even though he was
not tremendously well known in the

276
00:17:24 --> 00:17:28
United States you know you were not
listening to somebody trying things out

277
00:17:28 --> 00:17:34
there was such a you know I the album is
very centered

278
00:17:34 --> 00:17:38
you know did it just hits spot on what
it&#39;s going for

279
00:17:38 --> 00:17:41
there&#39;s something really extraordinary
about a debut album an artist has been

280
00:17:41 --> 00:17:45
writing these songs for quite a number
of years generally and so that the cream

281
00:17:45 --> 00:17:49
of the crop songs the best songs and
they don&#39;t want to save the second the

282
00:17:49 --> 00:17:51
best on to the second album they don&#39;t
want to give you the second best cause

283
00:17:51 --> 00:17:56
you want to give you their best songs
and along with that is the fact that the

284
00:17:56 --> 00:18:01
second album is often the most difficult
to do because debut album will come out

285
00:18:01 --> 00:18:04
it will be since that big sensation and
people say well what&#39;s this clown got to

286
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07
follow up with and then they&#39;re stuck
and they have to really scramble and

287
00:18:07 --> 00:18:08
right fast and

288
00:18:08 --> 00:18:12
sometimes the second album is forced and
contrived but the first album is always

289
00:18:12 --> 00:18:17
genuine and then the the result of the
artist&#39;s soul from the time that they

290
00:18:17 --> 00:18:21
were born until the time that they make
that album the album said someone at the

291
00:18:21 --> 00:18:26
top of most people&#39;s memory card opens
when it&#39;s difficult to find what comes

292
00:18:26 --> 00:18:29
second and third and fourth but i think
most people would we put that at the top

293
00:18:29 --> 00:18:32
and sweeping up in joke

294
00:18:32 --> 00:18:33
they left behind

295
00:18:33 --> 00:18:33
fine

296
00:18:33 --> 00:18:33
you did not

297
00:18:33 --> 00:18:35
leave you very much

298
00:18:35 --> 00:18:36
then laughter and

299
00:18:36 --> 00:18:37
like it

300
00:18:37 --> 00:18:38
dealer

301
00:18:38 --> 00:18:42
watching for the car is so high and wild

302
00:18:42 --> 00:18:46
need to deal another the words were what
this was about

303
00:18:46 --> 00:18:54
and the music attempted to evoke commute
a mood but not in any nothing certainly

304
00:18:54 --> 00:18:57
not in any aggressive way was just
things were kind of sketched in

305
00:18:57 --> 00:19:00
where&#39;s the words are not sketched in
the words are mysterious and enigmatic

306
00:19:00 --> 00:19:06
but there are plenty of them and you
know so he&#39;s he&#39;s almost reciting you

307
00:19:06 --> 00:19:10
know his singing voice is almost a kind
of recitation has a very hypnotic

308
00:19:10 --> 00:19:11
quality

309
00:19:11 --> 00:19:17
so again you know in era of the high
psychedelia and you know the wonder of

310
00:19:17 --> 00:19:20
the studio and all these great sonic
possibilities that everybody was

311
00:19:20 --> 00:19:22
interested in you know this

312
00:19:22 --> 00:19:25
he was coming from a whole other place
this is coming from inside

313
00:19:25 --> 00:19:30
they&#39;re not complicated songs musically
but they&#39;re complicated in terms of the

314
00:19:30 --> 00:19:35
language and in terms of the imagery and
in terms of the issues that he wants to

315
00:19:35 --> 00:19:41
confront but now another stranger seems
to want you to ignore his dream

316
00:19:41 --> 00:19:43
as though they were the burden

317
00:19:43 --> 00:19:45
I have another

318
00:19:45 --> 00:19:46
you&#39;ve seen that man

319
00:19:46 --> 00:19:47
before his gold and I

320
00:19:47 --> 00:19:52
this action card now it&#39;s rusted from
the elbow through the finger

321
00:19:52 --> 00:19:55
i felt i was working with a poet who
said his words to the song

322
00:19:55 --> 00:20:04
blenders lyrics set him apart from most
rock and roll X because they were more

323
00:20:04 --> 00:20:10
finely crafted the imagery was there
they the wonderfully crazy imagery that

324
00:20:10 --> 00:20:18
you&#39;d find Dylan or anybody but the
balance in the lines and the inner

325
00:20:18 --> 00:20:22
rhymes in the scansion that is the
number of beats per line everything was

326
00:20:22 --> 00:20:27
regular and perfect and school and
studied this is a guy who read poetry

327
00:20:27 --> 00:20:36
wrote poetry and I&#39;d be hard-pressed to
think of somebody who had that kind of

328
00:20:36 --> 00:20:37
chops

329
00:20:37 --> 00:20:41
you know coming into the dragon roll
field on his entrance into the late

330
00:20:41 --> 00:20:43
nineteen sixties music arena

331
00:20:43 --> 00:20:47
Cowen&#39;s profound poetic lyrics as well
as the spare beauty of his songs led to

332
00:20:47 --> 00:20:50
inevitable comparisons with the crown
prince of american singer songwriters

333
00:20:50 --> 00:20:50
Bob Dylan

334
00:20:50 --> 00:20:54
despite the obvious differences between
the two artists many music critics

335
00:20:54 --> 00:20:58
dismissed Cohen has yet another in a
long line of dylan wanna be is a lot of

336
00:20:58 --> 00:21:04
the misconceptions about comment came
from the obvious Dylan connections his

337
00:21:04 --> 00:21:08
songwriting instantly connected into
Dylan the fact that it was discovered by

338
00:21:08 --> 00:21:11
John Henry Hammond instantly connected
at the tail and the fact it was on CBS

339
00:21:11 --> 00:21:12
records connected into Dylan

340
00:21:12 --> 00:21:16
there&#39;s also the fact that they&#39;re both
Jewish they that they&#39;re both great

341
00:21:16 --> 00:21:21
words myths and they both you know you
tend to use biblical imagery apocalyptic

342
00:21:21 --> 00:21:24
imagery occasionally they&#39;re both right
slightly twisted love songs occasionally

343
00:21:24 --> 00:21:30
there&#39;s romance tempered with a certain
pessimism and darkness and melancholy

344
00:21:30 --> 00:21:31
and both of them as well

345
00:21:31 --> 00:21:34
so the connection seems to be implicit

346
00:21:34 --> 00:21:36
evenings and I

347
00:21:36 --> 00:21:40
return into sand man is from my hand

348
00:21:40 --> 00:21:44
let me blindly here is watch the light
sleeper

349
00:21:44 --> 00:21:49
my this amazes me I&#39;m branded on my feet

350
00:21:49 --> 00:21:50
I know why

351
00:21:50 --> 00:21:51
me too

352
00:21:51 --> 00:21:53
ancient empty streets to death

353
00:21:53 --> 00:22:01
Rahima it&#39;s not meaning it was the
desperate thing that people did flailing

354
00:22:01 --> 00:22:08
about Colin was plainly a very different
kind of versa fire been Dylan at that

355
00:22:08 --> 00:22:15
point Dylan was free associating plus a
calling on old sources but he was doing

356
00:22:15 --> 00:22:19
more free associating it was in the
melodies that he did you use the old

357
00:22:19 --> 00:22:24
sources more than the words whereas
Colin was a somebody who had been

358
00:22:24 --> 00:22:30
writing full-time on the page for I
guess six seven eight years by the time

359
00:22:30 --> 00:22:39
he put out that first record and it&#39;s
much more controlled

360
00:22:39 --> 00:22:45
I think the only point where the
comparison with Dylan was a fail or

361
00:22:45 --> 00:22:46
relevant

362
00:22:46 --> 00:22:55
one was that actually for the first time
you had here a songwriter who not only

363
00:22:55 --> 00:23:02
wrote the words as great as Dylan but
probably as a poet exceeded Dylan

364
00:23:02 --> 00:23:05
so of course he was going to be compared
because you know there weren&#39;t any other

365
00:23:05 --> 00:23:08
fish in the pond or if the world they
were me know

366
00:23:08 --> 00:23:12
see there that these two giant beasts
and in in literary terms

367
00:23:12 --> 00:23:19
I think the difference between them is
that Dylan was a songwriter is a

368
00:23:19 --> 00:23:20
songwriter not a poet

369
00:23:20 --> 00:23:27
that is to say the music and the words
work together and if you read that big

370
00:23:27 --> 00:23:33
tome of Dylan&#39;s lyrics they don&#39;t
necessarily stand up that well a lot of

371
00:23:33 --> 00:23:38
them on the page they they need the
music - to hold their hand as it were

372
00:23:38 --> 00:23:40
they working concert

373
00:23:40 --> 00:23:45
come undoubtedly was a poet as we know
he was a published poet before he was a

374
00:23:45 --> 00:23:55
recorded songwriter and in a way he
doesn&#39;t write songs in this . he puts

375
00:23:55 --> 00:23:59
poetry to music and that&#39;s the
distinction i think between Dillon and

376
00:23:59 --> 00:24:03
cone at this time because he was a
writer to begin with

377
00:24:03 --> 00:24:09
people always think about his words we
these books on him and then and it&#39;s

378
00:24:09 --> 00:24:10
verbal analysis

379
00:24:10 --> 00:24:13
I think one reason he was as arresting
as he was

380
00:24:13 --> 00:24:24
is that however he came upon it he had a
musical neck and you don&#39;t have to

381
00:24:24 --> 00:24:25
understand

382
00:24:25 --> 00:24:34
musical technique very well to know that
a good melody is where you find it that

383
00:24:34 --> 00:24:39
they are at that you can have all the
training in the world and not be able to

384
00:24:39 --> 00:24:40
write good melodies

385
00:24:40 --> 00:24:46
you could have no training and have an
absolute genius for it and I wouldn&#39;t

386
00:24:46 --> 00:24:51
say genius is exactly where I&#39;d put him
but he definitely had a talent for it

387
00:24:51 --> 00:24:58
and and without much question in my mind
it was the melodies as well as all the

388
00:24:58 --> 00:25:01
rest of the stuff that made it happen if
he hadn&#39;t had the melodies

389
00:25:01 --> 00:25:04
nobody would have it wouldn&#39;t have
happened

390
00:25:04 --> 00:25:07
I suppose that he told you everything

391
00:25:07 --> 00:25:10
and keep locked away in my head

392
00:25:10 --> 00:25:11
your master

393
00:25:11 --> 00:25:13
to view travel

394
00:25:13 --> 00:25:14
well at least that

395
00:25:14 --> 00:25:20
would use this simplicity of the guitar
accompaniment on songs of Leonard Colin

396
00:25:20 --> 00:25:26
itself made a kind of . there was a kind
of elegance very simple melodic elegance

397
00:25:26 --> 00:25:26
to it

398
00:25:26 --> 00:25:29
it wasn&#39;t trying too hard to appeal to
you and it was very clearly in an

399
00:25:29 --> 00:25:31
accompaniment to his voice

400
00:25:31 --> 00:25:36
I think the other notice of the sound
that did stand out from what was

401
00:25:36 --> 00:25:39
happening in rock and roll at that time
with dylan haven&#39;t gone electric and so

402
00:25:39 --> 00:25:39
on and so forth

403
00:25:39 --> 00:25:47
he tapped into that the European Jack
brel type thing and you can hear that in

404
00:25:47 --> 00:25:53
the voice as well and that was somehow
to me as a teenage kid listening to to

405
00:25:53 --> 00:25:58
learn to code this was very grown up you
know in 1956

406
00:25:58 --> 00:26:03
I don&#39;t think he was really listening to
chuck berry and a little richard he&#39;s

407
00:26:03 --> 00:26:05
not a child of the rock and roll era

408
00:26:05 --> 00:26:08
I guess is what I&#39;m trying to say dumb

409
00:26:08 --> 00:26:15
I think that inevitably had quite a
profound impact on the sound

410
00:26:15 --> 00:26:18
I mean with dylan you know even on the
early so called photo record you can

411
00:26:18 --> 00:26:21
kind of hear the rock and roller try to
get out

412
00:26:21 --> 00:26:25
he never get that feeling with Lana :
the album songs of leonard cohen was

413
00:26:25 --> 00:26:30
released on Boxing Day 1967 receiving
very limited public attention in the US

414
00:26:30 --> 00:26:34
but fairing far better in europe and
canada comin promoted the album with

415
00:26:34 --> 00:26:37
live shows and television appearances
both in Britain and Canada and with a

416
00:26:37 --> 00:26:39
tour of major American cities which
included an appearance at the

417
00:26:39 --> 00:26:44
prestigious newport folk festival like
Dylan before him and found that despite

418
00:26:44 --> 00:26:45
his obvious talents

419
00:26:45 --> 00:26:50
his voice was limiting his appeal both
to the public and to the music press or

420
00:26:50 --> 00:26:55
con voice at the start of his career was
always regarded as a problem by people

421
00:26:55 --> 00:26:58
it was an impediment to their enjoyment
in in many respects because it was

422
00:26:58 --> 00:26:59
unusual for the time

423
00:26:59 --> 00:27:02
you must remember it was only 10 12
years since the age of the crooners that

424
00:27:02 --> 00:27:02
whatever

425
00:27:02 --> 00:27:07
and we&#39;ve been through basic be pop
music and the folks for eternity

426
00:27:07 --> 00:27:12
you know how its own standards and
styles and Colin was was somewhat alien

427
00:27:12 --> 00:27:16
to all of that he was a distinctive
voice but not necessarily an attractive

428
00:27:16 --> 00:27:20
one or a radio-friendly one and it&#39;s
interesting if you if you look at the

429
00:27:20 --> 00:27:26
trajectory of you know vocalist since by
nineteen seventy say people getting a

430
00:27:26 --> 00:27:30
bit more comfortable with cones voice by
the mid-seventies it doesn&#39;t seem to be

431
00:27:30 --> 00:27:33
such a problem anymore and by the end of
the seventies its mainstream almost

432
00:27:33 --> 00:27:38
because eccentric vocalist as as they
would have been called one more

433
00:27:38 --> 00:27:43
prevalent in in the rock n roll era that
first album its kind of it it&#39;s not

434
00:27:43 --> 00:27:46
completely jarring after this isn&#39;t is
appearing in a context in which people

435
00:27:46 --> 00:27:50
have dealt with bob dylan&#39;s voice and
he&#39;s is similar and that&#39;s a bit of a

436
00:27:50 --> 00:27:53
non voice but he has a bit more of a
kind of natural melodic quality than

437
00:27:53 --> 00:27:58
still never did and it&#39;s not quite as
grating but you over the years the voice

438
00:27:58 --> 00:28:02
it just gets deeper and deeper and
deeper and deeper so he&#39;s kind of

439
00:28:02 --> 00:28:06
gravely and experience and careworn you
know really early on but your anything

440
00:28:06 --> 00:28:09
from on your man on would you play it
too loudly kills goldfish

441
00:28:09 --> 00:28:18
it was about conveying intimacy he
really something about is that the

442
00:28:18 --> 00:28:21
quality of his voice is that the way he
dramatizes himself

443
00:28:21 --> 00:28:27
I think that these things are very
mysterious and I i don&#39;t believe that

444
00:28:27 --> 00:28:30
I&#39;ve ever pinned it down it&#39;s like
trying to describe a reason franklyn&#39;s

445
00:28:30 --> 00:28:36
voice and he described why it is that
landed : makes you feel intimate with

446
00:28:36 --> 00:28:38
him but he does

447
00:28:38 --> 00:28:42
so you want to engage him when you hear
this voice coming out of the speakers

448
00:28:42 --> 00:28:46
he has that quality after a chance
meeting with nashville-based producer

449
00:28:46 --> 00:28:49
bob johnston he would notably worked the
Bob Dylan the singer-songwriters

450
00:28:49 --> 00:28:53
previous two releases Cohen decided but
his sophomore album required both the

451
00:28:53 --> 00:28:55
change of scene and of personnel

452
00:28:55 --> 00:28:59
he moved to an isolated farmhouse in
Franklin Tennessee and enlisted Johnston

453
00:28:59 --> 00:29:00
services for the recording of the album

454
00:29:00 --> 00:29:05
songs from a room it surprised many on
its release its contents far more somber

455
00:29:05 --> 00:29:09
and melancholic and the songs of his
debut the second album i think was the

456
00:29:09 --> 00:29:11
way in which he believed the music
should go

457
00:29:11 --> 00:29:17
I think he was striving to remove the
music the sound out of the studio into

458
00:29:17 --> 00:29:22
the self and so he doesn&#39;t recorded in
New York in Tennessee

459
00:29:22 --> 00:29:27
he was living on this remarkable little
farm in Franklin Tennessee which is

460
00:29:27 --> 00:29:31
about which I have been to which is
about 30 miles perhaps out of nashville

461
00:29:31 --> 00:29:37
and it was very influenced by the
isolation of that and that fit his

462
00:29:37 --> 00:29:39
romantic notion of the artist the artist

463
00:29:39 --> 00:29:44
this is really out of Byron and it&#39;s out
of shelley and it&#39;s even out of blake is

464
00:29:44 --> 00:29:49
a bard present past and future seas and
he is alone on the mountaintop

465
00:29:49 --> 00:29:54
Leonard was alone occasional woman of
course but alone in the small little

466
00:29:54 --> 00:29:58
farm in Franklin Tennessee where he
actually recorded some of the songs

467
00:29:58 --> 00:29:58
right there

468
00:29:58 --> 00:30:02
very minimalist manner and then we go
into nashville and you know do a studio

469
00:30:02 --> 00:30:07
version of it but i think it was for him
but he believed to be the natural the

470
00:30:07 --> 00:30:10
natural evolution of his music

471
00:30:10 --> 00:30:14
when they poured across the border I was
passion to surrender

472
00:30:14 --> 00:30:16
this I could do

473
00:30:16 --> 00:30:18
you

474
00:30:18 --> 00:30:19
I took my gun

475
00:30:19 --> 00:30:21
and

476
00:30:21 --> 00:30:25
the nature of those songs how they were
recorded the absence of ornamentation

477
00:30:25 --> 00:30:30
musical ornamentation was what he wanted
which I think he also felt was part of a

478
00:30:30 --> 00:30:36
certain purity to the music that he
wanted to intensify even his songs a

479
00:30:36 --> 00:30:42
letter , and sounded like you know
completely fully conceived work

480
00:30:42 --> 00:30:45
I think Leonard Cohen felt that he had
further to go

481
00:30:45 --> 00:30:49
you know Justin and what he wanted to
pursue and so the be even more extreme

482
00:30:49 --> 00:30:55
starkness of the second album gets at
that

483
00:30:55 --> 00:30:58
you know just how far can i really take
this

484
00:30:58 --> 00:31:02
it is more straight down it is
beautifully titled songs from a room you

485
00:31:02 --> 00:31:07
know that that that that sort of sums up
both the sound of the record and the

486
00:31:07 --> 00:31:12
sentiment of the lyrics it&#39;s got this
chamber quality for those who who have

487
00:31:12 --> 00:31:17
this image of Leonard Cohen is that
guitar strumming troubadour this is the

488
00:31:17 --> 00:31:19
closest the truest it gets to that sound

489
00:31:19 --> 00:31:23
below the majority of the album
maintained this minimalist aesthetic for

490
00:31:23 --> 00:31:26
many its strongest track was the
slightly more embellished opener bird on

491
00:31:26 --> 00:31:26
a while

492
00:31:26 --> 00:31:30
based on a lyric he had developed while
staying in the island of Hedra it would

493
00:31:30 --> 00:31:34
become like Susan on the previous album
one of cones most recognized signature

494
00:31:34 --> 00:31:37
tunes and a firm life favorite for the
rest of his career

495
00:31:37 --> 00:31:41
yeah

496
00:31:41 --> 00:31:42
like a drunk

497
00:31:42 --> 00:31:45
in some more

498
00:31:45 --> 00:31:48
I

499
00:31:48 --> 00:31:51
in my

500
00:31:51 --> 00:31:54
to be true

501
00:31:54 --> 00:31:58
it comes from a very of course prosaic
account of what actually happened it&#39;s

502
00:31:58 --> 00:32:02
it&#39;s about telegraph poles that were
introduced into the island for the first

503
00:32:02 --> 00:32:06
times that we have been echoed on this
Islands seemingly free from civilization

504
00:32:06 --> 00:32:09
you know writing in isolation and
suddenly you know technology and this is

505
00:32:09 --> 00:32:13
his world and he sees it but probably
window he sees a bird perched upon a

506
00:32:13 --> 00:32:17
wire and that inspired him to write this
this song about freedom but i think this

507
00:32:17 --> 00:32:23
the fact that the longing to be free is
a motif as well within the song that

508
00:32:23 --> 00:32:28
connects with people particularly the
late sixties and it&#39;s it&#39;s just it&#39;s

509
00:32:28 --> 00:32:31
it&#39;s a stronger it from the time and
this is something that that people just

510
00:32:31 --> 00:32:34
like to cover as well and I think the
effect that it

511
00:32:34 --> 00:32:38
you know it is so amenable to being a
cover version makes makes it more

512
00:32:38 --> 00:32:41
Universal than it might otherwise it
then I think the reason that so many

513
00:32:41 --> 00:32:44
people have come back to it and the
reason why he had stood up as part of

514
00:32:44 --> 00:32:48
his own work is that it&#39;s it is a great
tune you wouldn&#39;t necessarily know it

515
00:32:48 --> 00:32:52
from listening to his version with a
fabulous tune and it&#39;s something you

516
00:32:52 --> 00:32:54
could say about any of these lyrics but
it&#39;s a great lyric

517
00:32:54 --> 00:32:57
the couple of like a worm on a hook like
a knight from an old-fashioned book

518
00:32:57 --> 00:33:00
I think his description of of men in
love

519
00:33:00 --> 00:33:04
I think you have right there what we
think we are what we&#39;d like to be easy

520
00:33:04 --> 00:33:07
night in the old-fashioned book and yet
i think in those circumstances what we

521
00:33:07 --> 00:33:10
usually actually are a lot of the time
which is the worm on the hook and i

522
00:33:10 --> 00:33:13
think that&#39;s that&#39;s a that&#39;s a
definitive one in current moment right

523
00:33:13 --> 00:33:13
there

524
00:33:13 --> 00:33:17
if you had to pick one song to sum up
the appeal of leather covered that that

525
00:33:17 --> 00:33:23
might well be it you know from that
opening line like a bird on a wire like

526
00:33:23 --> 00:33:27
a drunk in a midnight choir I have tried
in my way to be free

527
00:33:27 --> 00:33:31
it seems to be a him for all those
beautiful losers that he&#39;d written about

528
00:33:31 --> 00:33:34
in the novel the drunk in a midnight
choir

529
00:33:34 --> 00:33:37
that we all associate with you and we
don&#39;t know this want to be the sort of

530
00:33:37 --> 00:33:41
pretty little choirboy who hits every no
spot on you

531
00:33:41 --> 00:33:44
much rather be the drunk in the back row
who wants to be part of it and he&#39;s

532
00:33:44 --> 00:33:45
actually joining in

533
00:33:45 --> 00:33:50
from the very best of motives and
spirits and what is hatched paper

534
00:33:50 --> 00:33:54
everything the whole thing and you try
to express yourself and this is my way

535
00:33:54 --> 00:33:59
of trying to be free and yeah there&#39;s
something about that song that really

536
00:33:59 --> 00:34:04
sums up the spirit of what early that
occurred was all about the album was

537
00:34:04 --> 00:34:07
released in april nineteen sixty-nine
and was a tremendous success in Europe

538
00:34:07 --> 00:34:11
it reached number two in the british
charts and made Cohen a star in France

539
00:34:11 --> 00:34:16
where in one periodical he was declared
focusing of the year yet in America he

540
00:34:16 --> 00:34:19
was struggling to secure a sizable
mainstream audience

541
00:34:19 --> 00:34:22
despite three tracks from his debut
appearing prominently in robert altman&#39;s

542
00:34:22 --> 00:34:24
revisionist Western McCabe and mrs.
Miller

543
00:34:24 --> 00:34:28
to this day a large north american
families is something that Cohen has

544
00:34:28 --> 00:34:33
still not attracted it always was a
sense of his being a little removed in

545
00:34:33 --> 00:34:33
the US

546
00:34:33 --> 00:34:36
partly because it&#39;s such a you know it&#39;s
a big country you know you

547
00:34:36 --> 00:34:39
it really is hard work to become a star
you know if people think you know what

548
00:34:39 --> 00:34:43
happens overnight and sometimes it does
but you have to really want it and be

549
00:34:43 --> 00:34:45
willing to do whatever it takes

550
00:34:45 --> 00:34:48
and I don&#39;t think we&#39;re gonna have a
particularly felt that way

551
00:34:48 --> 00:34:53
so along with you know the fact that
he&#39;s writing complicated songs and the

552
00:34:53 --> 00:34:57
fact that is his singing voice is not
necessarily you know

553
00:34:57 --> 00:35:03
ok I&#39;ll conventional hit sounding voice
you know you have a fact of a person an

554
00:35:03 --> 00:35:06
artist who is probably a little
ambivalent about all that stuff

555
00:35:06 --> 00:35:09
Leonard is not interested in
entertaining he&#39;s interested in engaging

556
00:35:09 --> 00:35:14
and that&#39;s what he&#39;s able to do with
that music both recorded and in person

557
00:35:14 --> 00:35:17
he engages the audience he does not
entertain them

558
00:35:17 --> 00:35:22
it appeals to certain people very
strongly but it is not mainstream

559
00:35:22 --> 00:35:26
what are his album sales compared to
dylan&#39;s and probably i don&#39;t even think

560
00:35:26 --> 00:35:27
there are third

561
00:35:27 --> 00:35:27
if you did the top

562
00:35:27 --> 00:35:33
little figures right of Dylan&#39;s doin has
at some point in his career and probably

563
00:35:33 --> 00:35:39
very early on encourage the mainstream
effort and terms of how his career is

564
00:35:39 --> 00:35:45
managed where he has performed the kinds
of songs you rights and certainly how

565
00:35:45 --> 00:35:50
his albums and have been marketed
Leonard doesn&#39;t take that proactive you

566
00:35:50 --> 00:35:51
at all

567
00:35:51 --> 00:35:57
and you know he recognizes he&#39;s a minor
voice and he&#39;s been relatively satisfied

568
00:35:57 --> 00:36:01
with that you never get the sense that
Leonard is so frustrated in not crossing

569
00:36:01 --> 00:36:07
the line to be in what the top ten
billboard albums of the week in march

570
00:36:07 --> 00:36:12
1970 work began on songs for a further
album rooted firmly in Nashville

571
00:36:12 --> 00:36:15
goin once again teamed up with Bob
Johnston who suggested the use of a

572
00:36:15 --> 00:36:18
group of musicians with whom he had
worked on Dylan&#39;s recent new morning

573
00:36:18 --> 00:36:23
album guitarist run Cornelius became the
impromptu bandleader and was involved

574
00:36:23 --> 00:36:26
both in the instrumentation of the
as-yet-untitled new record

575
00:36:26 --> 00:36:30
and with the preparations for a full
band live tool day one

576
00:36:30 --> 00:36:32
all I knew was that I was getting
involved with somebody that was a

577
00:36:32 --> 00:36:37
intellectual classical guy that doesn&#39;t
sing very well you know they just like

578
00:36:37 --> 00:36:40
that and it it took me a little while to
really understand

579
00:36:40 --> 00:36:44
you know really what we&#39;re dealing with
here you know and so therefore it became

580
00:36:44 --> 00:36:45
more of a mission

581
00:36:45 --> 00:36:49
you know and I think I when I say that
I&#39;m sorry i I&#39;m I&#39;m really talking about

582
00:36:49 --> 00:36:53
the girls I&#39;m talking about the players
in the band we were it was so much like

583
00:36:53 --> 00:36:57
a family that it was like we were on
this this mission together you know with

584
00:36:57 --> 00:37:00
many of the new songs written and the
musicians fully prepared

585
00:37:00 --> 00:37:03
co and delayed the studio recording and
went on the road with this new band the

586
00:37:03 --> 00:37:03
army

587
00:37:03 --> 00:37:07
the tour which encompassed many European
destinations as well as major American

588
00:37:07 --> 00:37:10
and Canadian cities also included a
performance at the prestigious isle of

589
00:37:10 --> 00:37:12
wight festival alongside the doors

590
00:37:12 --> 00:37:16
the who miles davis and Jimi Hendrix
translating what had often been acoustic

591
00:37:16 --> 00:37:20
tracks into a live context required a
very disciplined approach from the band

592
00:37:20 --> 00:37:26
we knew that Leonard&#39;s letters message
is lyrics everything we had to make sure

593
00:37:26 --> 00:37:30
that the people that came to see him got
what they wanted to see it became such a

594
00:37:30 --> 00:37:39
such a a unique delivery that it was
like it was like that feeling that if

595
00:37:39 --> 00:37:42
one person wasn&#39;t there you couldn&#39;t do
it that night it was a big

596
00:37:42 --> 00:37:46
responsibility on me because being the
bandleader and that if if if anything

597
00:37:46 --> 00:37:47
wasn&#39;t right

598
00:37:47 --> 00:37:52
they came to me they didn&#39;t go to the
person that wasn&#39;t what we you know that

599
00:37:52 --> 00:37:55
was that it wasn&#39;t hitting it at night
you know they would come to me and then

600
00:37:55 --> 00:37:58
I would have to go to that person say we
need to get together with this and fix

601
00:37:58 --> 00:37:59
this or fix that but

602
00:37:59 --> 00:38:04
consequently it was it was a real effort
by everybody and it was it truly was

603
00:38:04 --> 00:38:06
like a family running all over the world
and

604
00:38:06 --> 00:38:10
it was some some of the some of the the
nicest music that I&#39;ve ever been

605
00:38:10 --> 00:38:13
involved then takes

606
00:38:13 --> 00:38:13
see

607
00:38:13 --> 00:38:13
to the river

608
00:38:13 --> 00:38:17
she&#39;s wearing rags and feathers

609
00:38:17 --> 00:38:20
from salvation army

610
00:38:20 --> 00:38:27
and this Leonard as a performer is
happiest i think when he&#39;s got company

611
00:38:27 --> 00:38:32
on stage he always has backup singers
and usually has us a substantial group

612
00:38:32 --> 00:38:33
accompanying him

613
00:38:33 --> 00:38:37
it&#39;s not just Leonard and a piano man or
Leonard and you know someone on a drum

614
00:38:37 --> 00:38:38
kit

615
00:38:38 --> 00:38:42
Leonard&#39;s concerts I think achieve their
effectiveness

616
00:38:42 --> 00:38:47
partly because he&#39;s got a community with
him and when he does perform and he goes

617
00:38:47 --> 00:38:52
on tour he establishes this community
that&#39;s crucial for him they provide a

618
00:38:52 --> 00:38:57
support for you know for him as the
performer the fundamental thing is that

619
00:38:57 --> 00:39:02
he is part of a group and that group is
becomes a tour family and they do things

620
00:39:02 --> 00:39:05
together they travel together Leonard
doesn&#39;t hop on the jet and everybody

621
00:39:05 --> 00:39:09
else comes by bus after the tour cohen
and the band returned to the studio to

622
00:39:09 --> 00:39:13
record the new songs under the watchful
eye of producer bob johnston Bob

623
00:39:13 --> 00:39:13
Johnston

624
00:39:13 --> 00:39:17
he was born with something that I don&#39;t
know if I&#39;ve ever seen that match up to

625
00:39:17 --> 00:39:28
before our sins his gift was he could
make somebody whether it be a musician

626
00:39:28 --> 00:39:29
or

627
00:39:29 --> 00:39:36
artist background singer an engineer he
could with he was born with the ability

628
00:39:36 --> 00:39:41
to make you want to do right here
tonight

629
00:39:41 --> 00:39:48
the best you&#39;ve ever done now musically
it is time to get it

630
00:39:48 --> 00:39:52
nothing yeah has no i didn&#39;t know 111
note from another

631
00:39:52 --> 00:39:58
really however a the gift that i just
described is priceless

632
00:39:58 --> 00:40:04
and as far as the music goes you know I
i I&#39;m I know what I&#39;m doing there

633
00:40:04 --> 00:40:07
and so with with with me there

634
00:40:07 --> 00:40:12
Leonard out front and Bob being able to
fire everyone up to the to the hilt

635
00:40:12 --> 00:40:15
I mean magic can happen when you get
that kind of stuff together

636
00:40:15 --> 00:40:20
the album songs of love and hate was
released in March 1971 combining both

637
00:40:20 --> 00:40:25
familiar spare acoustic numbers with
live tracks that captured the new full

638
00:40:25 --> 00:40:26
band sound

639
00:40:26 --> 00:40:29
despite its lack of commercial success

640
00:40:29 --> 00:40:33
it was received by many critics as
confirmation of cones unique talent and

641
00:40:33 --> 00:40:38
remains a landmark record in his cabinet
will love and hate is possibly then it

642
00:40:38 --> 00:40:42
goes bleep his album the cover alone
would suggest that always smile on the

643
00:40:42 --> 00:40:45
cover this is definitely it&#39;s black and
white hands

644
00:40:45 --> 00:40:50
although it&#39;s it&#39;s called songs of love
and hate and i&#39;m sure you know many

645
00:40:50 --> 00:40:54
critics of have looked at that album and
gone through and said yet that that&#39;s

646
00:40:54 --> 00:40:56
what about love that song about hate
that song about love that song about hey

647
00:40:56 --> 00:40:59
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s like that at all i
don&#39;t think it&#39;s it is structured as

648
00:40:59 --> 00:41:03
that would suggest i think the love and
hate in two mins let L be very strange

649
00:41:03 --> 00:41:07
in different ways at times there i think
there are at least elements of collins

650
00:41:07 --> 00:41:08
right humor

651
00:41:08 --> 00:41:14
coming through joan of arc for instance
which is a song about Niko the sometimes

652
00:41:14 --> 00:41:16
guessing of the velvet underground

653
00:41:16 --> 00:41:23
she was a known heroin addict
self-destructive in a sense and thus the

654
00:41:23 --> 00:41:27
image of Joan of Arc that i often find
my listened to that record i thought it

655
00:41:27 --> 00:41:28
that this is right huber on

656
00:41:28 --> 00:41:32
Collins part I mean he talks about a
smoky night the night suddenly becomes

657
00:41:32 --> 00:41:35
very smoking you said well you know Joan
of Arc was burned at the stake for

658
00:41:35 --> 00:41:40
goodness sake is you know it is he
playing with this and he puts a

659
00:41:40 --> 00:41:45
particular stress on the word heroin
when he&#39;s talking about joan of arc as a

660
00:41:45 --> 00:41:50
heroine and you think it&#39;s nico heroin
ok we get it but it is it is playful i

661
00:41:50 --> 00:41:54
think the cognoscenti and that&#39;s what
company is doing a lot there

662
00:41:54 --> 00:41:58
well I&#39;m glad to hear you talk this way

663
00:41:58 --> 00:42:07
you know I&#39;ve watched you riding every
day something in me

664
00:42:07 --> 00:42:11
to win I&#39;ve got a long career behind me

665
00:42:11 --> 00:42:15
he look at the color this hair you know
I got a long career behind me and I&#39;ve

666
00:42:15 --> 00:42:19
got I&#39;ve got a lot of accomplishments
songs of love and hates right out there

667
00:42:19 --> 00:42:19
in front

668
00:42:19 --> 00:42:22
I mean it may be to me one of the best
things I&#39;ve ever done

669
00:42:22 --> 00:42:28
you know it was one of the most involved
musical endeavors that I&#39;ve ever been

670
00:42:28 --> 00:42:29
involved with in the studio

671
00:42:29 --> 00:42:32
it was just something that you knew what
you were working on it that this is

672
00:42:32 --> 00:42:36
something that&#39;s very special and it&#39;s
got to be right and and we didn&#39;t settle

673
00:42:36 --> 00:42:37
for seconds

674
00:42:37 --> 00:42:39
it&#39;s for and

675
00:42:39 --> 00:42:42
morning the end december

676
00:42:42 --> 00:42:43
I&#39;m writing in the

677
00:42:43 --> 00:42:46
I just to see if you&#39;re better

678
00:42:46 --> 00:42:49
New York is cold

679
00:42:49 --> 00:42:51
where am I

680
00:42:51 --> 00:42:52
music on

681
00:42:52 --> 00:42:53
the street

682
00:42:53 --> 00:42:58
through the evening you know famous blue
raincoat is a boy that&#39;s but that&#39;s

683
00:42:58 --> 00:43:05
another one that although i don&#39;t relate
very well to the wake Owen relates to

684
00:43:05 --> 00:43:10
women in so far as you want it to some
dark then sums it up really good

685
00:43:10 --> 00:43:14
either it&#39;s explicitly autobiographical
or he wants people to think it&#39;s

686
00:43:14 --> 00:43:17
explicitly autobiographical there is no
other reason why you would finish the

687
00:43:17 --> 00:43:21
song with the line sincerely old coen he
really more than any other songs ever

688
00:43:21 --> 00:43:24
recorded it puts himself right into the
middle of this and it is it is a letter

689
00:43:24 --> 00:43:28
and it&#39;s fairly clear as the song goes
on but it is a letter to a former friend

690
00:43:28 --> 00:43:33
and now rival in love of his who his
wife seems to have left him for but

691
00:43:33 --> 00:43:39
she&#39;s come back so he&#39;s won but the
general tone of the record is that it&#39;s

692
00:43:39 --> 00:43:41
a a fairly hollow victory

693
00:43:41 --> 00:43:44
there are certain key things in the song
which you know leap out at you i think

694
00:43:44 --> 00:43:51
particularly there&#39;s some wonderful
lines in it is the line about Jane after

695
00:43:51 --> 00:43:56
the affair has taken place taking a
mentor a lock of hair that she takes

696
00:43:56 --> 00:44:07
from the unnamed adulterer and it&#39;s on
the night that he tried to go clear and

697
00:44:07 --> 00:44:09
then it can pointedly asked him in the
song you know

698
00:44:09 --> 00:44:12
did you ever get did you ever go clear
did you ever get clear clear a wall you

699
00:44:12 --> 00:44:16
know clear of drugs will know I i think
the clear is a pretty explicit reference

700
00:44:16 --> 00:44:21
to Scientology and we do know that the
cone was interesting Scientology of the

701
00:44:21 --> 00:44:21
time

702
00:44:21 --> 00:44:27
and to be clear was the the holy grail
of Scientology if you went clear and

703
00:44:27 --> 00:44:33
then you rid yourself of all new roces
it imbues you with almost superpowers

704
00:44:33 --> 00:44:34
took me to a new level

705
00:44:34 --> 00:44:37
did you ever go clear I mean that line
what a great line

706
00:44:37 --> 00:44:41
I mean in the interesting thing is that
you don&#39;t actually have to know that

707
00:44:41 --> 00:44:44
that&#39;s a scientist logical piece of
jargon

708
00:44:44 --> 00:44:50
you just know it&#39;s something like that
and it it is a perfect choice at the

709
00:44:50 --> 00:44:54
despair and pessimism of such tracks as
avalanche and the reference to suicide

710
00:44:54 --> 00:44:57
and dress rehearsal rag proved
off-putting to certain members of the

711
00:44:57 --> 00:45:00
music press who found cones work
depressing

712
00:45:00 --> 00:45:04
ever since his debut some critics had
reacted negatively to the melancholy of

713
00:45:04 --> 00:45:08
the leonard cohen sound and the painful
introspection in songs of love and hate

714
00:45:08 --> 00:45:13
led to further accusations that the
singer was indulgent and self-pitying or

715
00:45:13 --> 00:45:15
an impediment to the enjoyment of
leonard cohen for many listeners

716
00:45:15 --> 00:45:21
particular many mainstream lessness is
that they see songs as bleak is not

717
00:45:21 --> 00:45:26
coins that the no famously a review of
of souls 11 he said you know they should

718
00:45:26 --> 00:45:30
they should give razor blades wife when
they sell this out in stores or whatever

719
00:45:30 --> 00:45:35
and you know that is the popular image
of the early lead and kind and it&#39;s an

720
00:45:35 --> 00:45:38
image they took a long time to rid
himself often some people would say is

721
00:45:38 --> 00:45:43
still doesn&#39;t you know that those old
joke still used to this day I think it&#39;s

722
00:45:43 --> 00:45:52
true I did start to break down around
that time there is a certain

723
00:45:52 --> 00:45:55
the qualities of that record this

724
00:45:55 --> 00:45:59
you know it has other redeeming features
that i don&#39;t i don&#39;t think those are bad

725
00:45:59 --> 00:46:02
qualities for the sentence

726
00:46:02 --> 00:46:05
step in - and then

727
00:46:05 --> 00:46:07
it covered up my mind

728
00:46:07 --> 00:46:10
so

729
00:46:10 --> 00:46:12
when a

730
00:46:12 --> 00:46:15
x back to see

731
00:46:15 --> 00:46:18
as we beneath the gold and healed

732
00:46:18 --> 00:46:24
in my way of thinking self-pity is not
attractive quality in an artist i prefer

733
00:46:24 --> 00:46:29
the blue Xephos right now why people
talk about the Blue thinking about how

734
00:46:29 --> 00:46:34
cut said colored people are Albert
Murray will tell you that no it&#39;s about

735
00:46:34 --> 00:46:40
having should hand it to you and having
a good time on saturday night and I

736
00:46:40 --> 00:46:44
think that&#39;s a stronger more
intellectually respectable point of view

737
00:46:44 --> 00:46:50
most people think pessimism is a sign of
seriousness I don&#39;t

738
00:46:50 --> 00:46:53
and Leonard Cohen is a pessimist

739
00:46:53 --> 00:46:58
nikon has a very pessimistic cast of
mind but to my mind he triumphs over

740
00:46:58 --> 00:47:08
this with his with his charm his craft
the poetic nature tends to be

741
00:47:08 --> 00:47:15
introspective and melancholic going back
to Keats and the romantics of the 19th

742
00:47:15 --> 00:47:27
century there was also i think this
fascination with great poets burning out

743
00:47:27 --> 00:47:28
and dying young

744
00:47:28 --> 00:47:34
Keats Shelley and and in fact there is a
famous interview that that the coen gave

745
00:47:34 --> 00:47:39
in the late 1960s where he actually
talks about great poets doing all their

746
00:47:39 --> 00:47:44
great work before their 35 and
committing suicide so that he&#39;s there

747
00:47:44 --> 00:47:50
I mean in later years it gets tempered
with with a wonderful wit and humor that

748
00:47:50 --> 00:47:56
that often gets overlooked in 1972 cohen
and the army began a new larger scale

749
00:47:56 --> 00:47:57
world tour

750
00:47:57 --> 00:48:01
the following year an album of selected
performances live songs was released

751
00:48:01 --> 00:48:05
stepping away from the musical arena :
unexpectedly became involved in the yom

752
00:48:05 --> 00:48:09
kippur war between israel and egypt in
late nineteen seventy-three traveling to

753
00:48:09 --> 00:48:12
Tel Aviv and performing on the front
line despite the many valid criticisms

754
00:48:12 --> 00:48:15
of the Israeli position in 1974

755
00:48:15 --> 00:48:19
he returned to music into his old horn
New York in a notable departure from his

756
00:48:19 --> 00:48:23
recent musical approach Cohen steered
clear of nashville and began working on

757
00:48:23 --> 00:48:26
new material with the young and
relatively unknown producer John Lee saw

758
00:48:26 --> 00:48:30
he had just finished the tour I guess
what the charlie daniels band does his

759
00:48:30 --> 00:48:35
thing and it was very Nashville &#39;ish you
know that pose do one thing where you

760
00:48:35 --> 00:48:38
take a singer-songwriter and you know
put some some country guys with them and

761
00:48:38 --> 00:48:41
that&#39;s what that was and it was it was
fine but it wasn&#39;t

762
00:48:41 --> 00:48:46
Leonard wasn&#39;t doing anything new in and
of itself except for how great he and

763
00:48:46 --> 00:48:50
his songs were the music had that kind
of it was that thing always start doing

764
00:48:50 --> 00:48:56
these songs we did I think Chelsea Hotel
which had a little down bluesy quality -

765
00:48:56 --> 00:49:03
I played some very funky clarinet and it
was Spacey and moody without being a

766
00:49:03 --> 00:49:06
standard folk there was really no
standard folk music on this album with

767
00:49:06 --> 00:49:07
that one or two exceptions

768
00:49:07 --> 00:49:10
why he had faith in me right off the bat
I don&#39;t know it turned out that we work

769
00:49:10 --> 00:49:15
great together but he saw something in a
collaboration that I mean I wasn&#39;t even

770
00:49:15 --> 00:49:16
thinking I was just saying I have to try
this

771
00:49:16 --> 00:49:21
let&#39;s try that with an entirely new
backing band this all fashion album that

772
00:49:21 --> 00:49:24
had more in common with John Simon&#39;s
production on collins debut than the

773
00:49:24 --> 00:49:27
stripped-down natural sound of the
previous two records

774
00:49:27 --> 00:49:31
he mentioned that the first time the
john simon simon element

775
00:49:31 --> 00:49:34
I don&#39;t know a lot of the details but I
do know that he looked at the same way

776
00:49:34 --> 00:49:39
that Leonard music their pieces a little
working and the idea of framing them or

777
00:49:39 --> 00:49:40
give them as you

778
00:49:40 --> 00:49:44
it&#39;s a embellishments more in coloration
and anything else sometimes setting the

779
00:49:44 --> 00:49:45
tone

780
00:49:45 --> 00:49:50
nothing that we did on new skin was
really thick or overdone there&#39;s a lot

781
00:49:50 --> 00:49:53
of transparency to it but there are
colors going on like crazy when people

782
00:49:53 --> 00:49:56
talk about that field commander : stuff
and some of the things that you&#39;re just

783
00:49:56 --> 00:50:01
floating around the time must have been
right i think because he didn&#39;t did

784
00:50:01 --> 00:50:07
those pared-down albums that national /
folk albums that did to me just sit

785
00:50:07 --> 00:50:07
there a bit

786
00:50:07 --> 00:50:10
the songs were so strong that it
sustained it

787
00:50:10 --> 00:50:17
I mean he had that you was still so new
but the songs that we started working on

788
00:50:17 --> 00:50:21
I thought I could just have a little
more color to them

789
00:50:21 --> 00:50:25
so who by fire which has all that little
those little spaces and those kind of

790
00:50:25 --> 00:50:31
emotional things and the colors are
happening in the girls and it and when

791
00:50:31 --> 00:50:33
it came easily because for some reason
it

792
00:50:33 --> 00:50:37
this his songs inspired me to think that
way and fine

793
00:50:37 --> 00:50:48
I want to do in sunshine and the next
time but it&#39;s when we get to new skin

794
00:50:48 --> 00:50:49
for the old ceremony

795
00:50:49 --> 00:50:52
it&#39;s a different letter code has emerged
it&#39;s there&#39;s a break there is completely

796
00:50:52 --> 00:50:54
different record from what we&#39;ve what
we&#39;ve heard before

797
00:50:54 --> 00:50:58
new producer is all very nice but he&#39;s
in New York

798
00:50:58 --> 00:51:02
so everything is different and for the
first time I think you know learning

799
00:51:02 --> 00:51:05
commons using the mechanics of pop music
he&#39;s got a full band there

800
00:51:05 --> 00:51:11
he&#39;s introducing a more mainstream sound
whether it&#39;s an attempt to become more

801
00:51:11 --> 00:51:14
accessible not is debatable but
certainly that seems to be the intent

802
00:51:14 --> 00:51:17
who by fire is an interesting song

803
00:51:17 --> 00:51:21
it&#39;s like a more serious version of
Dorothy Parker Zoomer in which she talks

804
00:51:21 --> 00:51:24
about all the different ways in which
you can die in commit suicide and here

805
00:51:24 --> 00:51:29
we have leather coat this listening of
on ways in which you might die and it&#39;s

806
00:51:29 --> 00:51:32
significantly says that this alignment
who black and orange and of course

807
00:51:32 --> 00:51:36
Avalon&#39;s was the opening song to song of
love and hate so he is a link there as

808
00:51:36 --> 00:51:36
well

809
00:51:36 --> 00:51:41
it&#39;s an echo of a a Jewish prayer which
was written in the 11th century I think

810
00:51:41 --> 00:51:46
by a German rabbi called an ominous a
prayer that spoken on Rosh Hashanah and

811
00:51:46 --> 00:51:53
Yom Kippur and cohen this is quite a
common thing for a Leonard Cohen that

812
00:51:53 --> 00:51:56
the Bible is a fairly common reference
point in all these works his Jewish

813
00:51:56 --> 00:52:01
heritage comes up a lot both in quite a
reverential tones and also an extremely

814
00:52:01 --> 00:52:06
self-mocking one&#39;s more than I think
he&#39;s alive - maybe contemporary American

815
00:52:06 --> 00:52:09
or indeed Canadian focusing as you can
see there&#39;s a sensibility linking

816
00:52:09 --> 00:52:12
someone like linking when it cold people
like Bob Dylan people at random human

817
00:52:12 --> 00:52:15
their songs are extremely worried either
very inquisitive they&#39;re requesting

818
00:52:15 --> 00:52:17
they&#39;re also very funny

819
00:52:17 --> 00:52:22
a lot of the time and who by fire he&#39;s
taking what is a prayer that these

820
00:52:22 --> 00:52:25
people have been making for ten
centuries and there&#39;s a attaching a

821
00:52:25 --> 00:52:28
punch line to the end of the sort of
like the and who shall I say is calling

822
00:52:28 --> 00:52:32
and is it is quite a great gag to stick
in the middle of a Avery cast prayer

823
00:52:32 --> 00:52:34
shall I see

824
00:52:34 --> 00:52:37
is Colin

825
00:52:37 --> 00:52:42
I was trying to frame his stuff take his
thing as pieces and put them in

826
00:52:42 --> 00:52:47
interesting frames make them visual make
them a cinematic baby

827
00:52:47 --> 00:52:51
so we did that he would take songs like
a level of her lover and instead of

828
00:52:51 --> 00:52:58
being a little focus on we put kind of a
ethiopian rhythm band behind him and it

829
00:52:58 --> 00:53:01
was great was exciting Leonard good
right off on it was that it was like a

830
00:53:01 --> 00:53:04
different approach to those who be with
me

831
00:53:04 --> 00:53:07
something

832
00:53:07 --> 00:53:13
Cohen need something two tents that
intimacy against I think that list our

833
00:53:13 --> 00:53:20
was really perfect in terms of the way
he can see the music i mean i-i I mean

834
00:53:20 --> 00:53:27
he you know he&#39;s a smart guy he works
with good people and and he doesn&#39;t mess

835
00:53:27 --> 00:53:29
up his productions anymore but i
wouldn&#39;t call the production of the

836
00:53:29 --> 00:53:33
recent records inventive the way I would
listen hours

837
00:53:33 --> 00:53:36
there are touches there are arrangements

838
00:53:36 --> 00:53:43
there are curlicues and furbelows in
that music and the voice snakes through

839
00:53:43 --> 00:53:47
it&#39;s an hour these very much of a
departure and I think starts the second

840
00:53:47 --> 00:53:51
phase of learning commons career where
he is no longer the acoustic troubadour

841
00:53:51 --> 00:53:53
that he&#39;s soon going to be out there
playing with you know you want to play

842
00:53:53 --> 00:53:58
with a full band doesn&#39;t want to be the
solo singer songwriter in the spotlight

843
00:53:58 --> 00:53:59
any more than that

844
00:53:59 --> 00:54:03
it&#39;s the end of that whole ear in a
sense of what we see from now on is is

845
00:54:03 --> 00:54:08
coming been much more comfortable
working with an ensemble with the new

846
00:54:08 --> 00:54:09
skin for the ceremony

847
00:54:09 --> 00:54:15
he&#39;d been told or he had decided that he
had really done everything he could

848
00:54:15 --> 00:54:21
within the limits of the sound of the
three albums that i regard as the

849
00:54:21 --> 00:54:27
trilogy and so you do have this quite
conscious effort to expand the sound

850
00:54:27 --> 00:54:32
I don&#39;t think entirely successfully but
then i wouldn&#39;t because these were my

851
00:54:32 --> 00:54:36
formative years I&#39;ve all those first
three records when they came out when I

852
00:54:36 --> 00:54:42
was 14 15 16 17 years old so you know
that&#39;s that&#39;s where i&#39;m coming from I

853
00:54:42 --> 00:54:45
was never really a fan of your skin
growth sermon

854
00:54:45 --> 00:54:50
on its release new skin for the old
ceremony was only a modest commercial

855
00:54:50 --> 00:54:55
success and critical opinion was divided
over the more ornate arrangements had

856
00:54:55 --> 00:54:58
one song once again stood out to become
one of cohen&#39;s most recognized

857
00:54:58 --> 00:55:03
chelsea hotel number two its lyrics
typically autobiographical the song

858
00:55:03 --> 00:55:06
recounts the tale of cones brief love
affair with the woman in the famous new

859
00:55:06 --> 00:55:09
york hotel where he it sporadically
lived at the start of his career

860
00:55:09 --> 00:55:13
Curren later uncharacteristically
revealed the subject of the song to be

861
00:55:13 --> 00:55:17
Janis Joplin remember you will

862
00:55:17 --> 00:55:20
and the chill sealed

863
00:55:20 --> 00:55:24
you are talking so brie and so sweet

864
00:55:24 --> 00:55:25
thank you

865
00:55:25 --> 00:55:25
me is

866
00:55:25 --> 00:55:26
on the

867
00:55:26 --> 00:55:27
you be yeah

868
00:55:27 --> 00:55:30
one of the great strengths of one cone
as a writer that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s

869
00:55:30 --> 00:55:33
really necessary to know all that much
about him personally to appreciate the

870
00:55:33 --> 00:55:37
songs and actually I tend to think a lot
of them probably better appreciated the

871
00:55:37 --> 00:55:42
less you know about the author which is
one of the reasons that I think chelsea

872
00:55:42 --> 00:55:45
hotel number two really doesn&#39;t work at
all I mean for a start I don&#39;t know I

873
00:55:45 --> 00:55:49
really don&#39;t think it&#39;s anything like a
great Leonard Cohen song i don&#39;t think

874
00:55:49 --> 00:55:53
it&#39;s even an especially good one I think
that Thun is one I&#39;ve always forgotten

875
00:55:53 --> 00:55:59
even while i was listening to it and the
lyric is even if you don&#39;t know it&#39;s

876
00:55:59 --> 00:56:02
about Janis Joplin it just the line
about you know giving me head on an

877
00:56:02 --> 00:56:06
unmade bed bulb in savings waited
outside is is it&#39;s it&#39;s graceless it&#39;s

878
00:56:06 --> 00:56:09
showing off and it sounds like David Lee
Roth

879
00:56:09 --> 00:56:12
I mean really you take it out of that
context it&#39;s it&#39;s not a very good

880
00:56:12 --> 00:56:16
culinary convert the line about you know
the one about her preferring handsome

881
00:56:16 --> 00:56:20
men but for me you said you&#39;d make an
exception that it&#39;s he&#39;s he&#39;s a lot

882
00:56:20 --> 00:56:22
funnier than that usually in a lot
better than that

883
00:56:22 --> 00:56:26
again it underlines the fact that as
well joan of arc that when the person is

884
00:56:26 --> 00:56:33
named whether it be an eco or the Janis
Joplin place what . sense of all you

885
00:56:33 --> 00:56:36
know that&#39;s a song about X and we can
visualize the person but in a way that&#39;s

886
00:56:36 --> 00:56:38
kind of self limiting and away and I ice

887
00:56:38 --> 00:56:41
I think it would be I think he was
absolutely right when he said down we

888
00:56:41 --> 00:56:44
know I regret ever saying it was about
Janis Joplin i think i think if it could

889
00:56:44 --> 00:56:47
have been about every woman oi in the
show&#39;s hotel at the time it would have

890
00:56:47 --> 00:56:51
been probably better i think you know
applying it Saudis to Janis Joplin which

891
00:56:51 --> 00:56:56
we now can&#39;t help but doing and and it
seems so explicitly so is regrettable

892
00:56:56 --> 00:57:00
Cohen was happy with the album and
immediately returned to the studio with

893
00:57:00 --> 00:57:02
jaundice or to work on the follow up

894
00:57:02 --> 00:57:05
despite this momentum with several songs
completed in the can

895
00:57:05 --> 00:57:09
the album was abandoned , and went on
tours with many of the backing band that

896
00:57:09 --> 00:57:13
had been involved in new skin but in
1975 stepped off of the musical stage

897
00:57:13 --> 00:57:17
and out of the public eye once more he
did not begin working on another album

898
00:57:17 --> 00:57:20
until nineteen seventy-seven when he was
introduced to legendary music producer

899
00:57:20 --> 00:57:23
phil spector to the surprise of many of
the pair

900
00:57:23 --> 00:57:27
and a collaboration an album which
vector would compose the music and cohen

901
00:57:27 --> 00:57:27
the lyrics

902
00:57:27 --> 00:57:33
phil spector was was largely favors for
two things he was famous for being as

903
00:57:33 --> 00:57:34
mad as a frog in a sock

904
00:57:34 --> 00:57:37
he was just not and you know

905
00:57:37 --> 00:57:41
subsequent more recent events may still
be subject to see but they would seem to

906
00:57:41 --> 00:57:44
sort of conforming various patterns of
his previous behavior

907
00:57:44 --> 00:57:47
he was also famous as a producer for
something called the wall of sound which

908
00:57:47 --> 00:57:51
was the sound that informed those great
girl group hits of the sixties the

909
00:57:51 --> 00:57:55
Ronettes most obviously you know the
leader who run inspector he was rather

910
00:57:55 --> 00:58:00
run fractious we married to for many
years

911
00:58:00 --> 00:58:04
he changed producing he changed the old
definition of the producer was the guy

912
00:58:04 --> 00:58:06
whom came in and sort of make sure
people showed up to the session make

913
00:58:06 --> 00:58:09
sure the contact scott signed and and i
put together the artist and sent back

914
00:58:09 --> 00:58:12
and said you know this is really good

915
00:58:12 --> 00:58:15
you worked with an established artist
and the songs are done in an angel - no

916
00:58:15 --> 00:58:18
respecter came in and said I&#39;m doing
this who wants to say it

917
00:58:18 --> 00:58:23
he&#39;s a producer that you&#39;ll never find
again i&#39;m sure he knows exactly what he

918
00:58:23 --> 00:58:29
wants he knows what it&#39;s going to sound
like before he ever does it and he gets

919
00:58:29 --> 00:58:34
usually gets what he wants and I think
that&#39;s what an artist coming to fill

920
00:58:34 --> 00:58:39
would expect the term wall of sound was
applied to the unique production the

921
00:58:39 --> 00:58:42
specter had developed along with the
engineers at gold star studios in los

922
00:58:42 --> 00:58:46
angeles it had been the defining
characteristic of many highly successful

923
00:58:46 --> 00:58:51
records and had the potential to cross
cone over into the mainstream the wall

924
00:58:51 --> 00:58:52
of sound

925
00:58:52 --> 00:58:56
what was what it sounds it was it was
absolutely did this monumental creation

926
00:58:56 --> 00:59:00
of basically compressing an entire
symphony orchestra into a three minute

927
00:59:00 --> 00:59:04
pop song it was not dissimilar in a lot
of respects to what the Beatles did and

928
00:59:04 --> 00:59:07
of course he went on to produce the let
it be album everything George Martin

929
00:59:07 --> 00:59:11
bought to those more orchestral Beatles
records he crept from phil spector the

930
00:59:11 --> 00:59:16
Beach Boys Pet Sounds was to a huge
extent brian wilson&#39;s homage or attempt

931
00:59:16 --> 00:59:21
to emulate Phil Spector I mean he&#39;s one
of the most influential figures in

932
00:59:21 --> 00:59:24
modern popular music is absolutely no
doubt about that at all

933
00:59:24 --> 00:59:28
there are many interpretations of what
the wall of sound was actually the

934
00:59:28 --> 00:59:30
combination of many things

935
00:59:30 --> 00:59:37
the echo chamber is a very important
part of it but the fact that Phil

936
00:59:37 --> 00:59:40
brought too many musicians into a room

937
00:59:40 --> 00:59:45
added to the effect and this is where
the wall sound came from because he had

938
00:59:45 --> 00:59:50
literally sound from wall to wall but
without the echo chamber it wouldn&#39;t

939
00:59:50 --> 00:59:53
have existed and probably vice versa
either

940
00:59:53 --> 00:59:58
it was odd to see him working with
something like Specter

941
00:59:58 --> 01:00:03
but the same time I thought it was an
element of that relationship which could

942
01:00:03 --> 01:00:04
and should have works

943
01:00:04 --> 01:00:08
Spector had been brought in at the tail
end of the beatles career you know it

944
01:00:08 --> 01:00:08
work

945
01:00:08 --> 01:00:11
infamously on let it be and we know the
stories about his production there

946
01:00:11 --> 01:00:15
his wall of sound is epic production was
something that had been strongly

947
01:00:15 --> 01:00:17
associated with the sixties but it&#39;s
time

948
01:00:17 --> 01:00:19
spector was working in the early
seventies he got involved with john

949
01:00:19 --> 01:00:23
lennon in the early stages of his career
and worked on the classic join and

950
01:00:23 --> 01:00:24
plastic ono band

951
01:00:24 --> 01:00:28
now that was a brilliant piece of work
and a brilliant collaboration and it

952
01:00:28 --> 01:00:33
showed you what might have happened
between Specter and con

953
01:00:33 --> 01:00:37
although refusing of the specter sound
with cones lyrics would obviously lead

954
01:00:37 --> 01:00:41
to a radical departure from previous
releases the producer decided like John

955
01:00:41 --> 01:00:45
Liz or and John Simon before him to
juxtapose cones voice with female

956
01:00:45 --> 01:00:50
singers he decided to push this idea
further and three tracks by having kind

957
01:00:50 --> 01:00:52
duet with the actress and country singer

958
01:00:52 --> 01:00:55
ronee blakley who had recently been a
part of Bob Dylan&#39;s Rolling Thunder

959
01:00:55 --> 01:00:59
review tool all voices blend with
Leonard but I think female voices are

960
01:00:59 --> 01:01:00
especially touching

961
01:01:00 --> 01:01:03
Leonard has in his voice

962
01:01:03 --> 01:01:09
a slight trembling from time to time
which is extremely vulnerable than real

963
01:01:09 --> 01:01:11
and present and there

964
01:01:11 --> 01:01:15
it&#39;s at the front of his head even
though it it almost has a rumbling sound

965
01:01:15 --> 01:01:24
almost a biblical sound at times it can
also sound very sensitive and charming

966
01:01:24 --> 01:01:27
and this sound that he has

967
01:01:27 --> 01:01:35
in addition to the Rabbinical quality of
of his Jewishness if I may say so is

968
01:01:35 --> 01:01:39
almost what in christian music would be
called bel canto or Cantus firmus the

969
01:01:39 --> 01:01:45
kinds of monks would sing and that
invites the addition of a sixth or third

970
01:01:45 --> 01:01:47
above or below as a harmony

971
01:01:47 --> 01:01:48
it just invites it

972
01:01:48 --> 01:01:51
and therefore compliment

973
01:01:51 --> 01:01:54
yeah

974
01:01:54 --> 01:01:57
yeah

975
01:01:57 --> 01:02:01
you know Leonard&#39;s great when he has a
female singer seen behind it just it

976
01:02:01 --> 01:02:07
complements him so well and I just
remember one night there were there was

977
01:02:07 --> 01:02:11
a session and I walked into there&#39;s a
coffee from outside the studio and

978
01:02:11 --> 01:02:14
somebody walked in and he looked really
familiar to me by in the who was with us

979
01:02:14 --> 01:02:17
so some rocker or something and i was in
the studio

980
01:02:17 --> 01:02:22
half hour later and the person come in
with a couple of other people on that

981
01:02:22 --> 01:02:26
night and I look looked at them and I
did like a triple take 30 minutes later

982
01:02:26 --> 01:02:31
said that&#39;s Bob Dylan and that must be
ronee blakley and that&#39;s allen ginsberg

983
01:02:31 --> 01:02:34
and i was i was like starstruck help to
tell you it was a wonderful experience

984
01:02:34 --> 01:02:38
just imagine yourself to be in the
studio with bob dylan allen ginsberg

985
01:02:38 --> 01:02:42
that leonard cohen and fails factor
isn&#39;t that heaven and the working

986
01:02:42 --> 01:02:43
atmosphere was far from heaven

987
01:02:43 --> 01:02:48
Spector after years of being teetotal
was drinking heavily again and acting

988
01:02:48 --> 01:02:52
dictatorial in the studio and cohen soon
found that he had little control over

989
01:02:52 --> 01:02:54
the producer all the record

990
01:02:54 --> 01:02:59
Phil is really a take-charge type of man
he wants to be in control the situation

991
01:02:59 --> 01:03:05
it&#39;s like an artist palette is holding
the brush and I would almost say like

992
01:03:05 --> 01:03:07
leonard carlton was the subject

993
01:03:07 --> 01:03:13
you know so so you know Leonard wasn&#39;t a
man of a lot of words in the studio Phil

994
01:03:13 --> 01:03:15
you know control the musicians and

995
01:03:15 --> 01:03:20
you know produce you know Leonard for
the microphone sing and you essentially

996
01:03:20 --> 01:03:21
ran the show

997
01:03:21 --> 01:03:26
well they were both very comfortable of
the there is a slight but to my voice as

998
01:03:26 --> 01:03:31
you may have heard a slight hesitation
because when an artist branching out

999
01:03:31 --> 01:03:32
into new territory

1000
01:03:32 --> 01:03:38
it is unsafe and insecure and
everybody&#39;s finding their footing

1001
01:03:38 --> 01:03:43
it&#39;s not familiar it&#39;s not the old turf
and so therefore it&#39;s a little bit

1002
01:03:43 --> 01:03:44
frightening

1003
01:03:44 --> 01:03:47
I got along fine with letting I got
along fine with everybody

1004
01:03:47 --> 01:03:50
I even got along fine with Phil but
Phil&#39;s couldn&#39;t get along fine with the

1005
01:03:50 --> 01:03:51
artist

1006
01:03:51 --> 01:03:54
it was always a trend shows transmission
of problems between the two of them

1007
01:03:54 --> 01:04:00
because phil was into this thing at the
time whatever it was and he that any

1008
01:04:00 --> 01:04:03
distraction will distract him a
telephone call

1009
01:04:03 --> 01:04:10
bathroom call anything would bother him
and it being on time bothered into that

1010
01:04:10 --> 01:04:13
bar that let it and that&#39;s one of the
things that really created a problem he

1011
01:04:13 --> 01:04:14
was just never on time

1012
01:04:14 --> 01:04:21
it seems to me that Colombia was after a
different tack on honey we&#39;re going to

1013
01:04:21 --> 01:04:21
record

1014
01:04:21 --> 01:04:29
Leonard I think it was an unfortunate
time to do it

1015
01:04:29 --> 01:04:32
I don&#39;t think Phil I know I wasn&#39;t at my
best

1016
01:04:32 --> 01:04:37
Phil wasn&#39;t his best I don&#39;t know
whether Leonard was but Leonard deserve

1017
01:04:37 --> 01:04:37
better than he got

1018
01:04:37 --> 01:04:42
I&#39;m sure my main memory of that whole
episode was that

1019
01:04:42 --> 01:04:45
and Phil and Leonard

1020
01:04:45 --> 01:04:50
we&#39;re both very unhappy with what was
coming off and I think rightly so I

1021
01:04:50 --> 01:04:55
don&#39;t think one thing that the other the
affair ended in a farcical manner

1022
01:04:55 --> 01:04:58
respective confiscating the final tapes
and mastering them in secret

1023
01:04:58 --> 01:05:03
the finished work death of a ladies man
was released in November 1977 the

1024
01:05:03 --> 01:05:06
specter approach failed to find Cohen
the new audience that many had been

1025
01:05:06 --> 01:05:08
expecting and the album was treated her

1026
01:05:08 --> 01:05:12
Ashley by critics it was subsequently
disowned by cohen who called the lp a

1027
01:05:12 --> 01:05:13
catastrophe

1028
01:05:13 --> 01:05:17
the word I would use about death of a
ladies man is its undignified

1029
01:05:17 --> 01:05:20
I think that you know you don&#39;t really
need to say much more that that word

1030
01:05:20 --> 01:05:25
somehow sums it up because then a cone
had always being this huge lead

1031
01:05:25 --> 01:05:31
dignified figure he was the poet he was
the artist he was the man who had this

1032
01:05:31 --> 01:05:34
wider experience than the rest of us

1033
01:05:34 --> 01:05:40
that was what made him special and then
this record just sucks

1034
01:05:40 --> 01:05:44
I really thought it was great I really
really liked the songs i thought they

1035
01:05:44 --> 01:05:45
were really unique

1036
01:05:45 --> 01:05:49
I think today if you go back and you try
to find music that compares to that

1037
01:05:49 --> 01:05:55
album its it stands on his own as one
unique statement of two artists work

1038
01:05:55 --> 01:05:59
the songs are fantastic you can imagine
every single one of them being done in

1039
01:05:59 --> 01:06:06
concert and he has done memories in all
sorts of all sorts of ways with

1040
01:06:06 --> 01:06:09
different backup singers and it always
gets a great reaction that always gets

1041
01:06:09 --> 01:06:12
it it&#39;s a real crowd pleaser

1042
01:06:12 --> 01:06:15
you&#39;re naked bye

1043
01:06:15 --> 01:06:18
it&#39;s not typical of Leonard&#39;s
performance style to sing the song

1044
01:06:18 --> 01:06:21
he&#39;s used to standing at a microphone
with a guitar in his own that when he

1045
01:06:21 --> 01:06:23
does memories in there is no good time

1046
01:06:23 --> 01:06:28
then in nineteen seventy-nine jennifer
warnes and sharon robinson did i do what

1047
01:06:28 --> 01:06:30
routine which brought the place to its
feet

1048
01:06:30 --> 01:06:33
it&#39;s really hard for me to say that you
know like death of a ladies man is is a

1049
01:06:33 --> 01:06:34
bad record

1050
01:06:34 --> 01:06:38
you know I&#39;m somebody who is intrigued
by whatever loan and cohen does

1051
01:06:38 --> 01:06:44
I could find things in it you know but
you can you say that you know that this

1052
01:06:44 --> 01:06:47
is it is a successful collaboration

1053
01:06:47 --> 01:06:50
no of course not it&#39;s ridiculous I mean
letter coming up so I was described as

1054
01:06:50 --> 01:06:55
grotesque and i think it is grotesque Oh

1055
01:06:55 --> 01:06:59
on the other hand I mean what does
Leonard Cohen want from this

1056
01:06:59 --> 01:07:05
what is he going for you know there&#39;s a
kind of as a garishness to it that is

1057
01:07:05 --> 01:07:11
revealing just a mean it&#39;s one thing to
say it&#39;s grotesque after it&#39;s done but

1058
01:07:11 --> 01:07:12
you made it

1059
01:07:12 --> 01:07:16
you know that&#39;s your record you know
what you think you were going to Phil

1060
01:07:16 --> 01:07:17
Spector for a subtlety

1061
01:07:17 --> 01:07:20
I personally felt that Linda : should
never use Phil Spector

1062
01:07:20 --> 01:07:24
you should&#39;ve gone with David Foster
because you need someone who really

1063
01:07:24 --> 01:07:30
understands autistic people who added
those more about that kind of performer

1064
01:07:30 --> 01:07:33
than the field spectre ii so I thought
using filled with the wrong man for the

1065
01:07:33 --> 01:07:33
job

1066
01:07:33 --> 01:07:36
even though phil was always in control

1067
01:07:36 --> 01:07:45
phil was the boss still he made stars
out of the people you work with and he

1068
01:07:45 --> 01:07:51
asked if he could have he would have
made Leonard a star also write as I say

1069
01:07:51 --> 01:07:58
I just don&#39;t think he was creatively and
his best at that time people refer to it

1070
01:07:58 --> 01:08:01
as Phil Spector&#39;s album not Leonard
Cohen&#39;s album and I don&#39;t think you need

1071
01:08:01 --> 01:08:03
to say anything more about it that tells
you the whole story

1072
01:08:03 --> 01:08:07
Leonard has been subsumed by Specter and
the wall of sound

1073
01:08:07 --> 01:08:10
in this first period of his career

1074
01:08:10 --> 01:08:14
Cohen had resisted the temptation to
return full time to writing and had

1075
01:08:14 --> 01:08:18
passionately pursued a life and music
with his remarkable debut is to spare

1076
01:08:18 --> 01:08:22
natural masterpieces and his experiment
in a more expansive sand with jaundice

1077
01:08:22 --> 01:08:26
or and phil spector he had demonstrated
a refusal to stick to one mode of sound

1078
01:08:26 --> 01:08:31
in his later career he would continue to
evolve an experiment but for many his

1079
01:08:31 --> 01:08:35
greatest achievements lay within those
early albums which he emerged as one of

1080
01:08:35 --> 01:08:40
the most idiosyncratic and insightful
artists working in popular music those

1081
01:08:40 --> 01:08:42
early records are done in their
extraordinary body of work and people

1082
01:08:42 --> 01:08:45
are going to be singing those songs for
decades and decades and decades and

1083
01:08:45 --> 01:08:48
finding new things in those songs and
decades and decades and decades there&#39;s

1084
01:08:48 --> 01:08:51
so much in the words there&#39;s so much you
can do with the melodies

1085
01:08:51 --> 01:08:57
the body of work the first three hours
in particular I think Stan supreme in

1086
01:08:57 --> 01:08:59
Leonard Cohen&#39;s canada

1087
01:08:59 --> 01:09:05
subsequently he does become a great
songwriter but these three records

1088
01:09:05 --> 01:09:10
I think not only supreme kinetic Owens
canon but I think in the cannon and pop

1089
01:09:10 --> 01:09:16
music as records of poached put music
but never been paralleled

1090
01:09:16 --> 01:09:19
yeah

1091
01:09:19 --> 01:09:24
yeah

1092
01:09:24 --> 01:09:27
by travelpod member

1093
01:09:27 --> 01:09:30
yeah

1094
01:09:30 --> 01:09:33
yeah

1095
01:09:33 --> 01:09:36
yeah

1096
01:09:36 --> 01:09:38
yeah

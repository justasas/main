once mr. Jameson to make a donation

55
00:02:36 --> 00:02:39
mr. James yeah and he&#39;s all conservative

56
00:02:39 --> 00:02:43
he wouldn&#39;t even eat a piece of steak it
was a little bit think we did I hear you

57
00:02:43 --> 00:02:45
say that you&#39;ve been here almost a year

58
00:02:45 --> 00:02:48
I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s been that long
seems longer to you too huh

59
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
well i gotta tell you it&#39;s really nice
having you here I mean it&#39;s nice having

60
00:02:51 --> 00:02:52
somebody else on my side

61
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
if you know what I mean well thanks Pete
but it works both ways

62
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
I mean everybody needs somebody to talk
to which reminds me I saw your pal

63
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
spider-man on the news last night

64
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
oh yeah sort of i does this mean our
mystery man is going public

65
00:03:04 --> 00:03:08
he oh no I&#39;m sure it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s just
that there really wasn&#39;t any other way

66
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
for him to handle that I mean reading
that girl was gonna jump a little

67
00:03:10 --> 00:03:11
publicity never hurt anybody

68
00:03:11 --> 00:03:14
spider-man&#39;s case i&#39;m not sure that&#39;s
true that would you get me the files are

69
00:03:14 --> 00:03:17
last year&#39;s garbage strike facing their
partner

70
00:03:17 --> 00:03:21
i miss Jensen I suppose you&#39;re either
sell me some exclusive photos on

71
00:03:21 --> 00:03:22
spider-man in action

72
00:03:22 --> 00:03:25
well no I i saw that on television - I&#39;m
sorry about that sir

73
00:03:25 --> 00:03:29
come on what you can expect me to get
every photo of spider-man like a kid and

74
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
why aren&#39;t you suppose I&#39;m kind of on
the payroll

75
00:03:31 --> 00:03:35
it&#39;s not that he does a good job every
time you send them out which isn&#39;t

76
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
nearly as often as i&#39;d like some key
partners when you Parker

77
00:03:38 --> 00:03:42
it&#39;s to you never put them on the big
stories if I had one apart and help me

78
00:03:42 --> 00:03:43
make decisions here

79
00:03:43 --> 00:03:46
I&#39;ve got to 1 30 years ago mr. Davison

80
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
I have an idea for a story that I think
you&#39;ll really

81
00:03:48 --> 00:03:51
don&#39;t have an idea for a story yes no
I&#39;m sure you&#39;re really going to like

82
00:03:51 --> 00:03:51
this

83
00:03:51 --> 00:03:54
not now can&#39;t you see that busy

84
00:03:54 --> 00:03:59
you know we do you really shouldn&#39;t talk
to him like that he could have you fired

85
00:03:59 --> 00:04:04
he wasn&#39;t there oh yes he would and he
will too if you make him mad enough and

86
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
he has some very important friends that
could make it very difficult for you to

87
00:04:07 --> 00:04:08
get another job

88
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
oh yeah well I got some friends to that
could make it very difficult for him to

89
00:04:11 --> 00:04:16
keep the tires on his roles if you know
what I mean either you interpret

90
00:04:16 --> 00:04:26
ok said what is so important for you to
drag him off the tennis court

91
00:04:26 --> 00:04:32
I want to show you something I got from
a TV station in new york wait this is a

92
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
piece of history are seeing spider-man
has been seen on the rooftops of the

93
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
city for a long time now but this is a
debut on the six o&#39;clock news

94
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
young woman had been on the ledge for
over an hour according to new york

95
00:04:41 --> 00:04:44
police department spokesman captain
barbera she resisted all attempts to

96
00:04:44 --> 00:04:45
talk her out of it

97
00:04:45 --> 00:04:49
the captain&#39;s own words we needed a
miracle I guess you could say we got one

98
00:04:49 --> 00:04:52
I&#39;m sure we would have lost her if it
hadn&#39;t been for spider-man

99
00:04:52 --> 00:04:57
that&#39;s the most incredible thing I&#39;ve
ever seen incredible wrong word i should

100
00:04:57 --> 00:04:58
try ridiculous

101
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
I want you to get the examiner an
interview with that spider-man character

102
00:05:01 --> 00:05:05
I want to do a cover story on you&#39;re
kidding you want to do a cover story on

103
00:05:05 --> 00:05:09
some weirdo who thinks he&#39;s a cross
between Rudolf Nureyev and Tarzan the

104
00:05:09 --> 00:05:15
public will eat it up said why me
because he&#39;s a man and you have a way of

105
00:05:15 --> 00:05:17
getting men to do what you want

106
00:05:17 --> 00:05:23
why can&#39;t I persuade you put somebody
else on this tour because I know you too

107
00:05:23 --> 00:05:23
well

108
00:05:23 --> 00:05:29
- 7:30 into kennedy . it always supposed
to get in touch with its not looking up

109
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
info funny gal fine

110
00:05:31 --> 00:05:34
there&#39;s some people you should see for
research the real key is a college

111
00:05:34 --> 00:05:37
student was a part-time photographer for
the New York Daily Bugle until it snows

112
00:05:37 --> 00:05:41
film he was the only one was ever able
to get close to the spider-man Peter

113
00:05:41 --> 00:05:42
Parker

114
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
that&#39;s the one

115
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
that&#39;s the one

116
00:05:48 --> 00:05:51
dr. Bailey you can&#39;t be serious you
actually plan to operate the reactor

117
00:05:51 --> 00:05:52
here at the University

118
00:05:52 --> 00:05:55
yes i have all the clearances well sir
it&#39;s one thing to conduct an experiment

119
00:05:55 --> 00:05:59
to the to build a model but to actually
operated that means you have to tone him

120
00:05:59 --> 00:06:00
in this very building

121
00:06:00 --> 00:06:03
mr. Parker we&#39;re talking about something
a little under five kilos now that&#39;s

122
00:06:03 --> 00:06:04
hardly a significant amount

123
00:06:04 --> 00:06:07
furthermore it&#39;s already been to learn
dr. Bader

124
00:06:07 --> 00:06:10
I hope you have created the perfect
breeder reactor I mean I&#39;d love to

125
00:06:10 --> 00:06:13
believe that will be no danger but I
just can&#39;t

126
00:06:13 --> 00:06:17
well the reactor will produce exactly
the same amount of plutonium oxide as it

127
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
uses there will be no ways to no danger
and the material be stored in the safe

128
00:06:20 --> 00:06:27
room in the lab if you would help to
Tony oxide you can be get in a matter of

129
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
hours if they don&#39;t call it stuff a
deadly just for nothing

130
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
look terrorists could come in here and
feel that stuff and build a bomb

131
00:06:33 --> 00:06:39
it&#39;s ridiculous the security has been
doubled on the lab security a bunch of

132
00:06:39 --> 00:06:40
all red cop

133
00:06:40 --> 00:06:44
all right suppose I did steal they have
to be very sophisticated terrorists to

134
00:06:44 --> 00:06:45
turn it into a bomb

135
00:06:45 --> 00:06:49
I&#39;m sorry sir but you are wrong all the
information you need is available in any

136
00:06:49 --> 00:06:53
good library everybody knows that a
university senior in physics could build

137
00:06:53 --> 00:06:55
one if he had the plutonium

138
00:06:55 --> 00:06:59
maybe he thinks he could build one but
what it explode

139
00:06:59 --> 00:07:01
I certainly hope we never have to find
out

140
00:07:01 --> 00:07:06
I understand and I appreciate your fears
but I also believe that the potential

141
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
benefit is well worth the risk

142
00:07:08 --> 00:07:12
the world will have chief nuclear power
and the bomb great material can be

143
00:07:12 --> 00:07:16
strictly monitored now i&#39;m offering the
world of solution not another problem

144
00:07:16 --> 00:07:21
believe me this is the way of the future
we will continue this discussion on

145
00:07:21 --> 00:07:24
Wednesday

146
00:07:24 --> 00:07:30
you don&#39;t go ahead sure someday atomic
bombs are gonna be like electric can

147
00:07:30 --> 00:07:30
openers

148
00:07:30 --> 00:07:33
everybody&#39;s gonna have one might not

149
00:07:33 --> 00:07:37
it was just some way we could convince
dr. bank maybe what he needs is a push

150
00:07:37 --> 00:07:41
what do you mean I don&#39;t know maybe
could get the bugle to write a story

151
00:07:41 --> 00:07:42
that&#39;s not a bad idea

152
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
yeah maybe the publicity put some
pressure on you know it&#39;s worth a try

153
00:07:45 --> 00:07:50
I&#39;ll see you guys later okay okay take
life here trying to do tell the whole

154
00:07:50 --> 00:07:50
thing

155
00:07:50 --> 00:07:54
no I just thought the way was talking
during the seminar that maybe come in

156
00:07:54 --> 00:07:57
here is history

157
00:07:57 --> 00:08:00
you know it would be good to have him
with us we don&#39;t need him i can do

158
00:08:00 --> 00:08:03
everything he can

159
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
spiders are your field dr. Lindsay Eric
knology right very good

160
00:08:06 --> 00:08:10
like spiders themselves people who study
them get little recognition

161
00:08:10 --> 00:08:13
it&#39;s always nice to meet someone who
knows what we do and you&#39;ve been

162
00:08:13 --> 00:08:15
following its characters exploits pretty
closely right

163
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
oh yes you were telling the truth

164
00:08:18 --> 00:08:21
I&#39;ve been rooting for him rooting for it

165
00:08:21 --> 00:08:24
tell me how do you think she doesn&#39;t

166
00:08:24 --> 00:08:32
I wish I knew but you must have some .
well yes if a man somehow gain the

167
00:08:32 --> 00:08:33
powers of a spider

168
00:08:33 --> 00:08:38
how could you do that that&#39;s the part of
the puzzle i haven&#39;t figured out yet but

169
00:08:38 --> 00:08:41
if he did have the powers of a spider he
would be magnificent

170
00:08:41 --> 00:08:46
it would have incredible strength he
could be 20 30 feet year would have a

171
00:08:46 --> 00:08:47
highly developed pics

172
00:08:47 --> 00:08:50
that&#39;s you mean in a sense of danger
exactly

173
00:08:50 --> 00:08:53
he could spin a web walk up the side of
a building

174
00:08:53 --> 00:08:58
mmm welcome to see me yes he undoubtedly
could produce some kind of adhesive that

175
00:08:58 --> 00:09:03
would allow them to do all that but mr.
Jameson the public has a right to know

176
00:09:03 --> 00:09:06
can you imagine what would happen if
somebody stole that plutonium and used

177
00:09:06 --> 00:09:10
it to build a bomb but you should be
working for a science fiction - I could

178
00:09:10 --> 00:09:10
build one

179
00:09:10 --> 00:09:15
yes what is it a Miss Hoffman about you
know what is gonna come in something you

180
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
want to meet you

181
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21

00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
I&#39;ve heard

189
00:09:40 --> 00:09:43
i watch that she has an idea for a story

190
00:09:43 --> 00:09:47

I&#39;ve been seriously right now that

191
00:09:47 --> 00:09:54
well you time I we want to do an
interview with spider-man examiner in

192
00:09:54 --> 00:09:57

simultaneously and since you&#39;re the only

193
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59

194
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02

00:10:16 --> 00:10:20
Peter that&#39;s fast well the way things
are going now by the year 2000 could be

200
00:10:20 --> 00:10:22
millions of pounds of plutonium spread
around the world

201
00:10:22 --> 00:10:25
you really know a lot about these things

202
00:10:25 --> 00:10:31
tell me how long have you known
spider-man um quite a while I guess

203
00:10:31 --> 00:10:34
you seem to know him better than anyone
else

204
00:10:34 --> 00:10:42
what is you like what kind of fellow is
he well he&#39;s fairly polite and

205
00:10:42 --> 00:10:43
reasonably intelligent

206
00:10:43 --> 00:10:48
what does he like physically physically

207
00:10:48 --> 00:10:51
well I suppose you could say we&#39;re kind
of similar types

208
00:10:51 --> 00:10:54
that&#39;s interesting

209
00:10:54 --> 00:11:04

ok yes a barbaric what is all that

245
00:13:32 --> 00:13:36
five kilos the continuum oxide or
missile has helped ease and make a bomb

246
00:13:36 --> 00:13:45
that&#39;s right it&#39;s not dangerous unless
they&#39;ve opened the container was that

247
00:13:45 --> 00:13:45
thing

248
00:13:45 --> 00:13:50
it&#39;s a Geiger counter except for Tony
Parker

249
00:13:50 --> 00:13:54
it&#39;s gone the lab is clean is anyone
gonna be okay for the moment yes

250
00:13:54 --> 00:13:57
the whole city could be in danger let me
get something straight

251
00:13:57 --> 00:14:01
you guys you guys a break and you call
that&#39;s right yeah Damon through the

252
00:14:01 --> 00:14:02
window of the spider-man

253
00:14:02 --> 00:14:06
excuse me sir you say you saw a spider
man right here in this lab no on the

254
00:14:06 --> 00:14:06
roof

255
00:14:06 --> 00:14:09
what difference does it make who else
would come in the window most cats birds

256
00:14:09 --> 00:14:12
come in windows out of the floors are
you

257
00:14:12 --> 00:14:15
it&#39;s all right captain she&#39;s with me

258
00:14:15 --> 00:14:18
I have my credentials Gail Hoffman with
the national paper

259
00:14:18 --> 00:14:24
the weekly examine great another one
next will be Woodward and Bernstein

260
00:14:24 --> 00:14:29
captain what are you going to do what
else without an APB on spider-man

261
00:14:29 --> 00:14:32
yeah

262
00:14:32 --> 00:14:35
where is 10 paper you relax a bigger in
a minute

263
00:14:35 --> 00:14:38
where is 10 paper and you relax

264
00:14:38 --> 00:14:41
but be here in a minute

265
00:14:41 --> 00:14:45
page 10 you say it&#39;s missing

266
00:14:45 --> 00:14:51
Taylor says there&#39;s virtually no danger
of the material being used to build an

267
00:14:51 --> 00:14:57
atomic device is it sounds like they
went back the real dangerous to the

268
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
people who have a photo

269
00:14:59 --> 00:15:08
the police think it&#39;s either man has no
no turning this thing into a joke

270
00:15:08 --> 00:15:13
we&#39;ll see how long it laughs I mean
we&#39;re gonna go through with it

271
00:15:13 --> 00:15:19
the only way we can make our point we
have to build

272
00:15:19 --> 00:15:21
yeah

273
00:15:21 --> 00:15:22
yeah

274
00:15:22 --> 00:15:23
yeah

275
00:15:23 --> 00:15:24
yeah

276
00:15:24 --> 00:15:30
or is believed me

277
00:15:30 --> 00:15:35
the guns will leave with the
subcontinent in the morning on bars

278
00:15:35 --> 00:15:38
I understand some armored cars were
about to become available in South

279
00:15:38 --> 00:15:41
America because I&#39;m interested

280
00:15:41 --> 00:15:45
it&#39;s my business I know

281
00:15:45 --> 00:15:49
r is playing you want some planes Boris
trusts me make some calls and more

282
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
yes goodbye Horace

283
00:15:52 --> 00:16:00
get angel hit me in the gym nation yeah
yeah yeah

284
00:16:00 --> 00:16:04
and i want to see me mr. white

285
00:16:04 --> 00:16:07
yes look at these

286
00:16:07 --> 00:16:10
make the necessary arrangements leaving
for New York immediately

287
00:16:10 --> 00:16:13
yeah

288
00:16:13 --> 00:16:16
yeah

289
00:16:16 --> 00:16:19
yeah

290
00:16:19 --> 00:16:23
there&#39;s nothing about the plutonium
recover in any of the newspapers

291
00:16:23 --> 00:16:27
that&#39;s good very good that&#39;s what it
really looks like

292
00:16:27 --> 00:16:33
why was time with doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t
want either one of you ever forget that

293
00:16:33 --> 00:16:36
yeah

294
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
ok

295
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
remember after this phase we monitor the
radiation levels

296
00:16:41 --> 00:16:44
Geiger counter on hold

297
00:16:44 --> 00:16:47
yeah

298
00:16:47 --> 00:16:55
and when it cools it would soften like
party and be practically pure you mean

299
00:16:55 --> 00:16:56
it could be turned into a bomb

300
00:16:56 --> 00:16:59
oh for sure but it would be very
dangerous just by itself you see you

301
00:16:59 --> 00:17:01
could go super critical supercritical
yeah

302
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
the mass would become so dance that that
would set off a chain reaction

303
00:17:04 --> 00:17:09
you mean you could be an atomic
explosion well no but just the release

304
00:17:09 --> 00:17:11
of radiation by itself can be done

305
00:17:11 --> 00:17:16
yes

306
00:17:16 --> 00:17:20
here how do you know that spider-man
didn&#39;t take the plutonium

307
00:17:20 --> 00:17:23
well he just wouldn&#39;t do something as a
matter of fact right now he&#39;s probably

308
00:17:23 --> 00:17:24
trying to figure out who did do it

309
00:17:24 --> 00:17:27
he&#39;s not involved why doesn&#39;t he go to
the police and prove it

310
00:17:27 --> 00:17:30
well you know it&#39;s not quite that simple
i mean think about it

311
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
I think spider-man does a lot of good
but if people knew who he was well just

312
00:17:33 --> 00:17:34
wouldn&#39;t be the same thing

313
00:17:34 --> 00:17:38
nobody asked him to save the world I
don&#39;t really think he wanted any part of

314
00:17:38 --> 00:17:46
being a superhero and all he has to do
is turn in his little blue tights and

315
00:17:46 --> 00:17:47
what about his conscience

316
00:17:47 --> 00:17:52
what is the point of having some kind of
special power if you don&#39;t use it to

317
00:17:52 --> 00:17:52
help people

318
00:17:52 --> 00:17:56
ok it could be a tough life and lonely

319
00:17:56 --> 00:17:58
how can he ever talk to people

320
00:17:58 --> 00:18:02
the way we&#39;re talking right now I mean
what kind of a life can you really have

321
00:18:02 --> 00:18:04
to think about it for a minute

322
00:18:04 --> 00:18:07
he has to lie to everybody at work

323
00:18:07 --> 00:18:10
his friends what about girlfriends

324
00:18:10 --> 00:18:15
how could he ever hope to get married
just have a normal life

325
00:18:15 --> 00:18:19
people think would be really wonderful
to have spider-man&#39;s powers

326
00:18:19 --> 00:18:24
let me tell you I&#39;m not sure whether
it&#39;s a blessing or a curse i doubt if he

327
00:18:24 --> 00:18:27
could have put that much better

328
00:18:27 --> 00:18:28
you know Parker

329
00:18:28 --> 00:18:32
there&#39;s more to you than I am

330
00:18:32 --> 00:18:36
hello

331
00:18:36 --> 00:18:39
it&#39;s b well yeah sure alcohol

332
00:18:39 --> 00:18:43
it&#39;s john astin Smith news anchor you
know he wants to interview me for the

333
00:18:43 --> 00:18:47
evening dooms well yes I guess I could
speak for some of the students at the

334
00:18:47 --> 00:18:47
University

335
00:18:47 --> 00:18:51
what if it would be convenient for you
perhaps you could come to my hotel there

336
00:18:51 --> 00:18:54
alone and say an hour an hour

337
00:18:54 --> 00:19:00
fine sure thank you yeah go with you
I&#39;ve always wanted to meet him

338
00:19:00 --> 00:19:03
are you sure

339
00:19:03 --> 00:19:06
Parker&#39;s the one checked every student
at Baylor seminar

340
00:19:06 --> 00:19:09
he&#39;s the only one smart enough to pull
it off when we do get the plutonium

341
00:19:09 --> 00:19:12
what are you going to do with it same as
I do with everything

342
00:19:12 --> 00:19:15
just put it up the sale to the highest
bidder

343
00:19:15 --> 00:19:19
you captain Barbera yeah expected to
Carlo

344
00:19:19 --> 00:19:22
what can I do for you

345
00:19:22 --> 00:19:25
zero was wondering what progress you&#39;re
making on this boot onium thing

346
00:19:25 --> 00:19:29
it&#39;s only been two days but I&#39;ve got one
lead the security guards in such high

347
00:19:29 --> 00:19:30
demand at the sink

348
00:19:30 --> 00:19:34
what can you tell me about spider-man
not much give me a lot of sleep with

349
00:19:34 --> 00:19:37
nights you think he&#39;s capable of doing
something like this

350
00:19:37 --> 00:19:40
who knows it could be capable of
anything have you thought of the other

351
00:19:40 --> 00:19:41
possibilities

352
00:19:41 --> 00:19:45
you mean like terrorists I mean they
don&#39;t even have to build a bomb in

353
00:19:45 --> 00:19:45
theory

354
00:19:45 --> 00:19:50
just two kilos of plutonium oxide could
cause millions of cases of lung cancer

355
00:19:50 --> 00:19:54
okay stop it you&#39;re scaring me I mean -
well maybe we should go back to the

356
00:19:54 --> 00:19:55
University and talk to dr. Baylor again

357
00:19:55 --> 00:19:58
I&#39;ve already talked to dr. Baylor yeah
getting out

358
00:19:58 --> 00:20:01
I asked him if he had any student who is
capable of building a bomb with the

359
00:20:01 --> 00:20:05
missing plutonium and what&#39;d he say he
came up with one named Peter Parker

360
00:20:05 --> 00:20:06
Parker

361
00:20:06 --> 00:20:10
he&#39;s just a kid I know well then maybe
you can help me find him a series of my

362
00:20:10 --> 00:20:10
partner

407
00:22:19 --> 00:22:23
ok

408
00:22:23 --> 00:22:26
watch the radiation level torture of
course

409
00:22:26 --> 00:22:29
yeah

410
00:22:29 --> 00:22:31
here&#39;s the reflected

Parker&#39;s apartment

440
00:24:05 --> 00:24:08
he&#39;s got a lot of electronic equipment a
lawful of science book and I couldn&#39;t

441
00:24:08 --> 00:24:10
find the plutonium anywhere baby

442
00:24:10 --> 00:24:11
he doesn&#39;t have it

443
00:24:11 --> 00:24:14
and why are we watching him because he&#39;s
a very bright young man

444
00:24:14 --> 00:24:18
if any of his fellow students have the
plutonium you will find the forest

445
00:24:18 --> 00:24:21

Tom it&#39;s worth it

466
00:25:25 --> 00:25:30
the world want to prove now they&#39;ve got
it this with plastic explosive instead

467
00:25:30 --> 00:25:33
of modeling clay we could make it go
boom

468
00:25:33 --> 00:25:35
I will want to prove

469
00:25:35 --> 00:25:37
now they&#39;ve got

470
00:25:37 --> 00:25:40
this with plastic explosive instead of
modeling clay we can make it go boom

471
00:25:40 --> 00:25:43
that we should read what do you think

472
00:25:43 --> 00:25:46
yeah

473
00:25:46 --> 00:25:49
what you guys monitoring the radiation
level so we were not wrong

474
00:25:49 --> 00:25:54
all right fine i was working directly
with the Tony my car was gotta get her

475
00:25:54 --> 00:25:57
to the hospital

476
00:25:57 --> 00:26:00
the box has got range . you can die

477
00:26:00 --> 00:26:01
yeah

478
00:26:01 --> 00:26:05

482
00:26:11 --> 00:26:13

490
00:26:38 --> 00:26:41
I wish I could you know the radiation
burns don&#39;t you

491
00:26:41 --> 00:26:44
how did you get them we were working in
the lab at the University there&#39;s a lot

492
00:26:44 --> 00:26:48
of radioactive material right I&#39;ll have
to report this

493
00:26:48 --> 00:27:00
do whatever you have to do just make her
well hello

494
00:27:00 --> 00:27:04

one of the girls from the University
just showed up in emergency

496
00:27:07 --> 00:27:10
she&#39;s got radiation sickness radiation
sickness

497
00:27:10 --> 00:27:13
what&#39;s her name Carlo Wilson

498
00:27:13 --> 00:27:14

we&#39;re going to explode it we&#39;re going to
give it back some people tried to kidnap

512
00:27:49 --> 00:27:54

plutonium do you realize do you realize

513
00:27:54 --> 00:27:56
what they could do with an atomic bomb

514
00:27:56 --> 00:27:59
you&#39;re relaxed nothing&#39;s gonna happen

543
00:29:35 --> 00:29:38
Benson get up on the roof keep around at
front street

yeah

551
00:29:54 --> 00:29:57

552
00:29:57 --> 00:30:00
will work

553
00:30:00 --> 00:30:03
yeah

554
00:30:03 --> 00:30:05
will work

555
00:30:05 --> 00:30:10
not with modeling clay but I think we
can find some real plastic explosive

556
00:30:10 --> 00:30:15
not bad the atmosphere is containing
most of the radiation we gonna handle it

557
00:30:15 --> 00:30:21
get it down to the car get up there
angel

558
00:30:21 --> 00:30:24
ok

559
00:30:24 --> 00:30:27
yeah

560
00:30:27 --> 00:30:30
yeah

561
00:30:30 --> 00:30:31
yeah

562
00:30:31 --> 00:30:33
ok

563
00:30:33 --> 00:30:36
squash

564
00:30:36 --> 00:30:39
yeah

565
00:30:39 --> 00:30:44
yeah

566
00:30:44 --> 00:30:47
yeah

567
00:30:47 --> 00:30:52
go ahead and the small jet angel you and
Benson with the limousine on the cargo

568
00:30:52 --> 00:30:55
flight and stay with it at all times

569
00:30:55 --> 00:30:58
don&#39;t worry mr. we want anybody near it

570
00:30:58 --> 00:31:01
sorry we were just trying to show how
easily it can be done

571
00:31:01 --> 00:31:04
yes we only want to point out the need
for better security

572
00:31:04 --> 00:31:07
it can&#39;t be detonated without a large
quantity of c4 I doubt of the people who

573
00:31:07 --> 00:31:11
took it will have much trouble finding a
plastic explosive the neutron reflector

574
00:31:11 --> 00:31:14
was made of wax right inside of an
aluminum hemisphere

575
00:31:14 --> 00:31:17
basically that&#39;s a very simple implosion
device what kind of detonator controls

576
00:31:17 --> 00:31:21
did you use a computer circuit
microcircuits carry the signal its

577
00:31:21 --> 00:31:23
instantaneous response the best

578
00:31:23 --> 00:31:29
test your conscience is I hope you have
room on your conscience is for all the

579
00:31:29 --> 00:31:30
lives that may be lost

580
00:31:30 --> 00:31:33
I talk to you in your office captain
yeah you too

581
00:31:33 --> 00:31:36
harder

582
00:31:36 --> 00:31:43
gentlemen I&#39;d say we have a situation
here

583
00:31:43 --> 00:31:46
the bomb will explode the city what
could we expect if it&#39;s still innocent

584
00:31:46 --> 00:31:50
let&#39;s say it is 10 pounds of plutonium
could have a yield as much as 15

585
00:31:50 --> 00:31:50
kilotons

586
00:31:50 --> 00:31:53
now if that were to explode in wall
street in the middle of eating the

587
00:31:53 --> 00:31:56
public hears about this he&#39;ll be
unbelievable panic

588
00:31:56 --> 00:31:59
this must be kept out of the newspapers
as long as possible you understand that

589
00:31:59 --> 00:32:03
Parker - stand I guess this lets you off
the hook but not spider-man

590
00:32:03 --> 00:32:07
not quite he could still be involved
partner

591
00:32:07 --> 00:32:11
let me ask you something deep down you
really think this bomb will explode

592
00:32:11 --> 00:32:15
let me put it to you this way as far as
we know since 1945 everyone who has

593
00:32:15 --> 00:32:18
attempted to explode an atomic bomb has
succeeded on the first try

594
00:32:18 --> 00:32:20
yeah

595
00:32:20 --> 00:32:23
how come you calling me so late how&#39;s it
going home

596
00:32:23 --> 00:32:26
well this will just take a minute and
besides it&#39;s only 315 California

597
00:32:26 --> 00:32:30
what is one got to do with the other I
need a favor and I wanted to wait until

598
00:32:30 --> 00:32:31
mr. Jameson it going home

599
00:32:31 --> 00:32:34
yeah well what does that have to do with
the time in California we do you think

600
00:32:34 --> 00:32:37
your friend on the force could check on
a california license for me now are you

601
00:32:37 --> 00:32:45
ready yeah it for 10 are you what&#39;s this
all about

602
00:32:45 --> 00:32:48
all i can say is it might be very
important to a friend of mine

603
00:32:48 --> 00:32:52
anyone I know well yes

604
00:32:52 --> 00:32:57

belly dancer and an earthquake

606
00:33:02 --> 00:33:05

618
00:33:34 --> 00:33:38
hello I this is the night shift

619
00:33:38 --> 00:33:43
oh yeah reading what you find out well
California boy 10 lr is registered to

620
00:33:43 --> 00:33:46
the White import-export company of Los
Angeles

621
00:33:46 --> 00:33:51
I know it Thank You Rita thank you very
much you are terrific

622
00:33:51 --> 00:33:54
are you just saying that but you&#39;re
right

623
00:33:54 --> 00:33:59
later what&#39;s up

624
00:33:59 --> 00:34:02
I just figured out with the plutonium

625
00:34:02 --> 00:34:05
yeah

626
00:34:05 --> 00:34:08
yeah

627
00:34:08 --> 00:34:11
yeah

628
00:34:11 --> 00:34:14
yeah

629
00:34:14 --> 00:34:21
yeah

630
00:34:21 --> 00:34:24
yeah

631
00:34:24 --> 00:34:29
they&#39;re here excellent I want the device
completed immediate you already have a

632
00:34:29 --> 00:34:29
buyer

633
00:34:29 --> 00:34:35
well several curious neighbors like I
think we call a real quite truthfully

634
00:34:35 --> 00:34:39
it&#39;s been rather disappointing i think i
may have to try a new approach with this

635
00:34:39 --> 00:34:40
piece of merchandise

636
00:34:40 --> 00:34:44
you don&#39;t get your hands on an atomic
bomb just every day

637
00:34:44 --> 00:34:48
you&#39;re right it is a rather unique
opportunity an opportunity that should

638
00:34:48 --> 00:34:51
be exploded with imagination and sense
of style

639
00:34:51 --> 00:34:56
would you think I&#39;d say we&#39;ll get right
on it like this

640
00:34:56 --> 00:34:59
yes I can and I will do that spider-man

641
00:34:59 --> 00:35:02
you&#39;re going too stubborn to school i
like to call it persistence that you

642
00:35:02 --> 00:35:05
wait here

643
00:35:05 --> 00:35:08
that&#39;s good people you got eaten right
out of your hands

644
00:35:08 --> 00:35:15
glad you were able to see me see us
again mr. Jameson you won&#39;t regret it I

645
00:35:15 --> 00:35:16
promise you I doubt it

646
00:35:16 --> 00:35:19
why would you want to tell me well first
I want to thank you for giving me my job

647
00:35:19 --> 00:35:21
back but secondly i do have a special
request

648
00:35:21 --> 00:35:24
okay i&#39;m gonna ask me for a raise oh no
it&#39;s nothing like that it&#39;s just that I

649
00:35:24 --> 00:35:25
need some expense money

650
00:35:25 --> 00:35:30
you see I found out where the plutonium
is really where Los Angeles

651
00:35:30 --> 00:35:33
if you didn&#39;t con me into a trip to
California you forget it

652
00:35:33 --> 00:35:36
trying to con you mr. Jameson it&#39;s just
that that&#39;s where the plutonium is and

653
00:35:36 --> 00:35:38
the only way i can afford to get there
is if the bugle sounds me

654
00:35:38 --> 00:35:38
yeah

655
00:35:38 --> 00:35:41
and the only way i can afford to get
there is if the bugle sends me you&#39;ve

656
00:35:41 --> 00:35:44
got as much chance of going to
California my expenses you have a

657
00:35:44 --> 00:35:46
walking upside down in that ceiling

658
00:35:46 --> 00:35:53
yes well what what I&#39;m about to tell you
the bugle cannot print and neither can

659
00:35:53 --> 00:35:54
the examiner

660
00:35:54 --> 00:35:58
we can&#39;t breath what the missing
plutonium has been used to build a bomb

661
00:35:58 --> 00:36:06
atomic bomb you don&#39;t believe me ask
captain barbera be the story of the year

662
00:36:06 --> 00:36:12
a century later you can&#39;t print that the
public would panic but if I help find

663
00:36:12 --> 00:36:17
the bomb then the bugle would have an
exclusive which it could share with the

664
00:36:17 --> 00:36:21
exam which I but why California
spider-man told me about the license

665
00:36:21 --> 00:36:21
number

666
00:36:21 --> 00:36:25
spider-man you got this respondent well
we we sort of worked it out together is

667
00:36:25 --> 00:36:31
I wouldn&#39;t believe anything that weirdo
tells me i would say what here i will

668
00:36:31 --> 00:36:33
get the examiner to finance your trip

669
00:36:33 --> 00:36:36
if you get me that interview with
fireman and if when you&#39;re on the west

670
00:36:36 --> 00:36:37
coast you get his story

671
00:36:37 --> 00:36:42
my paper runs it with my byline oh wait
a minute wait a minute you&#39;re still

672
00:36:42 --> 00:36:43
working for the bugle remember

673
00:36:43 --> 00:36:47
does that mean you sent me to California
you&#39;re holding a gun at my head

674
00:36:47 --> 00:36:50

newspaper

proposal i would imagine it will have to

732

all the excitement spider-man&#39;s here

840
00:46:10 --> 00:46:13
it was and I got to see him in action he
was terrific he went swinging through

841
00:46:13 --> 00:46:13
the barn

842
00:46:13 --> 00:46:16
grab me and it&#39;s great the guy&#39;s hands
we went flying through the air and

843
00:46:16 --> 00:46:19
landed in a haystack

844
00:46:19 --> 00:46:22
it&#39;s a transmitter it belongs to
spider-man the one that was on a white

845
00:46:22 --> 00:46:23
limousine

846
00:46:23 --> 00:46:26
afraid so

847
00:46:26 --> 00:46:27
yeah

848
00:46:27 --> 00:46:30
yeah

849
00:46:30 --> 00:46:30
yeah

850
00:46:30 --> 00:46:33
yeah

851
00:46:33 --> 00:46:36
we&#39;re a bit we have a problem someone&#39;s
been following us because that kid

852
00:46:36 --> 00:46:36
partner

853
00:46:36 --> 00:46:40
so it was him checking out the car lost
him but then that spider man showed up

854
00:46:40 --> 00:46:40
again

855
00:46:40 --> 00:46:45
spider-man but you just said I did I did
I threw him off the building 50 stories

856
00:46:45 --> 00:46:46
there&#39;s no way you could have made it

857
00:46:46 --> 00:46:50
this is very disturbing spider-man could
be dangerous

858
00:46:50 --> 00:46:53
I think we&#39;ll have to accelerate the
timetable

859
00:46:53 --> 00:46:58
just called again if the government
doesn&#39;t agree to his demands

860
00:46:58 --> 00:47:03
I 6 p.m. new york time tomorrow he says
he&#39;ll explode the bomb will do the most

861
00:47:03 --> 00:47:06
damage has to mean that happen

862
00:47:06 --> 00:47:09
you were here i have a lot of times or
something like some food tourists

863
00:47:09 --> 00:47:12
everything&#39;s happening in New York I got
the first plane out of area

864
00:47:12 --> 00:47:16
I should never have listened to you too
why would the bomb in Los Angeles if

865
00:47:16 --> 00:47:19
they plan to exploded and then maybe
they don&#39;t have the ball middle

866
00:47:19 --> 00:47:22
no that&#39;s not it must be missing
something

867
00:47:22 --> 00:47:26
yes the last flight to New York no wait
sir we can&#39;t go

868
00:47:26 --> 00:47:29
the bomb is here believe me

869
00:47:29 --> 00:47:33
Peter you may be wrong the bomb would do
more damage in New York

870
00:47:33 --> 00:47:36
it just makes more sense

871
00:47:36 --> 00:47:39
no i&#39;m not wrong it&#39;s just

872
00:47:39 --> 00:47:42

00:00:00 --> 00:00:03
My lords, gentlemen,

3
00:00:03 --> 00:00:07
pray silence for Ralph Douglas
Christopher Alexander Gurney,

4
00:00:07 --> 00:00:09
the 13th earl of Gurney.

5
00:00:09 --> 00:00:10
Thank you.

6
00:00:10 --> 00:00:13
The aim of the
Society of St. George...

7
00:00:13 --> 00:00:16
is to keep green
the memory of England.

8
00:00:16 --> 00:00:20
We were once the rulers...

9
00:00:20 --> 00:00:23
of the greatest empire
the world has ever known!

10
00:00:23 --> 00:00:27
&lt;i&gt;- Hear, hear!
- Ruled not by superior force or skill,&lt;/i&gt;

11
00:00:27 --> 00:00:31
but by sheer presence.

12
00:00:31 --> 00:00:33
Hear, hear!

13
00:00:33 --> 00:00:36
So I give you England.

14
00:00:36 --> 00:00:40
This teeming womb of privilege.

15
00:00:40 --> 00:00:42
This feudal state...

16
00:00:42 --> 00:00:47
whose shores beat back
the turbulent sea of foreign anarchy.

17
00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
This ancient fortress,

18
00:00:49 --> 00:00:52
still commanded by the noblest
of our royal blood.

19
00:00:52 --> 00:00:53
Hear, hear!

20
00:00:53 --> 00:00:55
This ancient land of ritual.

21
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
This precious stone...

22
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
set in the silver sea.

23
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
The toast is &quot;England.
This precious stone...

24
00:01:02 --> 00:01:04
set in the silver sea.&quot;

25
00:01:04 --> 00:01:08
England. Set in the silver sea.

26
00:01:08 --> 00:01:13
&lt;i&gt;# God save our gracious Queen #&lt;/i&gt;

27
00:01:13 --> 00:01:19
&lt;i&gt;#Scatter Her enemies #&lt;/i&gt;

28
00:01:19 --> 00:01:24
&lt;i&gt;#And make them fall #&lt;/i&gt;

29
00:01:24 --> 00:01:30
&lt;i&gt;# Confound their politics #&lt;/i&gt;

30
00:01:30 --> 00:01:36
&lt;i&gt;#Frustrate their knavish tricks #&lt;/i&gt;

31
00:01:36 --> 00:01:43
&lt;i&gt;# On Thee our hopes we fix #&lt;/i&gt;

32
00:01:43 --> 00:01:49
&lt;i&gt;# God save the Queen ##&lt;/i&gt;

33
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
Ah, thank you, Tuck.

34
00:01:51 --> 00:01:53
How was your speech, my lord?

35
00:01:53 --> 00:01:54
Went well, Tuck.

36
00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
Englishmen like to hear
the truth about themselves.

37
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
He&#39;s back, Claire.

38
00:01:59 --> 00:02:03
Claire!
I said, Ralph is back.

39
00:02:03 --> 00:02:08
Thank you, Charles.
I&#39;ll have a vodka and tonic.

40
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
I say, guv&#39;nor, the guv&#39;nor is back.

41
00:02:11 --> 00:02:14
Mummy, I was just telling the guv&#39;nor
that the guv&#39;nor is back.

42
00:02:14 --> 00:02:16
Charles! With ice.

43
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
I&#39;m repeating myself,
calling the guv&#39;nor the guv&#39;nor
and Daddy the guv&#39;nor as well.

44
00:02:19 --> 00:02:22
- Tucker, I&#39;m getting married again.
- Very good, my lord.

45
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
Miss Grace Shelley.
Charles is right.

46
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
Been putting it off.
Sake of the family.

47
00:02:26 --> 00:02:27
OnlyJack left.

48
00:02:27 --> 00:02:31
This house... used to be
full of mischief.

49
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
Four young devils.

50
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
Thought I was safe enough.

51
00:02:36 --> 00:02:38
Master Paul would have been
the 14th earl.

52
00:02:38 --> 00:02:40
District officer at 21.

53
00:02:40 --> 00:02:42
Dead at 23. Beriberi.

54
00:02:42 --> 00:02:46
Picked it up off some scruffy
fuzzy-wuzzy in dressing gown.

55
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
Shouldn&#39;t wonder, eh?

56
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
Master Richard
used to play the xylophone.

57
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
And young Raymond,
killed in Malaya.

58
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
Not one of them buried in England.

59
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
Never seen their graves.

60
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
You could do that
on your honeymoon, my lord.

61
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
Hmm, there&#39;s stillJack.

62
00:03:04 --> 00:03:07
It&#39;s all based on land, Tuck.

63
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
Can&#39;t have those knaves
from Whitehall moving in.

64
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
So it&#39;s Miss Grace Shelley.

65
00:03:12 --> 00:03:14
Is she anyone, my lord?

66
00:03:14 --> 00:03:18
No one. But Charles recommends her
as good breeding stock.

67
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
Family foals well.
Sires, mostly.

68
00:03:21 --> 00:03:24
There&#39;s always room at the top for
brains, money or a good pair of titties.

69
00:03:24 --> 00:03:26
Miss Shelley seems
well endowed, my lord.

70
00:03:26 --> 00:03:29
&lt;i&gt;Hmm.&lt;/i&gt;

71
00:03:29 --> 00:03:32
Oh, the guv&#39;nor loved this bed.

72
00:03:32 --> 00:03:35
Took it all over
the world with him.

73
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
Devilish great man,
the guv&#39;nor. Superb shot.

74
00:03:38 --> 00:03:40
Did wonderful needlework too.

75
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
What do you got there, hmm?

76
00:03:42 --> 00:03:43
Huh.

77
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
Oh, yes. Why not?

78
00:03:45 --> 00:03:49
Hard day. Need to relax.

79
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
Might I suggest
the silk tonight, sir?

80
00:03:51 --> 00:03:53
Good idea, Tuck.

81
00:03:53 --> 00:03:56
For St. George, eh?

82
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
&lt;i&gt;Ah, Tuck, there&#39;s no end to duty.&lt;/i&gt;

83
00:03:59 --> 00:04:01
&lt;i&gt;The law has been my life, Tuck.&lt;/i&gt;

84
00:04:01 --> 00:04:04
&lt;i&gt;Ajudge can&#39;t be unreasonable...&lt;/i&gt;

85
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
so how can he be a lover, eh?

86
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
Ours is a damned dry world, Tuck.

87
00:04:08 --> 00:04:12
A long life
and a gray one, my lord.

88
00:04:12 --> 00:04:14
The power of life and death.

89
00:04:14 --> 00:04:17
Ajudge has no need for other vices.

90
00:04:17 --> 00:04:21
&lt;i&gt;Once you put on a black cap,
everything else tastes like wax fruit.&lt;/i&gt;

91
00:04:21 --> 00:04:24
Uh, noose a bit high, Tuck.
Bring it down half an inch.

92
00:04:24 --> 00:04:26
&lt;i&gt;That&#39;s it.&lt;/i&gt;

93
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
Will that be all, my lord?

94
00:04:28 --> 00:04:31
A whiskey and soda
in about five minutes, as usual.

95
00:04:31 --> 00:04:33
Oh, Tuck,
I shan&#39;t be dining tonight.

96
00:04:33 --> 00:04:35
Tell cook the trial ends tomorrow,

97
00:04:35 --> 00:04:38
so I shall be wanting one of her
extra-large breakfasts in the morning.

98
00:04:38 --> 00:04:41
She knows I don&#39;t like passing
sentence on an empty stomach.

99
00:04:41 --> 00:04:43
- Very good, my lord.
- Thank you, Tuck.

100
00:04:43 --> 00:04:47
Nothing like a good English breakfast.

101
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
&lt;i&gt;Big meal of the day for the guv&#39;nor.&lt;/i&gt;

102
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
&lt;i&gt;Always read The Times through first...&lt;/i&gt;

103
00:04:51 --> 00:04:53
in case there was anything
too disturbing in it.

104
00:04:53 --> 00:04:57
Mother never knew what the word
&quot;socialist&quot; meant till she was past 50.

105
00:04:57 --> 00:05:00
Remember standing
at the foot of the bed there...

106
00:05:00 --> 00:05:02
telling them
I wanted to be a painter.

107
00:05:02 --> 00:05:05
&quot;The Gurneys have never
been slackers,&quot; he said.

108
00:05:05 --> 00:05:08
&quot;Earned their privileges.&quot;

109
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
Great concession
letting me study law.

110
00:05:11 --> 00:05:14
Not the Gurney tradition, no.
Always the army.

111
00:05:14 --> 00:05:18
# Feet, feet, feet
The boys are marching #

112
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
A little more grapeshot,
Captain Bragg.

113
00:05:20 --> 00:05:23
Give &#39;em a touch
of the cold steel, boys.

114
00:05:23 --> 00:05:25
Close. It&#39;s getting close.

115
00:05:25 --> 00:05:28
I can feel her hot breath.
Wonderful, wonderful.

116
00:05:28 --> 00:05:31
One slip. Wonderful.
The worms have the best of it.

117
00:05:31 --> 00:05:35
They dine off the tenderest joints.
Juicy breasts, white thighs.

118
00:05:35 --> 00:05:39
&#39;Tis a far, far better thing
I do now than I&#39;ve ever done.

119
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
No, sir, no bandage.
Die, my dear doctor?

120
00:05:42 --> 00:05:45
Oh, that is the last thing
I shall do.

121
00:05:45 --> 00:05:49
Is that you, my love?
Come to me.

122
00:05:49 --> 00:05:51
Come!

123
00:05:51 --> 00:05:54
Touched him. Saw her.

124
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
Towers of death and silence.

125
00:05:56 --> 00:06:00
Angels of fire and ice.
Saw Alexander...

126
00:06:00 --> 00:06:03
covered with honey
and beeswax in his tomb.

127
00:06:03 --> 00:06:06
Felt the flowers growing over me.

128
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
Oh, a man must have vision.

129
00:06:09 --> 00:06:13
How else could an English judge,
and peer of the realm...

130
00:06:13 --> 00:06:17
take moonlit trips
to Marrakesh and Ponders End?

131
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
See six vestal virgins
smoking cigars?

132
00:06:20 --> 00:06:22
Moses in bedroom slippers?

133
00:06:22 --> 00:06:25
Naked bosoms floating past Formosa?

134
00:06:25 --> 00:06:27
Just time for a quick one.

135
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
Be of good cheer, Master Ridley,

136
00:06:30 --> 00:06:31
and play the man.

137
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
There&#39;s plenty of time
to win this game...

138
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
and beat the Spaniards too.

139
00:06:35 --> 00:06:37
Form squares, men!

140
00:06:37 --> 00:06:40
Smash the Mahdi...
and Binnie Barnes!

141
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
&lt;i&gt;- Are you ready,
Your Lordship?&lt;/i&gt;

142
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
Bleeding bloody hell.

143
00:06:45 --> 00:06:49
&lt;i&gt;&quot;I am the resurrection
and the life, &quot;sayeth the Lord.&lt;/i&gt;

144
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
&quot;He that believeth in me...

145
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
though he were dead,
yet shall he live.

146
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
And whomsoever liveth
and believeth in me...

147
00:06:58 --> 00:07:00
shall never die.

148
00:07:00 --> 00:07:04
Gilead is mine
and Manasses is mine.

149
00:07:04 --> 00:07:08
Ephraim also
is the strength of my head.

150
00:07:08 --> 00:07:11
Judah is my lawgiver...

151
00:07:11 --> 00:07:14
and Moab is my washpot.

152
00:07:14 --> 00:07:18
Over Edom will I cast out
my shoe...

153
00:07:18 --> 00:07:22
and upon Philistria
will I triumph.

154
00:07:22 --> 00:07:26
Who will lead me
into the strong city...

155
00:07:26 --> 00:07:31
and who will bring me
into Edom?&quot;

156
00:07:31 --> 00:07:35
#All things
bright and beautiful #

157
00:07:35 --> 00:07:39
#All creatures great and small #

158
00:07:39 --> 00:07:43
#All things wise and wonderful #

159
00:07:43 --> 00:07:48
#The Lord God made them all ##

160
00:07:48 --> 00:07:51
An excellent service, Bertie.
Created exactly the right impression.

161
00:07:51 --> 00:07:53
Damned if I could understand
a word of it.

162
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
I hardly expected you to, my boy.

163
00:07:55 --> 00:07:56
Charles, I must
have a word with you.

164
00:07:56 --> 00:07:58
Charles, you see,
this was a service...

165
00:07:58 --> 00:08:01
which I could not have conducted
for someone who may have laid...

166
00:08:01 --> 00:08:03
vi-violent hands upon himself.

167
00:08:03 --> 00:08:06
Wait, Charles.
A disturbing rumor has reached me.

168
00:08:06 --> 00:08:08
Tell me, did Ralph commit suicide?

169
00:08:08 --> 00:08:11
Suicide? Tucker found Ralph
hanging in his bedroom...

170
00:08:11 --> 00:08:13
wearing a cocked hat,
underpants and a ballet skirt.

171
00:08:13 --> 00:08:17
- Does that sound like suicide?
- Oh, no, no, it does not.

172
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
But l-l-I had to be sure,
Charles. After all, he...

173
00:08:19 --> 00:08:21
well, he is buried
in consecrated ground.

174
00:08:21 --> 00:08:23
I must say, it&#39;s damned
odd to find Uncle Ralph...

175
00:08:23 --> 00:08:25
hanging around like that
in a ballet skirt.

176
00:08:25 --> 00:08:28
Charles, didn&#39;t you say Ralph
was always rather... artistic?

177
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
He was willful, stubborn,
and this time he went too far.

178
00:08:30 --> 00:08:32
But he was my brother.
Well, half brother.

179
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
I will not have you
calling him artistic.

180
00:08:35 --> 00:08:38
Cocked hat. Cocked hat.
You said cocked hat, Charles.

181
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
Wh-Why was Ralph
wearing a cocked hat?

182
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
Trying it on for size, obviously.

183
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
I told him
not to remain a widower.

184
00:08:44 --> 00:08:46
The guv&#39;nor didn&#39;t have
to start breeding again.

185
00:08:46 --> 00:08:48
It was not pleasant
for a man of Ralph&#39;s age,

186
00:08:48 --> 00:08:50
but that was something
he had to get on top of.

187
00:08:50 --> 00:08:53
Underpants. Wh-Why was...

188
00:08:53 --> 00:08:57
Why was he... Why was he...
Why was he in his underpants, Charles?

189
00:08:57 --> 00:08:59
Well, he was in his
bedroom, wasn&#39;t he?

190
00:08:59 --> 00:09:01
I thought all our troubles
would be over...

191
00:09:01 --> 00:09:03
when he took a fancy
to young Grace Shelley.

192
00:09:03 --> 00:09:05
- That would have solved everything.
- Yes, wouldn&#39;t it just?

193
00:09:05 --> 00:09:07
I do not know
what all the bother is about.

194
00:09:07 --> 00:09:10
Uncle Ralph has got an heir:
Jack, the 14th earl.

195
00:09:10 --> 00:09:12
Yes, there&#39;s always Jack.

196
00:09:12 --> 00:09:15
Yes, it&#39;s gonna be awkward.
Damned awkward.

197
00:09:15 --> 00:09:18
Well, Ralph knew the situation.
I&#39;m sure he&#39;s made proper arrangements.

198
00:09:18 --> 00:09:21
It&#39;s simply a matter of finding out who
he&#39;s made legal guardian of the estate.

199
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
Ballet skirt!

200
00:09:23 --> 00:09:27
What on earth was he doing in a ballet
skirt, Charles? Answer me that.

201
00:09:27 --> 00:09:29
A Mr. Matthew Peake
to see you, Sir Charles.

202
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
Thank you, Tucker.
Come on in, Peake.

203
00:09:32 --> 00:09:34
I believe you know everyone here.

204
00:09:34 --> 00:09:35
I have that honor, Sir Charles.

205
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
All right, that&#39;s all, Tucker.
We&#39;re not to be disturbed.

206
00:09:37 --> 00:09:41
Uh, might I suggest,
Sir Charles, that Tucker stays?

207
00:09:41 --> 00:09:43
What?

208
00:09:43 --> 00:09:44
Hmm, quite.

209
00:09:44 --> 00:09:46
Well, Tucker, it seems you&#39;re going
to hear something to your advantage.

210
00:09:46 --> 00:09:48
- Yes.
- Do sit down, Tucker.

211
00:09:48 --> 00:09:49
Thank you, madame.

212
00:09:49 --> 00:09:51
&lt;i&gt;May I take this opportunity
to express my condolences?&lt;/i&gt;

213
00:09:51 --> 00:09:53
&lt;i&gt;Yes, yes, but do get on with it.&lt;/i&gt;

214
00:09:53 --> 00:09:55
But, Sir Charles,
shouldn&#39;t we wait?

215
00:09:55 --> 00:09:57
- I mean, His Lordship&#39;s heir.
- He&#39;s been notified.

216
00:09:57 --> 00:09:59
Wasn&#39;t able to get away for the funeral,
so he&#39;s not likely to come now.

217
00:09:59 --> 00:10:02
Very well.
I will inform him later.

218
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
&quot;I, Ralph Douglas
Christopher Alexander Gurney...

219
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
of Gurney House
in the county of Bedfordshire,

220
00:10:06 --> 00:10:09
hereby revoke all former wills
and codicils and declare this to be
my last will.

221
00:10:09 --> 00:10:12
I appoint Mr. Matthew Peake
of 17 Brownlow Gardens, Bedfordshire,

222
00:10:12 --> 00:10:14
to be the sole executor of my will.

223
00:10:14 --> 00:10:17
I give and bequeath
unto my manservant, Daniel Tucker...

224
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
the sum of £30,000 free of duty.&quot;

225
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
&lt;i&gt;- What?
- Thirty thousand?&lt;/i&gt;

226
00:10:21 --> 00:10:24
&lt;i&gt;There follow a number
of bequests to various charities.&lt;/i&gt;

227
00:10:24 --> 00:10:26
&lt;i&gt;I&#39;ll run through them briefly.&lt;/i&gt;

228
00:10:26 --> 00:10:31
I bequeath the sum of £5,000 to the
Tail Wavers Registered National Charity,

229
00:10:31 --> 00:10:34
£3,000 to the Bankers
Benificent Society, Limited...

230
00:10:34 --> 00:10:37
Thirty-thousand smackers!
Yippee!

231
00:10:37 --> 00:10:40
# I&#39;m Gilbert the Filbert
The Knut with a &quot;K&quot; #

232
00:10:40 --> 00:10:43
#The pride of Piccadilly
The blase roue #

233
00:10:43 --> 00:10:46
# Oh, Hades, the ladies
who leave their wooden hats #

234
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
# For Gilbert the Filbert
The colonel of the Knuts ##

235
00:10:49 --> 00:10:52
&lt;i&gt;I say, Tucker seems a bit hit up.&lt;/i&gt;

236
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
So are the ways of everyone,
my boy, who is greedy of gain.

237
00:10:55 --> 00:10:57
Now then, Peake,
what about the Zambezi Mission?

238
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
And what about
the Overseas Bishoprics Fund?

239
00:10:59 --> 00:11:02
- Oh, never mind about them, Bertie!
- Charles, the Zambezi...

240
00:11:02 --> 00:11:04
&lt;i&gt;What about the estate?&lt;/i&gt;

241
00:11:04 --> 00:11:07
&quot;I devise and bequeath the remainder
of my estate, both real and personal,

242
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
&lt;i&gt;whatsoever and wheresoever
to which I might be entitled...&lt;/i&gt;

243
00:11:09 --> 00:11:11
&lt;i&gt;or over which I have any disposing
at the time of my death...&lt;/i&gt;

244
00:11:11 --> 00:11:16
to my beloved son,
Jack Arnold Alexander Tancred Gurney...

245
00:11:16 --> 00:11:20
&lt;i&gt;the 14th earl of Gurney,
for his own use absolutely. &quot;&lt;/i&gt;

246
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
For his own use absolutely?

247
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
Well, who&#39;s been appointed
legal guardian?

248
00:11:24 --> 00:11:26
No one.

249
00:11:26 --> 00:11:29
By the rivers of Babylon,
there we sat down. Yea, we wept...

250
00:11:29 --> 00:11:32
You mean Jack&#39;s free to run
the estate and everything?

251
00:11:32 --> 00:11:34
Jack&#39;ll cheer up
the House of Lords.

252
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
Oh, Ralph obviously
let his personal feelings
come before his duty to his family.

253
00:11:37 --> 00:11:39
Well, we&#39;ll just
have to fight. Awkward.

254
00:11:39 --> 00:11:41
There&#39;s bound to be a scandal,
but there&#39;s no choice.

255
00:11:41 --> 00:11:43
&quot;If this will be contested
in any way,

256
00:11:43 --> 00:11:45
the whole of my estate,
both real and personal,

257
00:11:45 --> 00:11:48
is bequeathed to the charities herewith:
The Earl Haig Fund...&quot;

258
00:11:48 --> 00:11:51
- It&#39;s disgraceful!
- May God forgive him.

259
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
How bizarre.
What a macabre sense of humor.

260
00:11:53 --> 00:11:56
- But, Father, I don&#39;t understand.
- You ask him to explain
before he explodes.

261
00:11:56 --> 00:11:58
Blast you, there&#39;s land at stake here,
Gurney land!

262
00:11:58 --> 00:12:00
- I&#39;m completely in the fog.
- When were you not?

263
00:12:00 --> 00:12:02
I don&#39;t understand what...

264
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
Ladies and gentlemen, the queen&#39;s
right trusty and well-beloved cousin,

265
00:12:06 --> 00:12:10
Jack Arnold
Alexander Tancred Gurney,

266
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
14th earl of Gurney.

267
00:12:12 --> 00:12:13
Hello.

268
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t here before.
I received the news only yesterday.

269
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
I&#39;m afraid our little community
is somewhat cut off.

270
00:12:18 --> 00:12:21
I hope you&#39;ll forgive me.
I know he will.

271
00:12:21 --> 00:12:23
I&#39;ve just been to his grave.

272
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
Thank you, Uncle Charles,
for making all the arrangements.

273
00:12:26 --> 00:12:28
&lt;i&gt;Aunt Claire, you haven&#39;t changed.&lt;/i&gt;

274
00:12:28 --> 00:12:30
Nor you.

275
00:12:30 --> 00:12:31
&lt;i&gt;You must be Dinsdale.&lt;/i&gt;

276
00:12:31 --> 00:12:34
Yes, I suppose I must be.
How do you do?

277
00:12:34 --> 00:12:38
&lt;i&gt;Are you still angry
with me, Bishop?&lt;/i&gt;

278
00:12:38 --> 00:12:40
Let me put your minds at rest.

279
00:12:40 --> 00:12:44
I&#39;m coming back to take
my place in the world.

280
00:12:44 --> 00:12:47
The monastic ideal isn&#39;t easy.
I&#39;ve had many broken nights.

281
00:12:47 --> 00:12:51
But I&#39;m coming back refreshed,
though hardly equipped for society.

282
00:12:51 --> 00:12:53
I shall need your help, Charles.

283
00:12:53 --> 00:12:57
Come. We&#39;re all one family.
Let&#39;s wash away the old sores.

284
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
If the bishop doesn&#39;t mind,
I think we should pray.

285
00:12:59 --> 00:13:03
- Pray?
- For love and understanding.

286
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
Surely you pray
for love and understanding?

287
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
Every night... without success.

288
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
- You too, my son.
- I&#39;m a Methodist.

289
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
I&#39;m sure you&#39;re
still a Christian. Come.

290
00:13:13 --> 00:13:15
&lt;i&gt;For me.&lt;/i&gt;

291
00:13:15 --> 00:13:16
Yes, my lord.

292
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
A prayer should rise up
like incense.

293
00:13:18 --> 00:13:21
A prayer is an act
of faith and union.

294
00:13:21 --> 00:13:24
To pray means to ask,
to beg, to plead.

295
00:13:24 --> 00:13:28
A prayer is a message to heaven.
You are talking directly to God.

296
00:13:28 --> 00:13:31
Express your desires freely.
Don&#39;t be afraid.

297
00:13:31 --> 00:13:33
I know them already.

298
00:13:33 --> 00:13:37
For I am the creator
and ruler of the universe.

299
00:13:37 --> 00:13:42
Khoda, the one supreme being
and infinite personal being.

300
00:13:42 --> 00:13:45
Yaweh, Shangri-Ti and EI,

301
00:13:45 --> 00:13:48
the First Immoveable Mover, yea,

302
00:13:48 --> 00:13:52
I am the Absolute, Unknowable,
Righteous, Eternal,

303
00:13:52 --> 00:13:56
the Lord of Hosts,
King of Kings, Lord of Lords,

304
00:13:56 --> 00:13:59
the Father, Son and Holy Ghost,

305
00:13:59 --> 00:14:02
the One True God,
the God of love,

306
00:14:02 --> 00:14:03
the Christ!

307
00:14:03 --> 00:14:06
His Lordship
is a paranoid schizophrenic.

308
00:14:06 --> 00:14:09
Paranoid schizophrenic?
But he&#39;s a Gurney.

309
00:14:09 --> 00:14:13
Then he&#39;s a paranoid schizophrenic
Gurney who believes he&#39;s God.

310
00:14:13 --> 00:14:15
But we&#39;ve always been
Church of England.

311
00:14:15 --> 00:14:17
His idea of the world
we live in...

312
00:14:17 --> 00:14:19
is determined
solely by his feelings.

313
00:14:19 --> 00:14:21
What he feels is, is.

314
00:14:21 --> 00:14:24
If my nephew is bonkers, why
the blazes did you let him out?

315
00:14:24 --> 00:14:27
He&#39;s a voluntary patient in a private
clinic, free to go whenever he chooses.

316
00:14:27 --> 00:14:30
His father insisted on
no official certification.

317
00:14:30 --> 00:14:33
If you want him detained here
permanently, you must bring him
before the Board of Control...

318
00:14:33 --> 00:14:36
or get a master in lunacy
to sign an order.

319
00:14:36 --> 00:14:38
&lt;i&gt;Later, after we&#39;ve
got a few things settled.&lt;/i&gt;

320
00:14:38 --> 00:14:39
&lt;i&gt;From a medical point of view,&lt;/i&gt;

321
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
&lt;i&gt;a plunge into the working world
won&#39;t do the earl any harm.&lt;/i&gt;

322
00:14:41 --> 00:14:44
Won&#39;t do him any harm?
What about the rest of us?

323
00:14:44 --> 00:14:46
&lt;i&gt;He&#39;s not dangerous.
Besides, I shall be on hand.&lt;/i&gt;

324
00:14:46 --> 00:14:48
&lt;i&gt;It&#39;ll be an interesting
experiment.&lt;/i&gt;

325
00:14:48 --> 00:14:51
A harsh dose of reality
can help towards a cure.

326
00:14:51 --> 00:14:54
Cure! You&#39;ve had him here
for seven years. Look at him.

327
00:14:54 --> 00:14:56
What have you been doing?

328
00:14:56 --> 00:14:59
Exercising patience
and understanding,

329
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
something he&#39;ll need
from his family.

330
00:15:01 --> 00:15:03
Yes, but why haven&#39;t you
used the knife?

331
00:15:03 --> 00:15:06
Because lobotomy is irrelevant
and dangerous in this case.

332
00:15:06 --> 00:15:10
&lt;i&gt;He can&#39;t forget being rejected by
his mother and father at the age of 11.&lt;/i&gt;

333
00:15:10 --> 00:15:12
They sent him away, alone...

334
00:15:12 --> 00:15:16
into a primitive community of
licensed bullies and pederasts.

335
00:15:16 --> 00:15:19
- You mean he went to public school?
- Exactly.

336
00:15:19 --> 00:15:22
I&#39;m aware of psychotherapy&#39;s
messy inadequacies,

337
00:15:22 --> 00:15:25
but I hope that my current
research will put it all...

338
00:15:25 --> 00:15:27
on a more scientific basis.

339
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
But it depends on my getting
a Guldenheim grant.

340
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
Well, never mind about that.
What aboutJack?

341
00:15:31 --> 00:15:34
Remember he&#39;s suffering
from delusions of grandeur.

342
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
In reality, he&#39;s an earl,
an English aristocrat,

343
00:15:36 --> 00:15:37
a member of the ruling class.

344
00:15:37 --> 00:15:41
&lt;i&gt;Naturally he&#39;s come to believe there&#39;s
only one person grander than that:&lt;/i&gt;

345
00:15:41 --> 00:15:42
The Lord God Almighty Himself.

346
00:15:42 --> 00:15:44
- Are you English?
- No.

347
00:15:44 --> 00:15:46
Ahhh.

348
00:15:46 --> 00:15:48
What&#39;s all this, then?

349
00:15:48 --> 00:15:51
It&#39;s His Lordship&#39;s effects.
Sign here, please.

350
00:15:51 --> 00:15:52
Christ.

351
00:15:52 --> 00:15:56
If I saw a man eating grass,
I&#39;d say he was hungry.

352
00:15:56 --> 00:15:58
They&#39;d have him certified.

353
00:15:58 --> 00:16:01
They claim that snow is only
precipitation and not candied dew.

354
00:16:01 --> 00:16:03
Whroom!
I&#39;m always thinking so fast.

355
00:16:03 --> 00:16:06
Whroom! Space and time exist
only within the walls of my brain.

356
00:16:06 --> 00:16:08
Whroom!
What I&#39;m trying to say...

357
00:16:08 --> 00:16:10
is if the words sound queer
or funny to your ear,

358
00:16:10 --> 00:16:11
a little bit jumbled up
and jivey,

359
00:16:11 --> 00:16:12
sing mares eat oats and does eat oats
and little lambs eat ivy.

360
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
Ivy, ivy? Who&#39;s Ivy?
I&#39;ve... I, l...

361
00:16:14 --> 00:16:17
For I&#39;m the Lord Jesus
come again in my own body...

362
00:16:17 --> 00:16:20
to heal the sick,
the troubled and the ignorant.

363
00:16:20 --> 00:16:23
I am he that liveth, and behold,
I am alive for everyone.

364
00:16:23 --> 00:16:26
Is everybody happy?
Now hear this.

365
00:16:26 --> 00:16:28
I come to proclaim
the new dispensation.

366
00:16:28 --> 00:16:30
The gospel dispensation promised
only salvation to the soul.

367
00:16:30 --> 00:16:32
The new dispensation
gives it to the body as well.

368
00:16:32 --> 00:16:34
Jesus Christ... Mark l...
suffered to redeem the spirit...

369
00:16:34 --> 00:16:35
to let the body
separate it from God.

370
00:16:35 --> 00:16:38
So Satan found the place in man
and formed in him a false love,
a love of self.

371
00:16:38 --> 00:16:41
Explode! Only feel.

372
00:16:41 --> 00:16:43
Love can sin no more.

373
00:16:43 --> 00:16:47
Most anything you touch,
see and feel glorifies my love.

374
00:16:47 --> 00:16:51
Top hat is my miter,
and the walking stick my rod.

375
00:16:51 --> 00:16:53
Oh, dear.

376
00:16:53 --> 00:16:56
Once I get started, it&#39;s...
it&#39;s terribly difficult to stop.

377
00:16:56 --> 00:16:58
&lt;i&gt;- I&#39;m so sorry.
- No, no, no, no.&lt;/i&gt;

378
00:16:58 --> 00:17:01
It&#39;s fascinating.
How do you know you&#39;re God?

379
00:17:01 --> 00:17:04
Simple. When I pray to Him,
I find I&#39;m talking to myself.

380
00:17:04 --> 00:17:06
I see. Well,
how did it happen?

381
00:17:06 --> 00:17:08
How did you come
to be in this state of grace?

382
00:17:08 --> 00:17:11
Like every prophet, I saw
visions, heard voices, I ran.

383
00:17:11 --> 00:17:14
The voices of St. Francis, Socrates,
General Gordon and Timothy O&#39;Leary...

384
00:17:14 --> 00:17:15
all told me I was God.

385
00:17:15 --> 00:17:18
It was Sunday,
August 25, at 3:32.

386
00:17:18 --> 00:17:20
I heard a terrible thunderclap
and saw a body of light...

387
00:17:20 --> 00:17:23
like the light from the sun
and red as fire.

388
00:17:23 --> 00:17:26
I cried, &quot;Hallelujah, Lord.
What will You do?&quot;

389
00:17:26 --> 00:17:27
And the light vanished.

390
00:17:27 --> 00:17:30
Blackness and darkness...

391
00:17:30 --> 00:17:34
until a great brush dipped
in light swept across the sky,

392
00:17:34 --> 00:17:36
and I saw the diversity,
distinction and variety...

393
00:17:36 --> 00:17:39
all clearly rolled up
into the unity...

394
00:17:39 --> 00:17:41
of universal love.

395
00:17:41 --> 00:17:45
- Where did all this happen?
- East Acton, outside the public urinal.

396
00:17:45 --> 00:17:47
What does it feel like to be God?

397
00:17:47 --> 00:17:49
Like a river flowing everywhere.

398
00:17:49 --> 00:17:51
I pick up a newspaper,
and I&#39;m everywhere...

399
00:17:51 --> 00:17:54
conducting a summit conference,
dying of hunger in a Peruvian gutter,

400
00:17:54 --> 00:17:56
accepting the Nobel Prize
for literature, raping a nun in Sumatra.

401
00:17:56 --> 00:18:00
Under this protective outer shell...

402
00:18:00 --> 00:18:02
I&#39;m God-filled.

403
00:18:02 --> 00:18:04
Your Lordship, Sir Cha...
One moment.

404
00:18:04 --> 00:18:06
- What the...
- I haven&#39;t finished yet.

405
00:18:06 --> 00:18:07
Sir Charles Gurney, my lord.

406
00:18:07 --> 00:18:11
- Insolent clown.
- I heard that, Sir Charles.

407
00:18:11 --> 00:18:13
The world&#39;s gone mad.
He&#39;ll have to go.

408
00:18:13 --> 00:18:16
Hadn&#39;t we better wait? Somebody new
mightn&#39;t understand the situation.

409
00:18:16 --> 00:18:18
Why is he hanging on
with 30,000 in the bank?

410
00:18:18 --> 00:18:21
- Out of love.
- Love? Tucker? Rot.

411
00:18:21 --> 00:18:23
There are certain matters to do
with the estate that need clearing up.

412
00:18:23 --> 00:18:25
Nothing important.
Just need your signature.

413
00:18:25 --> 00:18:27
- Gives me power to handle odd things.
- Of course, Uncle.

414
00:18:27 --> 00:18:29
There&#39;s no need to read it.
Just take my word.

415
00:18:29 --> 00:18:31
I take your word. I put on
my glasses because I feel cold.

416
00:18:31 --> 00:18:33
- Where do I sign?
- Just there.

417
00:18:33 --> 00:18:35
Excellent, excellent.
Easily done, eh?

418
00:18:35 --> 00:18:38
&quot;I, the undersigned,
Mycroft Holmes&quot;?

419
00:18:38 --> 00:18:39
Who&#39;s Mycroft Holmes?

420
00:18:39 --> 00:18:41
Brother of Sherlock Holmes,
you illiterate oaf.

421
00:18:41 --> 00:18:43
- But your name&#39;s Jack.
- Never call me that!

422
00:18:43 --> 00:18:46
Jack&#39;s a word
I reject absolutely.

423
00:18:46 --> 00:18:48
It&#39;s a word I put into
my galvanized pressure cooker.

424
00:18:48 --> 00:18:50
Whreeep! Jack&#39;s dead.

425
00:18:50 --> 00:18:54
All right, all right.
What should we call you then?

426
00:18:54 --> 00:18:56
Any of the nine billion
names of God...

427
00:18:56 --> 00:18:59
Your Lordship will do, orJ.C.,
Eric, Bert, Barney Entwistle.

428
00:18:59 --> 00:19:01
I know exactly who I am.

429
00:19:01 --> 00:19:03
- You asked for these, my lord.
- Burn them, Mr. Tucker, burn them.

430
00:19:03 --> 00:19:06
&lt;i&gt;But great Scott, man.
These are your coronation robes.&lt;/i&gt;

431
00:19:06 --> 00:19:07
A lot of tradition here, my lord.

432
00:19:07 --> 00:19:09
The axe must be laid
to the root, Uncle Charles.

433
00:19:09 --> 00:19:12
Pride and riches, pomp and property,
all must be locked off.

434
00:19:12 --> 00:19:14
Love makes all men equal.

435
00:19:14 --> 00:19:16
I love you dearly, Uncle Charles.

436
00:19:16 --> 00:19:18
Keep them,
if you feel so lost.

437
00:19:18 --> 00:19:21
Join me in a constitutional
before lunch, Mr. Tucker?

438
00:19:21 --> 00:19:25
Enjoy yourselves while I&#39;m gone.
Relax. Have sex.

439
00:19:25 --> 00:19:27
My God!

440
00:19:27 --> 00:19:28
Yes?

441
00:19:28 --> 00:19:30
No, no, no. Nothing.

442
00:19:30 --> 00:19:33
Well? You heard
what he said, Charles.

443
00:19:33 --> 00:19:34
I did.

444
00:19:34 --> 00:19:36
Destroying property.
All men are equal.

445
00:19:36 --> 00:19:38
Do you know what
this means, Claire?

446
00:19:38 --> 00:19:40
He&#39;s not only mad, he&#39;s Bolshie!

447
00:19:40 --> 00:19:44
Smell the soul dust from
the lawns and hedgerows.

448
00:19:44 --> 00:19:47
Oh, what a beautiful day I&#39;ve made.

449
00:19:47 --> 00:19:50
Look. Soft thistle and nigella.

450
00:19:50 --> 00:19:52
What?

451
00:19:52 --> 00:19:54
No water in days? Sorry.

452
00:19:54 --> 00:19:56
Can&#39;t think of everything.
I&#39;ll see to it.

453
00:19:56 --> 00:19:59
Remember the Sunday
picnics, Mr. Tucker?

454
00:19:59 --> 00:20:02
The world was all top hats
and white lace.

455
00:20:02 --> 00:20:04
And the best heavy silverware.

456
00:20:04 --> 00:20:07
- A snort, Your Lordship?
- Thank you.

457
00:20:07 --> 00:20:10
If only I knew then who I was now.

458
00:20:10 --> 00:20:12
Mmm, Mr. Grasshopper.

459
00:20:12 --> 00:20:14
Of course I bless you, you cherub,

460
00:20:14 --> 00:20:16
along with J. Edgar Hoover.

461
00:20:16 --> 00:20:20
This is the first chance I&#39;ve had
of speaking to you alone.

462
00:20:20 --> 00:20:24
- Be on your guard, sir.
- You puzzle me, Mr. Tucker.

463
00:20:24 --> 00:20:27
The family...
I&#39;ve seen them at work before.

464
00:20:27 --> 00:20:30
They got the power.
They make the rules.

465
00:20:30 --> 00:20:32
Back there, they&#39;re plotting
against you like mad.

466
00:20:32 --> 00:20:35
Love cannot doubt
nor faith the mustard seed.

467
00:20:35 --> 00:20:38
&quot;Plotting&quot; is a word I put into
my galvanized pressure cooker.

468
00:20:38 --> 00:20:39
Vroooom! It&#39;s gone.

469
00:20:39 --> 00:20:43
Feeling persecuted is one of the signs
of paranoid schizophrenia.

470
00:20:43 --> 00:20:46
Many poor wretches in Dr. Herder&#39;s
dancing academy suffered from same.

471
00:20:46 --> 00:20:50
&quot;I am being watched,&quot; they said.
&quot;Everybody is against me,&quot; they cried.

472
00:20:50 --> 00:20:53
You&#39;ve set up profound negative
reactions with your Kremlin plots.

473
00:20:53 --> 00:20:54
I&#39;m leaving you.

474
00:20:54 --> 00:20:57
Resist it, Mr. Tucker.
That way madness lies.

475
00:20:57 --> 00:21:01
&lt;i&gt;That&#39;s the thanks you get.
He&#39;s the same as all the rest.&lt;/i&gt;

476
00:21:01 --> 00:21:03
&lt;i&gt;What he doesn&#39;t want to be so
just isn&#39;t so.&lt;/i&gt;

477
00:21:03 --> 00:21:06
&lt;i&gt;No skin off my nose.
My 30,000&#39;s safe.&lt;/i&gt;

478
00:21:06 --> 00:21:08
&lt;i&gt;And I deserve
every last penny of it.&lt;/i&gt;

479
00:21:08 --> 00:21:10
&lt;i&gt;And more, and more and more!&lt;/i&gt;

480
00:21:10 --> 00:21:14
&lt;i&gt;What&#39;s keeping you then, Dan?
Be honest now, Daniel.&lt;/i&gt;

481
00:21:14 --> 00:21:16
&lt;i&gt;Fear. Fear and habit.&lt;/i&gt;

482
00:21:16 --> 00:21:18
&lt;i&gt;You get into the habit of serving.&lt;/i&gt;

483
00:21:18 --> 00:21:20
&lt;i&gt;Born a servant, see.
Son of a servant.&lt;/i&gt;

484
00:21:20 --> 00:21:22
&lt;i&gt;Family of servants.
From a nation of servants!&lt;/i&gt;

485
00:21:22 --> 00:21:26
&lt;i&gt;The first thing an Englishman does,
straight from his mother&#39;s womb,
is touch his forelock.&lt;/i&gt;

486
00:21:26 --> 00:21:28
&lt;i&gt;That&#39;s how they can tell
the wrinkled little bastard&#39;s English.&lt;/i&gt;

487
00:21:28 --> 00:21:29
&lt;i&gt;They don&#39;t know about me.&lt;/i&gt;

488
00:21:29 --> 00:21:31
&lt;i&gt;A lot they don&#39;t know
about Daniel Tucker.&lt;/i&gt;

489
00:21:31 --> 00:21:33
&lt;i&gt;Just old faithful Tucker.
Give doggie boney.&lt;/i&gt;

490
00:21:33 --> 00:21:36
&lt;i&gt;You know who I really am?
Alexei Kronstadt.&lt;/i&gt;

491
00:21:36 --> 00:21:40
&lt;i&gt;Anarchist, Trotskyist, Communist,
revolutionary. I&#39;m a cell!&lt;/i&gt;

492
00:21:40 --> 00:21:43
For years I&#39;ve been working
for the revolution.

493
00:21:43 --> 00:21:45
Spitting in the ox soup.

494
00:21:45 --> 00:21:47
Peeing on the Wedgewood plates.

495
00:21:47 --> 00:21:51
# So raise the scarlet banner high #

496
00:21:51 --> 00:21:55
# Beneath its shade we live and die ##

497
00:21:55 --> 00:21:56
J.C.!

498
00:21:56 --> 00:21:58
Bert!

499
00:21:58 --> 00:21:59
My lord!

500
00:21:59 --> 00:22:01
&lt;i&gt;Barney Entwistle.&lt;/i&gt;

501
00:22:01 --> 00:22:04
- Tea, madame?
- Oh, uh, yes.

502
00:22:04 --> 00:22:07
Tucker, what was that song
you were singing last night?

503
00:22:07 --> 00:22:09
An old German hymn, madame.

504
00:22:09 --> 00:22:10
&quot;Tannenbaum.&quot;

505
00:22:10 --> 00:22:11
Milk or lemon?

506
00:22:11 --> 00:22:12
Lemon.

507
00:22:12 --> 00:22:15
I say, where is the guv&#39;nor?
Ah, is that tea, Tucker? Just the job.

508
00:22:15 --> 00:22:17
He&#39;s in town, trying to find
a way around this mess.

509
00:22:17 --> 00:22:19
- When&#39;s he back?
- Oh, any time now...

510
00:22:19 --> 00:22:21
if he doesn&#39;t drop in
on his mistress first.

511
00:22:21 --> 00:22:24
Hope he gets things sorted out soon.
It&#39;s getting damned awkward
in the village.

512
00:22:24 --> 00:22:26
- Awkward?
- Well, they expect us Gurneys
to be in everything.

513
00:22:26 --> 00:22:29
Mrs. Piggot-Jones and Mrs. Treadwell
and all the other old girls,

514
00:22:29 --> 00:22:33
they thought it would be
a splendid idea if the new earl
was to open the fete on Sunday.

515
00:22:33 --> 00:22:36
I hardly dare ask, but naturally
you told them it would be impossible?

516
00:22:36 --> 00:22:38
&lt;i&gt;- Milk or lemon?
- Lemon, please, Tucker.&lt;/i&gt;

517
00:22:38 --> 00:22:41
Yes, but, you see,
I am the prospective parliamentary
candidate for the division,

518
00:22:41 --> 00:22:42
and I have to watch
my step with them.

519
00:22:42 --> 00:22:45
I couldn&#39;t very well say that
he was &quot;non-compis,&quot; could I?

520
00:22:45 --> 00:22:48
- Well, where is he now?
- Up there.

521
00:22:48 --> 00:22:51
Look what you&#39;ve done.

522
00:22:51 --> 00:22:54
Never get tea stains out.
Show some consideration.

523
00:22:54 --> 00:22:58
- He... It&#39;s yogi, isn&#39;t it?
- Tea, my lord?

524
00:22:58 --> 00:23:01
It&#39;s no use, Tucker. I&#39;ve tried.
He&#39;s asleep. Dead to the world.

525
00:23:01 --> 00:23:05
His body sleeps, but his
divinity is always watching.

526
00:23:05 --> 00:23:07
Milk, please.
Any toasted muffin?

527
00:23:07 --> 00:23:08
Yes.

528
00:23:08 --> 00:23:10
- Shall I bring &#39;em up?
- No, I&#39;ll be right down.

529
00:23:10 --> 00:23:12
It is yogi, isn&#39;t it?
Or a form of yogi?

530
00:23:12 --> 00:23:14
Don&#39;t give me another
headache, Dinsdale.

531
00:23:14 --> 00:23:16
You look ill, Mr. Tucker.

532
00:23:16 --> 00:23:19
Bed, Mr. Tucker, right now.

533
00:23:19 --> 00:23:21
Thank you, my lord.

534
00:23:21 --> 00:23:23
Welcome, Dinsdale.

535
00:23:23 --> 00:23:26
Yes. I mean, how are you?

536
00:23:26 --> 00:23:30
Sometimes my spirits sink below
the high water mark in Palestine,

537
00:23:30 --> 00:23:32
but I&#39;m adjusting gradually.

538
00:23:32 --> 00:23:36
For what I am about to receive,
may I make myself truly thankful.

539
00:23:36 --> 00:23:37
Soon I must be moving on.

540
00:23:37 --> 00:23:41
Sail away, Lalaha, New Jersey,
Port Said and Crewe.

541
00:23:41 --> 00:23:44
First, I shall command the Pope
to consecrate a planeload
of contraceptives...

542
00:23:44 --> 00:23:45
for the priest-ridden Irish.

543
00:23:45 --> 00:23:49
Arise, shine,
for my light is come...

544
00:23:49 --> 00:23:52
and the glory of the Lord
is risen upon thee.

545
00:23:52 --> 00:23:55
# Here is the rag
See how it goes #

546
00:23:55 --> 00:23:57
# Down on your heels
Up on your toes #

547
00:23:57 --> 00:24:00
#That&#39;s the way to do
the varsity drag #

548
00:24:00 --> 00:24:02
Piggot-Jones and Mrs. Treadwell.

549
00:24:02 --> 00:24:06
#You can pass many a class
whether you&#39;re dumb or wise #

550
00:24:06 --> 00:24:10
# If you all answer the call
when your professor cries #

551
00:24:10 --> 00:24:13
- Everybody!
- # Down on the heels, up on the toes #

552
00:24:13 --> 00:24:15
# Stay after school
Learn how it goes #

553
00:24:15 --> 00:24:17
# Everybody do the varsity #

554
00:24:17 --> 00:24:19
# Everybody do the varsity
Everybody do the varsity #

555
00:24:19 --> 00:24:22
# Everybody do the varsity drag ##

556
00:24:22 --> 00:24:25
Welcome, ladies.
I&#39;m the new lord.

557
00:24:25 --> 00:24:29
- You know Lady Claire
and my cousin Dinsdale.

558
00:24:29 --> 00:24:31
Oh, ladies, this is a surprise.

559
00:24:31 --> 00:24:33
But delightful,
really delightful.

560
00:24:33 --> 00:24:35
Dear Sir Dinsdale,
do forgive us for dropping in.

561
00:24:35 --> 00:24:38
We thought we&#39;d just take a stroll
out to the manor. It&#39;s only six miles.

562
00:24:38 --> 00:24:42
We&#39;ve come to try to persuade His
Lordship to open our little church fete.

563
00:24:42 --> 00:24:43
&lt;i&gt;Do say yes, my lord.&lt;/i&gt;

564
00:24:43 --> 00:24:45
I always say yes,
whatever question.

565
00:24:45 --> 00:24:46
How splendid!

566
00:24:46 --> 00:24:48
If you&#39;ll excuse us,
we have a lot to do.

567
00:24:48 --> 00:24:50
Stay to tea.
You be mother.

568
00:24:50 --> 00:24:52
Go and see if your father&#39;s back.

569
00:24:52 --> 00:24:54
Tell me, ladies, what do I do
at this gala opening of yours?

570
00:24:54 --> 00:24:57
Do I charm bracelets, swing
lead, break wind, pass water?

571
00:24:57 --> 00:24:59
Yes... No!

572
00:24:59 --> 00:25:01
You&#39;ll make a speech.

573
00:25:01 --> 00:25:03
On what text, Mother Superior?

574
00:25:03 --> 00:25:05
Oh, we leave that to the speaker.

575
00:25:05 --> 00:25:07
It can be any topic
of current interest:

576
00:25:07 --> 00:25:10
Hanging, immigration
or the stranglehold of the unions.

577
00:25:10 --> 00:25:14
But I&#39;ve always felt the speeches should
be about Britain and our way of life.

578
00:25:14 --> 00:25:15
- Britain?
- Mm-hmm.

579
00:25:15 --> 00:25:17
A fly-blown speck in the North Sea.

580
00:25:17 --> 00:25:21
You can&#39;t kick the natives
in the back streets of Calcutta anymore.

581
00:25:21 --> 00:25:25
Oh, he&#39;s joking again.
Aren&#39;t you, my lord?

582
00:25:25 --> 00:25:28
I&#39;m not laughing, Pamela,
and we can&#39;t stay here, Lady Claire.

583
00:25:28 --> 00:25:30
- Then for Christ&#39;s sake, go.
- Oh, don&#39;t go for my sake.

584
00:25:30 --> 00:25:33
Oh. Delicious. Homegrown?

585
00:25:33 --> 00:25:35
No, I bought them.
I mean, they go with...

586
00:25:35 --> 00:25:39
Ladies, I&#39;ve decided to begin
my second ministry at your gathering.

587
00:25:39 --> 00:25:43
Last time I preached the Word in holy
Galilee, I spoke in parables. Mistake!

588
00:25:43 --> 00:25:45
Now I must speak plain.
God is love.

589
00:25:45 --> 00:25:46
&lt;i&gt;- Love?
- Love.&lt;/i&gt;

590
00:25:46 --> 00:25:47
As water is wet, as jade is hard,

591
00:25:47 --> 00:25:49
as bread is life, so God is love.

592
00:25:49 --> 00:25:51
Mrs. Pamela Treadwell, can you love?

593
00:25:51 --> 00:25:54
&lt;i&gt;Can your blood bubble, flesh melt,
thighs twitch, heart burst for love?&lt;/i&gt;

594
00:25:54 --> 00:25:55
Your Lordship, I&#39;m a married woman...

595
00:25:55 --> 00:25:58
Remember the commandment I gave you:
&quot;Love one another as I love you.&quot;

596
00:25:58 --> 00:26:01
Stay back. My husband
is a master of hounds.

597
00:26:01 --> 00:26:05
Fill your hearts! Let your souls
dance, your eyes sparkle!

598
00:26:05 --> 00:26:07
Be bird happy!

599
00:26:07 --> 00:26:10
&lt;i&gt;- Oh, what is it?
- A Watusi walking stick.&lt;/i&gt;

600
00:26:10 --> 00:26:12
Big people, the Watusi.

601
00:26:12 --> 00:26:15
Ladies, come back.
I&#39;ll fill your bodies.

602
00:26:15 --> 00:26:19
- Oh, I&#39;m awfully sorry.
Have you seen my father?

603
00:26:19 --> 00:26:22
I am and the resurrection
and the light!

604
00:26:22 --> 00:26:24
Will you kindly stop?

605
00:26:24 --> 00:26:28
What are those two doing here?
Who&#39;s the idiot responsible?

606
00:26:28 --> 00:26:30
Oh, Dinsdale, of course.
Who else?

607
00:26:30 --> 00:26:32
You&#39;ll have to do something
about that boy.

608
00:26:32 --> 00:26:33
Well, he&#39;ll soon be off our hands.

609
00:26:33 --> 00:26:36
Old Barrington-Cochran&#39;s on his last
legs. That&#39;ll mean a by-election.

610
00:26:36 --> 00:26:38
Well, what about Mrs. Piggot-Jones?
Mrs. Treadwell?

611
00:26:38 --> 00:26:41
Oh, they&#39;ll say the new earl&#39;s
eccentric or something.
Better still, heavy drinker.

612
00:26:41 --> 00:26:43
Be not afraid! It is I!

613
00:26:43 --> 00:26:45
But,J.C., look,
I know who you are.

614
00:26:45 --> 00:26:49
But maybe they don&#39;t.
And we... I mean, that is, us...

615
00:26:49 --> 00:26:51
Oh, let&#39;s go and have
a glass of sherry.

616
00:26:51 --> 00:26:53
Well?
What did Sir Humphrey say?

617
00:26:53 --> 00:26:55
Oh, he gave me a lot of expensive
legal &quot;fal-de-roll.&quot;

618
00:26:55 --> 00:26:57
But as things stand,
there&#39;s no way of breaking the will.

619
00:26:57 --> 00:27:00
- So?
- There&#39;s only one possible solution.

620
00:27:00 --> 00:27:02
&lt;i&gt;- A male heir.
- A what!&lt;/i&gt;

621
00:27:02 --> 00:27:05
Well, ifJack had a son, Sir Humphrey
says we could easily get him certified.

622
00:27:05 --> 00:27:07
Because then, everything
would pass to the heir.

623
00:27:07 --> 00:27:09
We could manage the estate
till the boy came of age,

624
00:27:09 --> 00:27:10
and that way everything
would remain in the family.

625
00:27:10 --> 00:27:12
Oh, brilliant.
A small point.

626
00:27:12 --> 00:27:15
But before he can have an heir,
our lunatic nephew has to be married.

627
00:27:15 --> 00:27:17
Exactly.
And the sooner the better.

628
00:27:17 --> 00:27:21
Yes, but don&#39;t you understand
that these two ladies
are extremely important to me?

629
00:27:21 --> 00:27:24
Well, I sincerely hope, Jack, that
when they next come down to the manor,

630
00:27:24 --> 00:27:25
you&#39;ll be a trifle more courteous.

631
00:27:25 --> 00:27:28
- Now, be subtle.
- Oh, right.

632
00:27:28 --> 00:27:30
&lt;i&gt;Ah, we were just talking
about you and marriage.&lt;/i&gt;

633
00:27:30 --> 00:27:33
&lt;i&gt;- We think you should take a wife.
- Who from?&lt;/i&gt;

634
00:27:33 --> 00:27:35
I&#39;m sure we can find you
a suitable young goddess.

635
00:27:35 --> 00:27:37
What?
Oh, most appropriate, eh?

636
00:27:37 --> 00:27:40
- I can&#39;t marry a second time.
- You&#39;re already married?

637
00:27:40 --> 00:27:43
August 28th
in the year of me, 1964.

638
00:27:43 --> 00:27:45
This wife of yours...
What&#39;s her name?

639
00:27:45 --> 00:27:47
&lt;i&gt;- Marguerite Gauthier.
- French?&lt;/i&gt;

640
00:27:47 --> 00:27:49
- Yes.
- Gauthier. Marguerite Gauthier.

641
00:27:49 --> 00:27:50
Isn&#39;t that
&quot;The Lady of the Camellias&quot;?

642
00:27:50 --> 00:27:52
You knew her too?
Wonderful.

643
00:27:52 --> 00:27:54
And that&#39;s the tune, isn&#39;t it?

644
00:27:54 --> 00:27:57
Naturally I came as soon as I could.

645
00:27:57 --> 00:27:59
We do appreciate it.

646
00:27:59 --> 00:28:01
&lt;i&gt;Your nephew is not married
to the Lady of the Camellias.&lt;/i&gt;

647
00:28:01 --> 00:28:04
He has no wife. But he believes
he has, which is the same thing.

648
00:28:04 --> 00:28:06
Why did he pick on
Marguerite Gauthier?

649
00:28:06 --> 00:28:07
Another martyr for love.

650
00:28:07 --> 00:28:09
His delusions are all of a piece.

651
00:28:09 --> 00:28:11
Marguerite is the only
person he trusts.

652
00:28:11 --> 00:28:13
Why does he keep on about love?

653
00:28:13 --> 00:28:15
Because he wants us
all to love goodness.

654
00:28:15 --> 00:28:17
To love goodness is to love God.

655
00:28:17 --> 00:28:19
To love God is to love
the 14th Earl of Gurney.

656
00:28:19 --> 00:28:22
That&#39;s very clever,
but is it the truth?

657
00:28:22 --> 00:28:25
Ah, don&#39;t come to me
for the truth, only explanations.

658
00:28:25 --> 00:28:26
Can I ask you one more question?

659
00:28:26 --> 00:28:27
If it&#39;s as revealing as the others.

660
00:28:27 --> 00:28:29
Why does he hate being called Jack?

661
00:28:29 --> 00:28:31
Because it&#39;s his real name.

662
00:28:31 --> 00:28:33
Naturally he rejects it violently.

663
00:28:33 --> 00:28:35
If ever he answers
to the name ofJack,

664
00:28:35 --> 00:28:37
then you know he&#39;s
on the road to sanity.

665
00:28:37 --> 00:28:40
Doctor, how are my questions
revealing?

666
00:28:40 --> 00:28:42
The first one you asked me
was about love.

667
00:28:42 --> 00:28:46
&lt;i&gt;This is our Tucker, Dr. Herder.
He&#39;s been with the family for 40 years.&lt;/i&gt;

668
00:28:46 --> 00:28:48
Man and sniveling boy, sir.

669
00:28:48 --> 00:28:50
How do you find
the new earl, Tucker?

670
00:28:50 --> 00:28:53
By sniffing. He&#39;s a Gurney.

671
00:28:53 --> 00:28:54
A real Gurney.

672
00:28:54 --> 00:28:56
You don&#39;t find him odd?

673
00:28:56 --> 00:28:57
Odd?

674
00:28:57 --> 00:28:59
- Soda?
- Yes.

675
00:28:59 --> 00:29:02
Yes, odd, peculiar.

676
00:29:02 --> 00:29:04
Oh, you mean nutty?

677
00:29:04 --> 00:29:06
Yes, he&#39;s a nutcase.

678
00:29:06 --> 00:29:08
Most of these titled fleabags are.

679
00:29:08 --> 00:29:11
Rich nobs and priveleged arseholes
can afford to be bonkers.

680
00:29:11 --> 00:29:13
They&#39;re living in a dreamworld,
aren&#39;t they, sir?

681
00:29:13 --> 00:29:15
Life&#39;s made too easy for &#39;em.

682
00:29:15 --> 00:29:19
They don&#39;t have to earn a livin&#39;,
so they do just what they want to.

683
00:29:19 --> 00:29:24
We&#39;d all be pretty crackers
if we went around doing just
what we wanted to, wouldn&#39;t we?

684
00:29:24 --> 00:29:25
- Eh?
- Yes.

685
00:29:25 --> 00:29:26
Yes, I suppose...

686
00:29:26 --> 00:29:28
The late earl
left Tucker £30,000.

687
00:29:28 --> 00:29:31
Since then, he&#39;s been very outspoken.

688
00:29:31 --> 00:29:32
Lady?

689
00:29:32 --> 00:29:34
No, thank you.

690
00:29:34 --> 00:29:36
Waste not, want not.

691
00:29:36 --> 00:29:38
Mind having a look at my back, Doctor?

692
00:29:38 --> 00:29:40
Lumbago acting up again.

693
00:29:40 --> 00:29:43
&lt;i&gt;Lady of the Camellias
by Alexandre Dumas.&lt;/i&gt;

694
00:29:43 --> 00:29:45
&lt;i&gt;Camille.&lt;/i&gt;

695
00:29:45 --> 00:29:47
&lt;i&gt;It&#39;s La Traviata,
the opera by Verdi.&lt;/i&gt;

696
00:29:47 --> 00:29:50
It&#39;s all the same woman: Marguerite
Gauthier, a figure of romance.

697
00:29:50 --> 00:29:54
My dear chap, you&#39;ve proved my point
ipso facto. A divine figure of romance.

698
00:29:54 --> 00:29:55
Yeah.

699
00:29:55 --> 00:29:58
- Well, what a pleasant surprise.
- How are you?

700
00:29:58 --> 00:30:01
In the middle of a debate
on the existence of my wife, Marguerite.

701
00:30:01 --> 00:30:04
- Pray continue, Dinsdale Gurney.
- I give up.

702
00:30:04 --> 00:30:07
You did say it&#39;d be impossible
to convince him, Doctor.

703
00:30:07 --> 00:30:09
&lt;i&gt;Do you see? It&#39;s a play.
The Lady of the Camellias.&lt;/i&gt;

704
00:30:09 --> 00:30:11
- It&#39;s fiction.
- It&#39;s a biography of my Marguerite,

705
00:30:11 --> 00:30:13
&lt;i&gt;affectionately known
as La Dame aux Camellias.&lt;/i&gt;

706
00:30:13 --> 00:30:15
You aren&#39;t married.
The woman doesn&#39;t exist.

707
00:30:15 --> 00:30:19
Oh, come on! You&#39;ll be saying I&#39;m not
God, Christ and the Holy Ghost next!

708
00:30:19 --> 00:30:23
Well, you&#39;re not. I mean, God
wouldn&#39;t be so ridiculous waving
his arms around like a maniac,

709
00:30:23 --> 00:30:26
dressed in a white suit
and a red carnation.

710
00:30:26 --> 00:30:30
The prophet Ezekiel lay 300 days on his
left side and 40 days on his right.

711
00:30:30 --> 00:30:33
He cut his hair and divided it in three
parts. The first part he burnt,

712
00:30:33 --> 00:30:36
the second he chopped into pieces,
the third he scattered to the wind.

713
00:30:36 --> 00:30:38
It was all a sign
of something more important.

714
00:30:38 --> 00:30:41
All right, if you&#39;re God,
reveal your godhead.

715
00:30:41 --> 00:30:42
No, no, no, no.

716
00:30:42 --> 00:30:44
A miracle.
Show us a miracle.

717
00:30:44 --> 00:30:46
- Here&#39;s a miracle.
- What?

718
00:30:46 --> 00:30:48
This hand...

719
00:30:48 --> 00:30:51
this city network of tissues,
nerves, muscles, ligaments,

720
00:30:51 --> 00:30:53
carpals and metacarpals,
phalanges.

721
00:30:53 --> 00:30:55
And what about
the hairy-nosed wombat?

722
00:30:55 --> 00:30:56
I don&#39;t mean
that sort of miracle.

723
00:30:56 --> 00:30:58
I mean a proper miracle
like the loaves and the fishes.

724
00:30:58 --> 00:30:59
Oh, those.

725
00:30:59 --> 00:31:02
You see ten billion million
miracles a day,

726
00:31:02 --> 00:31:05
yet you want your conjuring tricks,
your pretty flimflams.

727
00:31:05 --> 00:31:07
Well, I can&#39;t raise Lazarus again.
He&#39;s decomposed.

728
00:31:07 --> 00:31:10
- So bring me that table.
- What are you going to do?

729
00:31:10 --> 00:31:13
A grade-one Galilee miracle.

730
00:31:13 --> 00:31:17
Now, instead of raising Lazarus,

731
00:31:17 --> 00:31:19
I&#39;ll raise you a table.

732
00:31:19 --> 00:31:21
- What? That table?
- Ten feet.

733
00:31:21 --> 00:31:25
Not with the aid of mirrors or
crippled midgets behind black curtains,

734
00:31:25 --> 00:31:27
but by the power of love.

735
00:31:27 --> 00:31:29
- Just love?
- It moves mountains...

736
00:31:29 --> 00:31:32
and makes the puny weed
split the rock.

737
00:31:32 --> 00:31:34
Believe in me.

738
00:31:34 --> 00:31:36
In loving goodness.

739
00:31:36 --> 00:31:38
Raise yourself up.

740
00:31:38 --> 00:31:40
Rise up.

741
00:31:40 --> 00:31:43
Slowly... slowly...

742
00:31:43 --> 00:31:44
rise up.

743
00:31:44 --> 00:31:47
One foot... two...

744
00:31:47 --> 00:31:50
three... four.

745
00:31:50 --> 00:31:53
Slowly... slowly.

746
00:31:53 --> 00:31:56
Five... six...

747
00:31:56 --> 00:31:59
&lt;i&gt;seven... eight...&lt;/i&gt;

748
00:31:59 --> 00:32:01
&lt;i&gt;nine, ten!&lt;/i&gt;

749
00:32:01 --> 00:32:06
&lt;i&gt;There! The table floats
ten feet in space!&lt;/i&gt;

750
00:32:06 --> 00:32:09
I see it!
It&#39;s a bloody miracle!

751
00:32:09 --> 00:32:11
- Drunken lout!
- It didn&#39;t rise. There it is.

752
00:32:11 --> 00:32:13
Tucker saw, believed!

753
00:32:13 --> 00:32:15
- Did you see it, Doctor?
- No.

754
00:32:15 --> 00:32:17
Into my galvanized
pressure cooker.

755
00:32:17 --> 00:32:20
There&#39;s no miracle.
There&#39;s no wife. She doesn&#39;t exist.

756
00:32:20 --> 00:32:22
&lt;i&gt;She&#39;s fiction. Part of a play,
part of an opera.&lt;/i&gt;

757
00:32:22 --> 00:32:24
&lt;i&gt;She&#39;s not flesh and blood.
She&#39;s not real.&lt;/i&gt;

758
00:32:24 --> 00:32:25
Marguerite.

759
00:32:25 --> 00:32:27
How dare you bring that woman here!

760
00:32:27 --> 00:32:29
- You should be very grateful
to Miss Shelley.
- Grace Shelley is your mistress.

761
00:32:29 --> 00:32:31
- Miss Shelley
is just a hardworking girl.
- On her back.

762
00:32:31 --> 00:32:33
First you try and pawn her
off on your own brother.

763
00:32:33 --> 00:32:36
Ralph needed a wife.
He took a fancy to young Miss Shelley.

764
00:32:36 --> 00:32:40
Well, that didn&#39;t work, so you tried
her with the son. It&#39;s incestuous.

765
00:32:40 --> 00:32:43
Don&#39;t talk about incest, madam.
I remember yourJeremy Gore.

766
00:32:43 --> 00:32:46
You went to school with the father,
but you went ahead and seduced the son.

767
00:32:46 --> 00:32:49
- That is incest, madam.
- Ohhh.

768
00:32:49 --> 00:32:51
Well, why the hell
didn&#39;t you warn us?

769
00:32:51 --> 00:32:53
No time. After what
that &quot;trick cyclist&quot; told me,

770
00:32:53 --> 00:32:57
I knew we&#39;d never
convinceJack he wasn&#39;t married
or that Marguerite didn&#39;t exist.

771
00:32:57 --> 00:32:59
So I telephoned Grace
and explained the position.

772
00:32:59 --> 00:33:01
She got hold of theatrical togs
and came down here.

773
00:33:01 --> 00:33:03
She put up
a first-rate show, I thought.

774
00:33:03 --> 00:33:04
Well, it had impact.

775
00:33:04 --> 00:33:06
Anyway, Jack believed
that she was Marguerite.

776
00:33:06 --> 00:33:09
All she has to do now is convince him
he has to marry her again.

777
00:33:09 --> 00:33:11
Dr. Herder is furious.

778
00:33:11 --> 00:33:14
Furious? He&#39;s got no right
to be furious. He&#39;s not family.

779
00:33:14 --> 00:33:18
He could make things difficult
by having Jack declared insane
before he&#39;s produced an heir.

780
00:33:18 --> 00:33:21
Damned Kraut. You&#39;ll have to keep
your eye on him, my dear.

781
00:33:21 --> 00:33:24
I&#39;m gonna have me hands full
getting Grace married and pregnant.

782
00:33:24 --> 00:33:26
What an entrance!
Beautiful, but beautiful!

783
00:33:26 --> 00:33:28
The looks on your faces!

784
00:33:28 --> 00:33:31
&lt;i&gt;I should have stuck to the classics.
Always said I had the voice.&lt;/i&gt;

785
00:33:31 --> 00:33:35
Oh, this dress is tight.
I feel constipated.

786
00:33:35 --> 00:33:37
Your flower is wilting, dear.

787
00:33:37 --> 00:33:39
Can&#39;t be. It&#39;s wax.

788
00:33:39 --> 00:33:41
Careful your husband-to-be
doesn&#39;t eat it for breakfast.

789
00:33:41 --> 00:33:44
You&#39;re right, Charlie boy.
She is an ice-cold biddy.

790
00:33:44 --> 00:33:46
Oh, she&#39;s too clever
by half, that woman.

791
00:33:46 --> 00:33:49
But I get things done my way.
She doesn&#39;t know what she wants.

792
00:33:49 --> 00:33:51
Oh, but I do, Charlie boy.

793
00:33:51 --> 00:33:54
Lady Grace.
Lady Grace Gurney,

794
00:33:54 --> 00:33:55
the countess of Gurney.

795
00:33:55 --> 00:33:57
Now, look here, Grace,
you mustn&#39;t call me Charlie boy.

796
00:33:57 --> 00:33:59
- We&#39;ve gotta be careful.
- Oh, if that&#39;s what you want.

797
00:33:59 --> 00:34:01
Oh, it&#39;s not what I want.
It&#39;s what it has to be.

798
00:34:01 --> 00:34:03
Oh, I&#39;m very fond of you, my dear.

799
00:34:03 --> 00:34:05
Yeah, well, you&#39;ve a damned
funny way of showing it.

800
00:34:05 --> 00:34:07
First you push me into the arms
of your half-dead half brother,

801
00:34:07 --> 00:34:08
and then onto his loony son.

802
00:34:08 --> 00:34:10
Well, I&#39;d make any sacrifice
for the sake of the family.

803
00:34:10 --> 00:34:12
Now, are you sure
you can handle the situation?

804
00:34:12 --> 00:34:15
Tricky and all, marrying
a man who thinks he&#39;s God.

805
00:34:15 --> 00:34:17
Happens all the time.

806
00:34:17 --> 00:34:20
Look, there he is.

807
00:34:20 --> 00:34:23
&lt;i&gt;Well, better get
the show on the road.&lt;/i&gt;

808
00:34:23 --> 00:34:25
Oh, where&#39;s me lousy camellia?

809
00:34:25 --> 00:34:27
Oh, I&#39;ll be glad
to get out of this clobber.

810
00:34:27 --> 00:34:29
Oh! No wonder
she was dying of consumption.

811
00:34:29 --> 00:34:31
Now, be careful.

812
00:34:31 --> 00:34:34
Oh, don&#39;t worry, Charlie bo...
Charles.

813
00:34:34 --> 00:34:36
I&#39;ve got too much at stake
to blow it.

814
00:34:36 --> 00:34:38
Damned plucky filly.

815
00:34:38 --> 00:34:40
I say, Father,
Mother&#39;s just told me...

816
00:34:40 --> 00:34:42
that this Lady of the Camellia
woman is just a fake.

817
00:34:42 --> 00:34:44
Well, I mean, I know thatJ.C.
Is as batty as a moorhen,

818
00:34:44 --> 00:34:46
but this just isn&#39;t
playing the game, sir.

819
00:34:46 --> 00:34:47
Game? What game?

820
00:34:47 --> 00:34:49
This is no game, sir.
This is real!

821
00:34:49 --> 00:34:51
My dream&#39;s made flesh.

822
00:34:51 --> 00:34:53
Sorry.
I don&#39;t speak French.

823
00:34:53 --> 00:34:56
Oh. German?
Italian? Yiddish?

824
00:34:56 --> 00:34:57
No. English.

825
00:34:57 --> 00:34:59
English?
Should have said so before.

826
00:34:59 --> 00:35:02
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Hard language to master.

827
00:35:02 --> 00:35:05
But we can&#39;t play this
love scene with mere words.

828
00:35:05 --> 00:35:07
Love scene? What, now?

829
00:35:07 --> 00:35:09
Love isn&#39;t just for one season.

830
00:35:09 --> 00:35:12
Tweet. Tweet.

831
00:35:12 --> 00:35:13
Tweet?

832
00:35:13 --> 00:35:14
Cuckoo.

833
00:35:14 --> 00:35:16
Anything you care for?
The Grand Canyon?

834
00:35:16 --> 00:35:18
A disused banana factory?
Absolution?

835
00:35:18 --> 00:35:20
- A white wedding.
- Will Tuesday suit you?

836
00:35:20 --> 00:35:22
- You deserve a big kiss.
- Not here in the garden.

837
00:35:22 --> 00:35:25
Last time I was kissed in a garden,
it turned out rather awkward.

838
00:35:25 --> 00:35:27
Oh, butJudas was a man.

839
00:35:27 --> 00:35:30
Yes. Strange business.

840
00:35:30 --> 00:35:32
- Who are you?
- A woman.

841
00:35:32 --> 00:35:34
Descended from Eve?

842
00:35:34 --> 00:35:36
No. Doorstep.
I&#39;m an orphan.

843
00:35:36 --> 00:35:38
We&#39;ll be orphans
together, Marguerite.

844
00:35:38 --> 00:35:40
Call me Grace,
as I don&#39;t speak French.

845
00:35:40 --> 00:35:42
Grace. A good name.
It means &quot;the gift of faith.&quot;

846
00:35:42 --> 00:35:44
And that&#39;s what I have in you.
I&#39;m holding you to that wedding.

847
00:35:44 --> 00:35:46
Hold hard.
You&#39;ll be my queen of queens.

848
00:35:46 --> 00:35:48
I&#39;ll be satisfied with
&quot;Lady Grace Gurney.&quot;

849
00:35:48 --> 00:35:52
And I say unto you, thou
shalt love the Lord thy God...

850
00:35:52 --> 00:35:56
with all thy heart and
all thy soul and all thy mind.

851
00:35:56 --> 00:35:57
I do.

852
00:35:57 --> 00:36:01
Oh, I&#39;m happy.
I&#39;m the sunshine man,

853
00:36:01 --> 00:36:03
the driver of the gravy train.

854
00:36:03 --> 00:36:05
Choo, choo, choo.

855
00:36:05 --> 00:36:07
It&#39;s so simple for me.

856
00:36:07 --> 00:36:09
Paradise is just a smiling face.

857
00:36:09 --> 00:36:12
- What&#39;s it for you?
- For me? Paradise?

858
00:36:12 --> 00:36:14
A fireplace, a cozy room.

859
00:36:14 --> 00:36:15
- A little nest.
- That nestles.

860
00:36:15 --> 00:36:18
#Where the roses bloom #

861
00:36:18 --> 00:36:20
# Sweet Gracey and me #

862
00:36:20 --> 00:36:22
#And baby makes three #

863
00:36:22 --> 00:36:24
#We&#39;re going to our #

864
00:36:24 --> 00:36:26
# Blue heaven #

865
00:36:26 --> 00:36:28
#When whippoorwills call #

866
00:36:28 --> 00:36:30
#And evening is nigh #

867
00:36:30 --> 00:36:34
#We hurry to our blue heaven #

868
00:36:34 --> 00:36:36
#A turn to the right #

869
00:36:36 --> 00:36:38
#A little white light #

870
00:36:38 --> 00:36:40
#Will lead you to our #

871
00:36:40 --> 00:36:42
# Blue heaven #

872
00:36:42 --> 00:36:45
#You&#39;ll see a smiling face
a fireplace #

873
00:36:45 --> 00:36:47
#A cozy room #

874
00:36:47 --> 00:36:51
#A little nest that nestles
where the roses bloom #

875
00:36:51 --> 00:36:53
# Sweet Gracey and me #

876
00:36:53 --> 00:36:55
#And baby makes three #

877
00:36:55 --> 00:37:00
#We&#39;re going to our blue heaven #

878
00:37:00 --> 00:37:02
What are you looking at?

879
00:37:02 --> 00:37:05
- Beauty?
- Oh?

880
00:37:05 --> 00:37:08
Yes, butJack...
I mean J. C... I mean Bert...

881
00:37:08 --> 00:37:09
Oh, hang it.
You&#39;re still a Gurney.

882
00:37:09 --> 00:37:12
Now, listen, that camellia woman
is called Grace Shelley.

883
00:37:12 --> 00:37:15
Close friend of my father&#39;s. He put her
onto it, made her dress like that.

884
00:37:15 --> 00:37:19
It&#39;s absolutely ridiculous.
He wants to marry you off.

885
00:37:19 --> 00:37:20
Well, Mother&#39;s in it too.

886
00:37:20 --> 00:37:22
And I expect old Tuck
knows all about it.

887
00:37:22 --> 00:37:23
&lt;i&gt;- Everybody except me.
- Stop!&lt;/i&gt;

888
00:37:23 --> 00:37:27
You&#39;re making me a stunted dwarf,
a deformed midget, a crippled newt!

889
00:37:27 --> 00:37:30
- What are you doing down there?
- It&#39;s your negative &quot;insinuendos.&quot;

890
00:37:30 --> 00:37:33
- Insinuendo?
- Insinuendo is insinuation
towards innuendo...

891
00:37:33 --> 00:37:34
brought on by increased
negativism...

892
00:37:34 --> 00:37:35
out of a negative reaction
to your father&#39;s positivism.

893
00:37:35 --> 00:37:37
I don&#39;t know what the devil you&#39;re going
on about, but I resent your attitude.

894
00:37:37 --> 00:37:39
I&#39;m only telling you
about Grace Shelley.

895
00:37:39 --> 00:37:41
She&#39;s my righteous,
ideal, planned wife!

896
00:37:41 --> 00:37:44
Don&#39;t forget. Apart from being God,
Christ and the Holy Ghost,

897
00:37:44 --> 00:37:46
I&#39;m also an L.O.B.,
D.F.C. And A.D.C.

898
00:37:46 --> 00:37:48
You&#39;re dealing with the big one!

899
00:37:48 --> 00:37:50
I&#39;ve told aged Tucker!

900
00:37:50 --> 00:37:52
Who... Same thing!

901
00:37:52 --> 00:37:56
Injecting me with his Kremlin
plots, negative microbes!

902
00:37:56 --> 00:37:58
I said verbatim,

903
00:37:58 --> 00:38:01
being persecuted
is paranoid schizophrenia!

904
00:38:01 --> 00:38:03
Wretched Dr. H. Suffered from same!

905
00:38:03 --> 00:38:04
I watched.

906
00:38:04 --> 00:38:07
They fight against me.

907
00:38:07 --> 00:38:08
Where are the signs...

908
00:38:08 --> 00:38:10
aiming for...

909
00:38:10 --> 00:38:14
Herder&#39;s dancing academy?

910
00:38:14 --> 00:38:20
I am being everybody but Christ.

911
00:38:20 --> 00:38:24
No, no, no, Charles.
I will not solemnize any marriage,

912
00:38:24 --> 00:38:27
even of my own nephew, during
the period from Advent Sunday...

913
00:38:27 --> 00:38:30
till eight days after Epiphany.

914
00:38:30 --> 00:38:33
So, Charles,
it must be Tuesday the 12th,

915
00:38:33 --> 00:38:37
8:00 a.m., private chapel,
o- ordinary license...

916
00:38:37 --> 00:38:41
Charles, Charles, I have
grave misgivings, grave misgivings.

917
00:38:41 --> 00:38:42
- Misgivings? AboutJack?
- Mmm.

918
00:38:42 --> 00:38:46
No, no, no.
About the bride, Miss Shelley!

919
00:38:46 --> 00:38:49
Charles,
who is she, hmm, hmm?

920
00:38:49 --> 00:38:51
What is she?

921
00:38:51 --> 00:38:54
Ch-Charles, look, I fear, I fear
that she may be using this marriage...

922
00:38:54 --> 00:38:56
merely to enhance
her social position.

923
00:38:56 --> 00:38:59
I hear that she says she&#39;s
some sort of an entertainer.

924
00:38:59 --> 00:39:01
I will vouch for Grace Shelley.

925
00:39:01 --> 00:39:03
- Mmm?
- Mmm!

926
00:39:03 --> 00:39:05
My husband&#39;s an idiot.

927
00:39:05 --> 00:39:06
That&#39;s not my concern.

928
00:39:06 --> 00:39:08
The Earl is no longer under my care.

929
00:39:08 --> 00:39:11
That charade with Miss Shelley
made me feel an absolute fool.

930
00:39:11 --> 00:39:13
And I don&#39;t care
to underestimate myself.

931
00:39:13 --> 00:39:15
I apologize,
but Charles had some idea...

932
00:39:15 --> 00:39:18
thatJack might accept her if she
dressed up as the Lady of the Camellias.

933
00:39:18 --> 00:39:20
Sometimes it&#39;s very easy to forget...

934
00:39:20 --> 00:39:23
Sir Charles occupies a position
of responsibility and power.

935
00:39:23 --> 00:39:25
You know he&#39;s on the board
of the Guldenheim Research Foundation?

936
00:39:25 --> 00:39:28
Yes, he mentioned
you were asking for a grant.

937
00:39:28 --> 00:39:31
It&#39;s only a nominal
£130,000 for a study...

938
00:39:31 --> 00:39:33
of paranoid,
schizophrenic rats.

939
00:39:33 --> 00:39:36
Charles, need we be so hasty?

940
00:39:36 --> 00:39:38
Charles,
God, in His infinite mercy,

941
00:39:38 --> 00:39:40
has seen fit
to cloud our nervous senses.

942
00:39:40 --> 00:39:42
But he will recover.
He will recover, Charles.

943
00:39:42 --> 00:39:45
God is merciful.
Yes, you must believe that, Charles!

944
00:39:45 --> 00:39:47
God is merciful
in spite of all appearances.

945
00:39:47 --> 00:39:49
We cannot wait
upon God&#39;s mercy, Bertie!

946
00:39:49 --> 00:39:52
Everything is going to pot.
Dr. Herder at least.

947
00:39:52 --> 00:39:54
- Herder?
- Herder.

948
00:39:54 --> 00:39:57
- Is he English?
- No.

949
00:39:57 --> 00:39:59
Oh. Hmm!

950
00:39:59 --> 00:40:03
We insert fine silver wires
into the rat&#39;s midbrain.

951
00:40:03 --> 00:40:07
- That rat&#39;s behavior
is then controlled...

952
00:40:07 --> 00:40:09
by the strength of the current
passing through them.

953
00:40:09 --> 00:40:13
&lt;i&gt;By pressing above them and stimulating
one area of the midbrain,&lt;/i&gt;

954
00:40:13 --> 00:40:15
&lt;i&gt;the rat is made to feel threatened.&lt;/i&gt;

955
00:40:15 --> 00:40:17
&lt;i&gt;It attacks any rat in sight.&lt;/i&gt;

956
00:40:17 --> 00:40:18
&lt;i&gt;There&#39;s really no threat,&lt;/i&gt;

957
00:40:18 --> 00:40:20
&lt;i&gt;- but the midbrain
can&#39;t tell the difference.&lt;/i&gt;

958
00:40:20 --> 00:40:23
Roughly the same thing happens
with human paranoids.

959
00:40:23 --> 00:40:25
But an unknown area
of the brain stimulated,

960
00:40:25 --> 00:40:27
and they feel threatened
without cause.

961
00:40:27 --> 00:40:30
Naturally, men aren&#39;t rats.

962
00:40:30 --> 00:40:32
Only a man would say so.

963
00:40:32 --> 00:40:34
Our next step is to conduct
similar experiments...

964
00:40:34 --> 00:40:35
on humans&#39; brains.

965
00:40:35 --> 00:40:39
I see. Today, rats;
tomorrow, the world.

966
00:40:39 --> 00:40:41
Who will you wire for vision?

967
00:40:41 --> 00:40:43
First of all, myself, naturally.

968
00:40:43 --> 00:40:44
I see.

969
00:40:44 --> 00:40:48
And if I press a button,
you&#39;ll feel fear... love?

970
00:40:48 --> 00:40:50
Love? No.

971
00:40:50 --> 00:40:52
Desire. Yes.

972
00:40:52 --> 00:40:55
What, by pressing a little button?

973
00:40:55 --> 00:40:57
Oh.

974
00:40:57 --> 00:40:58
Think of the risk, Doctor.

975
00:40:58 --> 00:41:02
Oh, there is only one commandment
a doctor need ever worry about:

976
00:41:02 --> 00:41:05
Thou shalt not... advertise.

977
00:41:05 --> 00:41:07
My heart...

978
00:41:07 --> 00:41:09
rises with the sun.

979
00:41:09 --> 00:41:13
I&#39;m purged of doubts
and negative innuendos.

980
00:41:13 --> 00:41:16
Today,
I want to bless everything.

981
00:41:16 --> 00:41:19
Bless the crawfish
with its scuttling walk.

982
00:41:19 --> 00:41:23
Bless the trout,
pilchard and periwinkle.

983
00:41:23 --> 00:41:28
Bless Ted Smoothey
of 22 East Hackney Road.

984
00:41:28 --> 00:41:29
Bless the mealy redpoll,

985
00:41:29 --> 00:41:31
the black-gloved wallaby
and W.C. Fields...

986
00:41:31 --> 00:41:33
who&#39;s dead but lives on.

987
00:41:33 --> 00:41:35
Bless the snotty-nosed giraffe.

988
00:41:35 --> 00:41:37
Bless the buffalo.

989
00:41:37 --> 00:41:40
Bless the Society of Women Engineers.

990
00:41:40 --> 00:41:42
Bless the pygmy hippos.

991
00:41:42 --> 00:41:44
Bless the mighty cockroach.

992
00:41:44 --> 00:41:45
Bless me!

993
00:41:45 --> 00:41:48
Today&#39;s my wedding day!

994
00:41:48 --> 00:41:50
Wake up, Bertie!

995
00:41:50 --> 00:41:52
Come, Bertie.
Get on with it.

996
00:41:52 --> 00:41:53
D- D-Dearly beloved,

997
00:41:53 --> 00:41:56
we are gathered here together,
in the sight of God...

998
00:41:56 --> 00:41:59
Get on with it, Bertie!

999
00:41:59 --> 00:42:02
A- A-A-And in the face
of this company,

1000
00:42:02 --> 00:42:04
t- t-t-t-to join together
this man and this woman...

1001
00:42:04 --> 00:42:07
in holy matrimony,
which is an honorable estate...

1002
00:42:07 --> 00:42:10
Instituted by me
in the time of man&#39;s innocence.

1003
00:42:10 --> 00:42:12
&lt;i&gt;- Get on, Bertie!
- Therefore,&lt;/i&gt;

1004
00:42:12 --> 00:42:17
if there be any in this company
who can show just cause...

1005
00:42:17 --> 00:42:20
&lt;i&gt;why these two
may not be joined together,&lt;/i&gt;

1006
00:42:20 --> 00:42:24
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

1007
00:42:24 --> 00:42:29
Load of British jelly-meat whiskers!
Piddling, half-dead helots.

1008
00:42:29 --> 00:42:30
Quiet, man!
Show some respect!

1009
00:42:30 --> 00:42:32
I always show respect, sir.

1010
00:42:32 --> 00:42:35
That&#39;s what I&#39;m paid for.

1011
00:42:35 --> 00:42:37
No one can say
I don&#39;t show respect.

1012
00:42:37 --> 00:42:38
Now come on, Bertie.

1013
00:42:38 --> 00:42:40
Now I require and ch...

1014
00:42:40 --> 00:42:42
I require and charge you both...

1015
00:42:42 --> 00:42:44
that if either of you
know of any impediment...

1016
00:42:44 --> 00:42:48
why ye may not lawfully
be joined together,

1017
00:42:48 --> 00:42:52
that you &quot;de&quot; now...
you &quot;de&quot;...

1018
00:42:52 --> 00:42:54
Ye do now confess it.

1019
00:42:54 --> 00:42:57
Yes, I&#39;m afraid
I do know an impediment.

1020
00:42:57 --> 00:43:00
But it&#39;s only a rhetorical
question, like all the others
in the wedding service.

1021
00:43:00 --> 00:43:02
Oh, &#39;tis no good
glossing o&#39;er the fact...

1022
00:43:02 --> 00:43:07
certain Roman Catholic knackers think
I&#39;m already married to the Virgin Mary.

1023
00:43:07 --> 00:43:09
We&#39;re not concerned
with what other people think,

1024
00:43:09 --> 00:43:11
especially Roman Catholics.

1025
00:43:11 --> 00:43:13
Get on with it, Bertie. Come on now.

1026
00:43:13 --> 00:43:16
Wilt thou, wilt thou take
this woman to thy wedded wife,

1027
00:43:16 --> 00:43:20
to live together i-i-in holy wedlock
under God&#39;s ordinance?

1028
00:43:20 --> 00:43:21
W- W-Wilt thou love her?

1029
00:43:21 --> 00:43:24
From the bottom of my soul
to the tip of my penis,

1030
00:43:24 --> 00:43:26
like the sun in its brightness,
the moon in its glory,

1031
00:43:26 --> 00:43:28
no breeze stirs
that doesn&#39;t bear my love.

1032
00:43:28 --> 00:43:30
- Come on, Bertie! Come on!
- Charles, blasphemy.

1033
00:43:30 --> 00:43:32
- But will you love me?
- I will.

1034
00:43:32 --> 00:43:37
&lt;i&gt;Wilt thou take this man to thy...
- I will.&lt;/i&gt;

1035
00:43:37 --> 00:43:39
- To live together in holy matrimony...
- I will!

1036
00:43:39 --> 00:43:43
- Who giveth his...
- I do!

1037
00:43:43 --> 00:43:45
- Oh, you.
- Come on, Bertie.

1038
00:43:45 --> 00:43:48
&lt;i&gt;- Get a move on!
- R-R-Repeat after me.&lt;/i&gt;

1039
00:43:48 --> 00:43:51
I, l...

1040
00:43:51 --> 00:43:53
J.C., take thee, Grace Shelley,

1041
00:43:53 --> 00:43:54
&lt;i&gt;to my wedded wife.&lt;/i&gt;

1042
00:43:54 --> 00:43:57
I,J.C., the holy,
flying roller, the morning star,

1043
00:43:57 --> 00:44:02
take thee Marguerite,
called Grace Shelley, because she
doesn&#39;t speak French, to my wedded wife.

1044
00:44:02 --> 00:44:03
Where are you going, Bertie?

1045
00:44:03 --> 00:44:05
&lt;i&gt;- Repeat after me.
- Oh, I know the lines.&lt;/i&gt;

1046
00:44:05 --> 00:44:07
I, Grace Shelley, take theeJ.C.
To my wedded husband...

1047
00:44:07 --> 00:44:11
better, worse, richer, poorer,
this day, sickness, health,
I plight thee my troth.

1048
00:44:11 --> 00:44:13
Plight thee my troth, yes.

1049
00:44:13 --> 00:44:17
Well, inasmuch as you
are now bound in holy wedlock,

1050
00:44:17 --> 00:44:21
l- l-I now pro-pronounce thee
man and wife!

1051
00:44:21 --> 00:44:25
God join together, no man,
no man put asunder,

1052
00:44:25 --> 00:44:27
in the name of the Father, the Son...

1053
00:44:27 --> 00:44:30
and Holy, the Holy, the Holy Ghost.

1054
00:44:30 --> 00:44:31
God have mercy on me.

1055
00:44:31 --> 00:44:32
&lt;i&gt;A bit tatty, Jeeves.&lt;/i&gt;

1056
00:44:32 --> 00:44:35
No guests, no reception,
two plates of curled up sandwiches...

1057
00:44:35 --> 00:44:37
and a deformed wedding cake.

1058
00:44:37 --> 00:44:39
It&#39;s not my fault, Your Ladyship.

1059
00:44:39 --> 00:44:41
&quot;Your Ladyship.&quot; That&#39;s better.

1060
00:44:41 --> 00:44:43
I&#39;ll watch &#39;em creep
and crawl at Harrods.

1061
00:44:43 --> 00:44:45
We thought you&#39;d like
a nice, quiet affair.

1062
00:44:45 --> 00:44:48
Huh! Quiet&#39;s right! And what about
a toast to the newlyweds or something?

1063
00:44:48 --> 00:44:51
- You know.
- All right.

1064
00:44:51 --> 00:44:54
Here&#39;s to long life and happiness
for the bride and groom.

1065
00:44:54 --> 00:44:56
- To the bride and groom!
- Thank you.

1066
00:44:56 --> 00:44:59
In reply, I name this ship
&quot;Loving Kindness.&quot;

1067
00:44:59 --> 00:45:01
May I keep her
and all who sail in her.

1068
00:45:01 --> 00:45:06
Ah, you should have seen
the late earl&#39;s wedding, m&#39;lady.

1069
00:45:06 --> 00:45:11
Five hundred guests,
the creme de menthe.

1070
00:45:11 --> 00:45:14
Wastrels all.
May their carbonized bones rot in hell!

1071
00:45:14 --> 00:45:15
Shut up!

1072
00:45:15 --> 00:45:18
Can&#39;t say that I like the idea
of you being alone with him.

1073
00:45:18 --> 00:45:19
You&#39;re a beauty.

1074
00:45:19 --> 00:45:21
Everything&#39;s yours,

1075
00:45:21 --> 00:45:24
even if you&#39;ve given it away.

1076
00:45:24 --> 00:45:27
&lt;i&gt;One minute silence, please.&lt;/i&gt;

1077
00:45:27 --> 00:45:31
- What for?
- For all the dead books of World War I.

1078
00:45:31 --> 00:45:35
For Mr. Moto, Sisco Kid and me.

1079
00:45:35 --> 00:45:39
Muffle the drums, silence. Shh!

1080
00:45:39 --> 00:45:44
Terrible, isn&#39;t it?
That&#39;s why I sing, dance, talk...

1081
00:45:44 --> 00:45:45
And love.

1082
00:45:45 --> 00:45:48
# Oh, we danced and we sang #

1083
00:45:48 --> 00:45:50
#And the village bells rang #

1084
00:45:50 --> 00:45:53
# On the beautiful night
we were married #

1085
00:45:53 --> 00:45:57
# Oh, the roses they bloomed #

1086
00:45:57 --> 00:45:58
# For the bride and the groom #

1087
00:45:58 --> 00:46:01
# On the beautiful night
we were wed #

1088
00:46:01 --> 00:46:03
- Shut up!
- #We were wed, Oh, the... ##

1089
00:46:03 --> 00:46:05
Shut up!

1090
00:46:05 --> 00:46:06
Sorry, sir.

1091
00:46:06 --> 00:46:09
Thought you&#39;d like me
to liven up this wake.

1092
00:46:09 --> 00:46:12
- Where&#39;d they go?
- To bed, of course.

1093
00:46:12 --> 00:46:14
I must say, I wouldn&#39;t like to be
in her shoes tonight.

1094
00:46:14 --> 00:46:16
It&#39;s not her shoes he&#39;ll be in,
Master Dinsdale.

1095
00:46:16 --> 00:46:20
I always get first night nerves.
Well, any good performer does.

1096
00:46:20 --> 00:46:23
You have to be keyed up
to give a good show.

1097
00:46:23 --> 00:46:26
I&#39;ve done it all.
From Stanislavsky to strip.

1098
00:46:26 --> 00:46:30
Greasy makeup towels, cracked mirrors,
rhinestones and beads.

1099
00:46:30 --> 00:46:33
What a world.
I sang &quot;This Can&#39;t Be Love.&quot;

1100
00:46:33 --> 00:46:35
Funny. Did the same act
late at the Pigalle...

1101
00:46:35 --> 00:46:37
for twice the money
without removing a stitch.

1102
00:46:37 --> 00:46:41
Of course, some women can strip
without taking their clothes off.

1103
00:46:41 --> 00:46:43
Nobody could call me undersexed.

1104
00:46:43 --> 00:46:48
But I could never get worked up
watching some man strip down
to suspenders and jockstrap.

1105
00:46:48 --> 00:46:50
Well, where&#39;s the fun?

1106
00:46:50 --> 00:46:54
I suppose some people just
prefer the smell of the steak
better than the steak itself.

1107
00:46:54 --> 00:46:58
Oh, if my mother
could see me now!

1108
00:46:58 --> 00:47:02
It&#39;s what she always wanted
for me... the big time.

1109
00:47:02 --> 00:47:04
Well, she found it hard to
settle down to civilian life...

1110
00:47:04 --> 00:47:07
after being in the touring
company of Chu Chin Chow.

1111
00:47:07 --> 00:47:09
Nobody need worry about me fitting in.

1112
00:47:09 --> 00:47:11
All I have to do is play it cool.

1113
00:47:11 --> 00:47:13
I can cock my little finger
with the best.

1114
00:47:13 --> 00:47:17
Darling.

1115
00:47:17 --> 00:47:18
Darling, I&#39;m waiting.

1116
00:47:18 --> 00:47:20
What? Oh, that&#39;s ridiculous!
It&#39;s not dignified!

1117
00:47:20 --> 00:47:22
Dignity has nothing to do
with divinity.

1118
00:47:22 --> 00:47:25
Not here! Not now!
A bike? You&#39;re mad!

1119
00:47:25 --> 00:47:27
- Don&#39;t be frightened.
- I&#39;m not frightened.

1120
00:47:27 --> 00:47:30
I just didn&#39;t expect to see my husband
riding a three-wheeled bike
on his wedding night.

1121
00:47:30 --> 00:47:32
It&#39;s the only way to travel.

1122
00:47:32 --> 00:47:33
Remember,

1123
00:47:33 --> 00:47:36
God loves you.

1124
00:47:36 --> 00:47:38
God wants you.

1125
00:47:38 --> 00:47:39
God needs you.

1126
00:47:39 --> 00:47:40
Come to me.

1127
00:47:40 --> 00:47:41
Damn!

1128
00:47:41 --> 00:47:43
Well, keep pouring.
I&#39;m starving!

1129
00:47:43 --> 00:47:44
It was a damn long night.

1130
00:47:44 --> 00:47:45
All right, Tucker.
I&#39;ll serve myself.

1131
00:47:45 --> 00:47:46
- Well, what happened?
- Happened?

1132
00:47:46 --> 00:47:48
Last night!
What&#39;d he do?

1133
00:47:48 --> 00:47:49
Rode around
on a three-wheeled bike.

1134
00:47:49 --> 00:47:51
Filthy beast!

1135
00:47:51 --> 00:47:54
Oh, yes. It must have been
one of the guv&#39;nor&#39;s old bikes.

1136
00:47:54 --> 00:47:55
The attic&#39;s full of his junk.

1137
00:47:55 --> 00:47:59
So... he just rode about
all night then?

1138
00:47:59 --> 00:48:01
First the bike, then me.

1139
00:48:01 --> 00:48:04
- Mmm.
- His mind may be wonky,

1140
00:48:04 --> 00:48:06
but there&#39;s certainly nothing wrong
with the rest of his anatomy.

1141
00:48:06 --> 00:48:08
Mmm, we Gurneys
are damnably virile.

1142
00:48:08 --> 00:48:11
I thought you&#39;d be delighted
to find out he&#39;s not impotent.

1143
00:48:11 --> 00:48:14
All right. Delighted.

1144
00:48:14 --> 00:48:15
Delighted.

1145
00:48:15 --> 00:48:17
&#39;Morning.

1146
00:48:17 --> 00:48:19
Well, was it successful?

1147
00:48:19 --> 00:48:21
- I should have sold bleeding tickets.
- Really, Claire!

1148
00:48:21 --> 00:48:24
- How could you ask that?
- Well, it was your idea, remember.

1149
00:48:24 --> 00:48:26
If our nephew&#39;s incapable,
somebody else might have to...

1150
00:48:26 --> 00:48:28
step into the bridge for him.

1151
00:48:28 --> 00:48:32
Charles, tell her to keep her sharp
tongue and low mind to herself.

1152
00:48:32 --> 00:48:34
Oh, she has claws.

1153
00:48:34 --> 00:48:36
Look, this is my pad now,
remember?

1154
00:48:36 --> 00:48:39
If you want to keep kibitzing here,
just belt up on the snide remarks...

1155
00:48:39 --> 00:48:40
or you&#39;ll
find yourself horizontal.

1156
00:48:40 --> 00:48:42
A position you&#39;re clearly
familiar with.

1157
00:48:42 --> 00:48:46
- Look, you granite-faced old...
- How dare you speak to me like that!

1158
00:48:46 --> 00:48:48
- Why can&#39;t you look at my back?
- I keep telling you.

1159
00:48:48 --> 00:48:51
- I&#39;m a psychiatrist.
- It&#39;s just because I&#39;m on the
national health, isn&#39;t it?

1160
00:48:51 --> 00:48:55
Damn money-grubbers...
you and your &quot;hypocrite&#39;s&quot; oath.

1161
00:48:55 --> 00:48:58
Wait a minute.

1162
00:48:58 --> 00:49:01
- Who the hell do you think you are?
- Will you two shut up?

1163
00:49:01 --> 00:49:02
It&#39;s Dr. Herder!

1164
00:49:02 --> 00:49:05
I&#39;ve come to offer my
congratulations on the wedding.

1165
00:49:05 --> 00:49:08
Dr. Herder,
this is Lady Grace Gurney.

1166
00:49:08 --> 00:49:11
How do you do, Doctor?
So nice to meet you at last.

1167
00:49:11 --> 00:49:13
You&#39;ll stay to lunch.
I want to talk to you about my husband.

1168
00:49:13 --> 00:49:16
- And I want to talk to you.
- I&#39;m so sorry you weren&#39;t
told about the wedding,

1169
00:49:16 --> 00:49:19
but we didn&#39;t invite anybody
except for close family.

1170
00:49:19 --> 00:49:22
Besides, you&#39;d have tried
to talk me out of it.

1171
00:49:22 --> 00:49:26
&lt;i&gt;And it wouldn&#39;t have done
any good. I love him.&lt;/i&gt;

1172
00:49:26 --> 00:49:29
&lt;i&gt;- You should have consulted me
before you went ahead.&lt;/i&gt;

1173
00:49:29 --> 00:49:30
- It&#39;s madness.
- Come, Doctor.

1174
00:49:30 --> 00:49:32
You said he needed
a harsh dose of reality.

1175
00:49:32 --> 00:49:35
Well, you can&#39;t get a harsher
dose of the stuff than marriage.

1176
00:49:35 --> 00:49:37
&lt;i&gt;It can&#39;t be legal!&lt;/i&gt;

1177
00:49:37 --> 00:49:40
It&#39;s legal! My brother-in-law
conducted the service. He&#39;s a bishop.

1178
00:49:40 --> 00:49:42
What do you say, Lady Claire?

1179
00:49:42 --> 00:49:43
Congratulations.

1180
00:49:43 --> 00:49:47
- Congratulations?
- On getting your Guldenheim Grant.

1181
00:49:47 --> 00:49:49
Yes, congrats, old boy.
I had a word with the chairman,

1182
00:49:49 --> 00:49:51
told him you were a sound fellow.

1183
00:49:51 --> 00:49:53
Sit down.
Help yourself to coffee, Doctor.

1184
00:49:53 --> 00:49:56
You made love to me to make sure
I wouldn&#39;t cause any trouble!

1185
00:49:56 --> 00:50:00
You seduced me to make sure the
£130,000 for your schizophrenic rats.

1186
00:50:00 --> 00:50:03
Don&#39;t be tiresome.

1187
00:50:03 --> 00:50:05
It&#39;s all right.
They agreed to be cut.

1188
00:50:05 --> 00:50:07
See, the sunflower in the center
and the roses...

1189
00:50:07 --> 00:50:09
and, and, and,
and the three sweet williams...

1190
00:50:09 --> 00:50:12
and all bound in Canton
evergreen for loving memory.

1191
00:50:12 --> 00:50:14
And I mean every word of it.

1192
00:50:14 --> 00:50:17
It&#39;s so beautiful.
Thank you.

1193
00:50:17 --> 00:50:20
I have shaken the silver
gong of the universe.

1194
00:50:20 --> 00:50:21
Bong!

1195
00:50:21 --> 00:50:23
Oh, Grace, it&#39;s hard.

1196
00:50:23 --> 00:50:25
Love is my theme,
and it frightens them,

1197
00:50:25 --> 00:50:27
happiness my gift, and they run.

1198
00:50:27 --> 00:50:29
I try to tie the air in knots...

1199
00:50:29 --> 00:50:31
and make mountains out of water.

1200
00:50:31 --> 00:50:32
It&#39;s hopeless, darling.

1201
00:50:32 --> 00:50:36
That&#39;s not a word in love&#39;s lexicon.

1202
00:50:36 --> 00:50:39
We&#39;ll hear the voice
of the turtle throughout the land.

1203
00:50:39 --> 00:50:41
Yes. Clop, clop, clop.

1204
00:50:41 --> 00:50:43
Oh, you fool!

1205
00:50:43 --> 00:50:46
&lt;i&gt;- You fool.
- I don&#39;t like
being made a fool of, Claire.&lt;/i&gt;

1206
00:50:46 --> 00:50:48
Nobody&#39;s making a fool of you.

1207
00:50:48 --> 00:50:50
The Gurneys must have an heir.

1208
00:50:50 --> 00:50:53
As soon as there is one child,
we&#39;ll haveJ.C. Committed.

1209
00:50:53 --> 00:50:55
The only way you can change
the plot, Doctor,

1210
00:50:55 --> 00:50:58
is by making the 14th earl
of Gurney sane like the rest of us.

1211
00:50:58 --> 00:51:00
You haven&#39;t much time.

1212
00:51:00 --> 00:51:04
Lady Grace isn&#39;t the type
to survive the rabbit test for long.

1213
00:51:04 --> 00:51:07
Your Lordship, this is the first
of a series of experiments...

1214
00:51:07 --> 00:51:09
I&#39;m going to conduct with your help.

1215
00:51:09 --> 00:51:11
Ask and thou shalt receive.

1216
00:51:11 --> 00:51:12
Experiment one.

1217
00:51:12 --> 00:51:14
What does that look like?

1218
00:51:14 --> 00:51:16
Is it a dragon?

1219
00:51:16 --> 00:51:19
A spider?
What does it remind you of?

1220
00:51:19 --> 00:51:20
God.

1221
00:51:20 --> 00:51:23
And this?

1222
00:51:23 --> 00:51:26
God. Everything that is
or ever shall be...

1223
00:51:26 --> 00:51:27
reminds me of me.

1224
00:51:27 --> 00:51:29
If it didn&#39;t remind you of you,

1225
00:51:29 --> 00:51:31
what would it remind you of?

1226
00:51:31 --> 00:51:32
An ink blot.

1227
00:51:32 --> 00:51:36
Your Lordship, this is a lie detector.

1228
00:51:36 --> 00:51:40
It will give us an objective truth.

1229
00:51:40 --> 00:51:41
Experiment seven.

1230
00:51:41 --> 00:51:44
Your Lordship, are you God?

1231
00:51:44 --> 00:51:46
No.

1232
00:51:46 --> 00:51:49
Doctor,
this machine says he&#39;s lying!

1233
00:51:49 --> 00:51:52
For experiment 11, I&#39;ve asked
His Lordship to visit ward C.

1234
00:51:52 --> 00:51:54
That&#39;s where we keep some
of the more extreme mental patients.

1235
00:51:54 --> 00:51:56
I&#39;m hoping they may provide
a beneficial shot.

1236
00:51:56 --> 00:51:58
- But isn&#39;t it dangerous?
- No, no, no, no.

1237
00:51:58 --> 00:52:01
I have an assistant outside
and inside.

1238
00:52:01 --> 00:52:03
Besides, you haven&#39;t
given me much time,

1239
00:52:03 --> 00:52:05
so I&#39;m forced
to try unorthodox methods.

1240
00:52:05 --> 00:52:07
&lt;i&gt;He&#39;s been inside
for about 20 minutes.&lt;/i&gt;

1241
00:52:07 --> 00:52:10
There was a lot of shouting
at first, but now... Listen.

1242
00:52:10 --> 00:52:11
#And here we are #

1243
00:52:11 --> 00:52:14
#To make the wounded whole #

1244
00:52:14 --> 00:52:16
# Bearers of love #

1245
00:52:16 --> 00:52:18
# Here we are #

1246
00:52:18 --> 00:52:21
#To heal the sin-sick soul #

1247
00:52:21 --> 00:52:24
Can you believe it?
J.C. Has got labor pains too.

1248
00:52:24 --> 00:52:27
Hmm. It&#39;s called couvade.
Sympathetic illness.

1249
00:52:27 --> 00:52:29
Psychosomatic.
Not at all unusual.

1250
00:52:29 --> 00:52:32
Oh, but I never felt anything
when Lady Claire here was pregnant.

1251
00:52:32 --> 00:52:33
I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t.

1252
00:52:33 --> 00:52:36
- Oh!
- Oh!

1253
00:52:36 --> 00:52:39
Mighty Mouse is roaring.

1254
00:52:39 --> 00:52:40
What are you up to now?

1255
00:52:40 --> 00:52:42
A colleague of mine
is sending you some help...

1256
00:52:42 --> 00:52:44
as a personal favor.

1257
00:52:44 --> 00:52:46
Well, do you need us here?

1258
00:52:46 --> 00:52:48
Yes, but whatever happens,

1259
00:52:48 --> 00:52:50
you must not interfere.

1260
00:52:50 --> 00:52:52
I&#39;m going to prove
that it&#39;s impossible...

1261
00:52:52 --> 00:52:56
for two objects to occupy
the same space at the same time.

1262
00:52:56 --> 00:52:58
&lt;i&gt;Dr. Herder, Mr. McKyle is here.&lt;/i&gt;

1263
00:52:58 --> 00:53:01
- Good. Show him straight in.
- Certainly, sir.

1264
00:53:01 --> 00:53:04
I&#39;ll just lie down on the doorstep
and let him walk over me.

1265
00:53:04 --> 00:53:09
J.C., I am going to show you
the world in the hard light of truth.

1266
00:53:09 --> 00:53:11
I am the light of truth,

1267
00:53:11 --> 00:53:14
the light of the world.

1268
00:53:14 --> 00:53:15
This is experiment 15.

1269
00:53:15 --> 00:53:18
Well now,
shall we get on with it?

1270
00:53:18 --> 00:53:21
- Let me introduce you first.
- Oh, there&#39;s no need.

1271
00:53:21 --> 00:53:23
I&#39;m sure they all know me here.

1272
00:53:23 --> 00:53:28
Who else has electricity steaming
from his eyeballs and from his fingers?

1273
00:53:28 --> 00:53:30
I&#39;m the High Voltage Messiah.

1274
00:53:30 --> 00:53:31
The who?

1275
00:53:31 --> 00:53:33
The Electric Christ.

1276
00:53:33 --> 00:53:34
The AC/DC God.

1277
00:53:34 --> 00:53:35
You look fused.

1278
00:53:35 --> 00:53:38
Cannot you see the wall plug
in my forehead? Here, here.

1279
00:53:38 --> 00:53:41
Takes everything I eat and drink
and turns it into watts and kilowatts.

1280
00:53:41 --> 00:53:43
Are you saying you&#39;re God too?

1281
00:53:43 --> 00:53:47
God the one, two, three,

1282
00:53:47 --> 00:53:48
four, five, six,

1283
00:53:48 --> 00:53:49
seven, eight, nine, ten.

1284
00:53:49 --> 00:53:51
Testing, testing.

1285
00:53:51 --> 00:53:53
Have you never seen God before?

1286
00:53:53 --> 00:53:56
I have, sir. I&#39;m God.

1287
00:53:56 --> 00:53:58
&lt;i&gt;You are not God!&lt;/i&gt;

1288
00:53:58 --> 00:54:01
You are what
my snot rag&#39;s made of!

1289
00:54:01 --> 00:54:05
I&#39;ve obliterated hundreds
of dupe messiahs in my time!

1290
00:54:05 --> 00:54:08
You think I&#39;d go around saying
I was God if I could help it?

1291
00:54:08 --> 00:54:12
I&#39;ve not traveled 20 million
miles through galactic space...

1292
00:54:12 --> 00:54:15
to bandy words with your poxy
moon loony who thinks he&#39;s me!

1293
00:54:15 --> 00:54:17
I&#39;m here. You&#39;re there.

1294
00:54:17 --> 00:54:20
I&#39;m here and there too!
Do not trifle with me, laddy.

1295
00:54:20 --> 00:54:22
I&#39;m Jehovah,
from the Old Testament.

1296
00:54:22 --> 00:54:24
The vengeful god!

1297
00:54:24 --> 00:54:28
Away... or you&#39;ll be dropped!

1298
00:54:28 --> 00:54:30
But you both can&#39;t be God.

1299
00:54:30 --> 00:54:33
Oh, you&#39;re trying to split
my mind with his tongue!

1300
00:54:33 --> 00:54:37
Away, laddy... or I&#39;ll burn you
to a crispy noodle.

1301
00:54:37 --> 00:54:40
You can&#39;t touch me!

1302
00:54:40 --> 00:54:42
I&#39;m the rock and the vine,

1303
00:54:42 --> 00:54:43
the goat, the sacred bug,

1304
00:54:43 --> 00:54:46
&lt;i&gt;the upright testicle, the bull!&lt;/i&gt;

1305
00:54:46 --> 00:54:49
I saw my son Jamie die.

1306
00:54:49 --> 00:54:51
He had a cancer
at the base of his spine...

1307
00:54:51 --> 00:54:53
and one in his head.

1308
00:54:53 --> 00:54:56
They put the black spider
treatment on him.

1309
00:54:56 --> 00:54:58
&lt;i&gt;They crawled all over,&lt;/i&gt;

1310
00:54:58 --> 00:55:00
&lt;i&gt;cracking the body vermin
with its nippers!&lt;/i&gt;

1311
00:55:00 --> 00:55:02
&lt;i&gt;I can cure your bursting.&lt;/i&gt;

1312
00:55:02 --> 00:55:06
Fire a laser beam into you
to clear away the sick pus...

1313
00:55:06 --> 00:55:08
the sack of pus, the white pus,

1314
00:55:08 --> 00:55:10
the dead fetus!

1315
00:55:10 --> 00:55:14
But first,
I must deal with yon Irishman.

1316
00:55:14 --> 00:55:17
&lt;i&gt;I&#39;m earthed!&lt;/i&gt;

1317
00:55:17 --> 00:55:21
I&#39;m dead. Recharge!

1318
00:55:21 --> 00:55:25
This is your responsibility, Doctor,
damn you! If we lose this child...

1319
00:55:25 --> 00:55:28
I say, super news!
Old Barrington-Cochran&#39;s dead.
This means a new by-election.

1320
00:55:28 --> 00:55:31
- Not now, Dinsdale!
- Mrs. Darby is a qualified midwife.

1321
00:55:31 --> 00:55:33
- She&#39;d resent me interfering
professionally.
- You&#39;re not going on with this!

1322
00:55:33 --> 00:55:36
I won&#39;t be able to get McKyle
out again. It&#39;s my last chance.

1323
00:55:36 --> 00:55:39
Paul! Paul,
why persecute thou me!

1324
00:55:39 --> 00:55:42
Look, will someone please tell
me what&#39;s going on here?

1325
00:55:42 --> 00:55:46
&lt;i&gt;Life, Mr. Dinsdale...
the rich, moth-eaten tapestry of life.&lt;/i&gt;

1326
00:55:46 --> 00:55:49
Come on, come on. Quickly.

1327
00:55:49 --> 00:55:50
&lt;i&gt;Right, McKyle.&lt;/i&gt;

1328
00:55:50 --> 00:55:53
Gentlemen, it&#39;s important to know...

1329
00:55:53 --> 00:55:54
which of you is telling the truth.

1330
00:55:54 --> 00:55:58
If one of you is God,
the other must be somebody else.

1331
00:55:58 --> 00:56:00
&lt;i&gt;I stand accused...&lt;/i&gt;

1332
00:56:00 --> 00:56:02
of not being who I am...

1333
00:56:02 --> 00:56:05
the hereafter named
uncontested God!

1334
00:56:05 --> 00:56:08
&lt;i&gt;I made the world in my image,&lt;/i&gt;

1335
00:56:08 --> 00:56:09
and I&#39;m the holy terror!

1336
00:56:09 --> 00:56:12
The red peacock is a moth
which only lives two days.

1337
00:56:12 --> 00:56:14
With no mouth to eat or drink,

1338
00:56:14 --> 00:56:17
it flies miles to love,
breed and die.

1339
00:56:17 --> 00:56:21
Consider a life of love
without one selfish act!

1340
00:56:21 --> 00:56:23
And they, and they put me away...

1341
00:56:23 --> 00:56:25
for 17 years!

1342
00:56:25 --> 00:56:27
&lt;i&gt;Only the sick...&lt;/i&gt;

1343
00:56:27 --> 00:56:31
with spider&#39;s webs in their brains...

1344
00:56:31 --> 00:56:34
clack on about love...

1345
00:56:34 --> 00:56:35
and goodness.

1346
00:56:35 --> 00:56:37
&lt;i&gt;I&#39;m a brave god...&lt;/i&gt;

1347
00:56:37 --> 00:56:40
for bashing
bairns&#39; heads out on rocks!

1348
00:56:40 --> 00:56:42
A brave god for strong stomachs!

1349
00:56:42 --> 00:56:44
We are the children of light!

1350
00:56:44 --> 00:56:47
The children of light...

1351
00:56:47 --> 00:56:50
you know, are far, far away.

1352
00:56:50 --> 00:56:52
This is Earth, man!

1353
00:56:52 --> 00:56:55
One of my earliest failures!

1354
00:56:55 --> 00:56:59
Earth is where I dump
the excrement of the universe!

1355
00:56:59 --> 00:57:02
&lt;i&gt;- People care for love!
- We don&#39;t want love!&lt;/i&gt;

1356
00:57:02 --> 00:57:05
We want a big, fat slice
of revenge! Kiss me arse.

1357
00:57:05 --> 00:57:07
Tucker, you unmitigated stinker.

1358
00:57:07 --> 00:57:10
No god of love made this world.

1359
00:57:10 --> 00:57:15
I have seen a girl of four whose nails
had been torn out by her father!

1360
00:57:15 --> 00:57:19
I have seen the mountains
of gold teeth and hair...

1361
00:57:19 --> 00:57:22
and the millions boiled down
for soap!

1362
00:57:22 --> 00:57:24
S- S-Sometimes God...

1363
00:57:24 --> 00:57:26
turns his back on His people...

1364
00:57:26 --> 00:57:27
And breaks wind...

1365
00:57:27 --> 00:57:30
and the stench clouds the globe!

1366
00:57:30 --> 00:57:34
I am the High Voltage Man...

1367
00:57:34 --> 00:57:36
closer to God than you,

1368
00:57:36 --> 00:57:39
you sentimental clishmac-laverer!

1369
00:57:39 --> 00:57:43
No, no, no, no, no!

1370
00:57:43 --> 00:57:44
The light!
The light of truth!

1371
00:57:44 --> 00:57:48
Here is the truth! You&#39;reJack Gurney,
the 14th earl of Gurney!

1372
00:57:48 --> 00:57:51
- And I&#39;m the cock of the north!
- Eloi! Eloi!

1373
00:57:51 --> 00:57:54
Your family tricked you into marriage.
They wanted an heir.

1374
00:57:54 --> 00:57:56
Paternoster, Paternoster...

1375
00:57:56 --> 00:57:58
And if the baby turns out to be a boy,

1376
00:57:58 --> 00:57:59
they&#39;ll have you in a straitjacket...

1377
00:57:59 --> 00:58:01
before you can say another Paternoster!

1378
00:58:01 --> 00:58:04
I am the father...
I&#39;m splitting!

1379
00:58:04 --> 00:58:09
&lt;i&gt;Torn, tear. Crowned.
Coming out c-crowned! Born.&lt;/i&gt;

1380
00:58:09 --> 00:58:11
I am the Father!

1381
00:58:11 --> 00:58:14
You&#39;re the father of nothing!

1382
00:58:14 --> 00:58:18
One million volts.

1383
00:58:18 --> 00:58:20
Two million volts.

1384
00:58:20 --> 00:58:22
Three million volts.

1385
00:58:22 --> 00:58:25
Four million volts!

1386
00:58:25 --> 00:58:27
Five million volts!

1387
00:58:27 --> 00:58:29
Six million volts!

1388
00:58:29 --> 00:58:31
Seven million volts!

1389
00:58:31 --> 00:58:33
Eight million volts!

1390
00:58:33 --> 00:58:37
Nine million! Ten million!

1391
00:58:37 --> 00:58:38
Get out of here.

1392
00:58:38 --> 00:58:39
Jack.

1393
00:58:39 --> 00:58:40
What?

1394
00:58:40 --> 00:58:43
Jack. My name.

1395
00:58:43 --> 00:58:46
Yes. That&#39;s right.
Your name&#39;s Jack.

1396
00:58:46 --> 00:58:49
- It&#39;s worked.
- Hallelujah!

1397
00:58:49 --> 00:58:54
- Hallelujah!
- Well done!

1398
00:58:54 --> 00:58:56
Jack?

1399
00:58:56 --> 00:58:58
My name&#39;s Jack.

1400
00:58:58 --> 00:59:00
It&#39;s a boy!

1401
00:59:00 --> 00:59:01
&lt;i&gt;A boy!&lt;/i&gt;

1402
00:59:01 --> 00:59:02
Jack.

1403
00:59:02 --> 00:59:03
I&#39;m Jack.

1404
00:59:03 --> 00:59:05
I&#39;m... Jack.

1405
00:59:05 --> 00:59:08
I&#39;m... Jack.

1406
00:59:08 --> 00:59:11
&lt;i&gt;# Over the winds #&lt;/i&gt;

1407
00:59:11 --> 00:59:12
&lt;i&gt;# On the wings #&lt;/i&gt;

1408
00:59:12 --> 00:59:14
&lt;i&gt;# Of a dove #&lt;/i&gt;

1409
00:59:14 --> 00:59:18
&lt;i&gt;#Far away, far away #&lt;/i&gt;

1410
00:59:18 --> 00:59:20
&lt;i&gt;# Would I roam #&lt;/i&gt;

1411
00:59:20 --> 00:59:23
&lt;i&gt;- # Over the wind #
- Vincent Henry Edward...&lt;/i&gt;

1412
00:59:23 --> 00:59:25
&lt;i&gt;Ralph Gurney.&lt;/i&gt;

1413
00:59:25 --> 00:59:27
Hmm. I baptize thee...

1414
00:59:27 --> 00:59:29
in the name of the Father
and of the Son...

1415
00:59:29 --> 00:59:30
and of the Holy Ghost.

1416
00:59:30 --> 00:59:31
Amen.

1417
00:59:31 --> 00:59:33
What a pair of lungs.
He&#39;s a trooper.

1418
00:59:33 --> 00:59:36
Coochie, coochie, coochie.
Oh, he&#39;s a splendid little
fellow, isn&#39;t he, Bertie?

1419
00:59:36 --> 00:59:38
A vessel newly-filled
with the Holy Spirit,

1420
00:59:38 --> 00:59:40
though somewhat a leaky vessel.

1421
00:59:40 --> 00:59:43
Leaky or not, he saved
you Gurneys from extinction.

1422
00:59:43 --> 00:59:44
What about His Lordship?

1423
00:59:44 --> 00:59:47
The family came to the decision
some time ago that, after
certain matters were cleared up,

1424
00:59:47 --> 00:59:48
he&#39;d be put away, permanently.

1425
00:59:48 --> 00:59:50
That was before, Charles.
Everything&#39;s changed.

1426
00:59:50 --> 00:59:54
I hear he&#39;s improved so far,
though of course he may slip
back into darkness and shadow.

1427
00:59:54 --> 00:59:56
Sometimes it&#39;s worse,
now he&#39;s not completely potty.

1428
00:59:56 --> 00:59:59
I mean, we&#39;ve all be waiting for him
to go off... tick, tick, tick, boom.

1429
00:59:59 --> 01:00:01
Well, we&#39;ve all been
extremely lucky up to now,

1430
01:00:01 --> 01:00:03
but with this by-election
coming up,

1431
01:00:03 --> 01:00:05
it&#39;s getting too dangerous.

1432
01:00:05 --> 01:00:08
I think it would be best all around
if he were put away.

1433
01:00:08 --> 01:00:10
Be best all around if the bloody
lot of you were put away.

1434
01:00:10 --> 01:00:14
You must realize the battle
between the God of Love
and the Electric Messiah...

1435
01:00:14 --> 01:00:15
is a tremendous breakthrough.

1436
01:00:15 --> 01:00:17
- Yes, but is he cured?
- He&#39;s on the way to recovery.

1437
01:00:17 --> 01:00:20
His behavior
is nearing the acceptable norm.

1438
01:00:20 --> 01:00:22
Frankly, I don&#39;t know
if it&#39;s permanent.

1439
01:00:22 --> 01:00:24
I do know you mustn&#39;t
have him committed.

1440
01:00:24 --> 01:00:27
This case could become
a classic of psychology.

1441
01:00:27 --> 01:00:30
Freud&#39;s Anna O.,
now Herder&#39;s Earl of Gurney.

1442
01:00:30 --> 01:00:32
Call meJack!

1443
01:00:32 --> 01:00:34
And you say he&#39;s recovering.

1444
01:00:34 --> 01:00:37
J- J-Jack.

1445
01:00:37 --> 01:00:40
A pleasant name.
Jack. J-J-J-Jack.

1446
01:00:40 --> 01:00:42
Why are you walking like that?

1447
01:00:42 --> 01:00:44
- Oh.
- Reasonable.

1448
01:00:44 --> 01:00:46
I found this in the attic.

1449
01:00:46 --> 01:00:49
- Why aren&#39;t you resting?
- I wanted to apologize...

1450
01:00:49 --> 01:00:51
for not being
at my son&#39;s christening.

1451
01:00:51 --> 01:00:53
The little devil stole the show.

1452
01:00:53 --> 01:00:55
I must be sure before I make
my first public appearance.

1453
01:00:55 --> 01:00:58
Important to leave the right impression.
When I r-r-r-r-relax.

1454
01:00:58 --> 01:01:02
Overall impression
of superiority and volatile...

1455
01:01:02 --> 01:01:06
Farts! Whoredoms! Bloody network!
Hold, sir. Hold, hold, hold.

1456
01:01:06 --> 01:01:08
How do you feel, Jack?

1457
01:01:08 --> 01:01:10
Lazarus felt like I feel.
Odor of dung.

1458
01:01:10 --> 01:01:13
Liquid, straight, unstable.

1459
01:01:13 --> 01:01:16
Back, sir. Back, back, back.

1460
01:01:16 --> 01:01:18
Be patient.

1461
01:01:18 --> 01:01:19
I&#39;ll learn the rules of the game.

1462
01:01:19 --> 01:01:21
- We know you will.
- Well, you&#39;ve changed already.

1463
01:01:21 --> 01:01:24
&lt;i&gt;You wished to take
a constitutional at noon, my lord.&lt;/i&gt;

1464
01:01:24 --> 01:01:26
Thank you, Tuck.

1465
01:01:26 --> 01:01:27
You&#39;re a valuable man, Tuck.

1466
01:01:27 --> 01:01:30
There are some here
who don&#39;t think so, my lord.

1467
01:01:30 --> 01:01:32
They&#39;re just waiting
to give me the boot.

1468
01:01:32 --> 01:01:33
You and me both, Tuck.

1469
01:01:33 --> 01:01:36
You must give them no cause, no cause.

1470
01:01:36 --> 01:01:38
&lt;i&gt;Don&#39;t stay out too long, Jack.&lt;/i&gt;

1471
01:01:38 --> 01:01:40
Just want to get the feel
of terra firma.

1472
01:01:40 --> 01:01:43
I must learn to keep my mouth shut,
bowels open and never volunteer.

1473
01:01:43 --> 01:01:44
Come, Tuck.

1474
01:01:44 --> 01:01:46
Well, has he changed or hasn&#39;t he?

1475
01:01:46 --> 01:01:48
- I just know he&#39;ll recover.
- I want him to.

1476
01:01:48 --> 01:01:51
I love him so much.
I know he&#39;ll forgive me for what I did.

1477
01:01:51 --> 01:01:52
Well, won&#39;t he?

1478
01:01:52 --> 01:01:54
Aren&#39;t we all rather
jumping the gun just a bit?

1479
01:01:54 --> 01:01:56
I mean, look at the way
he suddenly goes off.

1480
01:01:56 --> 01:01:59
&quot;Volatile farts a&#39;a duat.&quot;
I mean, what was that all about?

1481
01:01:59 --> 01:02:02
Paralalia...
a speech disturbance.

1482
01:02:02 --> 01:02:06
It&#39;d be simpler if a man were paranoid
one minute and cured the next.

1483
01:02:06 --> 01:02:08
Unfortunately,
it takes a little longer.

1484
01:02:08 --> 01:02:11
So what about all this Victorian
bric-a-brac he&#39;s got all over the place.

1485
01:02:11 --> 01:02:13
In the end,
it&#39;s Her Ladyship&#39;s decision.

1486
01:02:13 --> 01:02:16
- It isn&#39;t. It&#39;s done.
- Done?

1487
01:02:16 --> 01:02:17
I&#39;ve asked the master in lunacy...

1488
01:02:17 --> 01:02:19
to come down here
and certifyJack insane.

1489
01:02:19 --> 01:02:20
&lt;i&gt;You devious, horrible bastard!&lt;/i&gt;

1490
01:02:20 --> 01:02:22
Oh, Jack!

1491
01:02:22 --> 01:02:24
Do you think he&#39;s done
the decent thing at last?

1492
01:02:24 --> 01:02:25
This could&#39;ve been me.

1493
01:02:25 --> 01:02:28
You were waving that gun about
all over the place, my lord.

1494
01:02:28 --> 01:02:30
Not that anybody&#39;d care.

1495
01:02:30 --> 01:02:32
Nobody to weep for poor,
creepin&#39; Tucker.

1496
01:02:32 --> 01:02:36
&lt;i&gt;- Jack!
- Well, I&#39;m not ready
for the fiery furnace yet.&lt;/i&gt;

1497
01:02:36 --> 01:02:38
Awful lot of livin&#39; to do.

1498
01:02:38 --> 01:02:42
Girls by the hundreds...
to name only a few.

1499
01:02:42 --> 01:02:43
Are you all right, Jack?

1500
01:02:43 --> 01:02:47
- What were you doing, Jeeves?
- Guzzling. It&#39;s your job
to look after His Lordship.

1501
01:02:47 --> 01:02:50
Oh, please help.
I&#39;m stuck in the brambles! Tuck!

1502
01:02:50 --> 01:02:52
- So you&#39;re still in one piece.
- Oh, disappointed?

1503
01:02:52 --> 01:02:54
I was only trying to do
what&#39;s expected.

1504
01:02:54 --> 01:02:58
I recall, as a sign of normalcy,
our circle to slaughter anything
that moves. All I did was...

1505
01:02:58 --> 01:03:01
You bloody maniac!
I&#39;ve been shot!

1506
01:03:01 --> 01:03:05
Poachers!
After him, Tucker!

1507
01:03:05 --> 01:03:08
Come on, you devil!
Come on!

1508
01:03:08 --> 01:03:10
Hey, what&#39;s your name, then?

1509
01:03:10 --> 01:03:12
- Come on!
- Get me out... Oh, you...
Could, could you get me out...

1510
01:03:12 --> 01:03:14
Oh, Father, could you help me?
I&#39;m...

1511
01:03:14 --> 01:03:17
I know. I had an accident
with an old gun,

1512
01:03:17 --> 01:03:20
a stone in my shoe,
and you still think I&#39;m insane.

1513
01:03:20 --> 01:03:22
- Give me time.
- Time?

1514
01:03:22 --> 01:03:23
There&#39;s no time left.

1515
01:03:23 --> 01:03:26
Sir Charles has asked
the master in lunacy to come here
to commit you to an institution.

1516
01:03:26 --> 01:03:29
Naturally, I&#39;ll oppose any commitment,
but everything depends on how you act.

1517
01:03:29 --> 01:03:31
Perhaps it&#39;s for the best.

1518
01:03:31 --> 01:03:33
If I satisfy the lunatic master,

1519
01:03:33 --> 01:03:36
I&#39;ll be officially sane and have
a certificate to prove it.

1520
01:03:36 --> 01:03:39
But Charles has been unwise.

1521
01:03:39 --> 01:03:41
You&#39;ll catch your deaths out here.

1522
01:03:41 --> 01:03:42
Odd expression.

1523
01:03:42 --> 01:03:44
Will you be all right, Jack?

1524
01:03:44 --> 01:03:45
What a family.

1525
01:03:45 --> 01:03:47
Enough to send anyone round the bend.

1526
01:03:47 --> 01:03:50
The only sensible thing I&#39;ve
done in the last eight years...

1527
01:03:50 --> 01:03:51
has been to marry you.

1528
01:03:51 --> 01:03:54
There now.
Well, don&#39;t stay out too long.

1529
01:03:54 --> 01:03:55
Charles is a bloody moron.

1530
01:03:55 --> 01:03:57
I&#39;ll have his guts for garters.

1531
01:03:57 --> 01:04:00
Soft. Softly.

1532
01:04:00 --> 01:04:03
Down, down.
Oh, let me keep it down.

1533
01:04:03 --> 01:04:05
Pianissimo, damp down!

1534
01:04:05 --> 01:04:06
Damp down!

1535
01:04:06 --> 01:04:07
Down.

1536
01:04:07 --> 01:04:08
I&#39;m a soft grub...

1537
01:04:08 --> 01:04:13
Undulating.

1538
01:04:13 --> 01:04:17
They&#39;ll rip me open!
Nail my brain to my skull!

1539
01:04:17 --> 01:04:20
Strom! Strom!

1540
01:04:20 --> 01:04:25
Grunk, grok, crunk! Fug!

1541
01:04:25 --> 01:04:28
Fug! That means you!

1542
01:04:28 --> 01:04:30
Fug! Fug!

1543
01:04:30 --> 01:04:32
Silence when you speak!

1544
01:04:32 --> 01:04:34
Silence!

1545
01:04:34 --> 01:04:35
Steady the buffs!

1546
01:04:35 --> 01:04:37
Waiter! I say, waiter!

1547
01:04:37 --> 01:04:39
There&#39;s a moustache in my soup!

1548
01:04:39 --> 01:04:41
Korkshist! Korkshist!

1549
01:04:41 --> 01:04:44
Korkshist! Kork!

1550
01:04:44 --> 01:04:46
&lt;i&gt;I know the price
of every article in this room.&lt;/i&gt;

1551
01:04:46 --> 01:04:49
So if there&#39;s anything missing,
we&#39;ll know where to look, won&#39;t we?

1552
01:04:49 --> 01:04:50
Hmm?

1553
01:04:50 --> 01:04:51
Lordship.

1554
01:04:51 --> 01:04:53
It&#39;s the man from the loony bin.

1555
01:04:53 --> 01:04:54
He&#39;s in the library.

1556
01:04:54 --> 01:04:55
Watch yourself.

1557
01:04:55 --> 01:04:56
Right.

1558
01:04:56 --> 01:04:57
O&#39;er you go, son.

1559
01:04:57 --> 01:05:00
&lt;i&gt;You must be Truscott,
the lunatic fellow.&lt;/i&gt;

1560
01:05:00 --> 01:05:02
I&#39;m the master
of the court of protection.

1561
01:05:02 --> 01:05:05
The title &quot;master in lunacy&quot;
isn&#39;t used nowadays.

1562
01:05:05 --> 01:05:07
Snifter? No?

1563
01:05:07 --> 01:05:08
You should know why I&#39;m here.

1564
01:05:08 --> 01:05:10
I&#39;ll introduce myself first.

1565
01:05:10 --> 01:05:13
Jack Gurney,
the earl of Gurney.

1566
01:05:13 --> 01:05:14
Sit down, why don&#39;t you?

1567
01:05:14 --> 01:05:16
I understand Charles
considers me incapable.

1568
01:05:16 --> 01:05:19
&lt;i&gt;And you&#39;re here
to commit me officially.&lt;/i&gt;

1569
01:05:19 --> 01:05:20
&lt;i&gt;Not exactly, my lord.&lt;/i&gt;

1570
01:05:20 --> 01:05:24
I make a recommendation to a nominated
judge and he does the actual committing.

1571
01:05:24 --> 01:05:27
&lt;i&gt;This investigation,
however, is rather informal...&lt;/i&gt;

1572
01:05:27 --> 01:05:28
a favor to Charles.

1573
01:05:28 --> 01:05:29
Yours is a confusing case.

1574
01:05:29 --> 01:05:32
Two doctors recommend
you be put under care,

1575
01:05:32 --> 01:05:36
But Dr. Herder says
you&#39;re nearly back to normal.

1576
01:05:36 --> 01:05:38
Of course, he is a foreigner,

1577
01:05:38 --> 01:05:41
and his ideas of normal
may not be mine.

1578
01:05:41 --> 01:05:43
How do you find out about me?

1579
01:05:43 --> 01:05:46
You talk... I listen.

1580
01:05:46 --> 01:05:50
Oh. Talk. Judas T-T-T...

1581
01:05:50 --> 01:05:52
T- T-Talk.

1582
01:05:52 --> 01:05:54
Do you still believe
you&#39;re Christ, my lord?

1583
01:05:54 --> 01:05:55
Are you God?

1584
01:05:55 --> 01:05:59
Come, sire.
Are you the god of love?

1585
01:05:59 --> 01:06:02
Harrow may be more clever.

1586
01:06:02 --> 01:06:03
What?

1587
01:06:03 --> 01:06:06
Rugby may make more row.

1588
01:06:06 --> 01:06:10
&lt;i&gt;But we&#39;ll row, row, row forever,&lt;/i&gt;

1589
01:06:10 --> 01:06:13
&lt;i&gt;steady from stroke to bow.&lt;/i&gt;

1590
01:06:13 --> 01:06:15
And nothing in life will sever...

1591
01:06:15 --> 01:06:18
the chain that is round us now.

1592
01:06:18 --> 01:06:21
# Others may fill our places #

1593
01:06:21 --> 01:06:24
#To rest in the old light blue #

1594
01:06:24 --> 01:06:27
#We&#39;ll recollect our races #

1595
01:06:27 --> 01:06:30
#We&#39;ll to the flag be true #

1596
01:06:30 --> 01:06:33
# But we&#39;ll still swing together #

1597
01:06:33 --> 01:06:36
# Elsewhere by the best of schools #

1598
01:06:36 --> 01:06:39
# But we&#39;ll still swing together #

1599
01:06:39 --> 01:06:43
&lt;i&gt;#Elsewhere by the best of schools ##&lt;/i&gt;

1600
01:06:43 --> 01:06:45
- The old Eton boating song!
- I didn&#39;t realize!

1601
01:06:45 --> 01:06:49
&lt;i&gt;You&#39;re Kelso Truscott. The Kelso, the
greatest athlete the school ever had!&lt;/i&gt;

1602
01:06:49 --> 01:06:52
- A long time ago.
- Oh, no, no, no.

1603
01:06:52 --> 01:06:55
When one went to school,
the first thing one heard were
the days of your glory, Truscott.

1604
01:06:55 --> 01:06:58
Oh, dear, one day, apparently,
you debagged the chaplain...

1605
01:06:58 --> 01:07:00
and hit the local constable
over the head with an ebony shillelagh.

1606
01:07:00 --> 01:07:03
Ah, school days, school days.

1607
01:07:03 --> 01:07:05
It&#39;s all ahead of you, then.

1608
01:07:05 --> 01:07:07
You realize, Your Lordship,
the fact we&#39;re both Etonians...

1609
01:07:07 --> 01:07:10
can have no possible influence
on my recommendation.

1610
01:07:10 --> 01:07:12
Of course, I find it
even harder to believe now.

1611
01:07:12 --> 01:07:16
Now, are you the god of love?

1612
01:07:16 --> 01:07:18
He no longer exists.

1613
01:07:18 --> 01:07:20
I&#39;ve been raving
for eight years, Truscott.

1614
01:07:20 --> 01:07:21
Eight years?

1615
01:07:21 --> 01:07:24
That accounts for you&#39;re not being
at any of the old boys&#39; reunion dinners.

1616
01:07:24 --> 01:07:28
I went round saying,
&quot;God loves you.

1617
01:07:28 --> 01:07:32
&lt;i&gt;Loves you.&quot;
I&#39;m sorry there, Truscott.&lt;/i&gt;

1618
01:07:32 --> 01:07:36
Embarrassing for a chap
to remember what a spectacle
he&#39;s made of himself, you know.

1619
01:07:36 --> 01:07:40
You seem right enough to me,
but these things are deceptive.

1620
01:07:40 --> 01:07:44
Is there anything you feel
strongly about, my lord?

1621
01:07:44 --> 01:07:47
My w-w-w-wasted years.

1622
01:07:47 --> 01:07:49
I woke up the other morning
with grey hairs.

1623
01:07:49 --> 01:07:52
Grey hairs and duty neglected.

1624
01:07:52 --> 01:07:54
Our country is being destroyed.

1625
01:07:54 --> 01:07:58
You&#39;re mocked in the Strand if you talk
of patriotism and the old queen.

1626
01:07:58 --> 01:08:02
Discipline&#39;s gone. They are sapping
the foundations of our society...

1627
01:08:02 --> 01:08:03
with their adultery
and fornication!

1628
01:08:03 --> 01:08:06
The barbarians are waiting
outside with chaos, anarchy,

1629
01:08:06 --> 01:08:08
homosexuality and worse!

1630
01:08:08 --> 01:08:10
- Well?
- Dr. Herder,

1631
01:08:10 --> 01:08:12
you said His Lordship
was on the road to recovery.

1632
01:08:12 --> 01:08:14
- I can&#39;t agree.
- There!

1633
01:08:14 --> 01:08:15
You&#39;re too cautious.

1634
01:08:15 --> 01:08:17
For my money, he&#39;s recovered.

1635
01:08:17 --> 01:08:21
Oh, it&#39;s absolutely marvelous!
Oh!

1636
01:08:21 --> 01:08:23
Oh, we&#39;re so grateful to you,
Mr. Truscott.

1637
01:08:23 --> 01:08:28
Thank you, Your Ladyship.
We&#39;ll be expecting His Lordship
at the next reunion dinner.

1638
01:08:28 --> 01:08:31
You&#39;re lucky this was only
a friendly investigation, old boy.

1639
01:08:31 --> 01:08:34
- We take a dim view
of frivolous complaints.

1640
01:08:34 --> 01:08:35
- Kelso?
- Yes, Your Lordship?

1641
01:08:35 --> 01:08:36
I&#39;ll see you out.

1642
01:08:36 --> 01:08:39
&lt;i&gt;Truscott&#39;s a damned ass!&lt;/i&gt;

1643
01:08:39 --> 01:08:41
- Can&#39;t he see I&#39;m right?
- Right?

1644
01:08:41 --> 01:08:42
I&#39;ve had enough of your &quot;right.&quot;

1645
01:08:42 --> 01:08:46
You have stuck your
aristocratic schnoz into my affairs
for the last time, right?

1646
01:08:46 --> 01:08:50
&lt;i&gt;Jack&#39;s changed, right? Everything&#39;s
changed...you, me, us, them.&lt;/i&gt;

1647
01:08:50 --> 01:08:53
It&#39;s a new deal all round, right?
You know what I mean?

1648
01:08:53 --> 01:08:55
Right? Right!

1649
01:08:55 --> 01:08:57
You did it, Jack.
Wonderful.

1650
01:08:57 --> 01:09:00
Yes. He&#39;s made
a spectacular breakthrough.

1651
01:09:00 --> 01:09:02
We&#39;re in the process
of making a new man.

1652
01:09:02 --> 01:09:04
I&#39;m always on the lookout
for new men.

1653
01:09:04 --> 01:09:07
Deformed, unfinished,

1654
01:09:07 --> 01:09:09
sent before my time...

1655
01:09:09 --> 01:09:11
into this breeding world.

1656
01:09:11 --> 01:09:14
I&#39;m cured of fantasy obsessions,
paranoid delusions,

1657
01:09:14 --> 01:09:16
I master words.

1658
01:09:16 --> 01:09:18
L... Straighten up there.

1659
01:09:18 --> 01:09:21
Am... Close up with &quot;I,&quot;
you horrible, little word.

1660
01:09:21 --> 01:09:23
God.

1661
01:09:23 --> 01:09:25
I am God.

1662
01:09:25 --> 01:09:28
Not the god of love,
but God Almighty.

1663
01:09:28 --> 01:09:31
I massacred the Amalekites
and the Seven Nations of Canaan.

1664
01:09:31 --> 01:09:34
I hacked Agag to pieces
and blasted the barren fig tree,

1665
01:09:34 --> 01:09:37
for the day of vengeance
is in my heart.

1666
01:09:37 --> 01:09:38
You lunar jackass,

1667
01:09:38 --> 01:09:40
she betrayed you...
guilty, guilty, guilty.

1668
01:09:40 --> 01:09:42
The punishment is death.
I&#39;ve finally been processed.

1669
01:09:42 --> 01:09:45
They made me adjust...
to modern times.

1670
01:09:45 --> 01:09:48
This is 1888, isn&#39;t it?

1671
01:09:48 --> 01:09:49
I&#39;m Jack.

1672
01:09:49 --> 01:09:51
Cunning Jack.

1673
01:09:51 --> 01:09:53
QuietJack.

1674
01:09:53 --> 01:09:55
Jack whose sword never sleeps.

1675
01:09:55 --> 01:09:57
Hats off, I&#39;m Jack.

1676
01:09:57 --> 01:09:59
Not the good shepherd.

1677
01:09:59 --> 01:10:00
Not the prince of peace.

1678
01:10:00 --> 01:10:03
I&#39;m red Jack, spring-heeled Jack.

1679
01:10:03 --> 01:10:07
Jack from hell.
Trade name: Jack the Ripper.

1680
01:10:07 --> 01:10:09
&lt;i&gt;Mary, Annie,&lt;/i&gt;

1681
01:10:09 --> 01:10:11
&lt;i&gt;Elizabeth, Catherine,&lt;/i&gt;

1682
01:10:11 --> 01:10:13
&lt;i&gt;Alice, Marie Kelly.&lt;/i&gt;

1683
01:10:13 --> 01:10:15
&lt;i&gt;Six little whores,
glad to be alive.&lt;/i&gt;

1684
01:10:15 --> 01:10:18
&lt;i&gt;One sidles up toJack
and then there are five.&lt;/i&gt;

1685
01:10:18 --> 01:10:20
When they see how Jack&#39;s changed,

1686
01:10:20 --> 01:10:22
they&#39;ll spread the word, then
everyone&#39;ll know he&#39;s back to normal.

1687
01:10:22 --> 01:10:23
Well, I don&#39;t think he is.

1688
01:10:23 --> 01:10:25
You&#39;re just siding with your father.
Well, where is the old goat?

1689
01:10:25 --> 01:10:29
He&#39;s back in the library.
Do you know I think he&#39;s heading
for a serious breakdown?

1690
01:10:29 --> 01:10:31
I actually saw him reading a book.

1691
01:10:31 --> 01:10:34
I don&#39;t understand how you got the
hunt to inviteJack to come along.

1692
01:10:34 --> 01:10:36
Oh, I&#39;m still a ladyship.
Sixty miles out of town,

1693
01:10:36 --> 01:10:39
&lt;i&gt;an awful lot of cap touching
and forelock tugging still goes on.&lt;/i&gt;

1694
01:10:39 --> 01:10:43
I gather that the atmosphere
was a trifle strained on your
last visit to Gurney Manor.

1695
01:10:43 --> 01:10:45
Well, it was our first meeting
with His Lordship.

1696
01:10:45 --> 01:10:48
He asked me if I...
well, if I loved him.

1697
01:10:48 --> 01:10:49
Your manservant heard him.

1698
01:10:49 --> 01:10:54
&lt;i&gt;- Why did he say, &quot;God is love&quot;?
- Because he was mad.&lt;/i&gt;

1699
01:10:54 --> 01:10:57
&lt;i&gt;- Mad with grief.
My father had just died.
- Talk of the devil.&lt;/i&gt;

1700
01:10:57 --> 01:11:00
Darling, you remember
Mrs. Piggot-Jones and Mrs. Treadwell.

1701
01:11:00 --> 01:11:01
We&#39;ve met?

1702
01:11:01 --> 01:11:04
Why, you do remember.
You asked me if I&#39;d loved.

1703
01:11:04 --> 01:11:07
- Please, not in public!
- I keep telling Pamela
not to brood about it.

1704
01:11:07 --> 01:11:10
Let&#39;s have no talk of bestial
orgasms, erotic tonguings.

1705
01:11:10 --> 01:11:11
It burns high-voltage holes
in the brain.

1706
01:11:11 --> 01:11:13
It&#39;s been proved in oscillographs.

1707
01:11:13 --> 01:11:15
- My husband hates anything suggestive.
- Oh.

1708
01:11:15 --> 01:11:17
I hear that you got
Sir Barrington-Cochran to speak...

1709
01:11:17 --> 01:11:18
at your church fete
before he passed away.

1710
01:11:18 --> 01:11:22
Made a splendid speech about
the rise of crime. And socialism!

1711
01:11:22 --> 01:11:26
&lt;i&gt;I shall campaign actively for
the reintroduction of the death penalty.&lt;/i&gt;

1712
01:11:26 --> 01:11:28
&lt;i&gt;- Bravo.
- You mean there&#39;s no death penalty...&lt;/i&gt;

1713
01:11:28 --> 01:11:29
in England&#39;s green and pleasant?

1714
01:11:29 --> 01:11:32
- Surely you knew that...
- We&#39;re a bit out of touch.

1715
01:11:32 --> 01:11:35
The hangman holds
our society together.

1716
01:11:35 --> 01:11:38
He is the symbol of the great chastiser.
He built this world on punishment
and fear.

1717
01:11:38 --> 01:11:40
&lt;i&gt;Snuff out fear and see what follows.&lt;/i&gt;

1718
01:11:40 --> 01:11:41
Sons strike their doddering dads.

1719
01:11:41 --> 01:11:44
Young girls show their ankles and bosoms
and say rude things about the queen.

1720
01:11:44 --> 01:11:47
Anything goes, and they do it openly
in the street and frighten the horses!

1721
01:11:47 --> 01:11:49
It&#39;s the times.
What can we do about it?

1722
01:11:49 --> 01:11:52
- Bring back fear!
- Hear, hear.

1723
01:11:52 --> 01:11:56
In the old days, the executioner
kept the common herd in order.

1724
01:11:56 --> 01:12:00
When he stood on his gallows,
you knew God was in His heaven,
all right with the world.

1725
01:12:00 --> 01:12:02
The punishment for blaspheming
was to be broken on the wheel.

1726
01:12:02 --> 01:12:07
First, the fibula, crack.
Then the tibia, patella and
femur, crack, crack, crack!

1727
01:12:07 --> 01:12:10
Then the corpus, ulna
and radius, crack!

1728
01:12:10 --> 01:12:12
# Disconnect dem bones
Dem dry bones #

1729
01:12:12 --> 01:12:14
# Disconnect dem bones
Dem dry bones #

1730
01:12:14 --> 01:12:16
# Disconnect dem bones
Dem dry bones #

1731
01:12:16 --> 01:12:18
&lt;i&gt;- #Now hear the Word of the Lord #
- # Hear the Word of the Lord #&lt;/i&gt;

1732
01:12:18 --> 01:12:20
#Well, your head bone&#39;s
connected to your neck bone #

1733
01:12:20 --> 01:12:22
&lt;i&gt;# Your neck bone&#39;s connected
to your shoulder bone #&lt;/i&gt;

1734
01:12:22 --> 01:12:24
#Your shoulder bone&#39;s connected
to your backbone #

1735
01:12:24 --> 01:12:26
&lt;i&gt;# Your backbone&#39;s connected
to your hipbone #&lt;/i&gt;

1736
01:12:26 --> 01:12:28
&lt;i&gt;# Your hipbone&#39;s connected
to your thigh bone #&lt;/i&gt;

1737
01:12:28 --> 01:12:30
- # Now hear the Word of the Lord #
- # Hear the Word of the Lord #

1738
01:12:30 --> 01:12:32
# Dem bones, dem bones gonna

1739
01:12:32 --> 01:12:34
# Dem bones, dem bones gonna

1740
01:12:34 --> 01:12:36
# Dem bones, dem bones gonna

1741
01:12:36 --> 01:12:38
# Now hear the Word of the Lord #

1742
01:12:38 --> 01:12:40

# Disconnect dem bones

1745
01:12:44 --> 01:12:46
# Now hear the Word #

1746
01:12:46 --> 01:12:49
# Of the Lord ##

1747
01:12:49 --> 01:12:53
&lt;i&gt;- Ladies and gentlemen,
we understand each other perfectly.&lt;/i&gt;

1748
01:12:53 --> 01:12:54
Breeding speaks to breeding.

1749
01:12:54 --> 01:12:57
&lt;i&gt;He&#39;s so impressive,
Your Ladyship, isn&#39;t he?&lt;/i&gt;

1750
01:12:57 --> 01:13:00
&lt;i&gt;A little eccentric on the surface,
but deep down sound.&lt;/i&gt;

1751
01:13:00 --> 01:13:03
&lt;i&gt;He is so like his
father. Gets more like him every day.&lt;/i&gt;

1752
01:13:03 --> 01:13:04
&lt;i&gt;It&#39;s frightening.&lt;/i&gt;

1753
01:13:04 --> 01:13:06
God&#39;s blessing...

1754
01:13:06 --> 01:13:07
and send you a fine, fat fox.

1755
01:13:07 --> 01:13:10
- Join me for a cigar, Dinsdale.
- No, thank you, Jack.

1756
01:13:10 --> 01:13:13
It&#39;s up the wooden staircase
to Bedfordshire for me.

1757
01:13:13 --> 01:13:16
Don&#39;t be too long, darling. I&#39;m just
going to kiss littleJack good night.

1758
01:13:16 --> 01:13:18
&lt;i&gt;Listen.&lt;/i&gt;

1759
01:13:18 --> 01:13:19
Tucker&#39;s singing.

1760
01:13:19 --> 01:13:21
You were wonderful
at the hunt today.

1761
01:13:21 --> 01:13:22
I&#39;m still not word perfect...

1762
01:13:22 --> 01:13:24
all the talk of bestial orgasms.

1763
01:13:24 --> 01:13:27
It wasn&#39;t what you said.
It was your manner that won them over.

1764
01:13:27 --> 01:13:29
I stand outside myself,

1765
01:13:29 --> 01:13:32
watching myself watching myself.

1766
01:13:32 --> 01:13:34
I smile, I smile,

1767
01:13:34 --> 01:13:35
I smile.

1768
01:13:35 --> 01:13:37
I like your smile.

1769
01:13:37 --> 01:13:39
Before,
I was only sorry for you.

1770
01:13:39 --> 01:13:41
Oh, before, madam.

1771
01:13:41 --> 01:13:43
Before, I was a mass of light.

1772
01:13:43 --> 01:13:44
Mad, you see.

1773
01:13:44 --> 01:13:45
Now I am sane.

1774
01:13:45 --> 01:13:48
The world sweats
into my brain, madam.

1775
01:13:48 --> 01:13:51
Don&#39;t keep calling me... madam.

1776
01:13:51 --> 01:13:54
It&#39;s hard to look at people
from downwind. They stink.

1777
01:13:54 --> 01:13:56
It&#39;s terrible,
but it&#39;s the real thing.

1778
01:13:56 --> 01:13:59
I&#39;ve always wanted
to find the real thing.

1779
01:13:59 --> 01:14:02
&lt;i&gt;- Do you remember
our first talk together?
- I remember nothing.&lt;/i&gt;

1780
01:14:02 --> 01:14:06
&quot;Explode. Only feel,&quot; you said.

1781
01:14:06 --> 01:14:08
Oh, poorJack.

1782
01:14:08 --> 01:14:10
Why do you remember now
what I said then...

1783
01:14:10 --> 01:14:11
when I don&#39;t remember myself?

1784
01:14:11 --> 01:14:14
Because you&#39;re so different.

1785
01:14:14 --> 01:14:16
I&#39;m trembling...

1786
01:14:16 --> 01:14:20
like I used to tremble
at shadows when I was a child.

1787
01:14:20 --> 01:14:22
I am no shadow.

1788
01:14:22 --> 01:14:25
I&#39;m flesh and blood.

1789
01:14:25 --> 01:14:27
Touch.

1790
01:14:27 --> 01:14:29
Perhaps I&#39;m not really dead,

1791
01:14:29 --> 01:14:30
only sleeping.

1792
01:14:30 --> 01:14:33
Wake me... with a kiss.

1793
01:14:33 --> 01:14:35
Are you accosting me?

1794
01:14:35 --> 01:14:38
That&#39;s right, ducks.
&#39;Ow&#39;s about it?

1795
01:14:38 --> 01:14:40
Jack.

1796
01:14:40 --> 01:14:41
Yes?

1797
01:14:41 --> 01:14:43
Are you pleased
this has happened?

1798
01:14:43 --> 01:14:45
We were destined to meet.

1799
01:14:45 --> 01:14:47
That sounds romantic.

1800
01:14:47 --> 01:14:50
More. Please.

1801
01:14:50 --> 01:14:53
&lt;i&gt;Orgasm, copulation.&lt;/i&gt;

1802
01:14:53 --> 01:14:57
Fornication,
gangrened shoulder of sex.

1803
01:14:57 --> 01:15:00
Tear, spill the seed, gut-slime.

1804
01:15:00 --> 01:15:05
I know some women like
being stimulated by dirty words
and filthy talk, but I don&#39;t.

1805
01:15:05 --> 01:15:09
Flesh lusteth
against the spirit.

1806
01:15:09 --> 01:15:11
Run, Mary, run!

1807
01:15:11 --> 01:15:13
You&#39;re talking nonsense again, Jack.

1808
01:15:13 --> 01:15:16
You&#39;ll be nicked down
to your bloody membrane, Mary.

1809
01:15:16 --> 01:15:19
Say something soft and tender.

1810
01:15:19 --> 01:15:21
Calves, tender tongues,

1811
01:15:21 --> 01:15:23
earlobes, hearts,

1812
01:15:23 --> 01:15:24
tits, nipples.

1813
01:15:24 --> 01:15:27
&lt;i&gt;Lover.&lt;/i&gt;

1814
01:15:27 --> 01:15:32
The sword of the lord
is filled with blood.

1815
01:15:32 --> 01:15:36
Stop talking, Jack.
Make me immortal... with a kiss.

1816
01:15:36 --> 01:15:39
I&#39;m alive!

1817
01:15:39 --> 01:15:40
- What&#39;s going on?
- Who&#39;s that?

1818
01:15:40 --> 01:15:41
- What is she doing?
- Is she dead?

1819
01:15:41 --> 01:15:43
- Yes!
- Get back, everybody!

1820
01:15:43 --> 01:15:46
&lt;i&gt;It&#39;s Jack the Ripper!&lt;/i&gt;

1821
01:15:46 --> 01:15:50
Ah, Lady Claire.
Are you quite comfortable, madam?

1822
01:15:50 --> 01:15:53
Stoned, eh?
All right. Well.

1823
01:15:53 --> 01:15:54
Could I be of assistan...

1824
01:15:54 --> 01:15:58
One less!
Praise the Lord! Hallelujah!

1825
01:15:58 --> 01:16:00
&lt;i&gt;Hallelujah!&lt;/i&gt;

1826
01:16:00 --> 01:16:03
&lt;i&gt;Yippee!&lt;/i&gt;

1827
01:16:03 --> 01:16:05
- Halleluj...
- What&#39;s go...

1828
01:16:05 --> 01:16:07
Good God!

1829
01:16:07 --> 01:16:10
All right.
Who&#39;s the impudent clown...

1830
01:16:10 --> 01:16:11
responsible for this?

1831
01:16:11 --> 01:16:15
The super had a word with him
before he left. He&#39;s a close
friend of Charles Gurney&#39;s.

1832
01:16:15 --> 01:16:18
- Tricky, sir.
- There&#39;s to be no publicity,
and he wants it wrapped up quick.

1833
01:16:18 --> 01:16:23
We, therefore, commit
our dear sister&#39;s body to the ground.

1834
01:16:23 --> 01:16:24
&lt;i&gt;Earth to earth...&lt;/i&gt;

1835
01:16:24 --> 01:16:26
Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.

1836
01:16:26 --> 01:16:27
Chairman Mao Tse-tung.

1837
01:16:27 --> 01:16:30
So that&#39;s his little game.

1838
01:16:30 --> 01:16:35
Ah, she was beautiful as Taza
and comely as Jerusalem.

1839
01:16:35 --> 01:16:38
And now she&#39;s gone,
down, down, down.

1840
01:16:38 --> 01:16:41
Up, up, up she flies!

1841
01:16:41 --> 01:16:43
Her soul flies up.

1842
01:16:43 --> 01:16:44
Surely you believe she&#39;s gone
to another place...

1843
01:16:44 --> 01:16:46
to enjoy even greater privileges
than she had on Earth.

1844
01:16:46 --> 01:16:49
Yes, well, I have to, Jack.
After all, I am a bishop.

1845
01:16:49 --> 01:16:51
I think of her so fondly,

1846
01:16:51 --> 01:16:52
n- n-not her terrible death.

1847
01:16:52 --> 01:16:55
There, there, there.
Forgive an old man&#39;s wavering.

1848
01:16:55 --> 01:16:59
Lean on me.
Trust God&#39;s judgement.

1849
01:16:59 --> 01:17:00
There, there, dear boy.

1850
01:17:00 --> 01:17:03
Y- Y-You make an old man ashamed.

1851
01:17:03 --> 01:17:07
You have been such a great,
great source of strength to me, Jack.

1852
01:17:07 --> 01:17:09
And I won&#39;t forget this, my boy.

1853
01:17:09 --> 01:17:11
I won&#39;t forget this. Hmm.

1854
01:17:11 --> 01:17:16
Mmm, Jack, you were the instrument
that restored my faith.

1855
01:17:16 --> 01:17:18
L- l-l-I feel reborn.

1856
01:17:18 --> 01:17:21
L- l-l-I found the way again...
the way!

1857
01:17:21 --> 01:17:23
Come, my boy.

1858
01:17:23 --> 01:17:27
Let me walk... humbly,
w- w-w-with my God!

1859
01:17:27 --> 01:17:28
My God. Yes.

1860
01:17:28 --> 01:17:30
How could anything like this
happen to us?

1861
01:17:30 --> 01:17:32
- What was Mother thinking of?
- Not in front of strangers.

1862
01:17:32 --> 01:17:34
Pull yourself together,
Dinsdale.

1863
01:17:34 --> 01:17:36
Brockett, why aren&#39;t you
running this animal to earth?

1864
01:17:36 --> 01:17:38
Oh, don&#39;t you worry, sir.
We&#39;ll get him.

1865
01:17:38 --> 01:17:40
But there&#39;s still a few points
I&#39;d like to clear up.

1866
01:17:40 --> 01:17:44
Now, we know the butler found
the body just after the killer
left by the French windows.

1867
01:17:44 --> 01:17:46
And when you came in a moment later,
sir, where was he standing?

1868
01:17:46 --> 01:17:48
- Who?
- Well, the baby&#39;s asleep.
What are you lot doing?

1869
01:17:48 --> 01:17:51
This is Her Ladyship.
He wants to know how we found
Tucker beside Claire&#39;s body.

1870
01:17:51 --> 01:17:54
- Oh, here, like the hokey-cokey.
- The hokey-cokey?

1871
01:17:54 --> 01:17:56
Yes, you know,
the hokey-cokey.

1872
01:17:56 --> 01:17:59
- Now, why would he be doing
anything like the hokey-cokey?
- He was drunk.

1873
01:17:59 --> 01:18:01
Senile old fool. He should have been
booted out of here years ago.

1874
01:18:01 --> 01:18:04
But he&#39;s not the only one you
should check. What about my nephew?

1875
01:18:04 --> 01:18:06
Oh, I think that&#39;s rather
disgraceful, Father.

1876
01:18:06 --> 01:18:08
Charles, you&#39;ve been through
a lot, but I warn you.

1877
01:18:08 --> 01:18:10
I&#39;m not saying
he is involved, but...

1878
01:18:10 --> 01:18:12
But? I&#39;ll give you but!

1879
01:18:12 --> 01:18:14
Charles, you&#39;re not doing this
for Claire. You&#39;re doing it
because you&#39;re jealous...

1880
01:18:14 --> 01:18:15
because I love my husband.

1881
01:18:15 --> 01:18:18
Madam, you&#39;ll never be a Gurney.

1882
01:18:18 --> 01:18:20
I&#39;d rather be dead!

1883
01:18:20 --> 01:18:22
Is this the way to behave
in the presence of death?

1884
01:18:22 --> 01:18:24
Ah, forgive them, Jack.
Forgive them, my boy.

1885
01:18:24 --> 01:18:26
They know not what they do.

1886
01:18:26 --> 01:18:28
I think I&#39;ll sit here again.
Thank you.

1887
01:18:28 --> 01:18:31
Dinsdale, shouldn&#39;t you answer
those letters of condolence?

1888
01:18:31 --> 01:18:34
- Nonsense. Let &#39;em wait.
- No, no, no, no. Jack&#39;s right.

1889
01:18:34 --> 01:18:37
Creates a good impression.
Takes my mind off things.

1890
01:18:37 --> 01:18:41
It&#39;s been a bad day for me,
what with one thing or another.

1891
01:18:41 --> 01:18:43
My lord, there are still a few
details I&#39;d like to clear up.

1892
01:18:43 --> 01:18:47
Now on the night of the murder,
you talked with Lady Claire till 11:30.

1893
01:18:47 --> 01:18:48
How was she when you left her?

1894
01:18:48 --> 01:18:50
- Unhappy.
- Oh? Why&#39;s that?

1895
01:18:50 --> 01:18:53
Damn it, Brockett, what the devil
does it matter how my wife was feeling?

1896
01:18:53 --> 01:18:54
You went straight up to bed
and heard nothing?

1897
01:18:54 --> 01:18:55
I thought
I heard Tucker singing.

1898
01:18:55 --> 01:18:58
Uh-huh.

1899
01:18:58 --> 01:19:03
But he said he didn&#39;t leave
the kitchen till 12:00. Odd.

1900
01:19:03 --> 01:19:06
An important question, my lord.
Now think hard, now.

1901
01:19:06 --> 01:19:09
Has anything unusual
happened here recently?

1902
01:19:09 --> 01:19:11
Anything out of the ordinary?

1903
01:19:11 --> 01:19:12
Your Ladyship?

1904
01:19:12 --> 01:19:13
Sir Charles?

1905
01:19:13 --> 01:19:16
Bishop?

1906
01:19:16 --> 01:19:17
Get him, Fraser.

1907
01:19:17 --> 01:19:19
What&#39;s this? What are you doing?

1908
01:19:19 --> 01:19:21
All right.
All right, all right!

1909
01:19:21 --> 01:19:24
What&#39;s the idea?
I&#39;ve got a plane to catch.

1910
01:19:24 --> 01:19:28
&lt;i&gt;- You going somewhere, Tucker?
- Mr. Tucker, flatfoot.&lt;/i&gt;

1911
01:19:28 --> 01:19:31
Looks like it, don&#39;t it? It&#39;s
cocktails and champagne for yours truly.

1912
01:19:31 --> 01:19:32
&lt;i&gt;Gay Paree where all the girls
say, &quot;Oui, oui.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

1913
01:19:32 --> 01:19:35
- A bit sudden, isn&#39;t it?
- I&#39;m a creature of impulse,
Your Ladyship.

1914
01:19:35 --> 01:19:38
You&#39;re not going anywhere,
Tucker, me lad. I got questions
I want answerin&#39;.

1915
01:19:38 --> 01:19:41
Now, why were you found standing
like this beside the body, eh, eh?

1916
01:19:41 --> 01:19:43
Shock. That&#39;s it. Shock.

1917
01:19:43 --> 01:19:45
Shock.
I&#39;ll give you shock, me lad.

1918
01:19:45 --> 01:19:47
&lt;i&gt;- I told you all I know.
- Oh, have you?&lt;/i&gt;

1919
01:19:47 --> 01:19:50
Daniel Tucker,
alias Alexei Kronstadt.

1920
01:19:50 --> 01:19:51
Party member number 243.

1921
01:19:51 --> 01:19:54
- Murdering swine.
- Jeeves a Bolshie?

1922
01:19:54 --> 01:19:56
- You&#39;re a Red.
- What if I am?

1923
01:19:56 --> 01:19:58
What&#39;s it to you how I spend
my leisure time, flatfoot?

1924
01:19:58 --> 01:20:01
You&#39;re a suspect in
a murder case. You&#39;ve concealed
certain facts about yourself.

1925
01:20:01 --> 01:20:03
- What else are you hiding, Tucker?
- Suspect?

1926
01:20:03 --> 01:20:04
A suspect?

1927
01:20:04 --> 01:20:07
This is old Tuck, Your Lordship.

1928
01:20:07 --> 01:20:10
All talk, no action.

1929
01:20:10 --> 01:20:12
I couldn&#39;t commit a crime
if I wanted. I&#39;m not the type.

1930
01:20:12 --> 01:20:15
You told me you discovered Lady Claire&#39;s
body just before the others came back.

1931
01:20:15 --> 01:20:20
Yet His Lordship here
swears he heard you down here
in this room a half hour before.

1932
01:20:20 --> 01:20:24
Oh, no.
Oh, you&#39;re wrong about that, my lord.

1933
01:20:24 --> 01:20:28
If thy hand offends thee,
cut it off.

1934
01:20:28 --> 01:20:30
Say something for me,
Your Lordship.

1935
01:20:30 --> 01:20:32
Tell him you&#39;re wrong.
You&#39;re the only one that can help me.

1936
01:20:32 --> 01:20:36
Why, you always was my favorite,
MasterJack.

1937
01:20:36 --> 01:20:37
The old earl,
just before he died, said,

1938
01:20:37 --> 01:20:40
&quot;Look after that feebleminded
idiotJack for me, Tuck.&quot;

1939
01:20:40 --> 01:20:42
I could have gone, but I stayed.

1940
01:20:42 --> 01:20:44
Tuck, it was you.

1941
01:20:44 --> 01:20:48
Spawned out of envy, hate,
revenge, you killed her!

1942
01:20:48 --> 01:20:52
Oh, Dan, Dan, you dirty, old man!
Inspector.

1943
01:20:52 --> 01:20:55
- Daniel Tucker, I must warn you...
- Judas Jack Iscariot!

1944
01:20:55 --> 01:20:58
You&#39;ve sold me down the sewer.

1945
01:20:58 --> 01:21:00
You&#39;re just like
all the rest of them.

1946
01:21:00 --> 01:21:01
But I know why.

1947
01:21:01 --> 01:21:03
You did it.

1948
01:21:03 --> 01:21:06
You and Sir Charles, standing
there like a pickled walrus.

1949
01:21:06 --> 01:21:08
You Gurneys
don&#39;t draw the line at murder.

1950
01:21:08 --> 01:21:10
Upper-class excrement!

1951
01:21:10 --> 01:21:12
You wanna do me dirt,
just because I know too much.

1952
01:21:12 --> 01:21:15
I know that one percent
of the population owns half
the property in this country.

1953
01:21:15 --> 01:21:17
And that vomiting one percent
wants kosher killing,

1954
01:21:17 --> 01:21:20
hung up so the blue blood
drains out slow and easy.

1955
01:21:20 --> 01:21:22
So, comrades, come rally...

1956
01:21:22 --> 01:21:24
and the last fight let us face.

1957
01:21:24 --> 01:21:27
The international army unites
the human race.

1958
01:21:27 --> 01:21:30
# I&#39;m only a strolling vagabond #

1959
01:21:30 --> 01:21:31
# So good night, pretty maiden #

1960
01:21:31 --> 01:21:33
&lt;i&gt;- Ah, it&#39;s what I&#39;ve always said.
- # Good night #&lt;/i&gt;

1961
01:21:33 --> 01:21:35
&lt;i&gt;You can&#39;t give the working class money.&lt;/i&gt;

1962
01:21:35 --> 01:21:37
If he hadn&#39;t had that £30,000...

1963
01:21:37 --> 01:21:38
Fancy... old Jeeves.

1964
01:21:38 --> 01:21:41
My lord, I&#39;d like to say
what a pleasure it&#39;s been meeting you.

1965
01:21:41 --> 01:21:43
- Well, it couldn&#39;t have been easy.
- It wasn&#39;t.

1966
01:21:43 --> 01:21:45
But you realized
I was only doing me job.

1967
01:21:45 --> 01:21:49
You&#39;ve shown me what
&quot;noblesse oblige&quot; really means.

1968
01:21:49 --> 01:21:52
Cut up like meat.

1969
01:21:52 --> 01:21:53
&lt;i&gt;En garde.&lt;/i&gt;

1970
01:21:53 --> 01:21:56
No, no. I cured you.

1971
01:21:56 --> 01:21:59
You couldn&#39;t turn violent.
You believe, more or less,
what other people believe.

1972
01:21:59 --> 01:22:02
Your job&#39;s done, Herr Doctor.
I&#39;m adjusted.

1973
01:22:02 --> 01:22:05
I brush my teeth twice daily
and smile.

1974
01:22:05 --> 01:22:08
No, you call that
being adjusted, hmm?

1975
01:22:08 --> 01:22:13
Behavior, which would be
considered insanity in a tradesman,

1976
01:22:13 --> 01:22:17
is looked on
as mild eccentricity in a lord.

1977
01:22:17 --> 01:22:20
I want to know about Claire.

1978
01:22:20 --> 01:22:22
She&#39;s dead, Doctor...
one of the facts of life.

1979
01:22:22 --> 01:22:25
- I know that.
- She&#39;s turning to slime, Doctor.

1980
01:22:25 --> 01:22:27
- She&#39;s stinking pus!
- I don&#39;t need to know that!

1981
01:22:27 --> 01:22:28
Then kindly leave the stage.

1982
01:22:28 --> 01:22:30
- You killed her.
- A touch.

1983
01:22:30 --> 01:22:34
You... killed her!

1984
01:22:34 --> 01:22:37
You killed her!

1985
01:22:37 --> 01:22:39
A swordsman worthy of me steel.

1986
01:22:39 --> 01:22:42
Didn&#39;t we meet at Heidelberg?

1987
01:22:42 --> 01:22:45
You killed her!

1988
01:22:45 --> 01:22:48
You were fornicating lovers!
Sperm dancers!

1989
01:22:48 --> 01:22:50
It&#39;s a lie!

1990
01:22:50 --> 01:22:52
Lady Claire
meant nothing to me.

1991
01:22:52 --> 01:22:54
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

1992
01:22:54 --> 01:22:55
You killed her!

1993
01:22:55 --> 01:22:56
You cured me!

1994
01:22:56 --> 01:22:59
I was a pale moon loony.
You changed me into a murderer.

1995
01:22:59 --> 01:23:01
- Is that what you&#39;re saying?
- Yes.

1996
01:23:01 --> 01:23:03
No! Yes!

1997
01:23:03 --> 01:23:05
- May God forgive me!
- Never!

1998
01:23:05 --> 01:23:06
What proof have you?

1999
01:23:06 --> 01:23:07
I don&#39;t need proof. I know.

2000
01:23:07 --> 01:23:09
Physician, heal thyself.

2001
01:23:09 --> 01:23:11
You suddenly know
against all the evidence.

2002
01:23:11 --> 01:23:13
You don&#39;t need proof
from anybody or anything.

2003
01:23:13 --> 01:23:17
This monstrous belief of yours that
I&#39;m guilty is a clear case of paranoia.

2004
01:23:17 --> 01:23:19
I&#39;ve heard of&quot;transference,&quot;
Doctor, but this is ridiculous.

2005
01:23:19 --> 01:23:22
If they ask about me at
the trial, tell them the truth.

2006
01:23:22 --> 01:23:25
- What truth?
- That I&#39;m 100% normal.

2007
01:23:25 --> 01:23:27
Touche, Herr Doctor.

2008
01:23:27 --> 01:23:28
He&#39;s right.

2009
01:23:28 --> 01:23:30
He is normal.

2010
01:23:30 --> 01:23:31
It&#39;s only a feeling.

2011
01:23:31 --> 01:23:34
I can&#39;t rely on feelings.

2012
01:23:34 --> 01:23:39
Everything he&#39;s done conforms
to a classic recovery pattern.

2013
01:23:39 --> 01:23:42
His occasional lapses are normal.

2014
01:23:42 --> 01:23:46
His trying to blackmail me into saying
he&#39;s completely normal is normal.

2015
01:23:46 --> 01:23:47
Claire&#39;s death,

2016
01:23:47 --> 01:23:50
one of those terrible ironies...

2017
01:23:50 --> 01:23:52
nothing to do with the case.

2018
01:23:52 --> 01:23:55
Unpleasant as he is,

2019
01:23:55 --> 01:23:59
the good lord&#39;s... himself again.

2020
01:23:59 --> 01:24:00
My head&#39;s splitting!

2021
01:24:00 --> 01:24:03
I&#39;ve had an abdomen
full of the upper classes!

2022
01:24:03 --> 01:24:04
Claire.

2023
01:24:04 --> 01:24:07
I should have specialized
in heart diseases.

2024
01:24:07 --> 01:24:09
Cock-a-doodle-do.

2025
01:24:09 --> 01:24:10
&lt;i&gt;Scheisshund!&lt;/i&gt;

2026
01:24:10 --> 01:24:12
He made me deny you.

2027
01:24:12 --> 01:24:13
Cock-a-doodle-do.

2028
01:24:13 --> 01:24:16
Cock-a-doodle-do!

2029
01:24:16 --> 01:24:21
&lt;i&gt;Cock-a-doodle-do!&lt;/i&gt;

2030
01:24:21 --> 01:24:22
Ah, good, good.

2031
01:24:22 --> 01:24:25
Only a small item
on page three today. Uh...

2032
01:24:25 --> 01:24:28
- What are you doing?
- I&#39;m still answering
these letters of condolence.

2033
01:24:28 --> 01:24:31
- Damn. Let &#39;em wait.
- No, no. Jack&#39;s right. It&#39;s my duty.

2034
01:24:31 --> 01:24:34
Oh, now it&#39;s Jack this,
Jack that.

2035
01:24:34 --> 01:24:36
Jack, let&#39;s take off.
It&#39;s been hell here. We need a holiday.

2036
01:24:36 --> 01:24:40
- Good idea.
- No. I&#39;m taking my seat
in the House of Lords.

2037
01:24:40 --> 01:24:41
A... What?

2038
01:24:41 --> 01:24:44
What, now?
So soon after your illness?

2039
01:24:44 --> 01:24:45
Well, I mean,
are you ready for them?

2040
01:24:45 --> 01:24:47
&lt;i&gt;Are they ready for me, madam?&lt;/i&gt;

2041
01:24:47 --> 01:24:49
We&#39;re going to work
as a team once I&#39;m elected.

2042
01:24:49 --> 01:24:51
Jack in the House of Lords,
me in the other place.

2043
01:24:51 --> 01:24:52
&lt;i&gt;We think alike
about a lot of things.&lt;/i&gt;

2044
01:24:52 --> 01:24:54
That&#39;s asking for trouble.

2045
01:24:54 --> 01:24:56
Fine spectacle he&#39;d make,
gibbering in the Upper House.

2046
01:24:56 --> 01:24:58
&lt;i&gt;You&#39;re so bloody tactful, Charles.&lt;/i&gt;

2047
01:24:58 --> 01:25:01
Look, ifJack thinks he&#39;s ready
for them, then I&#39;m with him all the way.

2048
01:25:01 --> 01:25:03
- Me too.
- It&#39;s out of the question!

2049
01:25:03 --> 01:25:05
Who asked you a question?

2050
01:25:05 --> 01:25:06
Did you ask him a question?

2051
01:25:06 --> 01:25:08
Nobody asked a question,
so I&#39;ll ask a question.

2052
01:25:08 --> 01:25:09
Who is the head
of the Gurney family?

2053
01:25:09 --> 01:25:11
Uh... you are, Jack.

2054
01:25:11 --> 01:25:14
Then don&#39;t let me hear you
answering unasked questions again!

2055
01:25:14 --> 01:25:16
Don&#39;t make a complete ass
of yourself, Father.

2056
01:25:16 --> 01:25:19
&lt;i&gt;From now on,
just shut up, Charles.&lt;/i&gt;

2057
01:25:19 --> 01:25:21
Your brain&#39;s silting, Charles.

2058
01:25:21 --> 01:25:24
- Don&#39;t talk to me like that!
- It&#39;s over, finished.

2059
01:25:24 --> 01:25:28
And stop sniggering, you young pup!

2060
01:25:28 --> 01:25:30
- I&#39;m not sniggering, Father.
- I know sniggering!

2061
01:25:30 --> 01:25:33
Oh, it&#39;ll happen to you one day.

2062
01:25:33 --> 01:25:37
Suddenly you&#39;ll be standing there and...
nobody&#39;s paying any attention to you.

2063
01:25:37 --> 01:25:39
You start coughing,
and your mouth goes dry.

2064
01:25:39 --> 01:25:41
Wipe watery, dribbles away.
It&#39;s hard!

2065
01:25:41 --> 01:25:44
Because inside you&#39;re still,
you&#39;re still 21!

2066
01:25:44 --> 01:25:46
But your feet go flop, flop, flop!

2067
01:25:46 --> 01:25:51
&lt;i&gt;Oh, it&#39;s hard. Inside, one&#39;s still 21.&lt;/i&gt;

2068
01:25:51 --> 01:25:53
There now, Father.
That&#39;s enough, that&#39;s enough.

2069
01:25:53 --> 01:25:57
You&#39;ve had a good innings, but it&#39;s
milk-rusks and beddy-byes for you now.

2070
01:25:57 --> 01:25:59
Oh.

2071
01:25:59 --> 01:26:01
You&#39;re more than just cured, Jack.

2072
01:26:01 --> 01:26:03
You&#39;ve got that something extra...

2073
01:26:03 --> 01:26:05
what we call star quality.

2074
01:26:05 --> 01:26:06
It will be a triumphant climax.

2075
01:26:06 --> 01:26:08
Talking of climaxes,

2076
01:26:08 --> 01:26:11
you were a lot more loving
when you were potty.

2077
01:26:11 --> 01:26:14
- Do you still love me, Jack?
- Of course I do, Annie.

2078
01:26:14 --> 01:26:17
Annie? Well, why Annie?

2079
01:26:17 --> 01:26:19
Annie, Elizabeth, Catherine,
Alice, Marie Kelly...

2080
01:26:19 --> 01:26:22
- Jack, you&#39;re not going off again...
- Oh, it&#39;s nothing, my dear.

2081
01:26:22 --> 01:26:24
I have a big day ahead of me.

2082
01:26:24 --> 01:26:25
I&#39;m speaking in the House of Lords.

2083
01:26:25 --> 01:26:27
Oh, don&#39;t worry.
It&#39;s only nerves.

2084
01:26:27 --> 01:26:30
- You&#39;ll kill &#39;em.
- In time.

2085
01:26:30 --> 01:26:32
Then you&#39;ll get around to me,
I hope.

2086
01:26:32 --> 01:26:33
Promise.

2087
01:26:33 --> 01:26:35
Oh, Jack.

2088
01:26:35 --> 01:26:37
Oh, you&#39;re so lovely when you smile.

2089
01:26:37 --> 01:26:38
Oh, Jack.

2090
01:26:38 --> 01:26:41
Must get my grunch thoughts
in order, pro and contra.

2091
01:26:41 --> 01:26:44
Well, don&#39;t worry.
You&#39;re one of them, only more so.

2092
01:26:44 --> 01:26:48
Just be your own sweet self,
and they&#39;ll adore you as I adore you.

2093
01:26:48 --> 01:26:51
- Jack.
- See if the car is ready.

2094
01:26:51 --> 01:26:52
Annie.

2095
01:26:52 --> 01:26:54
English pigs!
Arse lickers!

2096
01:26:54 --> 01:26:58
I&#39;ve done nothing!
I want justice!

2097
01:26:58 --> 01:27:02
I, Jack Arnold
Alexander Tancred,

2098
01:27:02 --> 01:27:04
Earl of Gurney,

2099
01:27:04 --> 01:27:06
do swear by Almighty God...

2100
01:27:06 --> 01:27:08
that I will be faithful
and bear true allegiance...

2101
01:27:08 --> 01:27:10
to Her Gracious Majesty,

2102
01:27:10 --> 01:27:14
her heirs and successors,
according to law,

2103
01:27:14 --> 01:27:15
so help me God.

2104
01:27:15 --> 01:27:17
My lords, my lords,

2105
01:27:17 --> 01:27:21
I wish to call attention to the grave
disquiet throughout the country...

2106
01:27:21 --> 01:27:24
- at the increase of immorality.
- Yes.

2107
01:27:24 --> 01:27:27
My lords, my lords,

2108
01:27:27 --> 01:27:29
I must support the noble lord.

2109
01:27:29 --> 01:27:31
For 13 years,
there has been no flogging,

2110
01:27:31 --> 01:27:36
no hanging and a steadily rising volume
of crime, lawlessness and thuggery.

2111
01:27:36 --> 01:27:40
&lt;i&gt;- I believe that the sissy
treatment of young thugs...&lt;/i&gt;

2112
01:27:40 --> 01:27:44
&lt;i&gt;- is utterly wrong!
- Hear! Hear!&lt;/i&gt;

2113
01:27:44 --> 01:27:47
&lt;i&gt;My lords, we must step up
the penalties...&lt;/i&gt;

2114
01:27:47 --> 01:27:50
by making hanging and flogging
the punishment for certain state crimes.

2115
01:27:50 --> 01:27:53
&lt;i&gt;The criminal must be treated
as an animal.&lt;/i&gt;

2116
01:27:53 --> 01:27:55
&lt;i&gt;Hear! Hear!&lt;/i&gt;

2117
01:27:55 --> 01:27:57
My lords,

2118
01:27:57 --> 01:27:59
I had doubts about speaking here.

2119
01:27:59 --> 01:28:01
But after what I&#39;ve heard,
I realize...

2120
01:28:01 --> 01:28:03
this is where I belong!

2121
01:28:03 --> 01:28:06
My lords, these are grave times,
killing times.

2122
01:28:06 --> 01:28:08
Stars collapse,
universes shrink daily,

2123
01:28:08 --> 01:28:12
but the natural order is still
crime, guilt, punishment!

2124
01:28:12 --> 01:28:15
There&#39;s no love without fear!

2125
01:28:15 --> 01:28:20
By His hand,
sword, pike and grappling-hook,

2126
01:28:20 --> 01:28:23
God, the crowbar of the world,

2127
01:28:23 --> 01:28:27
flays, stabs,
bludgeons, mutilates...

2128
01:28:27 --> 01:28:29
just as I was...

2129
01:28:29 --> 01:28:32
If... B-B-B...

2130
01:28:32 --> 01:28:36
You... have... forgotten...

2131
01:28:36 --> 01:28:39
how to punish, my noble lords.

2132
01:28:39 --> 01:28:42
&lt;i&gt;The strong must manipulate the weak!&lt;/i&gt;

2133
01:28:42 --> 01:28:44
That&#39;s the first law of the universe.

2134
01:28:44 --> 01:28:49
The hard survive, the soft
quickly turn to corruption.

2135
01:28:49 --> 01:28:52
This is a call to greatness!

2136
01:28:52 --> 01:28:55
Approach this day out to battle
against your enemies.

2137
01:28:55 --> 01:28:58
&lt;i&gt;Let not your hearts faint,&lt;/i&gt;

2138
01:28:58 --> 01:29:00
&lt;i&gt;fear not and do not tremble,&lt;/i&gt;

2139
01:29:00 --> 01:29:01
&lt;i&gt;neither be ye terrified
because of them.&lt;/i&gt;

2140
01:29:01 --> 01:29:04
For the Lord your God
is He that goeth with you...

2141
01:29:04 --> 01:29:06
to fight for you against
your enemies to save you.

2142
01:29:06 --> 01:29:11
And mine eyes shall not spare,
neither will I have pity.

2143
01:29:11 --> 01:29:14
&lt;i&gt;I will recompense them
according to their ways...&lt;/i&gt;

2144
01:29:14 --> 01:29:16
&lt;i&gt;and their abominations
that are in the midst of them.&lt;/i&gt;

2145
01:29:16 --> 01:29:20
And they shall know that
I am the lord that smiteth!

2146
01:29:20 --> 01:29:22
&lt;i&gt;You&#39;re one of us at last!&lt;/i&gt;

2147
01:29:22 --> 01:29:23
Well done, Jack!

2148
01:29:23 --> 01:29:26
# Onward Christian soldiers #

2149
01:29:26 --> 01:29:29
# Marching as to war #

2150
01:29:29 --> 01:29:33
#With the cross ofJesus #

2151

2153
01:29:40 --> 01:29:43
# Leads against the foe #

2154
01:29:43 --> 01:29:46
# Forward into battle #

2155
01:29:46 --> 01:29:50
# See His banners go #

2156
01:29:50 --> 01:29:54
# Onward Christian soldiers #

2157
01:29:54 --> 01:29:57
# Marching as to war #

2158
01:29:57 --> 01:30:01
#With the cross ofJesus #

2159
01:30:01 --> 01:30:07
# Going on before ##

2160
01:30:07 --> 01:30:11
# Rainbow in the sky #

2161
01:30:11 --> 01:30:13
#The sunshine in my eyes #

2162
01:30:13 --> 01:30:16
#You&#39;re everything to me #

2163
01:30:16 --> 01:30:19
# Oh, myJack #

2164
01:30:19 --> 01:30:22
#The silver running stream #

2165
01:30:22 --> 01:30:24
#The lazy summer dream #

2166
01:30:24 --> 01:30:27
#You&#39;re everything to me #

2167
01:30:27 --> 01:30:31
# Oh, myJack #

2168
01:30:31 --> 01:30:35
#You&#39;re my world, you&#39;re my life
You&#39;re my dream come tru... ##

2169
01:30:35 --> 01:30:38
&lt;i&gt;I&#39;m Jack!&lt;/i&gt;

2170
01:30:38 --> 01:30:39
&lt;i&gt;I&#39;m Jack!&lt;/i&gt;

2171
01:30:39 --> 01:30:40
&lt;i&gt;I&#39;m Jack!&lt;/i&gt;

2172
01:30:40 --> 01:30:42
&lt;i&gt;#Hey, down on your heels
Up on your toes #&lt;/i&gt;

2173
01:30:42 --> 01:30:44
&lt;i&gt;#See how it feels
See how it goes #&lt;/i&gt;

2174
01:30:44 --> 01:30:46
&lt;i&gt;#Everybody do the varsity #&lt;/i&gt;

2175
01:30:46 --> 01:30:48
&lt;i&gt;#Everybody do the varsity #&lt;/i&gt;

2176
01:30:48 --> 01:30:50
&lt;i&gt;#Everybody do the varsity #&lt;/i&gt;

2177
01:30:50 --> 01:30:51
&lt;i&gt;#Drag ##&lt;/i&gt;

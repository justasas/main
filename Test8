00:00:00 --> 00:00:01
Welcome Everyone!

3
00:00:01 --> 00:00:04
In 1990, Madras... that is
Chennai Vyasarpadi

4
00:00:04 --> 00:00:08
Krishnapa Naicker was a wealthy
well wisher of that place

5
00:00:08 --> 00:00:13
His friend Karunakaran, both were strong
personalities in a political party

6
00:00:13 --> 00:00:14
They ruled over this area

7
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
Due to unforeseen issues their
political party got dissolved

8
00:00:16 --> 00:00:19
The inseparables had to part ways and
took their responsibilities accordingly

9
00:00:19 --> 00:00:21
Which lead to enmity between them

10
00:00:21 --> 00:00:25
The areas shared by them
were divided using their power

11
00:00:25 --> 00:00:27
They divided everything amicably

12
00:00:27 --> 00:00:30
Except this wall which is an Integral
part of the housing board

13
00:00:30 --> 00:00:35
There were issues on who will get it
to promote their parties.

14
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
Only if our poster is displayed on that
wall, It&#39;ll be like our kingdom.

15
00:00:37 --> 00:00:38
We should not let go of that wall!

16
00:00:38 --> 00:00:39
Don&#39;t worry about that

17
00:00:39 --> 00:00:42
We should not let go of the wall,
If we do, we can&#39;t face anyone

18
00:00:42 --> 00:00:46
Meanwhile Krishnapa begins work
to paint a poster on the wall

19
00:00:46 --> 00:00:47
We are scared of everything

20
00:00:47 --> 00:00:49
Where were we and
look where we are now

21
00:00:49 --> 00:00:51
It&#39;s like a dungeon, no
place to even stretch our legs

22
00:00:51 --> 00:00:52
Hey why are we talking now?

23
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
When we 3 are here, did
they bother to ask us?

24
00:00:55 --> 00:00:57
Earlier we were together, now
we have our own party

25
00:00:57 --> 00:01:00
It&#39;s not like that, if they get to
do it, we will go powerless

26
00:01:00 --> 00:01:02
...all because of arrogance, they do this.

27
00:01:02 --> 00:01:03
Why can&#39;t we? Are we cowards?

28
00:01:03 --> 00:01:07
Karunakaran provoked the housing board
people, who chased Krishnapa people away!

29
00:01:07 --> 00:01:08
Everybody has become
impudent now?

30
00:01:08 --> 00:01:10
You were lying homeless on the road

31
00:01:10 --> 00:01:12
Now that you have shelter,
are you rising up against me?

32
00:01:12 --> 00:01:13
Whose wall do you think it is?

33
00:01:13 --> 00:01:14
It belongs to the Government

34
00:01:14 --> 00:01:15
Filing a petition would do..

35
00:01:15 --> 00:01:17
..You&#39;ve committed fraudulence to be here

36
00:01:17 --> 00:01:19
What nonsense is this, It has been
allotted to us by the Government.

37
00:01:19 --> 00:01:20
No one can touch the walls
without our knowledge

38
00:01:20 --> 00:01:21
You don&#39;t need us anymore?

39
00:01:21 --> 00:01:22
We need you, but not your party.

40
00:01:22 --> 00:01:23
Where will we paint our party&#39;s image?

41
00:01:23 --> 00:01:25
Is it fine, if we do the
same on your walls?

42
00:01:25 --> 00:01:27
I know who has provoked you people

43
00:01:27 --> 00:01:28
Why? Don&#39;t we have brains?

44
00:01:28 --> 00:01:31
See, the wall is ours
and we can&#39;t let that go..

45
00:01:31 --> 00:01:32
Do what you can

46
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
The people who didn&#39;t dare
to speak against Krishnapa

47
00:01:34 --> 00:01:36
Spoke against him. Looking at
that, Krishnapa&#39;s son Kannan..

48
00:01:36 --> 00:01:38
Committed the first
murder for the wall

49
00:01:38 --> 00:01:40
Sangan died, which lead to huge riots.

50
00:01:40 --> 00:01:43
But the police arrested
people from housing board

51
00:01:43 --> 00:01:46
There was not a single man in the
area to help Sangan&#39;s funeral

52
00:01:46 --> 00:01:49
Exactly a year after Sangan&#39;s death,
Karunakaran who came there...

53
00:01:49 --> 00:01:51
..provoked Maanga there

54
00:01:51 --> 00:01:52
They Shouldn’t be..

55
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
Maanga slit Krishnapan&#39;s
throat in middle of the house

56
00:01:55 --> 00:02:00
One week later Kannan avenged his father&#39;s
murder by killing Maanga and his son

57
00:02:00 --> 00:02:02
Conspiring to kill Kannan,
one of his peeps got caught

58
00:02:02 --> 00:02:04
The murders continued
avenging each other

59
00:02:04 --> 00:02:06
The murders just kept piling up

60
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
Meanwhile Kannan became the North Chennai
District Secretary for his party

61
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
He spoke to a few in the area
and pacified them with money.

62
00:02:11 --> 00:02:14
For the first time without any opposition
he painted his father&#39;s image on the wall

63
00:02:14 --> 00:02:17
He got control over the wall

64
00:02:17 --> 00:02:18
Karunakaran couldn’t stop this

65
00:02:18 --> 00:02:20
Karunakaran passed away
in the sorrow of defeat

66
00:02:20 --> 00:02:23
After which his son Maari became the
leader of the housing board people

67
00:02:23 --> 00:02:24
Also took responsibility of the party

68
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
At the same time few unfortunate incidents
happen in front of that wall

69
00:02:26 --> 00:02:29
An old man came from no where collapsed
and fell dead in front of the wall

70
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
Two guys rammed their bike
in to the wall and died

71
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
A guy committed suicide
jumping off the wall

72
00:02:33 --> 00:02:35
Fearing these incidents, when
people consulted a holy man...

73
00:02:35 --> 00:02:37
It&#39;s waiting to take more people

74
00:02:37 --> 00:02:40
It&#39;s asking for blood,
blood sacrifice!

75
00:02:40 --> 00:02:44
Post which, everyone feared it to be a
soul sucking wall

76
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
Due to which a temple was
erected in front of the wall

77
00:02:46 --> 00:02:51
Kannan used this excuse to safeguard
his father&#39;s image on the wall

78
00:02:51 --> 00:02:55
On the other hand, Maari is waiting for
a chance to bring down that image

79
00:02:55 --> 00:02:56
This is how...

80
00:02:56 --> 00:02:59
Even in this generation the
fight for the wall continues...

81
00:02:59 --> 00:03:03
Madras

82
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
- Hey kiddo, what are you going to study?
- Collector!

83
00:03:05 --> 00:03:07
Collector uh?...What are you
going to do studying that?

84
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
- Good deeds for the society
- My son is great!

85
00:03:10 --> 00:03:14
Chennai! North Chennai!

86
00:03:14 --> 00:03:18
This land of black tamils

87
00:03:18 --> 00:03:25
Somebody making the tune, no
tune can shake our roots.

88
00:03:25 --> 00:03:29
Our land is Madras and
we’re its identity!

89
00:03:29 --> 00:03:33
Our land is Madras and
we’re its identity!

90
00:03:33 --> 00:03:35
Getting rid of atrocity from
politicians is freedom to our people

91
00:03:35 --> 00:03:36
I will definitely grab that right

92
00:03:36 --> 00:03:39
Police who never fears anyone,
Is feared of us... Why?...

93
00:03:39 --> 00:03:40
...Politics..Political power

94
00:03:40 --> 00:03:44
We enjoy every moment like a child
in the midst of our run for life

95
00:03:44 --> 00:03:48
We’re not a plant in solitude,
We&#39;re the wilds of unity

96
00:03:48 --> 00:03:52
Monuments of Madras is built not with brick
and stone, but with our blood and emotions

97
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
If you try to silent us, we’ll make
noises that the world will hear

98
00:03:56 --> 00:03:59
We’ll be the tool to break sorrows

99
00:03:59 --> 00:04:03
We’ll fly through the sky

100
00:04:03 --> 00:04:07
We’ll be the tool to break sorrows

101
00:04:07 --> 00:04:11
We’ll fly through the sky

102
00:04:11 --> 00:04:12
I wish to be a huge terror

103
00:04:12 --> 00:04:14
Looking at me, everyone should
tremble, I should be everything

104
00:04:14 --> 00:04:18
Our land is Madras
We’re its identity

105
00:04:18 --> 00:04:22
Our land is Madras
We’re its identity

106
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
Took the dagger and stabbed right through
him, intestines were out.It was a blood bath

107
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
Someone pierced me with a pin,
searched everyone in surrounding

108
00:04:28 --> 00:04:29
Our Saroja sister is witness to it

109
00:04:29 --> 00:04:30
Saroja sister..Police!
Saroja sister..Police!

110
00:04:30 --> 00:04:32
Took 500 bucks and bribed the policemen

111
00:04:32 --> 00:04:33
He wrote a report stating
that it&#39;s cow&#39;s blood

112
00:04:33 --> 00:04:37
When the girl blushes away when proposed
It&#39;s all for the celebration of love

113
00:04:37 --> 00:04:41
Football, Carom, Boxing, Kabadi
are games that showcase our courage

114
00:04:41 --> 00:04:45
We stay amidst the sounds of
Chennai that has become our music

115
00:04:45 --> 00:04:49
Paste posters, gather crowd and be
left with nothing is our culture

116
00:04:49 --> 00:04:52
The night will see the light for
the ones who are dedicated

117
00:04:52 --> 00:04:56
Be awake and aware, for
that day is not too far

118
00:04:56 --> 00:05:00
The night will see the light for
the ones who are dedicated

119
00:05:00 --> 00:05:03
Be awake and aware, for
that day is not too far

120
00:05:03 --> 00:05:04
Life is short dude,

121
00:05:04 --> 00:05:07
Enjoy every day, every moment.
Life is just about that.

122
00:05:07 --> 00:05:11
Our land is Madras
We’re its identity

123
00:05:11 --> 00:05:17
Chennai!
North Chennai!

124
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
This dominant Tamil land

125
00:05:19 --> 00:05:25
Somebody makes a tune. No
tunes can shake our root!

126
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
Why do you keep staring at the wall,
Aren&#39;t there any other issues in our area?

127
00:05:27 --> 00:05:29
People have been struggling without
water since 3 days, check that

128
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
Dude that&#39;s been taken care
of, will be done by evening

129
00:05:31 --> 00:05:32
That&#39;s like a secretary

130
00:05:32 --> 00:05:34
- We should be the one to grab this wall
- We&#39;ll

131
00:05:34 --> 00:05:36
What are you staring at?

132
00:05:36 --> 00:05:37
What&#39;s a match without a scuffle

133
00:05:37 --> 00:05:39
Let it go Viji, don&#39;t get worked up

134
00:05:39 --> 00:05:41
Scuffle during games are common, and
that too you were the one who bumped

135
00:05:41 --> 00:05:42
You&#39;ve lost, so try winning for a change

136
00:05:42 --> 00:05:42
Who do you think you&#39;re talking to?

137
00:05:42 --> 00:05:43
- Hey why are you creating a ruckus
- Keep Calm dude

138
00:05:43 --> 00:05:45
- What will you do?
- I will hack you right here

139
00:05:45 --> 00:05:47
Hey Bommai, give that dagger
to Viji, let him use that

140
00:05:47 --> 00:05:48
We will watch him with our hands folded

141
00:05:48 --> 00:05:50
Hey give that to him.
Sit down Perumal

142
00:05:50 --> 00:05:51
- How&#39;s your father?
- He&#39;s fine Maari

143
00:05:51 --> 00:05:54
Even for the petty matters,
these days they slit throats

144
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
If it&#39;s someone from a
different area it&#39;s fine

145
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
All of them are from our
area and our guys

146
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
What do you say? I&#39;m trying
to resolve this by talking

147
00:05:59 --> 00:06:01
No Maari, Viji is got a
reputation in that area

148
00:06:01 --> 00:06:04
If we leave this because he&#39;s with Anbu,
someone else will rise again just like him

149
00:06:04 --> 00:06:06
There are many who disappeared
without any trace in our area

150
00:06:06 --> 00:06:07
Ask them to be little careful

151
00:06:07 --> 00:06:09
Bro why are you talking unnecessarily

152
00:06:09 --> 00:06:10
I know how to handle
this, come on bro

153
00:06:10 --> 00:06:13
Stop right there. Do you think they are
offering porridge from Maariamman temple?

154
00:06:13 --> 00:06:14
You keep walking like that

155
00:06:14 --> 00:06:15
What do you think of these people?

156
00:06:15 --> 00:06:16
Hey Johnny, can&#39;t you be quiet?

157
00:06:16 --> 00:06:17
- Ask him to leave
- Johnny please leave from here

158
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
Look here Maari, let&#39;s end this here.
That too only for you.

159
00:06:20 --> 00:06:22
My guys won&#39;t create
problems hereafter

160
00:06:22 --> 00:06:25
If you&#39;re guys create a problem,
then no matter who supports them,

161
00:06:25 --> 00:06:26
I know how to handle it

162
00:06:26 --> 00:06:27
Hey, come let&#39;s go!

163
00:06:27 --> 00:06:30
Hey wait, why are you walking off
in middle of the conversation?

164
00:06:30 --> 00:06:33
I&#39;m done talking. All this is happening
because you are there for them.

165
00:06:33 --> 00:06:34
One day, he will be a problem for you

166
00:06:34 --> 00:06:36
You won&#39;t know when and where
you&#39;ll get in to trouble

167
00:06:36 --> 00:06:39
I&#39;ll take care of it Perumal,
He&#39;s not Viji... He&#39;s Anbu

168
00:06:39 --> 00:06:39
He&#39;s like a son to me

169
00:06:39 --> 00:06:40
Hey Kaali, you heard what he said right?

170
00:06:40 --> 00:06:43
If you try to start any more problems...
are you trying to become a rowdy?

171
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
You&#39;re well educated and in a good
job, why do you need all this?

172
00:06:45 --> 00:06:47
- That&#39;s it
- No bro, it was him not me

173
00:06:47 --> 00:06:48
Keep calm, Bro is talking right

174
00:06:48 --> 00:06:49
Hey Kaali, enjoy your life

175
00:06:49 --> 00:06:50
Get married and settle in life

176
00:06:50 --> 00:06:52
Have kids, one is not enough

177
00:06:52 --> 00:06:52
Have more than one

178
00:06:52 --> 00:06:54
Though we are not financially strong,
Why do you think they fear us?

179
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
It&#39;s only because of our men behind us,

180
00:06:58 --> 00:06:58
- Anbu
- Bro

181
00:06:58 --> 00:06:59
- Are you angry?
- No bro, nothing like that

182
00:06:59 --> 00:07:00
Should&#39;ve broken his bones

183
00:07:00 --> 00:07:03
With that anger would have bumped him
right there, because of me he survived

184
00:07:03 --> 00:07:04
Hey, don&#39;t make them wise like this

185
00:07:04 --> 00:07:05
They live at Kannan&#39;s mercy

186
00:07:05 --> 00:07:06
- Sit down Viji
- It&#39;s ok bro

187
00:07:06 --> 00:07:07
Sit down Viji, mom serve him food

188
00:07:07 --> 00:07:08
Why is the child crying?

189
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
Everything will happen in
this house while having food

190
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
- Hey sit down
- It&#39;s ok bro, I ate already

191
00:07:12 --> 00:07:13
What does Maari has to say?

192
00:07:13 --> 00:07:15
What will he say?
I&#39;ve warned him

193
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
Only because of him Anbu is so gutsy

194
00:07:17 --> 00:07:17
Get a toothpick

195
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
How many times do I have to tell you
to keep it ready while having meat?

196
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
Let him be, how long do you think
a fish will last in a bowl

197
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
Wait Viji, our time will come,
We can then show them who we are

198
00:07:26 --> 00:07:30
What time does he have, I thought of
finishing him, but you ..

199
00:07:30 --> 00:07:31
If you do something

200
00:07:31 --> 00:07:32
It should be talk of the town

201
00:07:32 --> 00:07:33
Only then we will be known

202
00:07:33 --> 00:07:34
If you finish him for this...

203
00:07:34 --> 00:07:37
...No one will fear you,
they will only spit on you

204
00:07:37 --> 00:07:38
Be with brother

205
00:07:38 --> 00:07:39
What is it dude, Viji is giving me a look?

206
00:07:39 --> 00:07:42
He&#39;s nothing to you, don&#39;t
waste your time on this

207
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
Why are you getting angry for
petty stuff, control you anger

208
00:07:44 --> 00:07:46
What can I do... couldn&#39;t control it!

209
00:07:46 --> 00:07:48
All this will be in control
when you have a wife

210
00:07:48 --> 00:07:50
As if it will be... It&#39;s
all an act, mere act

211
00:07:50 --> 00:07:52
- Dude Shall I leave?
- Wait, what&#39;s the hurry

212
00:07:52 --> 00:07:54
- She&#39;s smitten by all this act
- As if I&#39;m smitten

213
00:07:54 --> 00:07:55
Hey, don&#39;t provoke me

214
00:07:55 --> 00:07:57
Hey, don&#39;t talk too much,
have you made food?

215
00:07:57 --> 00:07:58
Both of us are hungry, serve us!

216
00:07:58 --> 00:08:01
- It&#39;s ok, I will have at home -Hey,
wait have and leave don&#39;t make a fuss

217
00:08:01 --> 00:08:04
Hey, I&#39;ve been talking to you,
can&#39;t you hear us get us food

218
00:08:04 --> 00:08:05
- Why are shouting at her?
- Just like that

219
00:08:05 --> 00:08:05
You just watch now

220
00:08:05 --> 00:08:05
Hey, Don&#39;t!

221
00:08:05 --> 00:08:06
Hey, I&#39;m gonna give you a strong one

222
00:08:06 --> 00:08:09
I didn&#39;t do it on purpose,
it slipped from my hand

223
00:08:09 --> 00:08:12
Hey come on silly,
did you get scared?

224
00:08:12 --> 00:08:15
- How is the girl? do you like her?
- Yes

225
00:08:15 --> 00:08:18
She&#39;s well educated and will
earn well if she goes to a job

226
00:08:18 --> 00:08:20
I am fine if she takes care of my mother

227
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
I have a feeling that this
time it&#39;ll work

228
00:08:22 --> 00:08:26
That&#39;s right, compared to previous
ones, she&#39;s dark and beautiful

229
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
Even though she&#39;s dark, she&#39;s charming!

230
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
If she&#39;s charming, you get married to her,
why are you pulling my son in to this?

231
00:08:31 --> 00:08:33
I conceived him with the blessings of
Goddess Kaali

232
00:08:33 --> 00:08:34
My son, deserves better than her

233
00:08:34 --> 00:08:36
For my son&#39;s personality
and the knowledge he has

234
00:08:36 --> 00:08:38
Not only in this town, will find
a girl out of this world for him

235
00:08:38 --> 00:08:40
If not, I&#39;m not born of my father!

236
00:08:40 --> 00:08:42
Even I want a girl like a
princess, Just for that...

237
00:08:42 --> 00:08:44
Look at her eyes they are squint

238
00:08:44 --> 00:08:45
Look at her nose, it&#39;s disgusting

239
00:08:45 --> 00:08:46
- She&#39;s so damn fair
- What?

240
00:08:46 --> 00:08:47
She&#39;s toothless!

241
00:08:47 --> 00:08:48
She&#39;ll create confusion!

242
00:08:48 --> 00:08:49
She&#39;s got a dry face

243
00:08:49 --> 00:08:51
You can find mistakes,
last week we saw a girl...

244
00:08:51 --> 00:08:51
...you know what she said?

245
00:08:51 --> 00:08:54
What kind of a smile is that?..Being
a girl can&#39;t she smile with glee?

246
00:08:54 --> 00:08:56
You tell me Johnny,
what&#39;s there in a smile?

247
00:08:56 --> 00:08:58
Love marriage is best for you

248
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
-  That day....!?!?
- You&#39;re a waste

249
00:09:00 --> 00:09:03
I can&#39;t even talk to girls, How can
I make them fall for me?

250
00:09:03 --> 00:09:06
I don&#39;t have a choice but to depend
on my mother to choose a girl for me

251
00:09:06 --> 00:09:06
Waiting for that

252
00:09:06 --> 00:09:07
Hey, What the hell are
you talking about?

253
00:09:07 --> 00:09:08
She is the girl I chose for my son...

254
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
Who did you choose? What
makes her so special?

255
00:09:10 --> 00:09:11
She doesn&#39;t have any siblings

256
00:09:11 --> 00:09:12
What if she has any sibling?

257
00:09:12 --> 00:09:14
When they have children
and if they need anything

258
00:09:14 --> 00:09:15
...their aunt and uncles are
the ones who will take care

259
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
I can&#39;t let my grand
children being abandoned

260
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
Mom, why do you always keep finding faults?

261
00:09:19 --> 00:09:21
Instead of finding whether the
girl is suitable for your son

262
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
If you keep doing like this, one day I&#39;ll
become a saint.

263
00:09:23 --> 00:09:26
Go ahead, Do you think this earth will stop
spinning if you become a saint?

264
00:09:26 --> 00:09:28
You can&#39;t even manage to buy
me a car... and you&#39;re talking!

265
00:09:28 --> 00:09:29
Did you hear that?

266
00:09:29 --> 00:09:32
- So you&#39;re worried only about the car?
- Hey, don&#39;t get me started

267
00:09:32 --> 00:09:33
For my son&#39;s qualification,
the less fortunate people..

268
00:09:33 --> 00:09:35
...are ready to offer
car and bike as dowry

269
00:09:35 --> 00:09:37
He says that he will offer the same
as he did for his other daughters

270
00:09:37 --> 00:09:38
We don&#39;t need her in our house

271
00:09:38 --> 00:09:39
I don&#39;t know who is gonna
come to this house

272
00:09:39 --> 00:09:42
I promise, I&#39;ll never
find a girl with you here

273
00:09:42 --> 00:09:43
That&#39;s right, It will
take long for me to die

274
00:09:43 --> 00:09:44
Why don&#39;t you kill me then

275
00:09:44 --> 00:09:45
Won&#39;t a mother want her
child to be prosperous?

276
00:09:45 --> 00:09:46
Your birth was a boon to me

277
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
Is it wrong, to expect good for you?

278
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
Am I going to use that car?
You&#39;ll be the one using it..

279
00:09:49 --> 00:09:51
Why are you creating a scene? One day
he&#39;s going to elope

280
00:09:51 --> 00:09:52
with someone, only then
you&#39;re gonna calm down

281
00:09:52 --> 00:09:53
Ah..as if he&#39;s going to elope

282
00:09:53 --> 00:09:54
If he does, only my broom
will talk to him..

283
00:09:54 --> 00:09:55
Grandson, give me some money!

284
00:09:55 --> 00:09:56
Granny, I&#39;m going to kill you first

285
00:09:56 --> 00:09:58
My grandson is not giving me money
for betel leaves because of you.

286
00:09:58 --> 00:09:59
I want to have tea, lend me 10 bucks

287
00:09:59 --> 00:10:00
Johnny bro, I have no money..

288
00:10:00 --> 00:10:02
...but I&#39;ve got a dagger, double
pointed like manali snake

289
00:10:02 --> 00:10:03
Is it? Show me

290
00:10:03 --> 00:10:05
- What&#39;s your colour?
- It&#39;s black

291
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
If only you have that in parrot
green, the value will be higher

292
00:10:08 --> 00:10:10
You didn’t get that, Shall I explain
in Tamil?..the way parrot chirps..

293
00:10:10 --> 00:10:12
...and If you have a snake along
with it, It&#39;s worth 2 crores!

294
00:10:12 --> 00:10:12
That&#39;s Johnny to you

295
00:10:12 --> 00:10:17
What do you think of me?...there&#39;s only
one Johnny in the whole of India!

296
00:10:17 --> 00:10:19
You guys don&#39;t know his fame

297
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
There was a time, when
everybody was afraid of him

298
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
Just a small dagger, will
finish his work in a jiffy

299
00:10:23 --> 00:10:24
Police torture changed him

300
00:10:24 --> 00:10:26
No one here can speak English like him

301
00:10:26 --> 00:10:27
Watch what you say

302
00:10:27 --> 00:10:28
Brother leave that, look at him

303
00:10:28 --> 00:10:30
Why are you so upset?..will take care of it

304
00:10:30 --> 00:10:31
How long are you planning to bear this?

305
00:10:31 --> 00:10:34
Then your kids are going
to call you grandfather!

306
00:10:34 --> 00:10:35
Hey you&#39;re going to get from me

307
00:10:35 --> 00:10:36
Stop it, our dude is upset.

308
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
There are so many girls at your
work, don&#39;t you even like one?

309
00:10:39 --> 00:10:42
They won&#39;t suit me, all are made up
beauties. I don&#39;t even bother to look at

310
00:10:42 --> 00:10:44
Dude, then check her out.
If she&#39;s fine.

311
00:10:44 --> 00:10:45
Hey, the one with
the pink colour bag

312
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
Look she&#39;s coming, as far as I know
she has turned down 4 until now

313
00:10:48 --> 00:10:50
It didn&#39;t work out, she&#39;s hot!

314
00:10:50 --> 00:10:52
Dude, she&#39;s the daughter of that
politician staying behind your house

315
00:10:52 --> 00:10:55
Hey she&#39;s that politician&#39;s daughter,
she comes daily to get water.

316
00:10:55 --> 00:10:56
Che... check your eyesight

317
00:10:56 --> 00:10:58
Hey, She&#39;s good looking.
what&#39;s wrong with her?

318
00:10:58 --> 00:11:00
She&#39;s not worth it, you guys
are praising her too much

319
00:11:00 --> 00:11:03
That&#39;s right, you conveniently
have a wife at home

320
00:11:03 --> 00:11:04
Others will be vague to you

321
00:11:04 --> 00:11:05
She&#39;s beautiful and you like her?

322
00:11:05 --> 00:11:07
Yup, are you going to
get me married to her

323
00:11:07 --> 00:11:09
Dude, she&#39;s from Viji&#39;s block

324
00:11:09 --> 00:11:11
So what, I&#39;m asking to get married

325
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
Hello, Kalaiarasi..I&#39;m talking to you!

326
00:11:13 --> 00:11:15
My bro Kaali is sincerely
in love with you

327
00:11:15 --> 00:11:16
He is determined to get married to you,

328
00:11:16 --> 00:11:17
He says he&#39;ll die without you.

329
00:11:17 --> 00:11:17
Gives us a wise reply

330
00:11:17 --> 00:11:18
Idiot do you have any sense?

331
00:11:18 --> 00:11:21
Son wake up, get water to take bath.
It&#39;s getting late

332
00:11:21 --> 00:11:23
Let me sleep, don&#39;t disturb
me so early in the morning.

333
00:11:23 --> 00:11:25
It&#39;s for you to take bath, don&#39;t create
a fuss as thought it is for me.

334
00:11:25 --> 00:11:28
It has become a habit,
have you ever woken up early?

335
00:11:28 --> 00:11:32
The alarm keeps ringing, If only it
had a mouth it will cry it&#39;s eyes out

336
00:11:32 --> 00:11:33
My wife would have done
this if I was married

337
00:11:33 --> 00:11:36
Lets see if its you or her
who is going to fetch water.

338
00:11:36 --> 00:11:37
I&#39;m gonna bite you one day, wait and see

339
00:11:37 --> 00:11:39
Dude, It&#39;s my girlfriend!

340
00:11:39 --> 00:11:39
Take that!

341
00:11:39 --> 00:11:42
- Just one, I&#39;ll fill it It&#39;s getting late
- You just came and you&#39;re barging in

342
00:11:42 --> 00:11:44
Isn&#39;t it getting late for us?
you are barging in just ike your mom

343
00:11:44 --> 00:11:45
Wait for sometime

344
00:11:45 --> 00:11:46
It&#39;s getting late sister

345
00:11:46 --> 00:11:48
Why don&#39;t you fill it up,
he&#39;s been pumping for long

346
00:11:48 --> 00:11:50
Hey, why are you leaving with half
filled pot?...get it filled

347
00:11:50 --> 00:11:51
That&#39;s ok, It&#39;s getting late

348
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
Can&#39;t they find a girl
and get him married?

349
00:11:53 --> 00:11:57
- He&#39;s struggling a lot -What can we
do, his mom is expecting a princess

350
00:11:57 --> 00:11:58
- When is that?
- Only when he&#39;s lost it

351
00:11:58 --> 00:12:00
I saw your crush, she&#39;s
cute, smart and beautiful

352
00:12:00 --> 00:12:02
But she went with a guy, who&#39;s that guy?
Is he her boyfriend?

353
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
Be careful, you just tell me,
will take his tongue out

354
00:12:04 --> 00:12:04
Hey Kalai!

355
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
- Hey Kalai, look here
- Dude, the college is on the other side

356
00:12:06 --> 00:12:08
What dude you seem early for work today?

357
00:12:08 --> 00:12:09
My manager will bug me if am late.

358
00:12:09 --> 00:12:11
Hey, is it your manager or your
girl friend who will bug you?

359
00:12:11 --> 00:12:13
You think I don&#39;t know?

360
00:12:13 --> 00:12:15
You go early morning
to fetch water

361
00:12:15 --> 00:12:17
Then follow her on bike

362
00:12:17 --> 00:12:18
Keep it going!

363
00:12:18 --> 00:12:19
- What are you up to?
- What do you mean?

364
00:12:19 --> 00:12:20
You think you can steal
her away so easily?

365
00:12:20 --> 00:12:23
It seems like she likes me, don&#39;t
spoil this by interfering

366
00:12:23 --> 00:12:26
Should have bumped you earlier. If
I hear anything more.

367
00:12:26 --> 00:12:26
Let&#39;s leave!

368
00:12:26 --> 00:12:29
Nothing happened, you sit dear. Wonder if
they are riding a bike or an aeroplane

369
00:12:29 --> 00:12:30
I heard you met with an
accident near the wall

370
00:12:30 --> 00:12:32
- An auto came in between
- That sinners wall won&#39;t back down

371
00:12:32 --> 00:12:34
Your mother was crying, why don&#39;t
you get blessed by the priest?

372
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
You don&#39;t know. If it&#39;s on
to you, will not spare you!

373
00:12:36 --> 00:12:37
Wonder how many lives
it&#39;s going to take?

374
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
- It seems like mother of ghost
- What is she doing here?

375
00:12:39 --> 00:12:39
Let&#39;s see!

376
00:12:39 --> 00:12:42
If the water tanker gets
here, the problem is solved

377
00:12:42 --> 00:12:43
Did you get hurt badly?

378
00:12:43 --> 00:12:44
Did you get hurt badly?

379
00:12:44 --> 00:12:45
Did you go to the hospital?

380
00:12:45 --> 00:12:48
- Nothing much, just got a bruise on
forehead -I saw you when you fell

381
00:12:48 --> 00:12:49
Can&#39;t you go carefully?

382
00:12:49 --> 00:12:50
I&#39;m sorry!

383
00:12:50 --> 00:12:51
It&#39;s my friends,

384
00:12:51 --> 00:12:54
I swear. They are lying.

385
00:12:54 --> 00:12:55
that I love you

386
00:12:55 --> 00:12:56
So, that&#39;s not true then?

387
00:12:56 --> 00:12:58
Dear? Superstar&#39;s
movie is a hit or a flop?

388
00:12:58 --> 00:13:01
- It&#39;s an utter flop
- Don&#39;t lie, It&#39;s super hit

389
00:13:01 --> 00:13:02
- Who told you that?
- I&#39;m saying

390
00:13:02 --> 00:13:03
Our Superstar&#39;s movie is always a hit

391
00:13:03 --> 00:13:05
So what if it&#39;s a hit? Is your
Superstar going to feed you?

392
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
Why so? Then why are you
here? Why should he feed me?

393
00:13:07 --> 00:13:10
Look at my Superstar, he&#39;s so super.
Feel like giving a kiss.

394
00:13:10 --> 00:13:13
- Hey, What are you doing?
- Kissing on Superstar&#39;s poster

395
00:13:13 --> 00:13:18
Don&#39;t you dare kiss him, when I&#39;m sitting
right here hale and healthy!

396
00:13:18 --> 00:13:20
If you&#39;re going to just sit,
then will have to kiss Superstar

397
00:13:20 --> 00:13:21
What did you say?

398
00:13:21 --> 00:13:23
Hey, don&#39;t come near
me, our son is watching

399
00:13:23 --> 00:13:24
Hey, who do you think
you&#39;re talking to?

400
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
Sounds like Kaali&#39;s bike, I&#39;ll
pretend to sleep, don&#39;t wake me up

401
00:13:26 --> 00:13:27
What&#39;s up Ronaldo?
didn&#39;t go to school?

402
00:13:27 --> 00:13:28
- Today holiday
- Holiday?

403
00:13:28 --> 00:13:30
- What&#39;s the holiday for, Mary? -There&#39;s
no holiday, haven&#39;t paid the fees yet

404
00:13:30 --> 00:13:33
He&#39;ll be the first one to print the party
posters Will pay the fees tomorrow

405
00:13:33 --> 00:13:34
Why is our leader still sleeping?

406
00:13:34 --> 00:13:34
Didn&#39;t go anywhere?

407
00:13:34 --> 00:13:35
What work does he have?

408
00:13:35 --> 00:13:36
He just came in the morning
and is sleeping since then

409
00:13:36 --> 00:13:37
He&#39;s got too much attitude

410
00:13:37 --> 00:13:38
Hey, you should have
beaten up your dad asking

411
00:13:38 --> 00:13:39
why he hasn&#39;t paid the fees.
Look he&#39;s sleeping.

412
00:13:39 --> 00:13:42
Dad&#39;s not sleeping, just now
mom and dad were kissing!

413
00:13:42 --> 00:13:45
- Look how he got us caught
- Started your romance early today?

414
00:13:45 --> 00:13:46
There is no specific time to romance

415
00:13:46 --> 00:13:48
You did beat me right?
Won&#39;t you let me be happy for a while

416
00:13:48 --> 00:13:50
Hey dude, that girl
spoke to me today

417
00:13:50 --> 00:13:51
Who is that brother?
What did it say?

418
00:13:51 --> 00:13:53
- That politicians daughter,
- Kalaiarasi? what did she say?

419
00:13:53 --> 00:13:55
I fell near the wall right?
first she enquired about that

420
00:13:55 --> 00:13:56
I was stunned!

421
00:13:56 --> 00:13:58
I apologised to her for that day

422
00:13:58 --> 00:14:00
To which she replied
&quot;That&#39;s not true then&quot;

423
00:14:00 --> 00:14:02
Did she say that? Which means she likes
you brother

424
00:14:02 --> 00:14:04
- What do you think? She
is in love with me?

425
00:14:04 --> 00:14:06
Keep asking all this to me!
If not why would she talk like that?

426
00:14:06 --> 00:14:08
- I&#39;m scared dude
- Why are you scared?

427
00:14:08 --> 00:14:11
Brother don&#39;t be scared, understand
her feelings and propose to her

428
00:14:11 --> 00:14:13
Look I liked his face at the first instance

429
00:14:13 --> 00:14:14
I kept waiting for him
to make the first move

430
00:14:14 --> 00:14:15
Married him,
the day he proposed

431
00:14:15 --> 00:14:18
You like her right, so go ahead.
Girls won&#39;t propose

432
00:14:18 --> 00:14:20
Hey, don&#39;t make any hasty decisions

433
00:14:20 --> 00:14:22
Think whether you need this or not.

434
00:14:22 --> 00:14:23
Think well dude!

435
00:14:23 --> 00:14:23
I&#39;m leaving dude

436
00:14:23 --> 00:14:25
- Why are you scaring him?
- I&#39;m not scaring him

437
00:14:25 --> 00:14:27
He has to like her, his
decision is important

438
00:14:27 --> 00:14:28
Now why are you coming closer?

439
00:14:28 --> 00:14:29
Ronaldo needs a sister, it seems

440
00:14:29 --> 00:14:31
I have decided.
I love Kalaiarasi

441
00:14:31 --> 00:14:33
I will get married only to her
I am leaving

442
00:14:33 --> 00:14:35
Sky is usually filled with sun and moon

443
00:14:35 --> 00:14:36
There&#39;s nothing there today

444
00:14:36 --> 00:14:37
It&#39;s filled with my &quot;Kalai&quot;

445
00:14:37 --> 00:14:37
Now listen to another one..

446
00:14:37 --> 00:14:39
Trees will have parrot and cuckoo..

447
00:14:39 --> 00:14:41
But now, it&#39;s Kalaiarasi all over

448
00:14:41 --> 00:14:42
Dude, you are amazing!

449
00:14:42 --> 00:14:44
- On the ground, you&#39;ll find dog and hen
- Dude please

450
00:14:44 --> 00:14:47
- Dude please spare me, don&#39;t torture me
- I&#39;m going to kick you

451
00:14:47 --> 00:14:49
Dude you keep going

452
00:14:49 --> 00:14:53
Dude, I was waiting near the water pump
to catch a glimpse of Kalaiarasi

453
00:14:53 --> 00:14:58
At that time, she seemed like
the angel they show in movies

454
00:14:58 --> 00:14:59
She was  beautiful

455
00:14:59 --> 00:15:04
The way she looked at me for a
second when she was leaving

456
00:15:04 --> 00:15:05
Felt so intense

457
00:15:05 --> 00:15:06
It was a great feeling

458
00:15:06 --> 00:15:07
Dude, Kalaiarasi is short tempered

459
00:15:07 --> 00:15:09
Guys have been trying to woo her
well before she reached puberty

460
00:15:09 --> 00:15:10
But she never fell for anyone

461
00:15:10 --> 00:15:10
Will break your jaw!

462
00:15:10 --> 00:15:11
- What?
- Nothing sister

463
00:15:11 --> 00:15:12
You were born without god&#39;s consent?

464
00:15:12 --> 00:15:13
For the International companies

465
00:15:13 --> 00:15:14
It&#39;s for those international companies

466
00:15:14 --> 00:15:15
Uninterrupted water service

467
00:15:15 --> 00:15:17
Her current one side lovers are...

468
00:15:17 --> 00:15:18
...Tailor Ganesh, supervisor Mohan

469
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
One last important thing, Nari Suresh
who hangs out with Viji all the time

470
00:15:20 --> 00:15:21
Tight competition dude!

471
00:15:21 --> 00:15:22
They keep following,
don&#39;t you get annoyed?

472
00:15:22 --> 00:15:24
They see what they
like. They have freedom

473
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
If I look, they
won&#39;t even face me

474
00:15:26 --> 00:15:27
As far as they don&#39;t
disturb me, it&#39;s fine

475
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
If the girl is fine with it,
we can take care of anyone

476
00:15:29 --> 00:15:31
First we have to get rid of the girls
roaming behind her

477
00:15:31 --> 00:15:32
Brother, there are
no issues anymore

478
00:15:32 --> 00:15:34
Now we have to change Kalaiarasi&#39;s
liking towards you as love.

479
00:15:34 --> 00:15:36
Very Important thing
in love is field work

480
00:15:36 --> 00:15:39
No matter how busy you are, your
priority should always be Kalaiarasi

481
00:15:39 --> 00:15:41
Scoundrels of that sort should
be pulled off by their roots

482
00:15:41 --> 00:15:42
He might be present
in our gathering

483
00:15:42 --> 00:15:45
He might also be holding on
to our party&#39;s blue flag

484
00:15:45 --> 00:15:48
- Hello... Hi... how are you?
- Damn. he is a headache!

485
00:15:48 --> 00:15:49
Hey... Hey... I&#39;m talking to you

486
00:15:49 --> 00:15:52
Poor thing, he&#39;s been waiting
for you since morning

487
00:15:52 --> 00:15:53
Why can&#39;t just give him a glance

488
00:15:53 --> 00:15:55
Is it fine now?
Now, get lost!

489
00:15:55 --> 00:15:57
I haven&#39;t done any business
since morning, just now...

490
00:15:57 --> 00:15:58
Hey, do you love Kaali?

491
00:15:58 --> 00:15:59
If you say, they&#39;ll
hit anyone they like?

492
00:15:59 --> 00:16:01
- Look how they have beaten them up
- As if she&#39;s an angel

493
00:16:01 --> 00:16:02
Warn him, or else he&#39;ll be done!

494
00:16:02 --> 00:16:04
- Do you know how much it hurts?
- Let it go dude

495
00:16:04 --> 00:16:05
They broke my nose dude

496
00:16:05 --> 00:16:07
Why are you getting worked up
for all this? Calm down

497
00:16:07 --> 00:16:08
Why are you doing this?

498
00:16:08 --> 00:16:09
What do you think of me?

499
00:16:09 --> 00:16:10
Are you a big rowdy?

500
00:16:10 --> 00:16:11
Will you beat up all those who follow me?

501
00:16:11 --> 00:16:13
You&#39;ve been telling everyone
that I&#39;m in love with you

502
00:16:13 --> 00:16:14
Don&#39;t do unnecessary things

503
00:16:14 --> 00:16:15
Did I ever say that I love you?

504
00:16:15 --> 00:16:16
You said you&#39;re not
like that the other day

505
00:16:16 --> 00:16:17
It&#39;s embarrassing!

506
00:16:17 --> 00:16:19
Wherever I go on the street,
they call me by your name

507
00:16:19 --> 00:16:20
And yesterday,
Viji threatened me

508
00:16:20 --> 00:16:21
What do you think of yourself?

509
00:16:21 --> 00:16:23
You think, I&#39;ll fall in love
if you keep following me

510
00:16:23 --> 00:16:25
I swear, I don&#39;t like you at all

511
00:16:25 --> 00:16:26
Get lost and do something useful

512
00:16:26 --> 00:16:29
What brother, looks like my idea
has worked out.

513
00:16:29 --> 00:16:30
Come on, I deserve a treat

514
00:16:30 --> 00:16:31
You guys carry on,
I&#39;ll be back

515
00:16:31 --> 00:16:33
Whats up dude? why
are you upset?

516
00:16:33 --> 00:16:34
Nope, I&#39;m not upset

517
00:16:34 --> 00:16:36
Are you drunk?

518
00:16:36 --> 00:16:38
Hey guys he&#39;s drunk!

519
00:16:38 --> 00:16:40
- Hey... come on blow..blow?
- Get lost!

520
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
- He&#39;s drunk way too much..it stinks
- Dude, be careful!

521
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
What&#39;s wrong with you?...You
went to booze all alone without us.

522
00:16:45 --> 00:16:45
Why don&#39;t you shut up

523
00:16:45 --> 00:16:46
Hey Kaali!...Hey!

524
00:16:46 --> 00:16:48
- Hey dude what is it?
- Dude he&#39;s crying!

525
00:16:48 --> 00:16:51
- What&#39;s it dude?
- Dude you know Kalaiarasi right?...

526
00:16:51 --> 00:16:53
...She doesn&#39;t like me it seems

527
00:16:53 --> 00:16:58
Checking her out, following her.
She doesn&#39;t like any of it

528
00:16:58 --> 00:17:00
Dude, thats how it is in the beginning

529
00:17:00 --> 00:17:02
Later you&#39;ll see.. she&#39;ll come
around and propose to you

530
00:17:02 --> 00:17:05
No dude, she was rude to me

531
00:17:05 --> 00:17:06
- Dude are you serious?
- Yes I&#39;m

532
00:17:06 --> 00:17:09
When she spoke to me, there
were small kids around

533
00:17:09 --> 00:17:11
- It was so embarrassing!
- Let it go!

534
00:17:11 --> 00:17:13
I don&#39;t want to be in
this world anymore

535
00:17:13 --> 00:17:16
- I&#39;ll commit suicide
- Really?...Go..Go die.

536
00:17:16 --> 00:17:17
Bloody fool!

537
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
I&#39;m going to die for sure

538
00:17:19 --> 00:17:21
Hey Kaali..stop
dude... don&#39;t be crazy!

539
00:17:21 --> 00:17:24
- Hey get down
- You&#39;re the one who asked me to die

540
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
You&#39;ve been acting like a fool,
I&#39;m gonna kill you myself

541
00:17:26 --> 00:17:29
Hit me dude..hit me,
and kill me after that

542
00:17:29 --> 00:17:30
She&#39;s the one who
came and spoke to me

543
00:17:30 --> 00:17:33
&quot;That&#39;s not true then&quot;...&quot;That&#39;s not
true then&quot;...she stressed on that

544
00:17:33 --> 00:17:34
So it&#39;s not love then?

545
00:17:34 --> 00:17:36
But my sister Mary,
said that it was love

546
00:17:36 --> 00:17:41
- It&#39;s ok dude -Now I&#39;m a rowdy, scoundrel
and she doesn&#39;t like me

547
00:17:41 --> 00:17:45
- I&#39;m a scoundrel dude
- Kaali, why are you acting like a kid

548
00:17:45 --> 00:17:47
- Kaali people are watching, let it go
- Who&#39;s watching?

549
00:17:47 --> 00:17:49
Hey!..No one is looking,
let&#39;s leave come on

550
00:17:49 --> 00:17:52
- Is there a scene going on here?
- Hey... dude what are you doing?

551
00:17:52 --> 00:17:53
- What is it?
- Why is he acting like this?

552
00:17:53 --> 00:17:55
I&#39;ve been sulking on my failure
and you have 3 girl friends

553
00:17:55 --> 00:17:55
Kaali don&#39;t be stupid

554
00:17:55 --> 00:17:56
What? Do you think of yourself as a hero?

555
00:17:56 --> 00:17:59
If anyone falls in love here,
I&#39;ll break their bones

556
00:17:59 --> 00:18:01
I don&#39;t need her

557
00:18:01 --> 00:18:04
You are my love
- Come lets leave

558
00:18:04 --> 00:18:05
My sister Mary

559
00:18:05 --> 00:18:07
Ronaldo is my son-in-law!

560
00:18:07 --> 00:18:08
I give you my word...

561
00:18:08 --> 00:18:11
- If I&#39;ve a daughter, I&#39;ll get her married
to your son -That&#39;s ok, let&#39;s leave

562
00:18:11 --> 00:18:13
He&#39;s way too high!..that&#39;s why

563
00:18:13 --> 00:18:14
She&#39;s said it&#39;s not going to happen

564
00:18:14 --> 00:18:16
Only if I get married,
I&#39;ll have a child

565
00:18:16 --> 00:18:18
Won&#39;t I get married at all?

566
00:18:18 --> 00:18:19
Bring water quickly

567
00:18:19 --> 00:18:21
Hey dude, why are you
getting so upset?

568
00:18:21 --> 00:18:24
I&#39;m there for you... will
try wooing another girl

569
00:18:24 --> 00:18:27
- Do you want eggs?
- Don&#39;t ask, just serve it

570
00:18:27 --> 00:18:28
Am I not?

571
00:18:28 --> 00:18:30
Dad showed me that girl,
she&#39;s good looking

572
00:18:30 --> 00:18:32
I&#39;ll talk to her,
Won&#39;t I do at least this for you?

573
00:18:32 --> 00:18:34
Mom, she said there&#39;s
nothin happening, let it go

574
00:18:34 --> 00:18:36
If it&#39;s nothing , why did
you try to kill yourself

575
00:18:36 --> 00:18:37
Don&#39;t you care about
your parents?

576
00:18:37 --> 00:18:38
Your birth was a boon to me.

577
00:18:38 --> 00:18:40
I couldn&#39;t sleep
the entire night

578
00:18:40 --> 00:18:42
Dear, please leave
this drinking habit

579
00:18:42 --> 00:18:45
- Why do you have to talk to him like that?
- Because of you he&#39;s behaving like this

580
00:18:45 --> 00:18:46
- You&#39;re the one who&#39;s spoiling my son
- Who me?

581
00:18:46 --> 00:18:47
Just shut the hell up!

582
00:18:47 --> 00:18:49
If you continue this, then
you won&#39;t see your mom.

583
00:18:49 --> 00:18:51
Make sure you are back
home once your job is done

584
00:18:51 --> 00:18:52
Don&#39;t worry about anything

585
00:18:52 --> 00:18:53
You&#39;ll get a girl like Angelina

586
00:18:53 --> 00:18:55
She is no angel
let her be

587
00:18:55 --> 00:18:59
Paper boat that sunk in an ocean of love,

588
00:18:59 --> 00:19:03
That took him in to the
deepest of sorrow.

589
00:19:03 --> 00:19:07
In an age where every moment counts,

590
00:19:07 --> 00:19:11
Stepping in to fragile
emotions is ludicrous

591
00:19:11 --> 00:19:12
You could reach it,

592
00:19:12 --> 00:19:15
Yet you cannot enjoy it

593
00:19:15 --> 00:19:19
Paper boat that sunk in an ocean of love,

594
00:19:19 --> 00:19:23
That took him in to the
deepest of sorrow.

595
00:19:23 --> 00:19:25
What the hell are you laughing
at, stop you bloody dogs!

596
00:19:25 --> 00:19:31
Our life is like a river
that takes random courses

597
00:19:31 --> 00:19:37
We never worry about the
emotions that strike us

598
00:19:37 --> 00:19:43
Worry not for we’ll not
stumble you to ground

599
00:19:43 --> 00:19:50
Succeed or fail in life,
we’ll not leave this land

600
00:19:50 --> 00:19:53
Step over the obstacles
with your head held high,

601
00:19:53 --> 00:19:56
Raise your voice for misdeeds

602
00:19:56 --> 00:19:59
Step over the obstacles
with your head held high

603
00:19:59 --> 00:20:02
Raise your voice for misdeeds

604
00:20:02 --> 00:20:07
The paper boat will reach the shores

605
00:20:07 --> 00:20:11
You&#39;ll succeed in love one day

606
00:20:11 --> 00:20:16
The grass on the other side,
is always greener!

607
00:20:16 --> 00:20:17
Take that garland.

608
00:20:17 --> 00:20:20
- Granny, get that right
- Maari, you should prosper well

609
00:20:20 --> 00:20:22
Hey!..keep it granny..keep it!

610
00:20:22 --> 00:20:23
Wait..wait... I&#39;ll give

611
00:20:23 --> 00:20:24
Here take it

612
00:20:24 --> 00:20:27
Here hold this....hey
Johnny dance!

613
00:20:27 --> 00:20:28
Brother, don&#39;t dance like this

614
00:20:28 --> 00:20:29
Anbu, keep this for festival expenses

615
00:20:29 --> 00:20:31
Come here Anbu, they have announced
the date for the conference

616
00:20:31 --> 00:20:32
Understood it&#39;s on March 3rd!

617
00:20:32 --> 00:20:34
We&#39;ve to show them who we
are, we&#39;ve to slog

618
00:20:34 --> 00:20:36
Everyone is ready to pull us down

619
00:20:36 --> 00:20:38
Look here Anbu, we should
not be scared of anything

620
00:20:38 --> 00:20:42
Our place, our area..whatever we&#39;ve
lost, should be reclaimed by us

621
00:20:42 --> 00:20:46
Don&#39;t worry about that, everything is going
as planned, this time it&#39;s going to be us

622
00:20:46 --> 00:20:49
That&#39;s not the issue Anbu, In case
we have a meeting near the wall...

623
00:20:49 --> 00:20:51
...won&#39;t they spit on us stating
that we still don&#39;t have the wall

624
00:20:51 --> 00:20:54
On top of that, they are so laid back
with an impression that nothing can be done

625
00:20:54 --> 00:20:55
Look here Anbu,

626
00:20:55 --> 00:20:56
Never have fear!

627
00:20:56 --> 00:20:57
From now on, It&#39;s them
who should be scared of us

628
00:20:57 --> 00:20:59
They&#39;ll be scared,
don&#39;t worry about that

629
00:20:59 --> 00:21:02
- What&#39;s it?
- Dude, lets leave

630
00:21:02 --> 00:21:03
Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll take care
Lets go

631
00:21:03 --> 00:21:04
What else? Just this wall right?

632
00:21:04 --> 00:21:05
Maari brother won&#39;t come for this also?

633
00:21:05 --> 00:21:06
Is he scared?

634
00:21:06 --> 00:21:09
Scared uh?...Won&#39;t the wall
take him as sacrifice?

635
00:21:09 --> 00:21:11
Hey! It tried killing him once.
It really has got some powers

636
00:21:11 --> 00:21:12
Che... The auto guy came in between!

637
00:21:12 --> 00:21:15
Remember the 2 guys who
died on the bike?

638
00:21:15 --> 00:21:18
They were sloshed, but the
blame was on the wall

639
00:21:18 --> 00:21:19
they could&#39;ve died some other place

640
00:21:19 --> 00:21:20
Why does it have to be this wall?

641
00:21:20 --> 00:21:22
Dude, who ever has died there
have their own reasons

642
00:21:22 --> 00:21:23
No one ever thinks about that

643
00:21:23 --> 00:21:25
It is the fear that we have
that makes us think like this

644
00:21:25 --> 00:21:26
All these are cooked up stories

645
00:21:26 --> 00:21:29
If they bestow the fear of death on us,
we won&#39;t touch it. Just some tricks

646
00:21:29 --> 00:21:30
They&#39;re scared that we&#39;ll grab that wall

647
00:21:30 --> 00:21:31
If we grab the wall,
will they mellow down?

648
00:21:31 --> 00:21:32
If not this, then something else

649
00:21:32 --> 00:21:34
If you ask me, I feel it should be
painted white making common

650
00:21:34 --> 00:21:37
Age old problem is still
persisting and it sure will continue

651
00:21:37 --> 00:21:39
The problem lies with Kannan, why
don&#39;t we deal with him directly?

652
00:21:39 --> 00:21:44
- But dude we will be the only ones in this
world fighting for this silly wall -Hey!

653
00:21:44 --> 00:21:45
Is it so simple for you....

654
00:21:45 --> 00:21:46
Do you think the issue is
only due to the wall?

655
00:21:46 --> 00:21:48
First Sengai use to work
under Krishnapa

656
00:21:48 --> 00:21:50
He went against him in
front of the people, that&#39;s when he died

657
00:21:50 --> 00:21:53
Loads of money, a big shot in politics,
why does he have to hold on to this wall?

658
00:21:53 --> 00:21:54
Wall isn&#39;t the issue,
It&#39;s the Authority

659
00:21:54 --> 00:21:55
No one should question him

660
00:21:55 --> 00:21:57
He&#39;ll ride on our back,
do you want us to ignore?

661
00:21:57 --> 00:21:59
Many lives have been lost for this wall

662
00:21:59 --> 00:22:00
Still his father&#39;s image is on that wall

663
00:22:00 --> 00:22:02
If we touch that, we will die it seems.
Let&#39;s see who is going to die

664
00:22:02 --> 00:22:04
Don&#39;t think that I&#39;m
doing this for Maari,

665
00:22:04 --> 00:22:06
This is for all those who
died because of this

666
00:22:06 --> 00:22:07
If not us, who else will do it?

667
00:22:07 --> 00:22:10
- I&#39;m leaving -This won&#39;t
work out, I&#39;m leaving too

668
00:22:10 --> 00:22:12
It&#39;s obvious there will be
issues if we touch that wall

669
00:22:12 --> 00:22:17
I agree with you buddy, this is a
persisting issue..can&#39;t solve it easily

670
00:22:17 --> 00:22:21
It became a big issue when a small kid
scribbled on that wall, think about it

671
00:22:21 --> 00:22:23
Hey, are you scared?

672
00:22:23 --> 00:22:23
That&#39;s not the case dude

673
00:22:23 --> 00:22:25
Dude, you carry on. We don&#39;t
need anyone, I&#39;ll stand by you

674
00:22:25 --> 00:22:27
You make your move without any
worries, we will take care of it

675
00:22:27 --> 00:22:28
My Anbu is here, now no one...

676
00:22:28 --> 00:22:29
All Johnnies... all open your mouth

677
00:22:29 --> 00:22:30
- Anbu
- Who&#39;s that?

678
00:22:30 --> 00:22:32
It&#39;s me, Perumal has come down.

679
00:22:32 --> 00:22:34
Wants to discuss about the wall,
he&#39;s waiting near Raghu&#39;s place

680
00:22:34 --> 00:22:37
- Who else is there?
- Viji, Suresh and 4 others

681
00:22:37 --> 00:22:39
- You leave. I&#39;ll be there
- Ok, Anbu

682
00:22:39 --> 00:22:42
- Who&#39;s that? Where are they taking you?
- No where, just be quiet

683
00:22:42 --> 00:22:44
Hey don&#39;t fight. Listen to me, Don&#39;t go.

684
00:22:44 --> 00:22:46
There&#39;s no fight, they have just
come to talk, don&#39;t be scared

685
00:22:46 --> 00:22:49
- I&#39;m asking you not to go
- I&#39;m going, Just shut up!

686
00:22:49 --> 00:22:52
Dude Perumal has come to speak
with Anbu, come near Raghu&#39;s place

687
00:22:52 --> 00:22:52
Welcome Anbu!

688
00:22:52 --> 00:22:53
- Did you ask the guys to come?
- I have

689
00:22:53 --> 00:22:55
Welcome Anbu, how are you?

690
00:22:55 --> 00:22:55
You&#39;ve become wiser

691
00:22:55 --> 00:22:57
It&#39;s not like that, just
been given a posting

692
00:22:57 --> 00:23:00
Bro, didn&#39;t I say. Anbu is our kid,
he must have done this unintentionally

693
00:23:00 --> 00:23:03
Anbu, I was going to talk to you myself.
Brother wanted to..

694
00:23:03 --> 00:23:05
- Because it&#39;s our wall - Our
wall?...Once again if you mention that

695
00:23:05 --> 00:23:07
All the walls in this area
is yours... I agree to that

696
00:23:07 --> 00:23:09
Have I ever touched any of them, or
at least put up a poster on them?

697
00:23:09 --> 00:23:12
All we have is one wall, and you
don&#39;t get that. What do you say?

698
00:23:12 --> 00:23:14
Let it be Bro, all
these years you had it

699
00:23:14 --> 00:23:15
This year we will write on that,

700
00:23:15 --> 00:23:17
may be next year... no
no..The wall is our henceforth

701
00:23:17 --> 00:23:19
Anbu, you&#39;re talking like a kid

702
00:23:19 --> 00:23:20
Then go ahead and speak
to the elder ones

703
00:23:20 --> 00:23:22
Don&#39;t speak unnecessarily,
I&#39;m handling this

704
00:23:22 --> 00:23:24
Everyone just shut up, who
asked you to come here?

705
00:23:24 --> 00:23:25
Nothing, they&#39;ve just come to talk

706
00:23:25 --> 00:23:27
Hey better be calm,
Hey you be silent!

707
00:23:27 --> 00:23:29
- Who is this?
- Your Dad... bloody sick b@#@d!

708
00:23:29 --> 00:23:33
- Hey you dirty worm, will smash you
- Who me? Get a cloth will go fishing then

709
00:23:33 --> 00:23:36
- Johnny I&#39;m getting worked up
- Can&#39;t you be calm, I&#39;m gonna kill you

710
00:23:36 --> 00:23:37
Let there be no conflicts

711
00:23:37 --> 00:23:38
My father has died

712
00:23:38 --> 00:23:41
- Don&#39;t get angry, all these years... -It&#39;s
the same for you as well, just shut up

713
00:23:41 --> 00:23:42
My grandfather is on that wall

714
00:23:42 --> 00:23:43
Where&#39;s your grandmother?
On the neighbor’s wall

715
00:23:43 --> 00:23:45
- We&#39;re talking here, and you&#39;re joking
- Hey Nari, will hack you

716
00:23:45 --> 00:23:45
Shut up!

717
00:23:45 --> 00:23:46
Can&#39;t shut up, times
have changed now

718
00:23:46 --> 00:23:46
Hey just calm down!

719
00:23:46 --> 00:23:48
Let&#39;s not waste time, this is
our area and it&#39;s our wall

720
00:23:48 --> 00:23:50
Hey Viji, you are silent.
Is this why we got you here?

721
00:23:50 --> 00:23:54
What do I have to say, area leader
has declared we can&#39;t have the wall.

722
00:23:54 --> 00:23:56
Let him paint a image on that
wall, we&#39;ll just watch..

723
00:23:56 --> 00:23:58
That&#39;s why I said, let&#39;s not
speak to him rather finish him

724
00:23:58 --> 00:24:00
You&#39;ll are useless, hey move

725
00:24:00 --> 00:24:01
Anbu, It&#39;s a big issue

726
00:24:01 --> 00:24:04
Who&#39;s the big shot? Let him know that Anbu
said that he won&#39;t give this wall to anyone

727
00:24:04 --> 00:24:05
Let him do as he wishes

728
00:24:05 --> 00:24:07
Why are you talking to them, let them lay
their hands on that wall, then we&#39;ll see

729
00:24:07 --> 00:24:08
F@#$g Bast...

730
00:24:08 --> 00:24:09
Hey..just calm down and leave from here

731
00:24:09 --> 00:24:10
Anbu, he&#39;s using his hands
while we are talking

732
00:24:10 --> 00:24:11
- What do you have to say?

733
00:24:11 --> 00:24:11
No, I can&#39;t

734
00:24:11 --> 00:24:11
Let&#39;s go!

735
00:24:11 --> 00:24:13
Thought we&#39;ll speak and sort it
out but you guys are fighting

736
00:24:13 --> 00:24:15
- He&#39;s talking too much
- Should have broken his jaw

737
00:24:15 --> 00:24:16
- Let it go dude - He&#39;s come to
our area and is creating a scene

738
00:24:16 --> 00:24:18
- We&#39;ll take care of it, where are
they gonna go -It&#39;s all unnecessary

739
00:24:18 --> 00:24:19
Don&#39;t you have any brains?

740
00:24:19 --> 00:24:21
Why did you hit him?

741
00:24:21 --> 00:24:23
Are you mad at me? You want me to be
quiet when he&#39;s yapping like that

742
00:24:23 --> 00:24:24
Enough, they came for
a compromise and we have fought

743
00:24:24 --> 00:24:27
Hey Kaali wait... he&#39;s angry dude

744
00:24:27 --> 00:24:29
Be careful, don&#39;t
go alone anywhere

745
00:24:29 --> 00:24:30
Why are you getting
pissed at him?

746
00:24:30 --> 00:24:33
- Hey kaali take care
- Let him know that it&#39;s not a simple issue

747
00:24:33 --> 00:24:35
Its another addition to
the existing problems

748
00:24:35 --> 00:24:38
Hey stop there, are you
nuts? Why did you hit that guy?

749
00:24:38 --> 00:24:39
They&#39;ve been waiting
for someone to bump

750
00:24:39 --> 00:24:41
Look here, don&#39;t get involved
in that wall&#39;s issue

751
00:24:41 --> 00:24:42
I gave birth to you after years of penance?

752
00:24:42 --> 00:24:42
Shut up!

753
00:24:42 --> 00:24:45
Be quiet. He&#39;s swearing at
Anbu and you want me to be quiet?

754
00:24:45 --> 00:24:46
I would have broken his bones

755
00:24:46 --> 00:24:49
You better don&#39;t get in to all
this, come back home after work.

756
00:24:49 --> 00:24:51
Always getting involved
in these issues

757
00:24:51 --> 00:24:52
Hello... Hello!

758
00:24:52 --> 00:24:54
Hello who&#39;s this? Come
to me if you have guts

759
00:24:54 --> 00:24:57
Someone is messing with
me, If I get hold of you...

760
00:24:57 --> 00:25:00
Hey let it go... just wait
and watch the next morning

761
00:25:00 --> 00:25:03
- Hello who do you want?
- I&#39;m Kalaiarasi

762
00:25:03 --> 00:25:06
Have you forgotten me? You&#39;ve
been swearing all the time when I call

763
00:25:06 --> 00:25:08
Just because I scolded you in anger
once, won&#39;t you meet me again?

764
00:25:08 --> 00:25:10
Were you behind me for fun?

765
00:25:10 --> 00:25:13
I&#39;ve been waiting for you to come and meet
me. But you won&#39;t even give me a glance.

766
00:25:13 --> 00:25:15
I&#39;ve been worried ever since the day I
scolded you

767
00:25:15 --> 00:25:17
But you&#39;ve been
sleeping peacefully

768
00:25:17 --> 00:25:19
I am waiting near the water
pump to meet you. Come fast.

769
00:25:19 --> 00:25:20
I&#39;m here!

770
00:25:20 --> 00:25:22
- What do you want? Why did you call?
- Why are you screaming?

771
00:25:22 --> 00:25:23
I wanted to talk to you

772
00:25:23 --> 00:25:24
Whatever I said the other day was in anger

773
00:25:24 --> 00:25:25
But what you did was right?

774
00:25:25 --> 00:25:27
If you love me? I should be
okay with it immediately?

775
00:25:27 --> 00:25:29
Do you know how girls
scold their lovers?

776
00:25:29 --> 00:25:31
One of my friends got her lover
caught by police

777
00:25:31 --> 00:25:32
He got beaten up black and blue

778
00:25:32 --> 00:25:34
She&#39;s now married
to the same guy

779
00:25:34 --> 00:25:35
She&#39;s Happy!

780
00:25:35 --> 00:25:36
I just scolded you

781
00:25:36 --> 00:25:37
What else did I do?

782
00:25:37 --> 00:25:39
I swear, I love you since then

783
00:25:39 --> 00:25:41
Please understand!

784
00:25:41 --> 00:25:42
Why are you crying now?

785
00:25:42 --> 00:25:43
Will you marry me?

786
00:25:43 --> 00:25:47
- When?
- Right here, right now!

787
00:25:47 --> 00:25:50
Then give me a kiss

788
00:25:50 --> 00:25:55
- Hey Kaali!
- Go please go, your mom might come down

789
00:25:55 --> 00:25:58
- Dear, where did you go this late?
- Where were you?

790
00:25:58 --> 00:26:00
I&#39;ve been asking, you don&#39;t
even bother to reply?

791
00:26:00 --> 00:26:01
What happened to him?

792
00:26:01 --> 00:26:02
Hello..bro it&#39;s Mary

793
00:26:02 --> 00:26:03
Whay happened?
Please come home soon

794
00:26:03 --> 00:26:05
- Why what happened? I&#39;m coming
- Bro please come soon

795
00:26:05 --> 00:26:07
- Maari don&#39;t get angry
- How can I not be angry?

796
00:26:07 --> 00:26:09
I told you guys not to, but you
guys have beaten him up so badly

797
00:26:09 --> 00:26:11
Trying to be smart?
Will dump you guys

798
00:26:11 --> 00:26:12
Let&#39;s see how long this goes on

799
00:26:12 --> 00:26:13
Greedy for money

800
00:26:13 --> 00:26:17
Until I was here nothing had happened,
all of this, when I was away in the morning

801
00:26:17 --> 00:26:18
All this is because of you

802
00:26:18 --> 00:26:19
Do you want me to get arrested?

803
00:26:19 --> 00:26:20
Sir, I was the one who
did this, arrest me

804
00:26:20 --> 00:26:22
Wait, Let&#39;s go in and talk

805
00:26:22 --> 00:26:22
Let&#39;s take care of this later

806
00:26:22 --> 00:26:24
Money is playing the main
role, please listen to me

807
00:26:24 --> 00:26:25
Come on Maari, let&#39;s go inside

808
00:26:25 --> 00:26:28
- Don&#39;t cry
- Don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll take care of this

809
00:26:28 --> 00:26:30
Anbu? Let it go, we&#39;ll
take care of it

810
00:26:30 --> 00:26:32
Bro, this is nothing. Forget it

811
00:26:32 --> 00:26:33
They&#39;ve to come here

812
00:26:33 --> 00:26:37
- Don&#39;t be scared
- Dude, looks like they&#39;ve beaten you badly

813
00:26:37 --> 00:26:39
Won&#39;t you guys tell us the
problem, you&#39;ve left him alone

814
00:26:39 --> 00:26:39
Let them be

815
00:26:39 --> 00:26:40
Why are you looking at Perumal?

816
00:26:40 --> 00:26:42
I know how to handle this
issue, just shut up and leave

817
00:26:42 --> 00:26:44
If only you let me, I would
have hacked them to death

818
00:26:44 --> 00:26:46
At least from now on let me know, I&#39;ll
take care of it if there&#39;s a problem

819
00:26:46 --> 00:26:48
Where are you going? Why
are you getting down?

820
00:26:48 --> 00:26:49
What are you doing?

821
00:26:49 --> 00:26:50
The wall is mine

822
00:26:50 --> 00:26:51
You can never touch it

823
00:26:51 --> 00:26:53
I dare you to touch me again

824
00:26:53 --> 00:26:55
- Dude, take him away. Make him sit inside.
- First take him away from here

825
00:26:55 --> 00:26:56
Leave..leave..Leave

826
00:26:56 --> 00:26:58
Seems like that fellow is
going to grow stronger?

827
00:26:58 --> 00:26:59
Is he that gutsy?

828
00:26:59 --> 00:27:01
If he hasn&#39;t changed in spite
of getting beaten up

829
00:27:01 --> 00:27:02
He has to die

830
00:27:02 --> 00:27:04
He&#39;s not scared of us, that
goes to his guys as well

831
00:27:04 --> 00:27:05
If it continues, he
will take the wall

832
00:27:05 --> 00:27:06
Don&#39;t you ever say that and get slippered

833
00:27:06 --> 00:27:08
- It&#39;s all because of Maari
- He&#39;ll be the same even otherwise

834
00:27:08 --> 00:27:10
- Sit down Viji
- It&#39;s ok!

835
00:27:10 --> 00:27:11
Come on, Sit down

836
00:27:11 --> 00:27:11
Sit down!

837
00:27:11 --> 00:27:13
If we let him continue this,
It will be a problem for us

838
00:27:13 --> 00:27:15
All these days Maari, didn&#39;t have
the guts to stand in front of us

839
00:27:15 --> 00:27:17
Anbu... Anbu is
everything out there

840
00:27:17 --> 00:27:18
If we finish the
leader of the herd

841
00:27:18 --> 00:27:19
They&#39;ll be shattered

842
00:27:19 --> 00:27:21
Do this now, It&#39;s the right
time you&#39;ve been asking for

843
00:27:21 --> 00:27:23
Kill Anbu, until you&#39;re satisfied

844
00:27:23 --> 00:27:24
After which, you&#39;re everything

845
00:27:24 --> 00:27:26
Be with him and give him
all that is required

846
00:27:26 --> 00:27:27
- Hey, who&#39;s it?
- No one

847
00:27:27 --> 00:27:29
Why are you dodging? Tell me...

848
00:27:29 --> 00:27:31
- It&#39;s that girl
- Is it Kalaiarasi?

849
00:27:31 --> 00:27:33
Mary did you listen to this?
What is she saying?

850
00:27:33 --> 00:27:33
She loves me

851
00:27:33 --> 00:27:36
Dude, you didn&#39;t even tell
me, when did this happen?

852
00:27:36 --> 00:27:38
Look how happy he is,
do you need all this?

853
00:27:38 --> 00:27:40
Shut up, he is talking
about his love

854
00:27:40 --> 00:27:43
Why are you biting your tongue?
Have you decided to abandon us?

855
00:27:43 --> 00:27:45
You&#39;re eating because you earned
it. Is that party gonna feed you?

856
00:27:45 --> 00:27:47
Look brother, how
irresponsible he is

857
00:27:47 --> 00:27:48
Get some sense at least after
looking at your child.

858
00:27:48 --> 00:27:51
Let them do whatever they want,
Is that wall going to feed you?

859
00:27:51 --> 00:27:53
Why am I here then? For
that wall to feed us?

860
00:27:53 --> 00:27:56
Are you nuts, after so much,
you still haven&#39;t changed

861
00:27:56 --> 00:28:00
- You&#39;ve been acting too much,
I&#39;m gonna break your jaw -Dude!

862
00:28:00 --> 00:28:03
If I get scared, then who will seek
justice for the blood that&#39;s been shed

863
00:28:03 --> 00:28:04
I have fixed a date for that wall

864
00:28:04 --> 00:28:06
By next week, I&#39;ll conquer that wall and
walk in front of them with pride

865
00:28:06 --> 00:28:07
Then there is no use of
us being here all this while

866
00:28:07 --> 00:28:09
- You just be with me
- You&#39;ll never listen

867
00:28:09 --> 00:28:11
- What is it?
- Get home soon

868
00:28:11 --> 00:28:14
Morning when we conquer that wall, everyone
should be here. No one should be missed

869
00:28:14 --> 00:28:17
I&#39;ve spoken to him, he&#39;ll give
you a paper, just take that

870
00:28:17 --> 00:28:18
Keep all the weapons
ready

871
00:28:18 --> 00:28:20
No matter who comes, we&#39;ll stand.
We&#39;ll show them who we are.

872
00:28:20 --> 00:28:21
Tomorrow should be our day

873
00:28:21 --> 00:28:24
It&#39;s ours, everything is ready.
We&#39;ll show them our worth

874
00:28:24 --> 00:28:26
Don&#39;t go out of our area, even
if there&#39;s a problem ignore it

875
00:28:26 --> 00:28:28
Be Alert! Okay. You guys leave

876
00:28:28 --> 00:28:29
First you leave dude

877
00:28:29 --> 00:28:31
What&#39;s going to happen in
our area, my buddy has come...

878
00:28:31 --> 00:28:32
...will talk to him and then leave

879
00:28:32 --> 00:28:33
Why are you so tensed?

880
00:28:33 --> 00:28:36
- What else it&#39;s that wall -Chill,
everything is going according to the plan

881
00:28:36 --> 00:28:40
- If only we conquer that wall
- If we do, will we get everything?

882
00:28:40 --> 00:28:42
What are you going to do with that? Are you
gonna change this place like Annanagar?

883
00:28:42 --> 00:28:45
We&#39;ve been surrounded with
people who won&#39;t let us change

884
00:28:45 --> 00:28:49
They keep shouting Tamil..Tamil, when
it comes to caste, they get violent

885
00:28:49 --> 00:28:52
Then why do you have to sweat it,
go and take care of your kids

886
00:28:52 --> 00:28:53
What&#39;s there to laugh?

887
00:28:53 --> 00:28:55
If there&#39;s an issue in your area, won&#39;t
you get down on to the streets?

888
00:28:55 --> 00:28:56
Dishing out dialogues.

889
00:28:56 --> 00:28:58
You are educated right?
What have you done for our area?

890
00:28:58 --> 00:29:01
Once you save up, you&#39;ll
move out somewhere else

891
00:29:01 --> 00:29:02
Get lost, it&#39;s my land
and I&#39;ll stand for it

892
00:29:02 --> 00:29:03
Even I will stand for it!

893
00:29:03 --> 00:29:05
It&#39;s not wrong to stand up, we&#39;ll
have to see if any good will happen

894
00:29:05 --> 00:29:09
Dude, your anger, wanting to
good for public is all good

895
00:29:09 --> 00:29:10
...but do it with political knowledge,

896
00:29:10 --> 00:29:11
don&#39;t react to this silly
wall issues, understood?

897
00:29:11 --> 00:29:14
- Hey guys welcome
- What are you guys up to?

898
00:29:14 --> 00:29:15
There&#39;s a dance competition

899
00:29:15 --> 00:29:16
- That&#39;s great
- We are going to rock!

900
00:29:16 --> 00:29:17
Won&#39;t come back without
winning the trophy

901
00:29:17 --> 00:29:19
Anbu Bro, will come back
with the trophy to see you

902
00:29:19 --> 00:29:21
Dude, you have been
delivering great dialogues

903
00:29:21 --> 00:29:22
I&#39;ll take care of all that

904
00:29:22 --> 00:29:24
Seems like you are working
as full time security?

905
00:29:24 --> 00:29:25
You&#39;ve become the
talk of the area!

906
00:29:25 --> 00:29:28
How can you say that dude?
...only now life is chirpy!

907
00:29:28 --> 00:29:30
I&#39;m getting angry thinking why I
did not give this a chance earlier

908
00:29:30 --> 00:29:32
I&#39;m not sure if I would have been this
happy if my mom had chosen a girl for me

909
00:29:32 --> 00:29:34
I like her very much,
It&#39;s all because of you

910
00:29:34 --> 00:29:38
You&#39;re hugging me now, hope you
won&#39;t hit me after your marriage

911
00:29:38 --> 00:29:40
She&#39;s not like
others, she is great

912
00:29:40 --> 00:29:46
Dude, usually people get a little intimate
before marriage, do you think it&#39;s right?

913
00:29:46 --> 00:29:47
Why are you laughing?

914
00:29:47 --> 00:29:48
Better tell me what you did...

915
00:29:48 --> 00:29:52
Not me. I was asking in general.-Hey Kaali,
don&#39;t get her pregnant before wedding

916
00:29:52 --> 00:29:55
Couldn&#39;t control dude, but
it&#39;s not like what you think

917
00:29:55 --> 00:29:57
- Just kissed her
- Dude, you&#39;re awesome

918
00:29:57 --> 00:29:58
Nothing man

919
00:29:58 --> 00:29:59
All that is wrong, just shut up

920
00:29:59 --> 00:30:01
She got impatient,  I&#39;m leaving

921
00:30:01 --> 00:30:04
No dude, she asked me to get home, She&#39;ll
be pissed off if she know I&#39;m here.

922
00:30:04 --> 00:30:07
You&#39;re already so scared,
wait you can go later

923
00:30:07 --> 00:30:08
Wait you can leave
later, what&#39;s the hurry?

924
00:30:08 --> 00:30:10
Hey, there&#39;s no one,
why are you here?

925
00:30:10 --> 00:30:12
- Come let&#39;s go
- Don&#39;t drag me, I&#39;ll come

926
00:30:12 --> 00:30:15
You&#39;re not even married
and yet you&#39;re so scared

927
00:30:15 --> 00:30:16
- Then she&#39;ll say, I don&#39;t
listen to her at all

928
00:30:16 --> 00:30:17
Dude, they are here,
start the bike

929
00:30:17 --> 00:30:18
Dude leave!
Run!

930
00:30:18 --> 00:30:19
They&#39;ve surrounded us,
come on..come on...

931
00:30:19 --> 00:30:21
I will hack you down,
who&#39;s that johnny?

932
00:30:21 --> 00:30:24
- Hey Anbu
- Keep running

933
00:30:24 --> 00:30:25
Get to the other side and surround him

934
00:30:25 --> 00:30:26
Don&#39;t run... catch him

935
00:30:26 --> 00:30:27
Hey... you&#39;re dead man

936
00:30:27 --> 00:30:30
Got him..Justin... kill him!

937
00:30:30 --> 00:30:31
Come on let&#39;s go!

938
00:30:31 --> 00:30:32
Come on dude..come on

939
00:30:32 --> 00:30:34
Hello... hello..Viji?
How did you lose them

940
00:30:34 --> 00:30:36
He&#39;ll be in this
area, keep looking

941
00:30:36 --> 00:30:38
If he doesn&#39;t die tonight,
you will, kill him!

942
00:30:38 --> 00:30:41
I don&#39;t know what you&#39;ll do, he has
to die tonight, Viji don&#39;t leave him

943
00:30:41 --> 00:30:42
What have you done Kaali?

944
00:30:42 --> 00:30:43
Leave that, let&#39;s go

945
00:30:43 --> 00:30:44
What have you done Kaali!

946
00:30:44 --> 00:30:47
Dude? Why have done like this?...He
fell down breaking his skull open!

947
00:30:47 --> 00:30:47
What do you mean?

948
00:30:47 --> 00:30:48
I am scared

949
00:30:48 --> 00:30:49
Dude he didn&#39;t die

950
00:30:49 --> 00:30:51
He would have acted out of fear
that I would hit him again

951
00:30:51 --> 00:30:51
No

952
00:30:51 --> 00:30:52
If he dies they would
imprison me, right?

953
00:30:52 --> 00:30:54
Only now everything has settled down

954
00:30:54 --> 00:30:55
Now everything is gone

955
00:30:55 --> 00:30:56
My general is gone..
Gone away!

956
00:30:56 --> 00:30:59
What&#39;s the use of you filthy guys?

957
00:30:59 --> 00:31:00
- Whats it dude?
- Where are you?

958
00:31:00 --> 00:31:01
- Perumal is dead
- Dead!

959
00:31:01 --> 00:31:03
- It has become a big issue
- Dude!

960
00:31:03 --> 00:31:04
Anbu, where are you?

961
00:31:04 --> 00:31:07
- Near Bhai&#39;s house
- How did you execute such a big thing?

962
00:31:07 --> 00:31:08
You have to be very careful from now on

963
00:31:08 --> 00:31:10
What bro, won&#39;t they let us be in peace?

964
00:31:10 --> 00:31:12
They will be not at peace now, they&#39;ll be
looking out to finish you guys overnight.

965
00:31:12 --> 00:31:13
We must not lose anyone from our side

966
00:31:13 --> 00:31:14
- What shall we do?
- Don&#39;t worry

967
00:31:14 --> 00:31:16
I&#39;ll talk to the lawyer, that
place is not safe, leave soon

968
00:31:16 --> 00:31:19
I&#39;ll come back after
killing them all

969
00:31:19 --> 00:31:22
If Police gets them they&#39;d be beaten to death.
Let us surrender them directly in court

970
00:31:22 --> 00:31:23
Avoid the police somehow.

971
00:31:23 --> 00:31:28
Court.. Not the High court..
Criminal court is best bring them there

972
00:31:28 --> 00:31:29
Kill them before they
surrender in court

973
00:31:29 --> 00:31:30
That is good for you

974
00:31:30 --> 00:31:32
Keep your guys in the search
We&#39;ll try our best too

975
00:31:32 --> 00:31:33
Hey, where are you?

976
00:31:33 --> 00:31:34
Hey, what happened?

977
00:31:34 --> 00:31:36
- Why are you crying?
- Perumal..

978
00:31:36 --> 00:31:37
Will you abandon me?

979
00:31:37 --> 00:31:38
Now what, Nothing has happened

980
00:31:38 --> 00:31:40
Ok you be brave, take care of our child

981
00:31:40 --> 00:31:41
If anyone asks for me
tell them you don&#39;t know.

982
00:31:41 --> 00:31:43
You go to your mothers house
Maari bro, will take care of us

983
00:31:43 --> 00:31:46
You do what you want,
But if something happens to you

984
00:31:46 --> 00:31:47
Mary don’t talk like this

985
00:31:47 --> 00:31:47
Is he there

986
00:31:47 --> 00:31:48
- Look properly
- Wait

987
00:31:48 --> 00:31:51
What&#39;s up Maari Brother! Anbu
has risen to a great level!

988
00:31:51 --> 00:31:53
He is the talk of our area now

989
00:31:53 --> 00:31:55
Whatever you have done all these years,
He has done it in a day&#39;s time

990
00:31:55 --> 00:31:58
He wanted to prove himself,
and stand up against you

991
00:31:58 --> 00:32:00
- Anbu has won
- Now what do you want?

992
00:32:00 --> 00:32:01
Stop this slander talk of yours

993
00:32:01 --> 00:32:02
Hey, where are you going?

994
00:32:02 --> 00:32:04
Fucking wall
The reason for all this

995
00:32:04 --> 00:32:06
How many times have I told that this
was unwanted.. Now everything is gone

996
00:32:06 --> 00:32:10
- I&#39;ll bring it down
- Come, lets leave, someone might see us

997
00:32:10 --> 00:32:12
Phone!

998
00:32:12 --> 00:32:15
Anbu, there is a Black car
near Seetha&#39;s shop.. Get on that

999
00:32:15 --> 00:32:16
I&#39;ve informed Anil everything
He&#39;ll take care

1000
00:32:16 --> 00:32:18
Come on!
Get in

1001
00:32:18 --> 00:32:20
Awesome chief, you&#39;ve stood
your ground in our area

1002
00:32:20 --> 00:32:23
They are looking around with weapons
Not a problem, we&#39;ll get away

1003
00:32:23 --> 00:32:24
- Shall we leave
- Phaa..

1004
00:32:24 --> 00:32:26
It&#39;s stinking, wash your mouth first

1005
00:32:26 --> 00:32:29
What you staring at?
If I inform boss, he&#39;ll finish you

1006
00:32:29 --> 00:32:30
What&#39;s with you bro?
Start the car

1007
00:32:30 --> 00:32:33
What a song! No one
can beat Ilayaraja

1008
00:32:33 --> 00:32:37
Super feel! It pulls out the
soul and makes you admire

1009
00:32:37 --> 00:32:38
Friend, don&#39;t you like the song

1010
00:32:38 --> 00:32:38
Guys are getting ready

1011
00:32:38 --> 00:32:40
The police are there,
Don&#39;t stop, keep going

1012
00:32:40 --> 00:32:42
Whatever happens you don&#39;t care
Just act like you are sleeping

1013
00:32:42 --> 00:32:45
If we cross this we are done
Never get down from the vehicle

1014
00:32:45 --> 00:32:46
Stop the Car!

1015
00:32:46 --> 00:32:47
Don&#39;t stop keep going

1016
00:32:47 --> 00:32:50
Just keep going, floor it!

1017
00:32:50 --> 00:32:52
That was a great escape

1018
00:32:52 --> 00:32:55
We can never have an ordinary
life hereafter, right?

1019
00:32:55 --> 00:32:56
They&#39;ll make us accused
if we go to jail, right?

1020
00:32:56 --> 00:32:58
We&#39;ve to become accused
Only then will they fear us

1021
00:32:58 --> 00:32:59
Do you know how
terrifying Perumal was?

1022
00:32:59 --> 00:33:01
You are God for those
who are affected

1023
00:33:01 --> 00:33:03
Be proud you are an accused

1024
00:33:03 --> 00:33:05
Won&#39;t you shut up..
He&#39;s already very disturbed

1025
00:33:05 --> 00:33:09
Should he hit for that?
I am also an accused.

1026
00:33:09 --> 00:33:10
We&#39;ve reached the court

1027
00:33:10 --> 00:33:11
Yeah the party are safe

1028
00:33:11 --> 00:33:12
We both didn&#39;t do it

1029
00:33:12 --> 00:33:14
We are surrendering just because
Police is suspecting us

1030
00:33:14 --> 00:33:15
Don&#39;t tell unwanted details

1031
00:33:15 --> 00:33:17
These are the two
Anbu and Kaali

1032
00:33:17 --> 00:33:18
These two,
- yes sir

1033
00:33:18 --> 00:33:20
- Under which police station is it?
- Puliyanthoopu Police station

1034
00:33:20 --> 00:33:21
- The SI is Devi, right?
- Yes sir

1035
00:33:21 --> 00:33:23
Wipe it! Your drooling.

1036
00:33:23 --> 00:33:24
Lawyer Prabhu from Karlapakkam, madam

1037
00:33:24 --> 00:33:26
Whats it sir? Suddenly
you have come on line

1038
00:33:26 --> 00:33:29
Can&#39;t get you in my line
Just small details madam

1039
00:33:29 --> 00:33:31
Can you please tell the suspects
name in the Perumal murder case?

1040
00:33:31 --> 00:33:32
Why? Are you gonna
surrender anyone?

1041
00:33:32 --> 00:33:34
The party has approached my friend

1042
00:33:34 --> 00:33:36
Tell me if you want,
I send the party to you

1043
00:33:36 --> 00:33:39
We&#39;ll see how you&#39;ll send them?
Don&#39;t fool around sir

1044
00:33:39 --> 00:33:40
What to do madam?
Please just check

1045
00:33:40 --> 00:33:41
No sleep all night

1046
00:33:41 --> 00:33:42
Note it down as I tell you.

1047
00:33:42 --> 00:33:49
Anbu, Mahesh a.k.a Adhiyan, Franklin,
Shiva, Moses, Dharnesh, Vetri and Chakra

1048
00:33:49 --> 00:33:52
Sir, If Anbu is with you
We can make a deal

1049
00:33:52 --> 00:33:54
Madam, there is
no one called Anbu here

1050
00:33:54 --> 00:33:56
If he comes I&#39;ll come to your line
Thanks Madam

1051
00:33:56 --> 00:33:57
- Who is Anbu?
- It&#39;s me

1052
00:33:57 --> 00:33:58
He&#39;s on demand,

1053
00:33:58 --> 00:34:00
If the Police had caught you
They would have swallowed you

1054
00:34:00 --> 00:34:02
- Your name
- Kaali, sir

1055
00:34:02 --> 00:34:03
Your name is not there in the FIR

1056
00:34:03 --> 00:34:04
Why should he be
surrendering voluntarily?

1057
00:34:04 --> 00:34:06
If he surrenders without
being in the case

1058
00:34:06 --> 00:34:07
They&#39;ll make it look as if he
was in the scene.....

1059
00:34:07 --> 00:34:08
He&#39;s not needed bring
the other alone

1060
00:34:08 --> 00:34:09
Your name is not there!

1061
00:34:09 --> 00:34:11
You kidding! I did it!
I should be the one imprisoned

1062
00:34:11 --> 00:34:14
Dude, only I know about it
Everybody thinks I did it

1063
00:34:14 --> 00:34:15
Even if you hadn&#39;t, I
would have killed him

1064
00:34:15 --> 00:34:17
Why should you go instead of me?
I should be arrested, Anil bro!

1065
00:34:17 --> 00:34:18
Who did you do this for?
For me, right

1066
00:34:18 --> 00:34:20
Dude, nothing will happen
to me because of this

1067
00:34:20 --> 00:34:22
This case won&#39;t last
I&#39;ll get bail soon

1068
00:34:22 --> 00:34:23
You&#39;ll be branded as a criminal

1069
00:34:23 --> 00:34:24
Then you&#39;ll be called on for
any problem in the area

1070
00:34:24 --> 00:34:26
Your life is different
You don&#39;t need all this

1071
00:34:26 --> 00:34:28
You kidding, I can&#39;t
What will I tell Mary?

1072
00:34:28 --> 00:34:31
It&#39;s getting late,
Even lovers won&#39;t romance so much

1073
00:34:31 --> 00:34:34
Don&#39;t worry, You can go to jail
for the next incident for sure!

1074
00:34:34 --> 00:34:36
I&#39;ve a sure scene
I&#39;ll tell you, come

1075
00:34:36 --> 00:34:39
Keep quiet! I&#39;m proud I&#39;m
going to jail for this

1076
00:34:39 --> 00:34:42
The judge has ordered him to be in
police custody for 15 days, take him

1077
00:34:42 --> 00:34:44
Sir, can I make a call

1078
00:34:44 --> 00:34:45
Hmm, here

1079
00:34:45 --> 00:34:49
Why are you sad, buddy?
Nothing bad has happened

1080
00:34:49 --> 00:34:53
I hit him!
I killed him!

1081
00:34:53 --> 00:34:54
I&#39;m the one to be arrested

1082
00:34:54 --> 00:34:56
I knew from that blow of yours

1083
00:34:56 --> 00:34:59
I swear, this won&#39;t happen to anyone else!

1084
00:34:59 --> 00:35:00
You got to worship your friend

1085
00:35:00 --> 00:35:03
I can never repay him for this debt

1086
00:35:03 --> 00:35:06
15 days.. He&#39;ll be bailed out, right?

1087
00:35:06 --> 00:35:10
Don&#39;t worry, this is a high level case.
No witness also. We&#39;ll get the bail.

1088
00:35:10 --> 00:35:11
Maari bro is calling

1089
00:35:11 --> 00:35:12
Yeah tell bro

1090
00:35:12 --> 00:35:14
We went to buy lunch.
Everything is over

1091
00:35:14 --> 00:35:15
Kaali is with me

1092
00:35:15 --> 00:35:16
Don&#39;t worry

1093
00:35:16 --> 00:35:18
You don&#39;t have to come and see me in
the prison I&#39;ll call you from there.

1094
00:35:18 --> 00:35:21
I&#39;ll get everything inside.
Whatever it is, tell it to Kaali.

1095
00:35:21 --> 00:35:22
Be careful!

1096
00:35:22 --> 00:35:24
Don&#39;t cry, idiot

1097
00:35:24 --> 00:35:26
Take care of our son... Okay?

1098
00:35:26 --> 00:35:28
I&#39;ll call you when I leave

1099
00:35:28 --> 00:35:29
Is that Mary?

1100
00:35:29 --> 00:35:29
She&#39;s just crying

1101
00:35:29 --> 00:35:32
- Take care
- Hey, don&#39;t cry dude

1102
00:35:32 --> 00:35:33
I&#39;ve never seen you like this

1103
00:35:33 --> 00:35:34
I&#39;ll take care

1104
00:35:34 --> 00:35:36
If we had taken over the wall
It would have been spectacular, right?

1105
00:35:36 --> 00:35:38
Now everyone will blame the wall,

1106
00:35:38 --> 00:35:39
no one will get close to it!

1107
00:35:39 --> 00:35:41
Hey, why are you still hung on that?

1108
00:35:41 --> 00:35:43
- Like a fool
- you won&#39;t understand

1109
00:35:43 --> 00:35:47
By this time, conquering that wall walking
head held high with pride in front of them

1110
00:35:47 --> 00:35:49
Would have brought peace to all
the souls who have lost their life

1111
00:35:49 --> 00:35:53
If I hadn&#39;t hit him that day
You would have dealt it, right?

1112
00:35:53 --> 00:35:56
Even If it wasn&#39;t for you,
it would have been the same

1113
00:35:56 --> 00:36:00
You don&#39;t worry dude, as you wished before
you come out, the wall will be ours.

1114
00:36:00 --> 00:36:02
You don’t have to do anything, fool

1115
00:36:02 --> 00:36:05
Inform the girls parents and get
married soon, save some for then

1116
00:36:05 --> 00:36:06
Don&#39;t do everything before marriage

1117
00:36:06 --> 00:36:09
I&#39;ve told her strictly,
So it&#39;s all only after marriage

1118
00:36:09 --> 00:36:13
Anbu is fine
Nothing happened to Anbu

1119
00:36:13 --> 00:36:15
I&#39;ve to see him

1120
00:36:15 --> 00:36:17
Don’t go by the wall
Go the other way

1121
00:36:17 --> 00:36:18
Go by the wall

1122
00:36:18 --> 00:36:20
Anbu! Anbu get up!

1123
00:36:20 --> 00:36:21
See who is here

1124
00:36:21 --> 00:36:24
Your best friend is here

1125
00:36:24 --> 00:36:26
You never wanted me to call you
passionately without respect..

1126
00:36:26 --> 00:36:31
Now i&#39;ll call you dear. Anbu dear!
Get up dear!

1127
00:36:31 --> 00:36:33
Get up and talk to me dear

1128
00:36:33 --> 00:36:37
You said you would make our son
like the football player Ronaldo

1129
00:36:37 --> 00:36:40
You said you would
make him study well

1130
00:36:40 --> 00:36:44
I&#39;ll make him study dear,
I&#39;ll make him a very good person

1131
00:36:44 --> 00:36:46
You were always talking about the Wall!

1132
00:36:46 --> 00:36:48
Today the wall has
taken you away

1133
00:36:48 --> 00:36:55
Were you born just to
taste death, my dearest

1134
00:36:55 --> 00:37:02
Leaving your kith in an eternal sorrow

1135
00:37:02 --> 00:37:09
Your memories never
die in our heart

1136
00:37:09 --> 00:37:16
Your authority never
ceases in this land

1137
00:37:16 --> 00:37:23
Your authority never
ceases in this land

1138
00:37:23 --> 00:37:30
Were you born just to
taste death, my dearest

1139
00:37:30 --> 00:37:37
Leaving your kith in an eternal sorrow

1140
00:37:37 --> 00:37:40
Where have you left in solitude?

1141
00:37:40 --> 00:37:45
We search for you everywhere

1142
00:37:45 --> 00:37:54
Having revolutionized the land,
have you taken up heaven now?

1143
00:37:54 --> 00:38:04
Having revolutionized the land,
have you taken up heaven now?

1144
00:38:04 --> 00:38:11
Why have you parted from us in solitude?

1145
00:38:11 --> 00:38:17
A day hasn’t passed without
tears of your memories

1146
00:38:17 --> 00:38:24
Were you born just to
taste death, my dearest

1147
00:38:24 --> 00:38:32
Leaving your kith in an eternal sorrow

1148
00:38:32 --> 00:38:33
I thought somehow we
should retrieve the wall

1149
00:38:33 --> 00:38:35
And take away all the authority
they had over us.

1150
00:38:35 --> 00:38:36
Now what are we going to give
for our lion, Anbu?

1151
00:38:36 --> 00:38:39
How many more are going to die
for this wall? Kill me first!

1152
00:38:39 --> 00:38:43
No one from are side should die,
If anyone that should be me

1153
00:38:43 --> 00:38:44
My dear hubby

1154
00:38:44 --> 00:38:49
You always used to say you like my
lip, Now come bite it dear! Bite!

1155
00:38:49 --> 00:38:56
Your journey of revolution had just begun

1156
00:38:56 --> 00:39:03
And you ended your life even before
tasting the light of change

1157
00:39:03 --> 00:39:10
Were you born just to
taste death, my dearest

1158
00:39:10 --> 00:39:18
Leaving your kith in an eternal sorrow

1159
00:39:18 --> 00:39:20
There is a house near Perambur for rent

1160
00:39:20 --> 00:39:23
Shall we move there for a
while, without any trouble

1161
00:39:23 --> 00:39:25
Dear, a change will make things better

1162
00:39:25 --> 00:39:27
Let&#39;s move to some other place

1163
00:39:27 --> 00:39:27
Why should we go?

1164
00:39:27 --> 00:39:29
This is my place
I will not go anywhere?

1165
00:39:29 --> 00:39:31
You want me to run like a coward?

1166
00:39:31 --> 00:39:31
Kaali is coming

1167
00:39:31 --> 00:39:33
- Hey dude welcome
- Good evening Pa!

1168
00:39:33 --> 00:39:35
- Aunt.
- Come in, why are you standing there?

1169
00:39:35 --> 00:39:37
Bloody sinners, look
how they&#39;ve cut him

1170
00:39:37 --> 00:39:38
If it had gone a bit deep
what would have happened?

1171
00:39:38 --> 00:39:40
I would have died

1172
00:39:40 --> 00:39:42
Why do you talk like that, You being
alive itself is just mere luck

1173
00:39:42 --> 00:39:43
I asked you not to go there,

1174
00:39:43 --> 00:39:44
Would any girl do such a thing?

1175
00:39:44 --> 00:39:45
I feel ashamed

1176
00:39:45 --> 00:39:47
Kaali, why do you have that?
Keep that aside

1177
00:39:47 --> 00:39:50
How are you? You fine?
What brings you here?

1178
00:39:50 --> 00:39:50
It&#39;s healed?

1179
00:39:50 --> 00:39:51
Leave it Kaali,
You don&#39;t know

1180
00:39:51 --> 00:39:52
I feel like half
of me is missing

1181
00:39:52 --> 00:39:52
How could they do this?

1182
00:39:52 --> 00:39:56
Kaali..I cant bear it
I cant even sleep at night

1183
00:39:56 --> 00:40:00
We have to kill Kannan,
We shouldn’t leave him

1184
00:40:00 --> 00:40:03
He should die,
I won&#39;t let him go

1185
00:40:03 --> 00:40:05
I&#39;ll do it,
Help me

1186
00:40:05 --> 00:40:06
How many more have to die?

1187
00:40:06 --> 00:40:07
We shouldn’t let him go

1188
00:40:07 --> 00:40:08
Right before my eyes

1189
00:40:08 --> 00:40:08
I won&#39;t

1190
00:40:08 --> 00:40:09
I&#39;ll be satisfied only after hacking him.

1191
00:40:09 --> 00:40:10
Why do you need to do this?

1192
00:40:10 --> 00:40:11
We are living a life without peace

1193
00:40:11 --> 00:40:14
You are educated, go work.
Look after your parents

1194
00:40:14 --> 00:40:15
Don&#39;t get angry

1195
00:40:15 --> 00:40:16
How can I keep calm?

1196
00:40:16 --> 00:40:17
Anbu died for me

1197
00:40:17 --> 00:40:19
I don&#39;t care if no one is with
me, I don&#39;t even need you

1198
00:40:19 --> 00:40:19
I know how to kill him

1199
00:40:19 --> 00:40:19
What do you know?

1200
00:40:19 --> 00:40:21
Look!
He too has lost his son

1201
00:40:21 --> 00:40:22
They&#39;ll have their eyes
wide open like an owl

1202
00:40:22 --> 00:40:24
Listen to me..
Keep calm

1203
00:40:24 --> 00:40:25
It&#39;s a duty to be done for Anbu

1204
00:40:25 --> 00:40:25
I&#39;ll do it

1205
00:40:25 --> 00:40:26
I know when to kill him

1206
00:40:26 --> 00:40:27
You think he is nobody to
be killed just like that?

1207
00:40:27 --> 00:40:29
Go!
Listen to me

1208
00:40:29 --> 00:40:30
Just keep quiet, even if he passes by

1209
00:40:30 --> 00:40:31
The silence is not of fear

1210
00:40:31 --> 00:40:33
That is to hit him back
understand

1211
00:40:33 --> 00:40:34
I&#39;ll take care Kaali

1212
00:40:34 --> 00:40:35
Leave your thoughts
behind and go home

1213
00:40:35 --> 00:40:38
Tell him to come. Where is he?
What is he doing?

1214
00:40:38 --> 00:40:39
I&#39;ll come home and kick you

1215
00:40:39 --> 00:40:40
Who do you think I am?

1216
00:40:40 --> 00:40:40
Kill him

1217
00:40:40 --> 00:40:42
Get in the car!
Get in the car brother!

1218
00:40:42 --> 00:40:43
Start the car!

1219
00:40:43 --> 00:40:45
Brother, get in

1220
00:40:45 --> 00:40:45
I&#39;m gonna kill you

1221
00:40:45 --> 00:40:46
What does he think of himself

1222
00:40:46 --> 00:40:47
Hey who are you, move aside

1223
00:40:47 --> 00:40:49
Kaali, the police are beating up dad

1224
00:40:49 --> 00:40:51
- Who is that?
- are you Kaali

1225
00:40:51 --> 00:40:53
- What do you need?
- What do you think of yourself?

1226
00:40:53 --> 00:40:54
raising your hand
against an educated

1227
00:40:54 --> 00:40:55
The police have hit my son

1228
00:40:55 --> 00:40:57
If you dare hit him now

1229
00:40:57 --> 00:40:59
Don&#39;t think I&#39;m being calm

1230
00:40:59 --> 00:41:00
I don&#39;t care even if you are the police

1231
00:41:00 --> 00:41:02
They have seen him, trying to kill

1232
00:41:02 --> 00:41:03
Is he dead?

1233
00:41:03 --> 00:41:05
How much did he give?
Shall I give you more?

1234
00:41:05 --> 00:41:07
Kaali, take dad inside

1235
00:41:07 --> 00:41:10
Granny first murder will be
Shouting out loud always

1236
00:41:10 --> 00:41:12
- Are you some whore or wolf
- Jhonny keep quiet

1237
00:41:12 --> 00:41:15
It&#39;s become an issue, there&#39;s a case booked
on his name and you are letting him go!

1238
00:41:15 --> 00:41:17
Maari said he&#39;ll give you the cash
Is the case still there

1239
00:41:17 --> 00:41:18
What have you done?
Even after what I told

1240
00:41:18 --> 00:41:19
Go! Go to the Police station

1241
00:41:19 --> 00:41:20
They have filed an attempt to murder case.

1242
00:41:20 --> 00:41:21
You all go bow to him now!

1243
00:41:21 --> 00:41:21
What to do Maari?

1244
00:41:21 --> 00:41:23
Why are you asking me? Ask your
son, who thinks too much of himself

1245
00:41:23 --> 00:41:24
We just lost one of us

1246
00:41:24 --> 00:41:26
They don&#39;t mind killing anyone,
and you are giving them a reason

1247
00:41:26 --> 00:41:28
Do you want me to keep quiet?
He would have died

1248
00:41:28 --> 00:41:30
No one has raised hands
against my husband

1249
00:41:30 --> 00:41:32
Why were you born to me?

1250
00:41:32 --> 00:41:36
Due to your short temper, have you
realised what kind of problem we are in?

1251
00:41:36 --> 00:41:37
Let it go! Don&#39;t raise
your hand on a grown up

1252
00:41:37 --> 00:41:39
Anbu is just your friend,
He is like my son

1253
00:41:39 --> 00:41:42
Do you think I&#39;ll let them go?
Let me take care of this

1254
00:41:42 --> 00:41:44
You know how difficult it was to
take your name off Perumal case?

1255
00:41:44 --> 00:41:46
Don&#39;t let your son get away, hold on to him

1256
00:41:46 --> 00:41:47
I&#39;ll take care

1257
00:41:47 --> 00:41:49
At this age they tend to be angry.
Advice him

1258
00:41:49 --> 00:41:51
What other work do you have?
Can you get back the life once lost?

1259
00:41:51 --> 00:41:52
- Take care
- Ok

1260
00:41:52 --> 00:41:55
Kaali, very soon you&#39;ll get
good news

1261
00:41:55 --> 00:41:57
I&#39;ll play
You just watch

1262
00:41:57 --> 00:41:58
He must die in my hands

1263
00:41:58 --> 00:41:58
I&#39;ll call you

1264
00:41:58 --> 00:41:58
Shut up, mom

1265
00:41:58 --> 00:42:00
Anbu abandoned Mary only after a while

1266
00:42:00 --> 00:42:02
I think he will abandon you right away

1267
00:42:02 --> 00:42:03
He isn&#39;t happy seeing me

1268
00:42:03 --> 00:42:05
He feels relieved seeing you

1269
00:42:05 --> 00:42:06
Don&#39;t leave my son, dear

1270
00:42:06 --> 00:42:08
Your son came back alive just for me aunty

1271
00:42:08 --> 00:42:11
Why are you looking like this?
What do you want?

1272
00:42:11 --> 00:42:12
You!

1273
00:42:12 --> 00:42:14
Hey..
What are you looking?

1274
00:42:14 --> 00:42:16
- No! Mom would come
- let her

1275
00:42:16 --> 00:42:18
The tablets are finished
I&#39;ll go buy some

1276
00:42:18 --> 00:42:19
I&#39;ll be back

1277
00:42:19 --> 00:42:21
She saw us, right?

1278
00:42:21 --> 00:42:24
Dear, you smiled
You smiled!

1279
00:42:24 --> 00:42:26
- Idiot, Mom saw us
- so what?

1280
00:42:26 --> 00:42:32
You! Me! Us!
My love! My life!

1281
00:42:32 --> 00:42:38
You! Me! Us!
Found life in us!

1282
00:42:38 --> 00:42:43
I am a blossoming flower

1283
00:42:43 --> 00:42:48
You are the thirst of the flower.

1284
00:42:48 --> 00:42:52
I am the sky for the birds,

1285
00:42:52 --> 00:42:56
Come and glaze through me.

1286
00:42:56 --> 00:42:59
I’m the courageous fire

1287
00:42:59 --> 00:43:03
You’re the one to control me

1288
00:43:03 --> 00:43:08
I am a blossoming flower

1289
00:43:08 --> 00:43:12
You are the thirst of the flower.

1290
00:43:12 --> 00:43:18
Even a thorn will be my nest

1291
00:43:18 --> 00:43:22
Your path will be shed with roses

1292
00:43:22 --> 00:43:28
Even a river fish will
find its way to the ocean

1293
00:43:28 --> 00:43:32
I long for your arrival, my dear

1294
00:43:32 --> 00:43:37
I am a blossoming flower

1295
00:43:37 --> 00:43:42
You are the thirst of the flower.

1296
00:43:42 --> 00:43:48
The sound of burning rocks
will become the melody of life

1297
00:43:48 --> 00:43:53
Is there a heart without
love in this world?

1298
00:43:53 --> 00:43:59
Within your eyes of vengeance
will blossom a beautiful love

1299
00:43:59 --> 00:44:04
Won’t you stay by my side

1300
00:44:04 --> 00:44:05
How much do you like me?

1301
00:44:05 --> 00:44:06
So... Little

1302
00:44:06 --> 00:44:07
Shall I tell you one thing
- Whats it?

1303
00:44:07 --> 00:44:08
- At first, I never had any love for you
- Hmm

1304
00:44:08 --> 00:44:10
Anbu and my friends made
it up that I loved you

1305
00:44:10 --> 00:44:12
Then with what you told, I
confirmed that you loved me

1306
00:44:12 --> 00:44:12
What did I say?

1307
00:44:12 --> 00:44:15
When I was hurt, you asked me by
that pump... I too apologised

1308
00:44:15 --> 00:44:17
&quot;That&#39;s not true then?&quot;, that&#39;s
when I realised you love me

1309
00:44:17 --> 00:44:18
Only then I knew you loved me

1310
00:44:18 --> 00:44:19
You took it that way?

1311
00:44:19 --> 00:44:23
Truly you don’t love
me, is it just a lie

1312
00:44:23 --> 00:44:25
I was just asking it
like any another

1313
00:44:25 --> 00:44:26
Did you ask so?

1314
00:44:26 --> 00:44:27
So that was not true

1315
00:44:27 --> 00:44:29
I was a fool to fall for that

1316
00:44:29 --> 00:44:33
Truly, I still don&#39;t
know why I like you

1317
00:44:33 --> 00:44:34
Hmmm... I casted a spell on you!

1318
00:44:34 --> 00:44:35
That&#39;s right you&#39;re a charmer!

1319
00:44:35 --> 00:44:38
Only after I scolded you,
I started liking you

1320
00:44:38 --> 00:44:39
Your mom too spoke to me

1321
00:44:39 --> 00:44:44
- What did she say? - While in an
Auto, a fellow was troubling me

1322
00:44:44 --> 00:44:45
She argued with him

1323
00:44:45 --> 00:44:47
That day she gave me jasmine...

1324
00:44:47 --> 00:44:49
My son loves you a lot

1325
00:44:49 --> 00:44:50
Why did you reject him?

1326
00:44:50 --> 00:44:51
My son is in distress

1327
00:44:51 --> 00:44:54
You&#39;ll never get a
guy better than him

1328
00:44:54 --> 00:44:55
Please accept my son

1329
00:44:55 --> 00:44:57
She showered her love on me.

1330
00:44:57 --> 00:45:00
- Did my mom say so?
- Really your mom is great, right?

1331
00:45:00 --> 00:45:01
Truly there are many
good people around you

1332
00:45:01 --> 00:45:05
Mom, Dad, Mary, Anbu and your friends

1333
00:45:05 --> 00:45:08
Yeah Kalai, everyone
around me is good

1334
00:45:08 --> 00:45:09
Anbu!

1335
00:45:09 --> 00:45:10
Telling that name makes me shiver

1336
00:45:10 --> 00:45:14
Looking at him I realised that
friends could also be like him

1337
00:45:14 --> 00:45:15
He took care of me like that

1338
00:45:15 --> 00:45:19
If anyone talks bad about
me, he would get angry

1339
00:45:19 --> 00:45:20
He doesn&#39;t care who ever it is

1340
00:45:20 --> 00:45:21
Even before his death

1341
00:45:21 --> 00:45:22
You have to settle down soon dude

1342
00:45:22 --> 00:45:23
he was talking about our marriage

1343
00:45:23 --> 00:45:26
Che, why did I remind
you of that again?

1344
00:45:26 --> 00:45:29
Leave it!
Lets talk something else

1345
00:45:29 --> 00:45:32
That&#39;s not the case Kalai,
You know how he is?

1346
00:45:32 --> 00:45:33
He never cared about himself

1347
00:45:33 --> 00:45:34
Do something for the people

1348
00:45:34 --> 00:45:36
He always wanted to make things
better for the guys in our area

1349
00:45:36 --> 00:45:38
He&#39;ll be thinking of that all the time

1350
00:45:38 --> 00:45:43
The money he earns, instead of paying his
son&#39;s fees, he&#39;d give to anyone who asks.

1351
00:45:43 --> 00:45:48
I swear, just like he was killed,
I&#39;ll kill them all without mercy

1352
00:45:48 --> 00:45:49
You have such a thought in you?

1353
00:45:49 --> 00:45:50
What after killing them?

1354
00:45:50 --> 00:45:51
When I&#39;m totally depending on you...

1355
00:45:51 --> 00:45:55
At least, if you had thought about me,
would you say such a thing

1356
00:45:55 --> 00:45:56
What are you talking?
Think from my side

1357
00:45:56 --> 00:45:59
How can you think like that?
You never thought about me?

1358
00:45:59 --> 00:46:01
To somebody who means the life to you?

1359
00:46:01 --> 00:46:02
How will I not think of you?

1360
00:46:02 --> 00:46:07
I swear. The only reason I haven’t done
anything wrong is because of you.

1361
00:46:07 --> 00:46:08
How much do you like me?

1362
00:46:08 --> 00:46:10
This much..
More...

1363
00:46:10 --> 00:46:11
More than this world!

1364
00:46:11 --> 00:46:15
- I&#39;ll ask you one thing, tell me the truth
- Ask..

1365
00:46:15 --> 00:46:19
Do you like me or Anbu brother?

1366
00:46:19 --> 00:46:23
- Are you insane?
- yes.. I am mad about you

1367
00:46:23 --> 00:46:25
I&#39;ve come believing you are my life
Yes I am a fool

1368
00:46:25 --> 00:46:26
If you like me would
you have such thoughts?

1369
00:46:26 --> 00:46:27
Who do you like?
Tell!

1370
00:46:27 --> 00:46:30
He&#39;s dead and you are comparing him!

1371
00:46:30 --> 00:46:32
I like you.. Enough?

1372
00:46:32 --> 00:46:33
Don&#39;t lie for my sake dear

1373
00:46:33 --> 00:46:36
Shall I die
Then will you say that it&#39;s me?

1374
00:46:36 --> 00:46:37
Why are you talking like this?

1375
00:46:37 --> 00:46:38
Tell me, who it is?

1376
00:46:38 --> 00:46:39
Anbu! Now what?

1377
00:46:39 --> 00:46:42
Go..Go away
Never come back

1378
00:46:42 --> 00:46:44
Hey.. Why did you come here

1379
00:46:44 --> 00:46:47
Why did you come back? He was
more important to you right?

1380
00:46:47 --> 00:46:49
You&#39;ve decided to disgrace me

1381
00:46:49 --> 00:46:53
What more your going to do? She went against
her parents for you. forget her now

1382
00:46:53 --> 00:46:55
She&#39;s gone! And she is
more stubborn than you

1383
00:46:55 --> 00:46:59
Kalai.. Kalai.. Sorry Kalai..
Your the most important.

1384
00:46:59 --> 00:47:01
Stop Kalai!
I&#39;m telling you to stop

1385
00:47:01 --> 00:47:04
The glittering moon doesn’t
rest when sky glazes!

1386
00:47:04 --> 00:47:07
How can I rest when you
stay farther from me

1387
00:47:07 --> 00:47:10
The glittering moon doesn’t
rest when sky glazes!

1388
00:47:10 --> 00:47:13
How can I rest when you
stay farther from me

1389
00:47:13 --> 00:47:16
The hay-man has no
kindred souls for him

1390
00:47:16 --> 00:47:19
My hands are without impressions
when you take my love away

1391
00:47:19 --> 00:47:24
Seems like oceans dry up in my eyes,
Until you and I unite.

1392
00:47:24 --> 00:47:30
Seems like oceans dry up in my eyes,
Until you and I unite.

1393
00:47:30 --> 00:47:31
Is it your Job to follow me

1394
00:47:31 --> 00:47:32
Don&#39;t you have a job

1395
00:47:32 --> 00:47:35
No one in the world rents love,

1396
00:47:35 --> 00:47:37
Why am I deprived of one..

1397
00:47:37 --> 00:47:43
Let the soul leave the body
Not your memories..

1398
00:47:43 --> 00:47:48
All I remember and see is your dazzling
beauty, And that’s what I cherish

1399
00:47:48 --> 00:47:55
Seems like oceans dry up in my eyes,
Until you and I unite.

1400
00:47:55 --> 00:47:58
Don&#39;t take me wrong, It&#39;s all for the good

1401
00:47:58 --> 00:48:01
Love is blind, not handicapped

1402
00:48:01 --> 00:48:03
Why did you go far from my reach

1403
00:48:03 --> 00:48:06
Migrant birds doesn’t settle in a place

1404
00:48:06 --> 00:48:08
But your nest is in my heart

1405
00:48:08 --> 00:48:14
The one place where you’ll stay safe
As the shooting stars in the sky

1406
00:48:14 --> 00:48:15
Why are you honking?

1407
00:48:15 --> 00:48:16
Yesterday, why didn&#39;t
you come to see me?

1408
00:48:16 --> 00:48:17
You&#39;ve things more important than me

1409
00:48:17 --> 00:48:18
Hereafter, if you follow me..

1410
00:48:18 --> 00:48:24
Seems like oceans dry up in my eyes,
Until you and I unite.

1411
00:48:24 --> 00:48:30
Seems like oceans dry up in my eyes,
Until you and I unite.

1412
00:48:30 --> 00:48:32
- Kalai, one minute..
- What?

1413
00:48:32 --> 00:48:35
- I like you only
- Oh! I believe that!!

1414
00:48:35 --> 00:48:37
Hey, I&#39;m talking to you
What the hell do you want?

1415
00:48:37 --> 00:48:40
What? I want you..
Will you marry me?

1416
00:48:40 --> 00:48:41
Then come sit in my bike
Only then will I marry you

1417
00:48:41 --> 00:48:44
The glittering moon doesn’t
rest when sky glazes

1418
00:48:44 --> 00:48:47
How can I rest when you
stay farther from me

1419
00:48:47 --> 00:48:50
The glittering moon doesn’t
rest when sky glazes

1420
00:48:50 --> 00:48:53
How can I rest when you
stay farther from me

1421
00:48:53 --> 00:48:56
The hay-man has no
kindred souls for him

1422
00:48:56 --> 00:48:59
My hands are without impressions
when you take my love away

1423
00:48:59 --> 00:49:02
Seems like oceans dry up in my eyes,
Until you and I unite.

1424
00:49:02 --> 00:49:05
Until you and I unite.

1425
00:49:05 --> 00:49:08
Seems like oceans dry up in my eyes,

1426
00:49:08 --> 00:49:10
Until you and I unite.

1427
00:49:10 --> 00:49:12
Groom, do you like the bride?

1428
00:49:12 --> 00:49:13
Hmm.. I like her a lot

1429
00:49:13 --> 00:49:15
- Do you like the groom?
- Hmm..

1430
00:49:15 --> 00:49:17
Then what, exchange the garlands

1431
00:49:17 --> 00:49:17
Stop this!

1432
00:49:17 --> 00:49:20
What&#39;s the dowry  going to be?
please share that with everyone

1433
00:49:20 --> 00:49:21
- That is not needed Uncle
- You keep quiet

1434
00:49:21 --> 00:49:22
I&#39;ve been talking,
ask them to reply

1435
00:49:22 --> 00:49:25
- Dad, ask them -You mention your demands,
they&#39;ll let you know if that&#39;s possible

1436
00:49:25 --> 00:49:27
We&#39;ll ask for a aeroplane
Will you be giving it?

1437
00:49:27 --> 00:49:29
Is he the king of Egypt
Ask what you need

1438
00:49:29 --> 00:49:31
One car, and 50 sovereign gold

1439
00:49:31 --> 00:49:33
Would you need a big truck
to carry all your things

1440
00:49:33 --> 00:49:34
Are you trying to mock me?

1441
00:49:34 --> 00:49:36
If it&#39;s not possible
let them say..

1442
00:49:36 --> 00:49:38
Ask your son to become a collector
we&#39;ll do what you ask for

1443
00:49:38 --> 00:49:40
After that will you give
us a truck load of goods?

1444
00:49:40 --> 00:49:42
You can&#39;t give us a reply
here, and you&#39;re talking

1445
00:49:42 --> 00:49:44
Thought you were wise people

1446
00:49:44 --> 00:49:46
But seems like you&#39;ll stop
this marriage by fighting

1447
00:49:46 --> 00:49:48
Look, my daughter-in-law is like gold

1448
00:49:48 --> 00:49:50
Why do we need more?
Let them do what they like

1449
00:49:50 --> 00:49:51
I&#39;ll do what it needs
for my daughter-in-law

1450
00:49:51 --> 00:49:53
What do we have to talk anymore?
My wife has said it

1451
00:49:53 --> 00:49:56
We are going to take her home
without an ounce of gold, what do you say?

1452
00:49:56 --> 00:49:58
What do you think? We&#39;ll
just let her go like that?

1453
00:49:58 --> 00:50:01
You&#39;ll be blown away from what we
are going to do for our daughter

1454
00:50:01 --> 00:50:03
Then what are we waiting for. Exchange
the garlands I&#39;m hungry, lets go eat

1455
00:50:03 --> 00:50:09
Seems like oceans dry up in my eyes,
Until you and I unite.

1456
00:50:09 --> 00:50:14
The Peoples republic front has
joined hand with the Peoples front...

1457
00:50:14 --> 00:50:16
Just because they&#39;ve joined hands, will we?

1458
00:50:16 --> 00:50:18
This is not a recently formed rivalry We
should never let his shadow fall upon us.

1459
00:50:18 --> 00:50:21
We should astound them with our
political campaign, looking at which...

1460
00:50:21 --> 00:50:23
...they should handover
this constituency to us

1461
00:50:23 --> 00:50:25
Tomorrow put up a
Street corner conference

1462
00:50:25 --> 00:50:32
We welcome Vyasar&#39;s silver star
Maari to this conference

1463
00:50:32 --> 00:50:41
We also welcome our well wishers and
youthful supporters on behalf of Maari

1464
00:50:41 --> 00:50:42
Whats this!
Kannan is coming

1465
00:50:42 --> 00:50:45
The decision of coalition,
has brought happiness

1466
00:50:45 --> 00:50:49
To respect that decision, our
former MLA Kannan of this division...

1467
00:50:49 --> 00:50:52
...will be presenting
Maari with the shawl

1468
00:50:52 --> 00:50:54
Enough Maari!
Enough with our fighting!

1469
00:50:54 --> 00:50:58
Our party joining hands doesn&#39;t matter, we
should join, our men should join hands

1470
00:50:58 --> 00:51:00
We should be together and
serve the people well

1471
00:51:00 --> 00:51:01
I&#39;ll leave

1472
00:51:01 --> 00:51:01
Jhonny

1473
00:51:01 --> 00:51:03
Bloody sinners, have forgotten
everything that has happened

1474
00:51:03 --> 00:51:04
and now have joined hands
with the same party

1475
00:51:04 --> 00:51:05
What kind of justice is this?

1476
00:51:05 --> 00:51:07
Did I go?
He is the one who came

1477
00:51:07 --> 00:51:09
High command decides
something, can we defy it?

1478
00:51:09 --> 00:51:11
Just because we are in alliance
I&#39;m not gonna be cooing with him

1479
00:51:11 --> 00:51:12
He&#39;s always my enemy

1480
00:51:12 --> 00:51:16
For Mari to win we have to unite,
How long can we keep fighting?

1481
00:51:16 --> 00:51:17
I&#39;ll hack you Jhonny

1482
00:51:17 --> 00:51:19
Once upon in this area
my father died

1483
00:51:19 --> 00:51:20
..Because of this Kannan

1484
00:51:20 --> 00:51:24
Will hack you guys down if you enter
the area with a party flag, I&#39;m alone!

1485
00:51:24 --> 00:51:25
Mari

1486
00:51:25 --> 00:51:28
Vote for Maari, okay

1487
00:51:28 --> 00:51:31

1491
00:51:33 --> 00:51:35

00:51:54 --> 00:51:57
- If you say anything, I&#39;ll kiss you
right here -don&#39;t ask for too much!

1503
00:51:57 --> 00:51:58
Are you teasing me? Don&#39;t piss me off..

1504
00:51:58 --> 00:51:59
You&#39;ve been acting too smart!

1505

00:52:02 --> 00:52:03
I&#39;m gonna give it to the people

1510
00:52:03 --> 00:52:06
I have to move away from all
this party, position and power

1511
00:52:06 --> 00:52:07
You&#39;ve to grow Maari

1512

Without any trouble

1520
00:52:24 --> 00:52:26
It&#39;s all in your hands

1521
00:52:26 --> 00:52:28

00:52:36 --> 00:52:38
Kaali, No! I&#39;m with my
family, I know nothing

1530
00:52:38 --> 00:52:38
What&#39;s it bro?

1531
00:52:38 --> 00:52:40
I did nothing
It was all Maari&#39;s plan

1532
00:52:40 --> 00:52:43
I was just part of it, I know nothing
Leave me! Leave me!

1533
00:52:43 --> 00:52:43
See who that is

1534
00:52:43 --> 00:52:44

00:52:44 --> 00:52:45

1536
00:52:45 --> 00:52:45
Why are you hitting me?

1537
00:52:45 --> 00:52:48
Maari was the one who planned the
murder of Anbu, why don&#39;t you go ask him?

1538
00:52:48 --> 00:52:52
Take it! Take it!
It&#39;s all yours

1541
00:53:01 --> 00:53:03
My son&#39;s head is shattered

1542
00:53:03 --> 00:53:04
My only son, Maari!

1543
00:53:04 --> 00:53:06
Don&#39;t have to do it for me?
Kill him for your good

1544
00:53:06 --> 00:53:08
Whatever you think
will happen, I&#39;m there

1545
00:53:08 --> 00:53:09
Kaali is here with me

1546
00:53:09 --> 00:53:11
- Stand up! Stand up!
- Whats all this for?

1547
00:53:11 --> 00:53:12
No one can win over you

1548
00:53:12 --> 00:53:16
By the grace of God I&#39;m blessing you
wholeheartedly, No one can beat you

1549
00:53:16 --> 00:53:17
Anything this granny
says will happen,

1550
00:53:17 --> 00:53:19
You&#39;ve won this Bro,
You are the next MLA

1551
00:53:19 --> 00:53:19
It&#39;s us hereafter

1552
00:53:19 --> 00:53:22
It&#39;s all your blessings
It&#39;s gonna be good times ahead

1553
00:53:22 --> 00:53:24
The dispute with
Kannan is gonna end today

1554
00:53:24 --> 00:53:26
Kannan said that there will be no more
disagreements regarding the wall.

1555
00:53:26 --> 00:53:27
How would it?

1556
00:53:27 --> 00:53:29
Welcome Jhonny!
You must be my activist

1557
00:53:29 --> 00:53:31
- Ok Jhonny
- Just rock with your english

1558
00:53:31 --> 00:53:34
Jhonny, you don&#39;t worry Jhonny
I&#39;ll let everyone know about you

1559
00:53:34 --> 00:53:35
We must file our
nomination in style

1560
00:53:35 --> 00:53:37
Don&#39;t worry bro, The whole
town will be by your side

1561
00:53:37 --> 00:53:40
Looking at the crowd that comes
they will select you unopposed

1562
00:53:40 --> 00:53:43
- Just one thing, If Anbu was there...
- It would have been different

1563
00:53:43 --> 00:53:44
Welcome Kaali

1564
00:53:44 --> 00:53:46
He has got a nomination
We&#39;ve to make him win the elections

1565
00:53:46 --> 00:53:47
I saw Anil

1566
00:53:47 --> 00:53:49
What?
What did he say?

1567
00:53:49 --> 00:53:51
No, Kaali
Don&#39;t trust Anil?

1568
00:53:51 --> 00:53:52
Anbu, is like my son

1569
00:53:52 --> 00:53:53
What&#39;s your problem?

1570
00:53:53 --> 00:53:55
Anbu was so loyal to you

1571
00:53:55 --> 00:53:58
He celebrated you,
We all thought you like our own brother

1572
00:53:58 --> 00:53:59
What made you do that?

1573
00:53:59 --> 00:54:01
You deceived us to surrender
and slit his throat

1574
00:54:01 --> 00:54:02
What have this sinner done?

1575
00:54:02 --> 00:54:04
Just because Anbu will grow, you
fell for the greed of Kannan&#39;s money

1576
00:54:04 --> 00:54:05
He pretended to be a
good man in front of us

1577
00:54:05 --> 00:54:07
Hey, you have hit
your brother know?

1578
00:54:07 --> 00:54:08
Would I be disloyal
to my people?

1579
00:54:08 --> 00:54:09
They won&#39;t believe you

1580
00:54:09 --> 00:54:12
They are my people

1581
00:54:12 --> 00:54:16
From then to now these people have
been believing you and your father

1582
00:54:16 --> 00:54:17
For all these years you
never listened to my words

1583
00:54:17 --> 00:54:18
You were all his scapegoats

1584
00:54:18 --> 00:54:20
What&#39;s your problem?
He&#39;s is a respectable person

1585
00:54:20 --> 00:54:22
He&#39;s not worthy,
He&#39;s a traitor

1586
00:54:22 --> 00:54:24
He has done a lot for us
Please calm down

1587
00:54:24 --> 00:54:27
Jhonny, he&#39;s next,
Finish him when it&#39;s the right time

1588
00:54:27 --> 00:54:28
In politics, there are slaves waiting

1589
00:54:28 --> 00:54:29
For us what is important is only Politics

1590
00:54:29 --> 00:54:31
He&#39;s next
Have a Look!

1591
00:54:31 --> 00:54:33
What? Are you guys kidding me?

1592
00:54:33 --> 00:54:34
Don&#39;t think I&#39;m being calm

1593
00:54:34 --> 00:54:36
You guys are nothing but dogs
wagging your tails salivating!

1594
00:54:36 --> 00:54:38
Look at him, This is what he is...

1595
00:54:38 --> 00:54:40
Who are you calling dogs? You
were the one who came begging to us

1596
00:54:40 --> 00:54:41
Look at the girl&#39;s face

1597
00:54:41 --> 00:54:45
See What you have done to her,
cant imagine what all you’ll do to us.

1598
00:54:45 --> 00:54:47
He killed Anbu, don&#39;t let
him go.. hack him down

1599
00:54:47 --> 00:54:51
You guys will talk like this now,
but later you&#39;ll again go behind him

1600
00:54:51 --> 00:54:55
We should show him that he is not the only
one, We have to unite and let him know that

1601
00:54:55 --> 00:54:56
Killing him is not enough

1602
00:54:56 --> 00:55:01
We have to deprive him of the greed for
politics for which he took Anbu&#39;s life

1603
00:55:01 --> 00:55:03
They kept fooling us with
this wall all these days

1604
00:55:03 --> 00:55:06
First we have to destroy this and
show them that they can&#39;t touch us

1605
00:55:06 --> 00:55:09
Don&#39;t touch that wall,
then it will kill you!

1606
00:55:09 --> 00:55:10
See what&#39;s gonna happen to the wall

1607
00:55:10 --> 00:55:11
Hey dude, don&#39;t

1608
00:55:11 --> 00:55:13
Don&#39;t do it Kaali
- Watch!

1609
00:55:13 --> 00:55:15
Bro, sorry

1610
00:55:15 --> 00:55:17
Your death is in my hand

1611
00:55:17 --> 00:55:18
Do what you can

1612
00:55:18 --> 00:55:19
Bro, Sorry

1613
00:55:19 --> 00:55:22
Kaali has come!
You can&#39;t do anything

1614
00:55:22 --> 00:55:24
Looking at your face it&#39;s clear
that you&#39;re a dog which hunts Rabbits

1615
00:55:24 --> 00:55:25
Bro, clean yourself

1616
00:55:25 --> 00:55:28
I would have finished
him the day he hit me..

1617
00:55:28 --> 00:55:31
It&#39;s gone..
They have ruined my father&#39;s image

1618
00:55:31 --> 00:55:35
- It&#39;s gone
- Bro, keep quite

1619
00:55:35 --> 00:55:36
Not now bro,
It&#39;s election time

1620
00:55:36 --> 00:55:37
F@#k the election

1621
00:55:37 --> 00:55:39
I&#39;ll kill you

1622
00:55:39 --> 00:55:40
I&#39;m there for you

1623
00:55:40 --> 00:55:41
We have to spill their blood

1624
00:55:41 --> 00:55:42
He&#39;s a phoenix nothing will happen to him

1625
00:55:42 --> 00:55:43
Bro, I&#39;ll do this

1626
00:55:43 --> 00:55:44
Who?
You?

1627
00:55:44 --> 00:55:47
Can you please just shut it?

1628
00:55:47 --> 00:55:49
I&#39;ve come. I&#39;ll finish it
Don&#39;t worry

1629
00:55:49 --> 00:55:52
The police will not be in town.
You do it boldly, I&#39;ll take care

1630
00:55:52 --> 00:55:54
- Are you scared?
- Why should I be scared?

1631
00:55:54 --> 00:55:55
Did you do anything wrong?

1632
00:55:55 --> 00:55:56
I&#39;ve looked around
There is no one here

1633
00:55:56 --> 00:55:58
I&#39;m keeping an eye
No one has come around &#39;G&#39; block

1634
00:55:58 --> 00:55:59
He&#39;s on the terrace of &#39;G&#39; block

1635
00:55:59 --> 00:56:02
Bloody cheater politician
Look at his face

1636
00:56:02 --> 00:56:03
What&#39;s it watchman?
What are you doing here?

1637
00:56:03 --> 00:56:06
If Kaali knows he&#39;ll finish you all,
Run away! Run!

1638
00:56:06 --> 00:56:08
What are you staring at!
One Blow! that’s it

1639
00:56:08 --> 00:56:10
- Finish him!
- Jhonny we were talking, whats all this?

1640
00:56:10 --> 00:56:13
Have to get married soon then

1641
00:56:13 --> 00:56:14
Shut up and keep walking

1642
00:56:14 --> 00:56:15

Leave quickly!

1643
00:56:15 --> 00:56:16

00:56:22 --> 00:56:27
- They have killed Jhonny

1648
00:56:27 --> 00:56:29
Why did you leave him alone?

1649
00:56:29 --> 00:56:31
He is still alive
Call an Auto!

1650
00:56:31 --> 00:56:33
- Hold him.. Lift him in
- Don&#39;t let them

1651
00:56:33 --> 00:56:36
Where are they?

1652
00:56:36 --> 00:56:36
Be with him

1653
00:56:36 --> 00:56:37
Ask them..

1654
00:56:37 --> 00:56:39

00:56:39 --> 00:56:40
- Did you see him?

1656
00:56:40 --> 00:56:43
- Lying to me?
- Get lost

1657
00:56:43 --> 00:56:43
Come on

1658
00:56:43 --> 00:56:46
He&#39;s at the crossroads,
I dare you to go there

1659
00:56:46 --> 00:56:46
Come on

1660
00:56:46 --> 00:56:48
Go search for him

1661
00:56:48 --> 00:56:49
Bro he is here
We&#39;ll catch him if he comes

1662
00:56:49 --> 00:56:52
Shiva? What happened Shiva?

1663
00:56:52 --> 00:56:55
- We are the ones who killed him
- Go catch them

1664
00:56:55 --> 00:56:58
Come!
Come here!

1665
00:56:58 --> 00:57:01
Catch him!
Don’t let him go!

1666
00:57:01 --> 00:57:03
Come on dude!
Get on!

1667
00:57:03 --> 00:57:05
- Hello, Come near Benny mills
- Super

1668
00:57:05 --> 00:57:07
Bro, he is cornered

1669
00:57:07 --> 00:57:09
This Viji is with you, let&#39;s take him out

1670
00:57:09 --> 00:57:11
Where are you hiding?
Come out

1671
00:57:11 --> 00:57:12
Dude, you leave

1672
00:57:12 --> 00:57:13
Viji, come!

1673
00:57:13 --> 00:57:14
After all these problems
This wall...

1674
00:57:14 --> 00:57:19
was bearing an awareness message
on education for the people

1675
00:57:19 --> 00:57:22
Viji became the next
power as he had wanted

1676
00:57:22 --> 00:57:24
- Whats this?
- Take it

1677
00:57:24 --> 00:57:27
Before I die, I should see my
fathers image on the wall

1678
00:57:27 --> 00:57:29
- Don&#39;t worry
- Only you can, you&#39;ve to do it Viji

1679
00:57:29 --> 00:57:31
I&#39;ll take care, don&#39;t worry
I do it and let you know

1680
00:57:31 --> 00:57:32
With just not education..

1681
00:57:32 --> 00:57:34
Political awareness and
rationality is needed for the

1682
00:57:34 --> 00:57:37
area children and taught them
with his family.. Kaali!

1683
00:57:37 --> 00:57:39
In order to gain respect for
humanity and to understand Social issues

1684
00:57:39 --> 00:57:41
Just education is not enough

1685
00:57:41 --> 00:57:43
Along with it we also require
knowledge of social politics...

1686
00:57:43 --> 00:57:45
...and social consciousness is needed,
shall we get started?

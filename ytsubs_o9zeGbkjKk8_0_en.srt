1
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:09,800
are the man

2
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:15,320
sam Harris on from Southern California
and

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,030
I was raised in a totally secular

4
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,460
homes I'm not not reacting in my
criticism of religion on

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,719
reacting against any kind a
fundamentalist upbringing in

6
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:28,948
I'm but nor was I told

7
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:32,219
that there was no got it was really not
a a

8
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,899
a subject to conversations on my my
rather strident criticism a religion

9
00:00:37,899 --> 00:00:41,488
is really a product above very recent
events in my case its

10
00:00:41,488 --> 00:00:45,399
September 11th 2001 so it's my my
upbringing isn't so

11
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:48,399
informative my views

12
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,140
at the moment

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,119
well it was two things one just

14
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,828
the and the rather obvious liability

15
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:04,469
religious certainty was was made
extraordinarily

16
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:09,109
clear on that day when we were having
people flying planes into our buildings

17
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:12,478
for explicitly religious reasons I'm

18
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:15,579
was was also made clear that we were
going to nah I

19
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:20,349
the religious rationale because of our
own attachment to our own religious

20
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:23,829
myths the only language we could find is
a culture to comfort ourselves

21
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:27,719
was to endorse our own cod talk so I i

22
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:31,469
suddenly saw faith plane both sides the
board

23
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:34,859
in a in a very dangerous game are we as
a nation

24
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,590
I E N prosecuting our war on terror
which was

25
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,049
obviously necessary thing to do though
calling it a war on terror think it's

26
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:43,880
rather silly

27
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:47,310
I'm but would we we were

28
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,409
Arkansas in ourselves with our own
religious certainties

29
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:53,830
you know he made a very much in the
language of Christian

30
00:01:53,829 --> 00:01:57,709
fundamentalism I have that the president
you comes before congress

31
00:01:57,709 --> 00:02:01,459
talks about God not being indifferent to
freedom in fear he

32
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:05,559
as an atheist I hear that exactly the
way I would hear someone say in

33
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,709
zoos is not a indifferent to freedom
unfair but it is a

34
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:12,170
on Canali strange an empty utterance

35
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:16,839
I'm and yet our culture is is

36
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,259
is now program not to notice how strange
an empty it is and it does really

37
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:24,879
significant work and so we see things
like stem cell research and

38
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,719
I'm other causes

39
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,030
that upon which the the lives and and

40
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,419
happiness have millions of people really
turn I

41
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:43,878
get subverted by religious thing can
explicitly religious thinking

42
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:48,578
Wes Malott I'm thinking about and
explore in

43
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:52,610
spiritual experience in our are
contemplative traditions mostly

44
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,849
in and eastern contacts in Buddhism and
Hinduism but

45
00:02:55,848 --> 00:02:59,679
have also CuZn red much of the
contemplative literature

46
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,079
Christianity and Judaism and Islam I'm

47
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:07,079
so I've been interested in religion for
at least 20 years

48
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:10,739
and interested in spiritual experience
and and

49
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,069
have spent a lot of time practicing
meditation and study in with

50
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:17,219
various meditation masters and Indian
the pollen

51
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:21,000
spendin months and weeks on on retreat

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,919
just practicing meditation I'm very much
the way up

53
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:27,988
you know monastic wouldn't in in the
Buddhist tradition

54
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,170
I'm so I i'm the concerns over

55
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,358
religious people the ethical and the

56
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:37,510
and the spiritual concerns are religious
people are something that I

57
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:42,310
I think I understand I take very
seriously a member I take very seriously

58
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:48,900
the possibility I love experience in the
world the way Buddha and Jesus another

59
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,189
famous patriarchs a major arts seem to
have experience the world and I

60
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:56,489
I think we want to actualize that kind
of experience me if it's possible to

61
00:03:56,489 --> 00:03:57,939
love your neighbor as yourself

62
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:01,239
I'm interested in learning how to do
that I'm

63
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:04,699
I just on the way to believe anything on
insufficient evidence in order to the

64
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:11,699
men

65
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,639
for what astonishes me when I read the
newspaper

66
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,150
are watching news is how many problems
are the direct result

67
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,339
what people believe about God me their
days while the New York Times Square

68
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:28,449
fully half of the stories are

69
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:32,479
he in a way that Sonic knowledge by the
the the paper

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,530
relate to people's religious convictions

71
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:38,609
I'm it's a mad

72
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,250
you know I mention the Virginia Tech
shooting this was that the role that

73
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,180
religion played in providing a context
for

74
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,220
the shooting was never really discussed
in the media but maybe we just hear that

75
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,229
the mother happened to be you know
devout Christian and

76
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:54,389
structure child from church to church in
search of exorcism

77
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:58,228
I'm I just try to see

78
00:04:58,228 --> 00:05:01,639
continually our attention bound up

79
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,139
in these competing in

80
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:08,389
ideas about God I at best

81
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:12,220
this is this is often just a waste of
time but it worse

82
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,229
it is just it is manufacturing violence
and and

83
00:05:15,228 --> 00:05:18,959
unnecessary conflict and misuses over
resources

84
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,909
and what's more it is it is very rare
that we acknowledge me now are beginning

85
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,280
to acknowledge the role that Islam is
plain

86
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:30,619
in in Muslim terrorism

87
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,189
but even that has been very slow

88
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:37,589
to come minutes but it has been obvious
for many many years long before

89
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:38,728
September 11th

90
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:41,909
that a certain style love I love

91
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,960
Muslim infatuation was leading into this
kinda

92
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:51,269
jihadi behavior I'm where we because a

93
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:54,509
the respect we accord religious faith
were very slow to

94
00:05:54,509 --> 00:06:00,800
to acknowledge that sits causal role in
in conflict

95
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,810
why I think the biggest challenge as a
matter a discourse and debate

96
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,800
I'm concerning the most frustrating
challenge is

97
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,290
he is what comes from otherwise secular
and even

98
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,450
non believing people who are just

99
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:21,909
reluctant to admit how much mad work is
being done

100
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,710
because our religion in this world may
be either can't believe that people

101
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:29,329
really believe this stuff years when a
suicide bomber blows himself up in

102
00:06:29,329 --> 00:06:33,029
in a crowd of children I'm this secular

103
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:37,689
type of person will imagine that was in
religion

104
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:40,668
and there was no I hadn't had nothing to
do with a belief in paradise and 72

105
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,639
virgins who believe that if this is

106
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,569
this is a some kind of psychological
aberration or it's a

107
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:51,310
is caused by economic desperation or our
policies in the region means not

108
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,800
matter love metaphysical believes I'm

109
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,629
I think the the jury is in on this I
mean we know

110
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:02,689
that that people really do believe these
things they are telling us ad nauseam

111
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:03,709
they believe these things

112
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:07,639
and I don't think there's any more
powerful rhetorical device

113
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,870
for emphasis then blow yourself up for
four or fly a plane into a building

114
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,889
these people are really willing to die

115
00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:17,759
I for what they believe

116
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,810
and we know it's not a matter by going
to speak specifically about the Muslim

117
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,389
world from we know it's not a matter of
economics and

118
00:07:24,389 --> 00:07:28,649
and education because you know in this
recent plot in in the UK these are all

119
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:32,668
doctors who are who are aspiring suicide
bombers me how you know

120
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:36,620
how much more education did these
doctors need one was a neurosurgeon

121
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,329
you know you if I mean neurosurgeon
suicide bomber and you tell me the

122
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:42,409
problem is education and economics its

123
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,530
it clearly isn't and I'm

124
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:48,538
the deeper problem and I think a far
more

125
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:52,649
sinister problem is that it is possible
to be well-educated so well educated

126
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:54,089
that you can be a neurosurgeon

127
00:07:54,089 --> 00:07:58,019
and still believe that you can get 72
virgins in paradise and this is made

128
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:58,819
possible

129
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:02,930
by the fact that we have allowed a
certain

130
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,978
motive thought religion to thrive in

131
00:08:06,978 --> 00:08:11,158
in a bit in a I'm a cocoon

132
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:16,329
love this is hereof protection from
criticism is just taboo to criticize

133
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:23,329
people's religious themes

134
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:32,720
well that this is a I'm a common
criticism the idea that the atheist is

135
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,279
guilty over up a literal it's really not
scripture

136
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,129
I no better than the reading a
fundamental essence very naive

137
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:44,070
way of approaching religion and there's
a far more sophisticated and nuanced

138
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:45,070
view

139
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,110
religion I on offer in the atheists
disregarding that

140
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,159
I'm few problems with his first is

141
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:57,120
anyone making that argument is is
failing to acknowledge

142
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,600
just how many people really do approach

143
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,470
these texts literally or functionally me
love whether their selective literalist

144
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,460
or literal

145
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,590
all the way down the line there is a the
there are certain passages in these in

146
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,170
Scripture that this cannot be read

147
00:09:11,169 --> 00:09:14,309
figuratively I'm and

148
00:09:14,309 --> 00:09:17,959
people really do live by the lights

149
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,530
above what is literally laid out in
these books so you know the Koran says

150
00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:25,659
hate the infertile and Muslims hate the
infertile because the koran spells it

151
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:26,049
out

152
00:09:26,049 --> 00:09:30,039
ad nauseam I'm now

153
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:33,899
it's true that you can

154
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:38,120
cherry-pick scripture and you can look
for all the good parts you can ignore

155
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,429
where it says in love the case that a
for

156
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:44,199
a woman is not a virgin on our wedding
night stoned to death on a father's

157
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,620
doorstep you can ignore that and now it
to my knowledge all Jews and Christians

158
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,759
do ignore that in fact that's not true
there some Christians who actually

159
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,580
doing a reconstruction is Christian
dominions Christians in the US who will

160
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,680
say and I think the

161
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,269
the pally for adultery should be death
into their their people who are

162
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:05,090
have the courage of their convictions
there I'm but most of us

163
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:09,740
most religious people ignore those
pastors which really can only be you

164
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,590
red literally I'm and say that all they
were only appropriate for the time and

165
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,340
they don't don't apply now and

166
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:22,090
likewise muslims tried to have the same
reading a passage is that advocate holy

167
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,050
war until these were appropriate to
those

168
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:27,319
battles that Muhammad was fine but now
we don't have to fight those battles

169
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,640
I'm this is all up a good thing

170
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:34,439
but which recognize what is what's that

171
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,290
what's happening here people are feeling
pressure from the host love

172
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:43,179
all too human concerns that have nothing
in principle to do with God

173
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:48,429
I mean secularism and human rights and
democracy and scientific progress

174
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:51,459
these have have made certain passages in
scripture

175
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,830
untenable okay so this is coming from
outside religion

176
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,090
and religion is now making a great show
up its sophistication in

177
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,139
kinda grappling with these with these
pressures

178
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:06,049
I'm but once again this is this is a

179
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:09,189
example if religion losing the argument
with maternity

180
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:12,850
example busy you to know the recent
shooting at Virginia Tech

181
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:17,129
the in the mother of this the shooter I
recognize that there was something wrong

182
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:18,100
with her son

183
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,100
you know he's suffering from some kind
of mental problem

184
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,470
in the context of her a rather

185
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,950
doctrinaire Christianity she did not
take him to a psychiatrist who took in

186
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,280
from church to church

187
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:34,659
in search of exorcism generally found a
church that performed an exorcism

188
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:38,289
maybe if they were there it just picture
this is some I know

189
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:41,349
it we have a I an atrocity

190
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:44,540
in the makin we have a date dangerously
mentally ill

191
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:48,879
college student we have a concerned
mother whose worldview about mental

192
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,090
health is trimmed down through the

193
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,519
the the keyhole

194
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,600
love a kind medieval Christianity

195
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,899
and with have a church willy nilly to
put for his expertise in the performance

196
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:03,799
an exorcism

197
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:08,059
I'm it would be a lot better if everyone
involved had a 20 percent review of

198
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:08,839
mental health

199
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,850
I'm no one is really a

200
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,440
moderate people moderate Christians and
Jews and Muslims

201
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,840
have to look at this situation and say
well there's something wrong here it be

202
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,450
better to go to a psychiatrist

203
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,450
I'm but the problem is you can't show
what's wrong

204
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,170
in terms of Scripture you can show
what's wrong in terms of

205
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:33,079
I've religion because in terms of
religion

206
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,400
the the mother was right to mean there
is there are demons

207
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,730
and you Jesus cast them out you know me
is it demonic possession is actually a

208
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,399
problem

209
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:44,799
I'm the only reason why we're we we
don't

210
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,389
take it seriously is because we have a
wider view

211
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:52,789
up the univers the University that view
the universe did not come to us from

212
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:57,240
religion came from science

213
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,259
let's just grant the possibility

214
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:05,338
that there there is a creator guy who's
omniscient who occasionally

215
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:09,470
authors books I and he's going to give
us a book

216
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:13,240
I the most useful bookies a loving God
is compassionate God

217
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,509
I'm he's going to give us a guide to
life I

218
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:19,970
he's got a scribe describes gonna write
it down what's going to be in that book

219
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,870
I just think how good a book

220
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,220
would be if it were authored by an
omniscient

221
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:29,040
deity me that there is not a single line
in the Bible the Koran

222
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:32,429
that could not have been authored by a a

223
00:13:32,429 --> 00:13:35,458
first-century I person

224
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:38,929
I mean there's not there's not one one
reference to anything

225
00:13:38,929 --> 00:13:43,778
held their older their pages and pages
about how to sacrifice animals

226
00:13:43,778 --> 00:13:47,370
and keep slaves and who did kill and why

227
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:50,639
I'm there's nothing about I

228
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,100
electricity is nothing about DNA there's
nothing about how do infectious disease

229
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,159
the principles a

230
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,269
infectious disease I'm there there's

231
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:03,549
there's nothing particularly useful and
there's a lot of

232
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:07,219
Iron Age barbarism in there and
superstition I

233
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,360
this does not mean this is not a
candidate book and I can go into a

234
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,949
to any Barnes and Noble blindfolded

235
00:14:13,948 --> 00:14:17,799
and pull a book off the shelf which is
going to have more

236
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:21,068
relevance more wisdom

237
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:24,789
I for the 21st century the Bible the
Koran

238
00:14:24,789 --> 00:14:30,088
its Riz really not an exaggeration is is
he every one of our specific sciences

239
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:34,019
has superseded and surpassed the wisdom
a scripture from

240
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:37,139
from cosmology to psychology and
economics

241
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,818
we know more about ourselves than anyone

242
00:14:40,818 --> 00:14:45,559
right in the Bible the Koran did and
that is a a distinctly inconvenient fact

243
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:49,759
for the the for anyone what who want him
to believe

244
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:56,759
that this book was was dictated by the
creator the man

245
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,110
well the there are many problems with
this idea that

246
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,460
me personal that that's unfolds the
viable

247
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,210
thesis minute then their infinite
numbers upon also viable

248
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,440
PC's that you're not tempted to believe
and we could believe that this is

249
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,640
were in the matrix and you know that
that

250
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:23,939
you go down that path and there's a lot
that could be asserted

251
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,920
by people who are sure we're in the
matrix and where you know some alien

252
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,809
civilizations simulating us on I'm

253
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:32,859
their hard drive I'm I

254
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,190
one problem is that we have many

255
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:39,840
holy books authored by the created
universe and they're in conflict you

256
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,600
know they're not yet

257
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,730
the New Testament makes it perfectly
clear that Jesus is the Son of God

258
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,779
really the Son of God and you have to
believe this

259
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:52,179
otherwise your gonna spend eternity in
hell the koran

260
00:15:52,179 --> 00:15:56,409
says twice the Jesus was not the Son of
God and anyone who believes he is the

261
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:57,120
son of God

262
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,029
will spend eternity how me this is this
offers as much room for compromise

263
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:07,230
as a coin toss so so let's say let's say
we just knew the one of those claims

264
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:07,620
were

265
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,039
was right you know we have a unit we now
it's we've we've

266
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,269
we've eliminated all the other
possibilities we're living in this

267
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:17,679
challenging universe where God has given
us the highly imperfect book

268
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,589
and me and asked us to grapple with it
but now have the biblical claim

269
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,830
the New Testament claim to divinity of
Jesus and and it did

270
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,830
necessity believe in unit and the

271
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,850
Khurana claim that belief into Jesus
divinity

272
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:35,920
leads to damnation which is more likely
that the one of those is right

273
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:40,059
and the other is wrong or that we have
these competing tribes who were

274
00:16:40,059 --> 00:16:45,000
with toy lean in the context love just
abysmal ignorance about the the world

275
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,350
and

276
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,670
and the you know the the birth of the
cosmos and the and

277
00:16:48,669 --> 00:16:51,860
the destiny of any individual soul after
death I

278
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,639
you know I would put my lot in with a
wider view the circumstance but even if

279
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,069
we

280
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:00,520
granted your premise that no no there's
a good reason to believe the one of his

281
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,399
books perfect

282
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:05,029
we're still with a cake or entire
situation we don't know whether to be a

283
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:06,139
Christian or Muslim

284
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,880
I'm and we're noticing the people are
are

285
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,300
choosing basically on that on the basis
that accidents have birth

286
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,859
you just accidentally born in
Afghanistan and yours you choose to be a

287
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:17,529
Muslim

288
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:20,809
I'm and likewise with Christianity
elsewhere

289
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:25,649
a it is a it's a very strange sorta

290
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,509
loving God who would have created the
circumstance that were by mere accident

291
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:30,289
of birth

292
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:33,980
you are raised to believe that a certain
book was

293
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,509
was and ran was the rightly raised to
believe that this book was

294
00:17:37,509 --> 00:17:41,009
you know the perfect book but if you
happen to be born in China you know you

295
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:42,690
go for centuries without hearing

296
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,820
about this it's a it's a a stray a

297
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:49,549
for for an obvious reasons they totally
provincial and

298
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:52,730
and implausible scenario and yet

299
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:59,730
it's the scenario that most people
believe in the twenty-first themes

300
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:08,278
why do have existential worries and I'm
I like

301
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:11,499
I think everybody else's I am

302
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:15,278
concerned about death you know it's it's
you know death is

303
00:18:15,278 --> 00:18:19,409
in some ways unacceptable it's just
astonishing fact

304
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:24,909
a Barbie here that we that we die but I
think worse than that is that if we if

305
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:25,909
we live long in a

306
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:30,769
we lose everyone we love in this world I
mean to people die and disappear

307
00:18:30,769 --> 00:18:34,509
and we're we're left with this stark
mystery I

308
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:37,788
visions sheer not knowing love what
happened to them

309
00:18:37,788 --> 00:18:43,229
and into this void religion comes
rushing with a very consoling story same

310
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:46,879
nothing happened to them they're in a
better place and you're gonna meet up

311
00:18:46,878 --> 00:18:47,378
with them

312
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:50,668
after you die you can get everything you
want after you die death is an illusion

313
00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:55,089
I'm there's no question and that if you
could believe it that would pay

314
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:58,338
emotional dividends min is not there's
no other story you can tell

315
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:01,388
somebody who's just lost her daughter to
cancer say

316
00:19:01,388 --> 00:19:06,148
to make her feel good you know if you is
kit is consoling to believe that

317
00:19:06,148 --> 00:19:09,878
the daughter was just taken up with
Jesus and everyone's gonna bring

318
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:14,488
be reunited in a few short years I'm
there's no

319
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:17,649
replacement for that doesn't need to be
replacement for that

320
00:19:17,648 --> 00:19:20,918
I think we have to be we have to just
witnessed the cost of that

321
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:25,009
me that there are many obvious cost that
way of thinking I'm

322
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:28,219
one is we just don't teach people how to
grieve

323
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:31,249
you know that religion is it going to
the antithesis of teaching

324
00:19:31,249 --> 00:19:34,598
your children how to grieve do you tell
your child that been your grandma's in

325
00:19:34,598 --> 00:19:35,288
heaven

326
00:19:35,288 --> 00:19:38,700
and there's nothing to be sad about I'm

327
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,229
that's religion it would be better to to
equip your child for the reality of this

328
00:19:43,229 --> 00:19:44,179
life which is

329
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:47,580
you know we death is death is a fact

330
00:19:47,579 --> 00:19:50,878
and we don't know what happens after
death and I'm not pretending to know

331
00:19:50,878 --> 00:19:54,738
that you get a dial tone after death I
don't know what happens after

332
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:58,298
that the physical brain dies I don't
know what the relationship between

333
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:00,058
consciousness and the physical world

334
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:03,079
is I'm I don't think anyone does know

335
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:06,138
now I think they're there many reasons
to be doubtful

336
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:10,238
love naive conceptions about the soul
when about this idea that you could

337
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:13,319
just migrate to a a better place after
death

338
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:17,378
but I simply don't know

339
00:20:17,378 --> 00:20:20,548
about what I don't know when I believe
about

340
00:20:20,548 --> 00:20:23,819
death I'm and I don't think it's
necessary to know

341
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:28,798
in order to live I as sane leeanne
ethically and happily

342
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,168
as possible I don't think you get I'm

343
00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:35,200
you don't get anything worth getting

344
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:42,200
by for tendon to know things you know
the names

345
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:50,889
hear what I think that there's this myth
that unless you think

346
00:20:50,888 --> 00:20:54,319
one of your books was dictated by the
creator the universe and

347
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:59,308
and there he told you what could what
good and evil are

348
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:03,028
you'll just have no basis for morality
you you need

349
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,579
religion in some sense to have a a
generalizable

350
00:21:06,579 --> 00:21:11,138
morality without religion is no way to
say the Nazis were really wrong

351
00:21:11,138 --> 00:21:14,819
to to do what they do believe what they
believe I'm

352
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:19,349
I think that's clearly untrue I think we
have a some very serviceable intuitions

353
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:19,829
about

354
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:23,970
about what good and evil are and what is
I'm

355
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:29,720
what constitutes an ethical life and we
converge on those intuitions me with the

356
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:35,720
every culture I'm agrees that that
cruelty is wrong

357
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,798
is the taking pleasure in the suffering
of others is wrong within the context I

358
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,378
love you are in Group I mean that the

359
00:21:41,378 --> 00:21:44,579
many cultures think it's good to take
pleasure in the in the suffering of

360
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:45,778
people

361
00:21:45,778 --> 00:21:50,028
who are not part of your tribe I'm but
in terms of

362
00:21:50,028 --> 00:21:53,398
you who you're going to I'm

363
00:21:53,398 --> 00:21:56,508
it made into your moral sphere

364
00:21:56,509 --> 00:22:01,009
we have some very serviceable intuitions
about how we treat the people we accept

365
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:01,778
inner sphere

366
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:05,638
and the challenge for maternity the
challenge civilization

367
00:22:05,638 --> 00:22:11,038
is to it to extend the spear our moral
community to include the entire species

368
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:11,919
and

369
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,230
even other species so that we really we
really don't have these

370
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,679
these us and them boundaries that we
have an

371
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:22,889
r us and them boundaries are are really
propped up by

372
00:22:22,888 --> 00:22:26,868
dogmatism their profit by nationalism
the trip propped up by racism in as many

373
00:22:26,868 --> 00:22:28,628
ways to divide your world

374
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:32,839
dogmatically but the most insidious

375
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:36,599
us and them boundary for from my point
of view is religion I mean it really is

376
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,599
it religion

377
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,808
posits a transcendental object between
you

378
00:22:40,808 --> 00:22:45,190
and this other person not only are you
different because her skin color are

379
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,179
your political persuasion or because you

380
00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:50,970
speak a different language you were
different for all time

381
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,970
free what what you believe about God and
what he believes about God

382
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:57,409
are so opposed that

383
00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:00,539
that energy it's going to require
eternity to

384
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:04,589
you know an eternity of punishment in
his case to work out that difference

385
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:07,658
I'm so I think it's a very I'm

386
00:23:07,659 --> 00:23:11,580
I think are more a you to this question
rallies

387
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:15,740
is an important one to to focus on
because many people are attached to

388
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,569
religion

389
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:20,609
not because they're convinced that that
the metaphysics make sense but because

390
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:21,008
they

391
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:24,460
the to see no other alternative to I'm

392
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,009
teaching kids you know right and wrong I
think there's

393
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:32,639
you the few obvious things to point out
one is that you we will clearly don't

394
00:23:32,638 --> 00:23:34,109
get on around the outer bar

395
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:38,079
holy books because we go into the holy
books they are bursting with cruelty

396
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:41,678
me the Old Testament the New Testament
the koran

397
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,278
these are I'm profoundly

398
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:48,599
cruel and morally ambiguous books at
best

399
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:52,548
me the you know the Ten Commandments I
the first four commanders have nothing

400
00:23:52,548 --> 00:23:54,460
to do with morale that have to do with
with

401
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:57,778
theological offenses you know don't take
any other gods before me don't a guy's

402
00:23:57,778 --> 00:23:59,450
name in vain or even images

403
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,429
excedrin or on the Sabbath what he's
supposed to do when people break those

404
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:04,000
commandments

405
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,929
it was a kill them and this is
unbelievably immoral and yet

406
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:11,159
when we're we're not doing that now not
because

407
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,169
the the book itself is so wise me to
take away

408
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:18,330
more relevant example slavery

409
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:21,599
miss labor is clearly endorsed in the
Bible's endorsing the Old Testament is

410
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,949
endorsed in the New Testament

411
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,179
we all agree that slavery is wrong we

412
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:29,259
we conquer that ground morally

413
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:33,079
for some very hard-fought conversations
and

414
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:37,418
also wars I'm religion was a very little
help

415
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:41,440
in that made their worries this true did
abolitionists were cherry-picking

416
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,179
scripture trying to find

417
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:47,009
ways to to justify their project

418
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:50,740
but their project wasn't coming from
Scripture because scripture is clear

419
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,358
it supports slavery there's there's no
the evil slavery is not recognized in

420
00:24:55,358 --> 00:24:56,558
the Bible and it is

421
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,128
it is certainly not repudiated in the
Bible I'm

422
00:25:00,128 --> 00:25:04,378
and so the this label to the south were
on the women's side at that theological

423
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:05,428
argument and

424
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:09,460
and it the religion was an impediment to
making that

425
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:13,149
that moral progress I'm again the back

426
00:25:13,148 --> 00:25:16,918
even if it were not an impediment even
if it were extremely useful

427
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,259
that would not be a reason to believe
that any of our books were

428
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:27,259
dictated by a mission theme

429
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,480
I'm not make any strong claims about
where science is going I think it's is

430
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,140
certainly reasonable to expect that we
will understand our experience

431
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,810
much better than we do at the level of
the brain and there may there may be

432
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:43,349
some real impediments to that

433
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:47,779
but I'm it could also be true that the
sky's the limit I mean we could really

434
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:51,240
understand it in a very precise way

435
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,819
in such a way as to to allow us to to

436
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:59,339
alter our experience in in you this fine
grained ways we won

437
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:03,250
who knows what what awaits us there but
I know we're not gonna get there

438
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:07,759
if we I'm don't have an honest
conversation about the roots of human

439
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:08,369
experience

440
00:26:08,369 --> 00:26:13,219
this whole idea secular fundamentalism
were atheists dogmatism this is really a

441
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,819
a play on words that there's nothing
that you have to accept

442
00:26:16,819 --> 00:26:20,639
are as dogma there's nothing you have to
accept an insufficient evidence

443
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,650
in order to reject the biblical God or
in order to reject the idea that the

444
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,990
Koran on the bible's

445
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:31,700
is is the perfect word of God I'm
there's no dog by the UN I have accepted

446
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:36,059
on insufficient evidence in order to
reject Zeus and Poseidon the thousands

447
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:37,419
of dead guys that live

448
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,500
buried in that's in that mass grave way
home ology

449
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,450
me these are these are is God's were in
good standing

450
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,539
among generations of our ancestors and

451
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:51,279
for a variety of historical reasons here
most media center

452
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,519
%uh monotheism they put your now in
disrepute but

453
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:58,420
they have the same a piston logical
stature as the God of Abraham

454
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,860
missus not like it's not like there's so
much data for the God of Abraham in

455
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:05,029
there's no data for Poseidon they're
both without data

456
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:10,079
I'm and it's an accident of history that
we are not worshipping the side and then

457
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:12,189
when trying to constrain our

458
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:15,259
I'm in america time law

459
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:22,129
as you know in deference to the whims of
that mean I got off the ocean

460
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:25,340
there may be a there's a value in
storytelling there's a value in

461
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:28,869
and certainly in art and literature and
and I think there's a

462
00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:32,199
specifically a value in in narrative

463
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,900
and I'm there may be a value in

464
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,740
taking on certain mythical propositions
as though they

465
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,079
as s kinda schema through which to look
at your life into

466
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,449
Tina take Joseph Campbell's story the
net you know the hero's journey and to

467
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:49,330
think if you're

468
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:52,829
self in those terms and to look at what
I'm

469
00:27:52,829 --> 00:27:56,169
features up your your life in psychology
that

470
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:00,210
Springs interview I'm but

471
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:05,029
I think we have to be very careful up
about making claims to knowledge about

472
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:05,500
the world

473
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:09,230
me take something like you know tarot
card reading you some 10

474
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,390
puts the cars down in front view I and
they

475
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,410
they to turn up whatever it is the 30

476
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:19,080
rods whatever work tarot card is and

477
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:22,500
they say well this you know this
suggests to me that I'm

478
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,190
you're dealing with issues honesty and
he have you been dishonest with anyone

479
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:27,730
in your life

480
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:31,579
I'm now the two ways to approach the
situation I i

481
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:35,569
you know I think tarot card reading is
totally bogus as a metaphysical

482
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:36,899
instrument I don't think the

483
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,170
the card is is is doing anything
important there

484
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:45,640
except it is causing you to ask a
question about your life min someone is

485
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,400
just point-blank a moment ago you
weren't thinking about honesty

486
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,810
and now I just put this card from here
so what this tells me that you know you

487
00:28:51,809 --> 00:28:53,559
might want to ask yourself this
question:

488
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:57,419
all of a sudden that may that changes
your

489
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:01,160
your experience in the present moment it
may in fact get you realize oh yeah

490
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:04,830
had some real work to do with my wife
for my father I'm

491
00:29:04,829 --> 00:29:09,279
but the questions then what you let's
say you have that experience a really

492
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:10,960
valuable Tero card reading

493
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,779
you know what are you going to conclude
about tarot cards under that

494
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:17,859
on the basis of that I think you'd be
wrong to conclude

495
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:21,859
that this is magic you the right to
conclude that there's a certain value

496
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:25,219
in asking him questions I'm and

497
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,529
and that it's very easy we know this is
very easy to

498
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:32,190
to set up a system which has a very
psychological resonance

499
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:36,570
for most people most of the time is why
astrology seems to work for most people

500
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:38,019
most the time you can give

501
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:41,509
Charles Manson's astrological chart 200
people

502
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:44,609
and 99% of them will say at withers

503
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:47,779
you never think it's their chart and I
think you know this really does come get

504
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:48,230
me

505
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:53,000
I in some fundamental way because
there's no magic to this things are

506
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:53,690
written with

507
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:57,330
you know sufficient generality as to PO
Box Live

508
00:29:57,329 --> 00:30:04,329
for everybody because we're very similar
theme

509
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:12,948
well I mates it's an allusive thing to

510
00:30:12,949 --> 00:30:16,070
get a hold over there I think the

511
00:30:16,069 --> 00:30:21,019
absence love neurosis the absence of
fear the absence of anxiety

512
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:24,578
when you recognize what consciousness is
like

513
00:30:24,578 --> 00:30:27,848
when those states of mind her

514
00:30:27,848 --> 00:30:31,838
subsided I it seems to be intrinsically
happy

515
00:30:31,838 --> 00:30:34,868
intrinsically at ease is intrinsically

516
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:38,298
peaceful and I'm

517
00:30:38,298 --> 00:30:43,058
I'm at times even blissful mistress its
the lack of complications just merely

518
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:44,068
being aware

519
00:30:44,068 --> 00:30:47,378
I'll oneself I in the present moment and
not

520
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:54,378
I'm continually being in conversation
with with with oneself about the present

521
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:56,609
moment just thinkin thinkin thinkin
thinkin

522
00:30:56,608 --> 00:31:01,019
you know incessantly when that can
subside either because you're meditating

523
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:02,019
or because you're

524
00:31:02,019 --> 00:31:07,378
enjoying yourself so much in you know in
sport tourer you know you're havin sex I

525
00:31:07,378 --> 00:31:08,028
mean any

526
00:31:08,028 --> 00:31:12,898
peak experience has this feature love up
having your attention

527
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:17,578
really focused

528
00:31:17,578 --> 00:31:21,408
Ian you in a very uncomplicated way I

529
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:24,829
on your experience in the present and
that that state of mind is

530
00:31:24,828 --> 00:31:28,048
is what I would call happiness and

531
00:31:28,048 --> 00:31:31,048
and all the obstacles

532
00:31:31,048 --> 00:31:35,138
to been addressed in that in that state
of mind I I would

533
00:31:35,138 --> 00:31:38,568
I think about as the obstacles to
happiness and those are things like

534
00:31:38,568 --> 00:31:42,328
you know an erotic self-absorption with
how other people perceive you

535
00:31:42,328 --> 00:31:47,338
or you know anxiety about the future or
regret about the thing you didn't say

536
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:50,838
you know yesterday in all those those
are the way those the modes of thought

537
00:31:50,838 --> 00:31:55,048
that keep us from recognizing that is
possible to actually be

538
00:31:55,048 --> 00:31:58,418
really at ease in the present and and
happy with with

539
00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:02,049
happy before anything happens me they
are they have to have a happiness that's

540
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,098
not contention

541
00:32:03,098 --> 00:32:07,189
upon the next good thing that's going to
happen but have just directly be

542
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,409
addressed with what is

543
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:15,409
happenin right now the men

544
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:22,609
certainty is is I think a false colour
or not

545
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:25,819
achieving what we achieve in functional
certainties

546
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:29,109
in science and in just in our in our

547
00:32:29,109 --> 00:32:32,628
day-to-day lives mean is a functional
certainty that I'm sitting here talking

548
00:32:32,628 --> 00:32:35,128
to you though it's possible I could be
dreamin or

549
00:32:35,128 --> 00:32:40,288
near deceived by an evil demon I'm those
kind to fill a philosophical

550
00:32:40,288 --> 00:32:43,730
epistemological worries don't really

551
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:47,409
relate too much to the ordinary practice
of science very useful practice of

552
00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:48,860
science and our ordinary

553
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:52,469
I'm task to Pinterest negotiating

554
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:56,288
our lives and finding happiness in this
world we recognize there's a

555
00:32:56,288 --> 00:33:00,269
a range as a continuum I love you know
I'm not sure

556
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:04,769
you know the coin toss 50/50 a
understand enough

557
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:09,778
a circumstance to being functionally
certain about what is so

558
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:13,888
and many people are pretending to be
functionally certain

559
00:33:13,888 --> 00:33:17,298
or believe themselves to be fun to a
certain about things like

560
00:33:17,298 --> 00:33:20,849
Jesus is going to come back in judge the
world in their lifetime

561
00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:24,628
a 20 percent of the American population
claims to be functionally certain

562
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:28,808
that that is not gonna come to pass and
78 percent thank the Jesus gonna come

563
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:30,398
back sometime not necessarily

564
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:34,898
in their lifetime I and the certainties
do real work for us

565
00:33:34,898 --> 00:33:40,638
me that the person who certain that the
soul enters the zygote at the moment

566
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:41,378
conception

567
00:33:41,378 --> 00:33:44,898
is the person who wants to veto stem
cell research

568
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:48,079
despite the fact that ended millions of
people are suffering conditions

569
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:52,490
wait for which stem cell research is the
best line research to generate therapies

570
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:58,109
so these these are ideas that are not as
a academic interest for personal private

571
00:33:58,109 --> 00:34:03,158
spiritual relevance in these are these
are shaping policy their shape in a

572
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:04,490
national conversation

573
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,059
and then when you look to the Muslim
world they are causing people to blow

574
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:09,069
themselves up on

575
00:34:09,068 --> 00:34:16,068
street corners the net

576
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:22,879
oh I think we are misled by this this
very term religion we use this word

577
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,610
religion

578
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,930
as though it named a distinct thing is
is that in one

579
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:32,179
phenomenon in in human discourse and is
really a range

580
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:36,519
love infatuation zine practices

581
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:41,099
that go by the name of religion and the
therefore many points on this continuum

582
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:42,509
don't have much in common

583
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:46,280
with with others so if you take a
religion like Jane -ism

584
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,019
religion in India its core principle is
non-violence

585
00:34:50,019 --> 00:34:53,889
this work on the got his conception of
non-violence I'm

586
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:57,009
into the chains are vegetarian a they
have no

587
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:01,180
doctor and holy war in fact they don't
even have a doctrine proper doctor in

588
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:03,929
self defense minister pacifists they
don't hurt

589
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:09,119
fly I'm and then you on the other end to
the continuing have something like Islam

590
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,019
where has he explicitly

591
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:14,090
a doctor in a holy war and a notion love

592
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:17,140
I'll sir your combat and

593
00:35:17,139 --> 00:35:21,559
death in certain contexts his is
actually the highest obligation

594
00:35:21,559 --> 00:35:25,949
a religious person can can fulfil so
these are both religions

595
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:29,109
you know says so religion as a word like
sport you know you have a sport like

596
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,980
badminton and you have a sport like

597
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:34,360
you know boxing they're not they're both
sports

598
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,360
you know they're one is much more
dangerous I'm

599
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:43,110
so I'm i'm concerned. I'm obviously more
concerned about religions like Islam

600
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:46,930
that wary and you have this marriage
have I'm

601
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:51,659
Friday spiritual and ethical concerns
but also

602
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:54,739
certain kinds of metaphysical
certainties

603
00:35:54,739 --> 00:35:58,779
that inspire people to not only diaper
to kill others

604
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:02,769
in the process I'm and you don't have
that in other religions so I think that

605
00:36:02,769 --> 00:36:04,400
we have it be clear about how

606
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,599
this term religion I'm can

607
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,880
can mislead us

608
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:15,710
religions as essentially failed science
is a minute the religious religion was

609
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:16,579
the discourse

610
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:19,950
I that we had when

611
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:23,098
all causes in the universe were opaque
we didn't know

612
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:26,599
we didn't know the basis of anything we
didn't know why we were here

613
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:31,710
we we didn't know how diseases spread or
what disease was we didn't know how

614
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:32,400
people

615
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,380
I why people died early and why others

616
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:41,099
flourished we don't know what what's
causing thunderstorms arco causing crops

617
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:41,778
to fail

618
00:36:41,778 --> 00:36:44,960
and we very naturally as a as a

619
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,278
cognitive and behavioral imperative with
reform

620
00:36:48,278 --> 00:36:51,900
job descriptions of the world and we try
to figure out what's going on

621
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,380
I'm we tell ourselves stories about our
origins and about where we're going on

622
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,900
about causes in the world and

623
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,599
those stories given given our is
pervasive ignorance

624
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,789
and our our disposition to see agency in
the world to see

625
00:37:05,789 --> 00:37:09,359
you know to feel ourselves in
relationship to the world the stories

626
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:10,058
entail

627
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:13,380
be in relation to invisible friends

628
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,880
you know and enemies and we so we have
you know that this parent figure in this

629
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,990
guy who's gonna

630
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:21,828
take care of things if you live rightly
and and we have other

631
00:37:21,829 --> 00:37:25,528
demonic presence is that we should be
really worried about and

632
00:37:25,528 --> 00:37:28,969
gradually what what

633
00:37:28,969 --> 00:37:32,179
you see happening is that religion as as

634
00:37:32,179 --> 00:37:36,798
as rationality and and dozens of
specific sciences

635
00:37:36,798 --> 00:37:41,480
were birthed in the human conversation
you see religion on a hundred franz

636
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,338
losing the argument with signs and we
see that you know on the front tooth

637
00:37:45,338 --> 00:37:49,889
love human health and disease religion
there used to be that you could get a

638
00:37:49,889 --> 00:37:51,858
diagnosis have demonic possession

639
00:37:51,858 --> 00:37:55,619
community that was a Reno reasonable
thing to believe you had if you were

640
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:59,519
having seizures say you know but now we
have a science and neurology and we know

641
00:37:59,518 --> 00:38:01,939
about epilepsy and so when your kid has
seizures

642
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,909
you know you don't go to the church to
get get him diagnosed and treated people

643
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,118
would buy exorcism

644
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,190
and so that's a good thing i'm saying
that religion is losin

645
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,019
the argument on every other front is
losing the argument

646
00:38:15,018 --> 00:38:18,288
ethically is he is gonna it will lose
the argument spiritually and we will

647
00:38:18,289 --> 00:38:20,299
understand spiritual experience

648
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:24,199
so well at some point at the level of
the brain and the level love

649
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:28,118
now the way in which she using attention
in certain ways can change in my

650
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,400
experience well understand in a way that
makes a mockery

651
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,329
love this kinda dot denominational
religion talk about

652
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:39,750
cheeses and grace or about Buddha and
magic powers and and and

653
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:43,358
that will break down in the same way
that has broken down on medicine on

654
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:47,318
medicine thats that's a process I think
we just have to be honest about it and

655
00:38:47,318 --> 00:38:54,318
let on the move

656
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:59,440
why I can say that I'm an optimist you
know it's

657
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,389
I see that this are emotional attachment

658
00:39:04,389 --> 00:39:08,679
to these myths is so well subscribed and
so deep

659
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,879
and i believe even people who are not
religious belief that everyone else

660
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,259
needs to be religious

661
00:39:14,259 --> 00:39:17,920
it's like you know I don't need it but
even so the ultimate condescending

662
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:18,730
attitude but

663
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:23,259
everyone else does I mean this is a a
myth that that is also widely described

664
00:39:23,259 --> 00:39:24,380
even among atheists

665
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:28,140
I'm so the the inertia

666
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:31,588
in the system around around really just

667
00:39:31,588 --> 00:39:35,759
have an honest conversation about what
it's reasonable to believe in what

668
00:39:35,759 --> 00:39:39,318
religion is doing in the world I is
profound as I like I'm certainly not

669
00:39:39,318 --> 00:39:40,210
optimistic

670
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:43,949
I'm I don't know what else to do and I
see how's

671
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:47,018
how tissue thin these

672
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:50,868
these believes actually are many really
it would be so easy

673
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:54,930
to just on burden ourselves

674
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:58,449
evolve this mythology I'm an idiot would
be accomplished in a single generation

675
00:39:58,449 --> 00:39:59,828
if we just talk

676
00:39:59,829 --> 00:40:05,180
our children reasonably about the
Bible's place in literature

677
00:40:05,179 --> 00:40:08,828
you know the Bible's not science I it's
not particularly good philosophy

678
00:40:08,829 --> 00:40:12,609
but it is literature let's let's let's
read the Bible and then it was read all

679
00:40:12,608 --> 00:40:13,460
these other

680
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:17,019
books about dead gods like that you know
of its metamorphosis

681
00:40:17,018 --> 00:40:21,108
on if we talk the Bible in and the koran
in that way

682
00:40:21,108 --> 00:40:25,650
in a single generation really good I did
Abraham would take his place alongside

683
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:30,059
Zeus and Poseidon Apollo and the other
day cards and none of this would be a

684
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:30,700
problem

685
00:40:30,699 --> 00:40:34,108
I'm but that the is not likely to happen
I think

686
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:40,088
know the name

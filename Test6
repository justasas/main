00:00:00 --> 00:00:02
114 there&#39;s hot.

3
00:00:02 --> 00:00:03
Wake up, Ed.

4
00:00:03 --> 00:00:05
Leave me alone, Prince,
I&#39;m dreaming.

5
00:00:05 --> 00:00:06
There a cop on our tail.

6
00:00:06 --> 00:00:07
I know we got a cop on our tail,

7
00:00:07 --> 00:00:08
we always got a cop on our tails.

8
00:00:08 --> 00:00:09
Part of the territory.

9
00:00:09 --> 00:00:10
Now, let me go back to sleep?

10
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
This is a bike cop
and he&#39;s pullin&#39; us over.

11
00:00:12 --> 00:00:13
Okay.

12
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
Get your log
and freight bills ready.

13
00:00:15 --> 00:00:18
Let Eddie silver-tongue
do the talking?

14
00:00:18 --> 00:00:19
Be careful with that gun.

15
00:00:19 --> 00:00:20
Good evening, officer.

16
00:00:20 --> 00:00:22
I know what you&#39;re gonna say,
we were goin&#39; too fast.

17
00:00:22 --> 00:00:24
If I told him once,
I told him a thousand times,

18
00:00:24 --> 00:00:26
&quot;Watch those damn straightaways,
they&#39;ll get away from you every time.&quot;

19
00:00:26 --> 00:00:28
Give us a break, he&#39;s a good kid.

20
00:00:28 --> 00:00:29
I&#39;ll look after him, officer.

21
00:00:29 --> 00:00:30
- Please.
- It wasn&#39;t your speed.

22
00:00:30 --> 00:00:31
You blew out a retread...

23
00:00:31 --> 00:00:32
left rear tandem.

24
00:00:32 --> 00:00:33
Really?

25
00:00:33 --> 00:00:34
No kidding?

26
00:00:34 --> 00:00:35
Hey.

27
00:00:35 --> 00:00:37
Oh, man, look at that!

28
00:00:37 --> 00:00:38
Jesus!

29
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
You saved... Officer, you saved us
a heck of a bad time.

30
00:00:41 --> 00:00:42
Up against the truck.

31
00:00:42 --> 00:00:43
Hey, that&#39;s for my protection.

32
00:00:43 --> 00:00:44
Protection from what?

33
00:00:44 --> 00:00:45
Come on, answer me.

34
00:00:45 --> 00:00:46
What are you hauling?

35
00:00:46 --> 00:00:47
I said, what are you hauling?

36
00:00:47 --> 00:00:48
Open it up!

37
00:00:48 --> 00:00:49
Now, open it!

38
00:00:49 --> 00:00:50
Shit.

39
00:00:50 --> 00:00:51
Okay, okay, relax,
I&#39;m opening it.

40
00:00:51 --> 00:00:53
- Eddie!
- Oh, Jesus!

41
00:00:53 --> 00:00:54
Eddie?

42
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
Prince... I&#39;m sorry.

43
00:00:57 --> 00:00:59
- Eddie, Eddie.
- Sorry.

44
00:00:59 --> 00:01:00
Hang on.

45
00:01:00 --> 00:01:03
Unit 211,
motorist needs assistance.

46
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
Wellman Anthony Santee,

47
00:01:06 --> 00:01:09
State of California finds you guilty
of the murder

48

or more than 35 years

50
00:01:17 --> 00:01:19

53
00:01:25 --> 00:01:27
there to begin your sentence.

54
00:01:27 --> 00:01:30
Santee, have you anything to say?

55
00:01:30 --> 00:01:33
If I do, it won&#39;t be here.

56
00:01:33 --> 00:01:34
I&#39;ll get rid of him.

57
00:01:34 --> 00:01:35
You keep a lookout.

58
00:01:35 --> 00:01:36
Get up the hill.

59
00:01:36 --> 00:01:37
Piss calι.

60
00:01:37 --> 00:01:39
I just pissed 20 minutes ago.

61
00:01:39 --> 00:01:40
Looks like you&#39;re gonna have
to piss again.

62
00:01:40 --> 00:01:41
Come on.

63
00:01:41 --> 00:01:42
So, where the hell are we?

64
00:01:42 --> 00:01:44
- Down there!
- Jesus.

65
00:01:44 --> 00:01:45
Before Christmas, cop killer!

66
00:01:45 --> 00:01:47
I don&#39;t know if I can piss.

67
00:01:47 --> 00:01:48
If you give me a drink of water...

68
00:01:48 --> 00:01:49
You get nothin&#39;!

69
00:01:49 --> 00:01:50
Hey!

70
00:01:50 --> 00:01:51
Son of a bitch!

71
00:01:51 --> 00:01:53
Fuck! Get the radio, quick!

72
00:01:53 --> 00:01:55
Bet you&#39;d like a bite
outta my ass too, wouldn&#39;t ya?

73
00:01:55 --> 00:01:56
It&#39;s alι yours, pal.

74
00:01:56 --> 00:01:57
I&#39;m buyin&#39;.

75
00:01:57 --> 00:01:58
Gotta go.

76
00:01:58 --> 00:02:00
I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s just not working.

77
00:02:00 --> 00:02:01
It&#39;s not about anybody else, Michael.

78
00:02:01 --> 00:02:02
It&#39;s not.

79
00:02:02 --> 00:02:03
It&#39;s just that it&#39;s...

80
00:02:03 --> 00:02:04
it&#39;s nice with you.

81
00:02:04 --> 00:02:05
It&#39;s comfortable.

82
00:02:05 --> 00:02:06
What&#39;s wrong with comfortable?

83
00:02:06 --> 00:02:07
What&#39;s wrong with nice?

84
00:02:07 --> 00:02:08
Stay here, Rita.

85
00:02:08 --> 00:02:09
Please?

86
00:02:09 --> 00:02:10
Just wait.

87
00:02:10 --> 00:02:11
I can&#39;t.

88
00:02:11 --> 00:02:12
I just can&#39;t, Michael.

89
00:02:12 --> 00:02:13
Rita, wait!

90
00:02:13 --> 00:02:14
Oh, sit on it.

91
00:02:14 --> 00:02:15
Damn it!

92
00:02:15 --> 00:02:15
Thank you, Mike.

93
00:02:15 --> 00:02:16
Put the nozzle back.

94
00:02:16 --> 00:02:18
Michael! Michael!

95
00:02:18 --> 00:02:19
Freeze!

96
00:02:19 --> 00:02:20
Don&#39;t shoot the girι!

97
00:02:20 --> 00:02:21
Get him!

98
00:02:21 --> 00:02:22
Don&#39;t shoot,
he&#39;s got a hostage!

99
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
All right, all right,
Sheriff Cepeda&#39;s pullin&#39; in now.

100
00:02:24 --> 00:02:26
Right, we&#39;re on top
of things... what?

101
00:02:26 --> 00:02:28
What detective?
Yeah, I see him.

102
00:02:28 --> 00:02:29
The LAPD guys,
they&#39;re here now.

103
00:02:29 --> 00:02:31
Bulletin, repeat, all three counties,

104
00:02:31 --> 00:02:33
all available sheriff and local units...

105
00:02:33 --> 00:02:36
Sheriff Cepeda, the detectives
that made the original homicide arrest.

106
00:02:36 --> 00:02:38
Frank Severence, Jack Rudisill.

107
00:02:38 --> 00:02:39
You guys got here fast.

108
00:02:39 --> 00:02:41
Yeah, well, if you knew Santee,
you&#39;d wish we got here sooner.

109
00:02:41 --> 00:02:44
My partner and I are
a little keyed up, Sheriff.

110
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
The officer Santee killed last June,

111
00:02:46 --> 00:02:46
he was a friend.

112
00:02:46 --> 00:02:47
I understand, Lieutenant,
I&#39;m sorry.

113
00:02:47 --> 00:02:49
The report said Santee
took a hostage.

114
00:02:49 --> 00:02:50
A woman.

115
00:02:50 --> 00:02:52
I got a preliminary ID
from the DMV.

116
00:02:52 --> 00:02:53
Her name&#39;s Rita Marek.

117
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
Twenty-eight years old,
an address in Victorville.

118
00:02:56 --> 00:02:58
Apparently, she was standing
over by the pump

119
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
when he abducted her...
stole her vehicιe.

120
00:03:00 --> 00:03:01
Excuse me Sheriff,
we just found the girl&#39;s purse

121
00:03:01 --> 00:03:02
on top of one of the gas pumps.

122
00:03:02 --> 00:03:03
Thought you might be interested, sir.

123
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
She worked with me in Victorville.

124
00:03:05 --> 00:03:06
Both deputy sheriffs.

125
00:03:06 --> 00:03:08
Hey, take it easy, will ya?

126
00:03:08 --> 00:03:10
You know the desert,
Sheriff, where the hell could he go?

127
00:03:10 --> 00:03:12
All I can tell you, Lieutenant,

128
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
is there&#39;s 6,000 square miles
of sand and rock out there

129
00:03:15 --> 00:03:18
and God knows how many
dirt roads and coyote trails.

130
00:03:18 --> 00:03:21
The only thing that&#39;s sure is,
if he does get away out there,

131
00:03:21 --> 00:03:23
he can come out anywhere.

132
00:03:23 --> 00:03:24
We&#39;ve been all over
the back roads

133
00:03:24 --> 00:03:25
and we haven&#39;t seen hide
nor hair of him.

134
00:03:25 --> 00:03:27
Hell, we were up Rock Point
and didn&#39;t see squat.

135
00:03:27 --> 00:03:28
Keep on goin&#39;.

136
00:03:28 --> 00:03:29
Okay, good luck to ya?

137
00:03:29 --> 00:03:29
Go ahead, jump.

138
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
You been thinking about it
for the last 20 minutes.

139
00:03:31 --> 00:03:34
Even if she does escape,
she&#39;s got nowhere to go.

140
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
It&#39;s 120 miles from there to L.A.

141
00:03:37 --> 00:03:39
And you know him, Lieutenant.

142
00:03:39 --> 00:03:40
Think he&#39;ll try it?

143
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
I know him enough to know
I don&#39;t know what the hell he&#39;ll try.

144
00:03:43 --> 00:03:45
Well, the press&#39;I keep it off the air.

145
00:03:45 --> 00:03:47
No one&#39;ll know she&#39;s a deputy.

146
00:03:47 --> 00:03:49
No one better know.

147
00:03:49 --> 00:03:50
Because, if Santee finds out,
he&#39;ll kill her.

148
00:03:50 --> 00:03:53
If that son of a bitch
comes out here, he&#39;s ours.

149
00:03:53 --> 00:03:54
Comes out there and he&#39;s yours.

150
00:03:54 --> 00:03:56
Makes no difference to me
who makes this arrest,

151
00:03:56 --> 00:03:58
city, county, anything.

152
00:03:58 --> 00:04:00
All I know is,

153
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
this man, Santee, has already
killed one police officer

154
00:04:03 --> 00:04:04
and now he&#39;s got
his hands on another.

155
00:04:04 --> 00:04:06
I understand
you&#39;re invoιved personally

156
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
with the young woman,
with Deputy Marek.

157
00:04:08 --> 00:04:09
That&#39;s right.

158
00:04:09 --> 00:04:11
I don&#39;t know if this helps, son,
but we&#39;re all involved now.

159
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
It&#39;s... personal for all of us.

160
00:04:14 --> 00:04:15
May I?

161
00:04:15 --> 00:04:16
Want one?

162
00:04:16 --> 00:04:17
What&#39;s your name?

163
00:04:17 --> 00:04:19
Whatta you care
what my name is?

164
00:04:19 --> 00:04:20
Sorry, just asking, forget it.

165
00:04:20 --> 00:04:21
So, what did you do?

166
00:04:21 --> 00:04:23
Your crime, I mean,
something serious?

167
00:04:23 --> 00:04:25
Turned away from Jesus.

168
00:04:25 --> 00:04:27
What are you,
from People Magazine?

169
00:04:27 --> 00:04:28
Keep pumpin&#39;, old man.

170
00:04:28 --> 00:04:30
What else can I get you,
you son of a bitch!

171
00:04:30 --> 00:04:31
Fry you up some eggs?

172
00:04:31 --> 00:04:32
Deed you my ranch?

173
00:04:32 --> 00:04:34
There&#39;s no phone, honey.

174
00:04:34 --> 00:04:36
And don&#39;t even think about runnin&#39;.

175
00:04:36 --> 00:04:37
Show some class, Henry.

176
00:04:37 --> 00:04:38
Oh, a first-aid kit.

177
00:04:38 --> 00:04:39
Goin&#39; somewhere
where you&#39;ll need it?

178
00:04:39 --> 00:04:42
I see you turned out
exactly like we all hoped.

179
00:04:42 --> 00:04:44
Just followin&#39;
in your footsteps, oιd man.

180
00:04:44 --> 00:04:45
If I leave this woman with you,

181
00:04:45 --> 00:04:47
you&#39;ll just drive her straight
to the cops, won&#39;t ya?

182
00:04:47 --> 00:04:49
You give me a grab
at that .30-30,

183
00:04:49 --> 00:04:51
and I&#39;ll tear you
a second asshole.

184
00:04:51 --> 00:04:52
Could blow the hell
outta your truck,

185
00:04:52 --> 00:04:53
but you&#39;d just fix that,
wouldn&#39;t ya?

186
00:04:53 --> 00:04:54
You&#39;re good at that.

187
00:04:54 --> 00:04:56
Can fix just about anything,
can&#39;t you, old man?

188
00:04:56 --> 00:04:57
Thought I could.

189
00:04:57 --> 00:04:58
But some things just don&#39;t fix.

190
00:04:58 --> 00:04:59
But you tried.

191
00:04:59 --> 00:05:00
I had time.

192
00:05:00 --> 00:05:01
I got time now.

193
00:05:01 --> 00:05:02
Yeah, well, I don&#39;t.

194
00:05:02 --> 00:05:03
Out of respect for your mother,

195
00:05:03 --> 00:05:04
rest in peace.

196
00:05:04 --> 00:05:05
Respect for my mother?

197
00:05:05 --> 00:05:06
That&#39;s good, coming from you.

198
00:05:06 --> 00:05:07
Who was that?

199
00:05:07 --> 00:05:09
Some old jailbird.

200
00:05:09 --> 00:05:10
My dad.

201
00:05:10 --> 00:05:11
Where the hell are we?

202
00:05:11 --> 00:05:13
Shit, my truck!

203
00:05:13 --> 00:05:14
Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;ll find it.

204
00:05:14 --> 00:05:15
By then, we&#39;ll be miles from here.

205
00:05:15 --> 00:05:16
Come on, let&#39;s go.

206
00:05:16 --> 00:05:17
Oh, great.

207
00:05:17 --> 00:05:18
What a way to start my day?

208
00:05:18 --> 00:05:20
I knew I should have worn my flats.

209
00:05:20 --> 00:05:21
Why don&#39;t I ever listen to myself?

210
00:05:21 --> 00:05:22
Mara?

211
00:05:22 --> 00:05:24
Santee,

212
00:05:24 --> 00:05:25
how are you?

213
00:05:25 --> 00:05:26
I&#39;m fine.

214
00:05:26 --> 00:05:26
Hey.

215
00:05:26 --> 00:05:27
Look at this puppy.

216
00:05:27 --> 00:05:29
The pink slip&#39;s
in the glove box.

217
00:05:29 --> 00:05:30
The van came off a storage lot,

218
00:05:30 --> 00:05:32
so it ought to be cool
for a day or two, all right?

219
00:05:32 --> 00:05:33
Why&#39;d you bring the kid?

220
00:05:33 --> 00:05:35
Who do you think ripped the car.

221
00:05:35 --> 00:05:37
You nailed this, right, E.G.?

222
00:05:37 --> 00:05:38
Damn straight, sucker.

223
00:05:38 --> 00:05:39
Shit!

224
00:05:39 --> 00:05:40
She doesn&#39;t move.

225
00:05:40 --> 00:05:41
Come on.

226
00:05:41 --> 00:05:43
Thought you were smart, E.G.

227
00:05:43 --> 00:05:44
That&#39;s a good start, cars.

228
00:05:44 --> 00:05:45
I like that.

229
00:05:45 --> 00:05:46
I did it for you, man.

230
00:05:46 --> 00:05:47
I wanna be like you.

231
00:05:47 --> 00:05:48
Like me?

232
00:05:48 --> 00:05:49
Great.

233
00:05:49 --> 00:05:50
What day is it?

234
00:05:50 --> 00:05:51
What day is it?

235
00:05:51 --> 00:05:52
Tuesday or Thursday.

236
00:05:52 --> 00:05:53
What day, I asked ya?

237
00:05:53 --> 00:05:54
Friday.

238
00:05:54 --> 00:05:56
Welι, I&#39;ll be dead by Sunday.

239
00:05:56 --> 00:05:57
Now, is that smart?

240
00:05:57 --> 00:05:59
- Is that smart?
- No!

241
00:05:59 --> 00:06:00
- I can&#39;t hear you!
- No!

242
00:06:00 --> 00:06:01
- I can&#39;t hear!
- No!

243
00:06:01 --> 00:06:02
Listen...

244
00:06:02 --> 00:06:06
Your father died because I was too dumb
and too slow to help him.

245
00:06:06 --> 00:06:08
I&#39;m not gonna be too slow
to help you.

246
00:06:08 --> 00:06:09
You&#39;re goin&#39; after her, aren&#39;t you?

247
00:06:09 --> 00:06:11
Santee, please don&#39;t be crazy!

248
00:06:11 --> 00:06:14
Eddie is gone, let them keep
their damn money!

249
00:06:14 --> 00:06:18
It&#39;s not to E.G. and me,
we don&#39;t need it.

250
00:06:18 --> 00:06:19
Please.

251
00:06:19 --> 00:06:20
And what are
you gonna do with her?

252
00:06:20 --> 00:06:21
What size do you wear?

253
00:06:21 --> 00:06:23
Looks like those pants
are a size too small.

254
00:06:23 --> 00:06:24
Who was that woman back there?

255
00:06:24 --> 00:06:25
She&#39;s Eddie&#39;s wife, isn&#39;t she?

256
00:06:25 --> 00:06:26
Who&#39;s Eddie, anyway?

257
00:06:26 --> 00:06:28
We&#39;re gonna meet him too?

258
00:06:28 --> 00:06:29
Eddie Turner&#39;s wife!

259
00:06:29 --> 00:06:30
And you don&#39;t know where she is.

260
00:06:30 --> 00:06:31
Why did I put you out there all night?

261
00:06:31 --> 00:06:33
She gets her calls
through a God damn barbershop.

262
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
Two weeks ago,
she&#39;s livin&#39; in a station wagon.

263
00:06:35 --> 00:06:36
We got the stolen pickup, sir.

264
00:06:36 --> 00:06:37
Bottom of a canyon, Riverside.

265
00:06:37 --> 00:06:39
Well, I&#39;m glad somebody
can do somethin&#39;.

266
00:06:39 --> 00:06:40
You wanna come,
I got cars outside.

267
00:06:40 --> 00:06:41
I&#39;m on my way.

268
00:06:41 --> 00:06:44
Come on, Frank, you know
where Santee&#39;s headed?

269
00:06:44 --> 00:06:47
He&#39;s not that crazy
and he&#39;s not that stupid.

270
00:06:47 --> 00:06:48
He&#39;s not?

271
00:06:48 --> 00:06:49
Send a car out there.

272
00:06:49 --> 00:06:50
Tell &#39;em to stay awake.

273
00:06:50 --> 00:06:51
Otto, come here.

274
00:06:51 --> 00:06:52
Get a couple cops.

275
00:06:52 --> 00:06:53
- Standby, I&#39;ll be in touch.
- Yes, sir.

276
00:06:53 --> 00:06:54
Santee&#39;s visitor sheet from prison.

277
00:06:54 --> 00:06:55
Popular bastard, ain&#39;t he?

278
00:06:55 --> 00:06:57
Detective Chelsey,
I&#39;ve got the report on the hostage.

279
00:06:57 --> 00:07:01
Rita Marek, 28, they call her
Lovely Rita, but she&#39;s no meter maid.

280
00:07:01 --> 00:07:03
She&#39;s a hard case,
a real law and order type.

281
00:07:03 --> 00:07:04
Six years
with the sheriff&#39;s department,

282
00:07:04 --> 00:07:06
DB&#39;d twice for excessive force.

283
00:07:06 --> 00:07:08
This Marek is no cream puff,
Lieutenant.

284
00:07:08 --> 00:07:10
He father was a deputy...
killed in the line of duty,

285
00:07:10 --> 00:07:12
most decorated
in Mojave County history.

286
00:07:12 --> 00:07:14
- Sheriff.
- Lieutenant.

287
00:07:14 --> 00:07:15
She&#39;s got two brothers.

288
00:07:15 --> 00:07:17
One of them&#39;s a highway
patrolman in Alaska,

289
00:07:17 --> 00:07:19
the other one&#39;s a marine gunny
in the Philippines.

290
00:07:19 --> 00:07:21
Sounds like she&#39;s hangin&#39;
a pair of brass ovaries.

291
00:07:21 --> 00:07:24
In other words, she may just crunch
this Santee guy herself.

292
00:07:24 --> 00:07:25
Save the tax payers a lot a trouble.

293
00:07:25 --> 00:07:29
One more thing... this motorcycle cop
that Santee killed,

294
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
- Jacobs, L.T.
- Right, Jacobs.

295
00:07:31 --> 00:07:32
Give the press something on him...

296
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
a grieving widow,
kids without a dad, you know.

297
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
I don&#39;t want anybody glamorizing
this dirt bag, Santee.

298
00:07:38 --> 00:07:40
I want &#39;em to see the price
he made people pay.

299
00:07:40 --> 00:07:41
Shit.

300
00:07:41 --> 00:07:42
Dead.

301
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
In your car,
this is a routine vehicle inspection.

302
00:07:45 --> 00:07:48
I repeat, stay in your car.

303
00:07:48 --> 00:07:50
- You&#39;ll be processed as quickly
as possible. - Get out.

304
00:07:50 --> 00:07:53
Ladies and gentlemen,
please stay in your car.

305
00:07:53 --> 00:07:55
- I repeat...
- Don&#39;t make me use it.

306
00:07:55 --> 00:07:56
Come on.

307
00:07:56 --> 00:07:57
Ouch!

308
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
Bill, I&#39;m tellin&#39; ya, you can take
that detective exam

309
00:07:59 --> 00:08:00
&#39;til it&#39;s comin&#39; out your ass,
it won&#39;t help.

310
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
- All right?
- Yeah, I know what you&#39;re sayin&#39;.

311
00:08:02 --> 00:08:03
I got ya.

312
00:08:03 --> 00:08:04
Hey, how ya doin&#39;?

313
00:08:04 --> 00:08:05
How&#39;s it goin&#39;?

314
00:08:05 --> 00:08:06
Don&#39;t even think about it.

315
00:08:06 --> 00:08:06
Yeah?

316
00:08:06 --> 00:08:07
Stay cool.

317
00:08:07 --> 00:08:09
Hey, guys, get your butts in gear.

318
00:08:09 --> 00:08:10
We got a live one.

319
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
That guy, Santee, abandoned
his car on the freeway.

320
00:08:12 --> 00:08:13
- Any idea which way he went?
- That&#39;s our bus.

321
00:08:13 --> 00:08:14
Move.

322
00:08:14 --> 00:08:15
- ...patrol on it.
- Okay, let&#39;s go.

323
00:08:15 --> 00:08:16
Look at that.

324
00:08:16 --> 00:08:17
Don&#39;t do it!

325
00:08:17 --> 00:08:18
Get that fuckin&#39; gun outta there!

326
00:08:18 --> 00:08:19
Come on, ditch &#39;em!

327
00:08:19 --> 00:08:20
That&#39;s right.

328
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
Keep the fuck down there,
you stay down there!

329
00:08:22 --> 00:08:23
Get your ass up there!

330
00:08:23 --> 00:08:24
Damn it.

331
00:08:24 --> 00:08:25
Get in.

332
00:08:25 --> 00:08:27
What are you, showing off?

333
00:08:27 --> 00:08:28
I almost smoked those bastards!

334
00:08:28 --> 00:08:30
Where the hell
did you learn that shit?

335
00:08:30 --> 00:08:31
To protect myself.

336
00:08:31 --> 00:08:34
Last seen heading
north on Pinto Basin Road...

337
00:08:34 --> 00:08:35
Come on.

338
00:08:35 --> 00:08:36
Fugitive is armed...

339
00:08:36 --> 00:08:37
Come on, tough broad.

340
00:08:37 --> 00:08:39
With a 12-guage automatic.
Exercise extreme caution.

341
00:08:39 --> 00:08:40
That way.

342
00:08:40 --> 00:08:41
Run.

343
00:08:41 --> 00:08:42
Move your butt.

344
00:08:42 --> 00:08:43
Let&#39;s go.

345
00:08:43 --> 00:08:44
Thank you,
I&#39;ll see you guys later.

346
00:08:44 --> 00:08:45
Thanks.

347
00:08:45 --> 00:08:47
Next time you come in,
you get 10% off on that.

348
00:08:47 --> 00:08:49
- If you spot this individual,
- How you doin&#39;?

349
00:08:49 --> 00:08:50
All righty, man,
let&#39;s start the weekend.

350
00:08:50 --> 00:08:52
So, what&#39;ll it be, boys and girls,
half or an hour?

351
00:08:52 --> 00:08:55
- All night.
- This must be love.

352
00:08:55 --> 00:08:57
But that&#39;ll be 60 bucks.

353
00:08:57 --> 00:08:58
I&#39;d like to address myself...

354
00:08:58 --> 00:09:00
You want to sign in,
there you go, Mr. and Mrs. Smith?

355
00:09:00 --> 00:09:01
Let me get you some change.

356
00:09:01 --> 00:09:02
Miss Marek,
whom Santee holds captive.

357
00:09:02 --> 00:09:03
Do nothing reckless.

358
00:09:03 --> 00:09:04
Stay calm.

359
00:09:04 --> 00:09:07
Police forces from three counties
are converging on you.

360
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
We will get you free safely.

361
00:09:09 --> 00:09:10
Leave the door open.

362
00:09:10 --> 00:09:11
Why?

363
00:09:11 --> 00:09:12
You gonna watch me?

364
00:09:12 --> 00:09:15
I&#39;ll watch if I&#39;m in the shower,
if you give me any more bullshit.

365
00:09:15 --> 00:09:17
How much longer are we going
to stay in this room?

366
00:09:17 --> 00:09:18
Why do you want to know?

367
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
So I can wash my panties.

368
00:09:20 --> 00:09:21
So they&#39;ll have enough time to dry.

369
00:09:21 --> 00:09:22
So, what do you do for a living?

370
00:09:22 --> 00:09:23
What?

371
00:09:23 --> 00:09:24
Your job?

372
00:09:24 --> 00:09:26
When you&#39;re not practicing kung fu.

373
00:09:26 --> 00:09:27
I&#39;m a colorist.

374
00:09:27 --> 00:09:28
What the hell is that?

375
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
I color hair in a salon.

376
00:09:30 --> 00:09:32
Nobody&#39;s seen him,
nobody knows him.

377
00:09:32 --> 00:09:33
Nobody speaks English.

378
00:09:33 --> 00:09:34
Shit!

379
00:09:34 --> 00:09:35
What are you doing here?

380
00:09:35 --> 00:09:36
I wanna help.

381
00:09:36 --> 00:09:38
Sheriff Cepeda got my CO
to cut me loose.

382
00:09:38 --> 00:09:40
Thanks, cowboy,
we got all the help we need.

383
00:09:40 --> 00:09:41
It&#39;s okay, Rudy.

384
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
You speak Spanish, deputy?

385
00:09:42 --> 00:09:43
Enough to curse in it.

386
00:09:43 --> 00:09:44
Well, start using it.

387
00:09:44 --> 00:09:45
Come on, son, I got a job.

388
00:09:45 --> 00:09:46
See those bean eaters?

389
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
Start puttin&#39; their feet
to the fire, good boy.

390
00:09:47 --> 00:09:49
The rest of you get
your thumbs outta your asses!

391
00:09:49 --> 00:09:50
Scour this neighborhood!

392
00:09:50 --> 00:09:53
I want every missing car, bike,
shopping cart, and skateboard!

393
00:09:53 --> 00:09:54
Now, move!

394
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
I just need an hour of sleep,
then we&#39;ll go.

395
00:09:56 --> 00:09:57
Leave it on.

396
00:09:57 --> 00:09:58
He&#39;s your hero, isn&#39;t he?

397
00:09:58 --> 00:10:00
The outlaw who goes down
with all guns blazing.

398
00:10:00 --> 00:10:01
Why do you want to die?

399
00:10:01 --> 00:10:02
You think it&#39;s romantic?

400
00:10:02 --> 00:10:04
You think some girl&#39;s going
to cry for you?

401
00:10:04 --> 00:10:06
Kinda nervous... hell,
I been waitin&#39; over an hour.

402
00:10:06 --> 00:10:07
I been waitin&#39; too,
over eight years.

403
00:10:07 --> 00:10:08
The park&#39;s down there, ain&#39;t it?

404
00:10:08 --> 00:10:09
Yeah, the park.

405
00:10:09 --> 00:10:11
Say, Earl, you feelin&#39; all right?

406
00:10:11 --> 00:10:12
I will be.

407
00:10:12 --> 00:10:13
Get on the bed.

408
00:10:13 --> 00:10:17
Where the grass is still green,
trees are still growin&#39;.

409
00:10:17 --> 00:10:18
Ice him, buddy.

410
00:10:18 --> 00:10:19
How&#39;d you get shot?

411
00:10:19 --> 00:10:21
Or are you just gonna smack me
and tell me to shut up?

412
00:10:21 --> 00:10:23
Guard tried to kill me
in prison last night.

413
00:10:23 --> 00:10:25
A guard tried to kill you?

414
00:10:25 --> 00:10:26
Why?

415
00:10:26 --> 00:10:28
Somebody paid him.

416
00:10:28 --> 00:10:29
Who?

417
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
The guy who&#39;s gonna find me
in his face in about two hours.

418
00:10:32 --> 00:10:34
Coppers&#39;ll go to the fire now.

419
00:10:34 --> 00:10:36
Oh, Roy, those boys.

420
00:10:36 --> 00:10:39
Small timers for small jobs.

421
00:10:39 --> 00:10:40
They lost their heads.

422
00:10:40 --> 00:10:41
This one was just too big.

423
00:10:41 --> 00:10:42
Eddie!

424
00:10:42 --> 00:10:43
What time is it?

425
00:10:43 --> 00:10:44
10:30.

426
00:10:44 --> 00:10:45
Damn it!

427
00:10:45 --> 00:10:46
Come on.

428
00:10:46 --> 00:10:47
Get in.

429
00:10:47 --> 00:10:49
Hey, hey, wait a minute,
where are you going?

430
00:10:49 --> 00:10:50
I thought you said
you would let me go.

431
00:10:50 --> 00:10:51
I am.

432
00:10:51 --> 00:10:53
Where, out here in cow country?

433
00:10:53 --> 00:10:55
It&#39;s horse country,
you&#39;ll like it.

434
00:10:55 --> 00:10:57
Lot&#39;s of rich people&#39;s
make-believe ranches.

435
00:10:57 --> 00:10:59
That&#39;s where he lives.

436
00:10:59 --> 00:11:01
The guy who tried
to have you killed.

437
00:11:01 --> 00:11:03
That&#39;s where you&#39;re going
right now, isn&#39;t it?

438
00:11:03 --> 00:11:04
Isn&#39;t it?

439
00:11:04 --> 00:11:05
You wanted off this ride?

440
00:11:05 --> 00:11:06
You&#39;re off.

441
00:11:06 --> 00:11:07
Where the hell are we now?

442
00:11:07 --> 00:11:08
Your stop.

443
00:11:08 --> 00:11:09
Here?

444
00:11:09 --> 00:11:10
Oh, God.

445
00:11:10 --> 00:11:12
It&#39;ll take me a half hour
to hike back to the road.

446
00:11:12 --> 00:11:14
Come on, what harm
can I do you now?

447
00:11:14 --> 00:11:16
The people you met
on this little adventure,

448
00:11:16 --> 00:11:17
forget every one of &#39;em.

449
00:11:17 --> 00:11:19
Santee, Santee!

450
00:11:19 --> 00:11:20
God damn it.

451
00:11:20 --> 00:11:21
Well, this is great.

452
00:11:21 --> 00:11:22
Hey!

453
00:11:22 --> 00:11:24
Police officer,
I need some information fast.

454
00:11:24 --> 00:11:25
Are there any ranches
around here?

455
00:11:25 --> 00:11:26
What?

456
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
Ranches, you know,
where people ride their horses?

457
00:11:28 --> 00:11:29
I got somethin&#39;
you can ride, lady.

458
00:11:29 --> 00:11:31
What is your God damn
problem, buddy?

459
00:11:31 --> 00:11:33
Hey, come here
and put a hurt on me, baby!

460
00:11:33 --> 00:11:35
Hey, do you know of any
horse ranches around here?

461
00:11:35 --> 00:11:36
Just one, straight up
the canyon road.

462
00:11:36 --> 00:11:37
Look, I need your bike,
I&#39;m a deputy sheriff

463
00:11:37 --> 00:11:38
and this is a police emergency.

464
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
See this right here,
it&#39;s a pussy seat.

465
00:11:40 --> 00:11:41
You know why they call it that?

466
00:11:41 --> 00:11:42
Hey.

467
00:11:42 --> 00:11:44
Yo, what?

468
00:11:44 --> 00:11:45
What... what you doing?

469
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
Christ, Santee, are you crazy?

470
00:11:47 --> 00:11:48
What&#39;s wrong with you?

471
00:11:48 --> 00:11:49
There are cops outside.

472
00:11:49 --> 00:11:50
- Where is he?
- He&#39;s at work.

473
00:11:50 --> 00:11:51
Where do you think he is?

474
00:11:51 --> 00:11:53
Call Jimmy Shoeshine.

475
00:11:53 --> 00:11:55
What am I, your fuckin&#39; secretary?

476
00:11:55 --> 00:11:57
I don&#39;t know his number!

477
00:11:57 --> 00:11:59
I don&#39;t talk to that lying Chink.

478
00:11:59 --> 00:12:00
Call him, Esther.

479
00:12:00 --> 00:12:01
Dial the phone.

480
00:12:01 --> 00:12:02
Let me help you, baby.

481
00:12:02 --> 00:12:04
Don&#39;t screw around, Esther.

482
00:12:04 --> 00:12:06
Did you think I could forget you?

483
00:12:06 --> 00:12:07
It was always you, baby.

484
00:12:07 --> 00:12:08
Gimme the good thing, baby.

485
00:12:08 --> 00:12:10
Call Jimmy Shoeshine.

486
00:12:10 --> 00:12:12
Listen to me, you son of a bitch!
Shut up!

487
00:12:12 --> 00:12:13
It&#39;s almost eleven.

488
00:12:13 --> 00:12:16
Be at the warehouse at one... alone.

489
00:12:16 --> 00:12:18
I want my end and Eddie&#39;s.

490
00:12:18 --> 00:12:19
I want it all tonight.

491
00:12:19 --> 00:12:20
Or everyone goes down.

492
00:12:20 --> 00:12:21
Everyone.

493
00:12:21 --> 00:12:22
No!

494
00:12:22 --> 00:12:24
Open the door, Santee!

495
00:12:24 --> 00:12:25
Santee!

496
00:12:25 --> 00:12:27
Who do you think you are?

497
00:12:27 --> 00:12:28
God damn it!

498
00:12:28 --> 00:12:29
Severence.

499
00:12:29 --> 00:12:31
Oh, my God.

500
00:12:31 --> 00:12:33
Open the door, now!

501
00:12:33 --> 00:12:34
What the hell?

502
00:12:34 --> 00:12:36
This is Severence&#39;s house.

503
00:12:36 --> 00:12:37
That&#39;s Severence&#39;s wife.

504
00:12:37 --> 00:12:38
No shit.

505
00:12:38 --> 00:12:39
Here.

506
00:12:39 --> 00:12:40
Introduce yourself.

507
00:12:40 --> 00:12:41
Wait!

508
00:12:41 --> 00:12:41
Shit!

509
00:12:41 --> 00:12:42
Come on, open the fucking door!

510
00:12:42 --> 00:12:43
- What the hell?
- Let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go.

511
00:12:43 --> 00:12:44
So, what kinda bike was it?

512
00:12:44 --> 00:12:45
It was a white Yamaha.

513
00:12:45 --> 00:12:46
This girl wasn&#39;t normal, man.

514
00:12:46 --> 00:12:48
She knew karate or kung fu
or somethin&#39;.

515
00:12:48 --> 00:12:49
She said something
about being a cop.

516
00:12:49 --> 00:12:50
Really, did she say where from?

517
00:12:50 --> 00:12:51
Here comes Smokey.

518
00:12:51 --> 00:12:52
His wife!

519
00:12:52 --> 00:12:54
W-I-F-E.

520
00:12:54 --> 00:12:55
You putz.

521
00:12:55 --> 00:12:56
Now, put me through to him.

522
00:12:56 --> 00:12:57
Name?

523
00:12:57 --> 00:12:59
Yeah, fine.

524
00:12:59 --> 00:13:00
I understand.

525
00:13:00 --> 00:13:02
Frank, he made me call
the Chinaman.

526
00:13:02 --> 00:13:04
He&#39;s going there now, tonight.

527
00:13:04 --> 00:13:05
This is probably nothing, Sheriff,

528
00:13:05 --> 00:13:07
but remember
it was Severence this year

529
00:13:07 --> 00:13:09
who arrested Santee for the murder
of the motorcycle cop?

530
00:13:09 --> 00:13:10
Well, here&#39;s the strange thing...

531
00:13:10 --> 00:13:12
11 years ago,
Santee&#39;s first arrest

532
00:13:12 --> 00:13:14
for auto theft when he was 17.

533
00:13:14 --> 00:13:15
Severence made that too.

534
00:13:15 --> 00:13:16
You got it.

535
00:13:16 --> 00:13:18
Well, I don&#39;t think
that amounts to anything.

536
00:13:18 --> 00:13:19
No?

537
00:13:19 --> 00:13:20
And baby,

538
00:13:20 --> 00:13:21
he came into our bedroom.

539
00:13:21 --> 00:13:22
He touched me.

540
00:13:22 --> 00:13:24
Thank you, Sergeant.

541
00:13:24 --> 00:13:26
We&#39;ll respond to that right away.

542
00:13:26 --> 00:13:28
Sir, you got something
on the phone just now.

543
00:13:28 --> 00:13:29
It was about Rita, wasn&#39;t it?

544
00:13:29 --> 00:13:30
You got the same dope as everyone.

545
00:13:30 --> 00:13:31
Santee&#39;s on the 14 east.

546
00:13:31 --> 00:13:32
Now, get to your block...

547
00:13:32 --> 00:13:34
No, there was more, you heard more...
I can tell from your face.

548
00:13:34 --> 00:13:34
Severence, God damn it!

549
00:13:34 --> 00:13:35
What do you want, Agnos?

550
00:13:35 --> 00:13:37
You want to get your girl wasted,
is that what you want?

551
00:13:37 --> 00:13:39
That&#39;s enough, Severence.

552
00:13:39 --> 00:13:40
We get the idea.

553
00:13:40 --> 00:13:42
Get control of this cowboy, Sheriff,

554
00:13:42 --> 00:13:43
before another cop gets killed.

555
00:13:43 --> 00:13:44
Let&#39;s move out.

556
00:13:44 --> 00:13:46
Jesus Christ, Frank!

557
00:13:46 --> 00:13:48
We have a moratorium on those fuckin&#39;
dock ropes you been smokin&#39;?

558
00:13:48 --> 00:13:51
They keep me calm,
you should try one.

559
00:13:51 --> 00:13:52
No, my nerves are fine.

560
00:13:52 --> 00:13:54
It wasn&#39;t me who backed off
when we could a closed this shit out.

561
00:13:54 --> 00:13:56
Should a tanked Santee
at the hospital.

562
00:13:56 --> 00:13:58
Minute one, bing bang.

563
00:13:58 --> 00:13:59
The shit is finished.

564
00:13:59 --> 00:14:01
I&#39;ve said a million fucking times...

565
00:14:01 --> 00:14:04
If you&#39;re gonna break the law,
you do it with cops and only cops.

566
00:14:04 --> 00:14:07
We were nuts to throw in
with this... this Shoeshine prick.

567
00:14:07 --> 00:14:08
To bring Santee in to drive...

568
00:14:08 --> 00:14:10
That son of a bitch is spilling
his guts big time right now

569
00:14:10 --> 00:14:11
to that bimbo deputy.

570
00:14:11 --> 00:14:12
No, you&#39;re wrong, Rudy.

571
00:14:12 --> 00:14:14
It&#39;s against his code.

572
00:14:14 --> 00:14:17
Guy like Santee&#39;s
got nothing but his code.

573
00:14:17 --> 00:14:19
You like him?

574
00:14:19 --> 00:14:20
I always liked him.

575
00:14:20 --> 00:14:21
But I&#39;m gonna kill him.

576
00:14:21 --> 00:14:23
It was Severence who tried
to have you killed in prison.

577
00:14:23 --> 00:14:24
That&#39;s what you meant before, right?

578
00:14:24 --> 00:14:25
Why?

579
00:14:25 --> 00:14:26
Because he was in on it with you.

580
00:14:26 --> 00:14:27
Come on.

581
00:14:27 --> 00:14:28
Oh, thanks a lot.

582
00:14:28 --> 00:14:29
It&#39;s all connected to here, isn&#39;t it?

583
00:14:29 --> 00:14:31
Severence is coming here.

584
00:14:31 --> 00:14:32
Christ, Santee, come on!

585
00:14:32 --> 00:14:33
Is there an off switch
to your mouth?

586
00:14:33 --> 00:14:34
You know, you pull this job...

587
00:14:34 --> 00:14:36
Everybody, thankfully
we were out drinking.

588
00:14:36 --> 00:14:38
Get rid of all the cars
except the Rolls.

589
00:14:38 --> 00:14:40
Let me guess, Jimmy Shoeshine?

590
00:14:40 --> 00:14:42
No mistakes
with this son of a bitch.

591
00:14:42 --> 00:14:43
Right.

592
00:14:43 --> 00:14:46
Cars, exotic cars.

593
00:14:46 --> 00:14:48
That&#39;s what you were hauling
the night the cop got killed.

594
00:14:48 --> 00:14:49
Only, you didn&#39;t kill him,
did you?

595
00:14:49 --> 00:14:50
You didn&#39;t kill anyone.

596
00:14:50 --> 00:14:51
You wanna know
what happened then?

597
00:14:51 --> 00:14:52
Watch what happens now.

598
00:14:52 --> 00:14:53
Santee...

599
00:14:53 --> 00:14:55
you could run.

600
00:14:55 --> 00:14:56
Just go.

601
00:14:56 --> 00:14:57
Santee, I can help, I&#39;m...

602
00:14:57 --> 00:14:59
Already there, good.

603
00:14:59 --> 00:15:01
Yeah, I&#39;m here, Santee.

604
00:15:01 --> 00:15:02
Alone.

605
00:15:02 --> 00:15:03
Just like you wanted.

606
00:15:03 --> 00:15:04
I&#39;ve got your money.

607
00:15:04 --> 00:15:05
I don&#39;t want any trouble.

608
00:15:05 --> 00:15:06
Where are you?

609
00:15:06 --> 00:15:07
Almost there.

610
00:15:07 --> 00:15:09
You&#39;ll see my car out front.

611
00:15:09 --> 00:15:10
Come on up to the office.

612
00:15:10 --> 00:15:14
Your car, now, would that be
the Rolls or the wagon?

613
00:15:14 --> 00:15:17
Hey, boss,
the fucker&#39;s in your Rolls!

614
00:15:17 --> 00:15:18
What the f... shit!

615
00:15:18 --> 00:15:20
Come out, Jimmy.

616
00:15:20 --> 00:15:21
All alone.

617
00:15:21 --> 00:15:24
You... and the money.

618
00:15:24 --> 00:15:26
You learned from me.

619
00:15:26 --> 00:15:27
All right.

620
00:15:27 --> 00:15:29
I&#39;m comin&#39;.

621
00:15:29 --> 00:15:30
Stay where you are.

622
00:15:30 --> 00:15:31
Don&#39;t shoot the boss&#39;s Rolls!

623
00:15:31 --> 00:15:33
Get out there, finish him off!

624
00:15:33 --> 00:15:35
I been looking forward to this.

625
00:15:35 --> 00:15:37
Now, don&#39;t underestimate him.

626
00:15:37 --> 00:15:38
He&#39;s dangerous.

627
00:15:38 --> 00:15:40
He&#39;s a driver, not a killer.

628
00:15:40 --> 00:15:41
I&#39;m different!

629
00:15:41 --> 00:15:43
Holy shit!

630
00:15:43 --> 00:15:45
Son of a bitch!

631
00:15:45 --> 00:15:47
Evidently, no more Mr. Nice Guy!

632
00:15:47 --> 00:15:49
Come on out, Santee.

633
00:15:49 --> 00:15:50
Let&#39;s talk, man.

634
00:15:50 --> 00:15:51
Be reasonable.

635
00:15:51 --> 00:15:53
Santee, where are you?

636
00:15:53 --> 00:15:55
Don&#39;t play these chicken shit
games with me.

637
00:15:55 --> 00:15:56
One of those is worth
a half a million bucks!

638
00:15:56 --> 00:15:57
Give me the money, Jimmy.

639
00:15:57 --> 00:15:58
It&#39;s cheaper.

640
00:15:58 --> 00:16:00
Each one of those
is worth one of your life!

641
00:16:00 --> 00:16:02
You won&#39;t make it out
of here alive, Santee!

642
00:16:02 --> 00:16:05
Okay, Santee, okay... quit.

643
00:16:05 --> 00:16:06
Stop, man.

644
00:16:06 --> 00:16:07
Before it&#39;s almost a junkyard.

645
00:16:07 --> 00:16:08
Come out.

646
00:16:08 --> 00:16:09
You can trust me.

647
00:16:09 --> 00:16:11
Son of a bitch!

648
00:16:11 --> 00:16:12
Just a driver?

649
00:16:12 --> 00:16:14
You&#39;re different, you fuck!

650
00:16:14 --> 00:16:15
Surprise.

651
00:16:15 --> 00:16:17
I think it&#39;s time you called
your insurance company.

652
00:16:17 --> 00:16:18
Oh, man.

653
00:16:18 --> 00:16:20
The safe is on a time lock.

654
00:16:20 --> 00:16:21
I can&#39;t open it.

655
00:16:21 --> 00:16:22
Is that right, Jimmy?

656
00:16:22 --> 00:16:24
Tick, tock, tick...

657
00:16:24 --> 00:16:25
Now, don&#39;t be crazy, Santee.

658
00:16:25 --> 00:16:26
Come on, I tried to help you!

659
00:16:26 --> 00:16:28
After Eddie, Severence wanted
to do you right in the hospital!

660
00:16:28 --> 00:16:29
I called the lawyer for you!

661
00:16:29 --> 00:16:30
Tick, tock.

662
00:16:30 --> 00:16:30
Time&#39;s up.

663
00:16:30 --> 00:16:33
You can open the safe
with your balls,

664
00:16:33 --> 00:16:34
or without &#39;em.

665
00:16:34 --> 00:16:35
First choice.

666
00:16:35 --> 00:16:37
Looks like we missed
one hell of a party.

667
00:16:37 --> 00:16:38
Don&#39;t worry, Rudy,

668
00:16:38 --> 00:16:39
the fat lady hasn&#39;t sung yet.

669
00:16:39 --> 00:16:40
Severence.

670
00:16:40 --> 00:16:43
Why did you go to Severence&#39;s
house to call me?

671
00:16:43 --> 00:16:45
Why didn&#39;t you just pick up
another phone?

672
00:16:45 --> 00:16:47
I wanted to save a dime.

673
00:16:47 --> 00:16:48
Oh, you&#39;re smart, Santee.

674
00:16:48 --> 00:16:50
See, you learned from me.

675
00:16:50 --> 00:16:53
With that bitch wife,
you knew she&#39;d call Severence.

676
00:16:53 --> 00:16:54
You knew he&#39;d come here.

677
00:16:54 --> 00:16:56
You know the cops&#39;ll be comin&#39; soon.

678
00:16:56 --> 00:16:58
Relax, duffo, we are the cops.

679
00:16:58 --> 00:17:00
That&#39;s a little more
than your end, man.

680
00:17:00 --> 00:17:01
Call it interest.

681
00:17:01 --> 00:17:02
Let me help you get Severence.

682
00:17:02 --> 00:17:04
Look, Santee,
I&#39;m just as dead as you are.

683
00:17:04 --> 00:17:05
Severence has to kill me too.

684
00:17:05 --> 00:17:08
Don&#39;t take him on alone.

685
00:17:08 --> 00:17:09
Trust me.

686
00:17:09 --> 00:17:11
Learn from me...

687
00:17:11 --> 00:17:12
I did learn from you, Jimmy.

688
00:17:12 --> 00:17:13
I&#39;ll go get somethin&#39; heavier.

689
00:17:13 --> 00:17:14
Shit, look at this.

690
00:17:14 --> 00:17:16
I&#39;ll take care of him,
you get the artillery.

691
00:17:16 --> 00:17:17
Where&#39;s Rita? Is she okay?

692
00:17:17 --> 00:17:19
Stay back, you stupid fuck!

693
00:17:19 --> 00:17:20
I followed ya,
I figured you needed help.

694
00:17:20 --> 00:17:22
You wanna help?
Get the fuck outta here!

695
00:17:22 --> 00:17:23
Severence!

696
00:17:23 --> 00:17:24
Santee&#39;s in the office!

697
00:17:24 --> 00:17:26
Shoot the God damn window!

698
00:17:26 --> 00:17:27
Rudy, give Jimmy your piece.

699
00:17:27 --> 00:17:28
Kill that guy?

700
00:17:28 --> 00:17:30
It&#39;s a God damn AK-47.

701
00:17:30 --> 00:17:32
What the fuck is goin&#39; on here?

702
00:17:32 --> 00:17:33
Smart cop.

703
00:17:33 --> 00:17:35
What are ya gaping at,
have you reloaded?

704
00:17:35 --> 00:17:36
Bye-bye, Jimmy.

705
00:17:36 --> 00:17:37
Lieutenant Severence.

706
00:17:37 --> 00:17:39
He&#39;s got automatic weapons,
he just murdered another officer.

707
00:17:39 --> 00:17:40
Take a position
on the other side of the lot.

708
00:17:40 --> 00:17:41
Shoot to kill.

709
00:17:41 --> 00:17:42
What&#39;s this?

710
00:17:42 --> 00:17:42
Fuck.

711
00:17:42 --> 00:17:44
- Where the hell...
- I&#39;m a cop, don&#39;t listen to him.

712
00:17:44 --> 00:17:45
Whatever he told you,
he shot Michael!

713
00:17:45 --> 00:17:46
Michael, who the hell&#39;s that?

714
00:17:46 --> 00:17:49
Severence shot him just now,
ten seconds ago, not Santee!

715
00:17:49 --> 00:17:50
I don&#39;t know who the hell is who.

716
00:17:50 --> 00:17:51
All I know is that is
a LAPD lieutenant.

717
00:17:51 --> 00:17:53
What do you want,
a fucking badge number?

718
00:17:53 --> 00:17:54
You&#39;re gonna be all right...

719
00:17:54 --> 00:17:55
No, I won&#39;t, not if you
don&#39;t listen to me!

720
00:17:55 --> 00:17:56
I&#39;m a cop!

721
00:17:56 --> 00:17:57
Stay down and shut up!

722
00:17:57 --> 00:17:58
Hey!

723
00:17:58 --> 00:17:59
Are you crazy? Get outta here!

724
00:17:59 --> 00:18:00
There&#39;s a chance now,
turn yourself in.

725
00:18:00 --> 00:18:01
To who, Severence?

726
00:18:01 --> 00:18:02
I saw Severence shoot Michael.

727
00:18:02 --> 00:18:04
Someone will listen to me...
I&#39;ll make them.

728
00:18:04 --> 00:18:05
I&#39;ll be your witness!

729
00:18:05 --> 00:18:06
I said get outta here.

730
00:18:06 --> 00:18:08
Deputy sheriff,
you&#39;re under arrest.

731
00:18:08 --> 00:18:09
The fuck are you doin?

732
00:18:09 --> 00:18:10
They&#39;ll listen to me.

733
00:18:10 --> 00:18:11
I&#39;m a cop.

734
00:18:11 --> 00:18:12
I&#39;m one of them.

735
00:18:12 --> 00:18:13
Hold your fire,
he&#39;s in my custody!

736
00:18:13 --> 00:18:14
Come on, move.

737
00:18:14 --> 00:18:15
Get up.

738
00:18:15 --> 00:18:16
Come on, get up.

739
00:18:16 --> 00:18:17
It&#39;s a trick!

740
00:18:17 --> 00:18:19
The bitch is with him,
let him have it!

741
00:18:19 --> 00:18:20
You&#39;re dead!

742
00:18:20 --> 00:18:22
Turning into a major cluster fuck.

743
00:18:22 --> 00:18:24
Do you ever stop bitching!

744
00:18:24 --> 00:18:25
Oh, shit!

745
00:18:25 --> 00:18:26
I&#39;m callin&#39; it in.

746
00:18:26 --> 00:18:27
Why?

747
00:18:27 --> 00:18:28
Why Michael?

748
00:18:28 --> 00:18:30
Those tin badged dick-brains!

749
00:18:30 --> 00:18:32
If I were a man,
they would have paid attention to me!

750
00:18:32 --> 00:18:34
If I was my father,
if I was my brothers,

751
00:18:34 --> 00:18:36
if I was anyone
with a God damn dick

752
00:18:36 --> 00:18:37
someone would have paid
attention to me!

753
00:18:37 --> 00:18:40
I mean, why&#39;d you have to turn out
to be so fucking innocent?

754
00:18:40 --> 00:18:43
LAPD, officer, everything&#39;s okay,
we got this under control.

755
00:18:43 --> 00:18:45
Severence,
what the fuck is goin&#39; on?

756
00:18:45 --> 00:18:46
You&#39;re supposed to be
our protection out here.

757
00:18:46 --> 00:18:49
LAPD, it&#39;s under control here.

758
00:18:49 --> 00:18:50
Son of a bitch!

759
00:18:50 --> 00:18:52
We&#39;re doin&#39; everything
we can, Lieutenant.

760
00:18:52 --> 00:18:53
Yeah, yeah!

761
00:18:53 --> 00:18:55
- We can&#39;t block traffic in every...
- Yeah, I hear you.

762
00:18:55 --> 00:18:57
You gotta give me...

763
00:18:57 --> 00:18:59
Listen to me, you cunt!

764
00:18:59 --> 00:19:00
There are only so many roads

765
00:19:00 --> 00:19:02
and we&#39;ve got only
so many cars, Lieutenant.

766
00:19:02 --> 00:19:05
I don&#39;t care how many roads there are,
I want &#39;em blocked!

767
00:19:05 --> 00:19:07
We&#39;ve only got so many resources.

768
00:19:07 --> 00:19:08
I don&#39;t give a shit!

769
00:19:08 --> 00:19:09
Santee&#39;s got a head start

770
00:19:09 --> 00:19:12
in a car that&#39;ll do
170 miles an hour!

771
00:19:12 --> 00:19:13
Clear!

772
00:19:13 --> 00:19:14
Sheriff.

773
00:19:14 --> 00:19:15
Santee gunned down Agnos.

774
00:19:15 --> 00:19:16
Took him out in cold blood.

775
00:19:16 --> 00:19:17
Jesus Christ.

776
00:19:17 --> 00:19:18
Go on, check inside.

777
00:19:18 --> 00:19:20
There&#39;s just one place...
one place he&#39;ll go.

778
00:19:20 --> 00:19:22
The desert... Joshua Tree.

779
00:19:22 --> 00:19:23
Joshua Tree.

780
00:19:23 --> 00:19:25
If Santee gets into the backcountry,
he can come out anywhere, you know.

781
00:19:25 --> 00:19:27
Mexico, Nevada.

782
00:19:27 --> 00:19:29
Block the roads to the desert,
&#39;cause that&#39;s where he&#39;ll go.

783
00:19:29 --> 00:19:31
You know a lot
about Santee, don&#39;tcha?

784
00:19:31 --> 00:19:33
He used to talk to me.

785
00:19:33 --> 00:19:35
You been bangin&#39; him
since day one.

786
00:19:35 --> 00:19:36
Frank.

787
00:19:36 --> 00:19:37
The girl.

788
00:19:37 --> 00:19:38
Get the girl too.

789
00:19:38 --> 00:19:39
Give me your radio.

790
00:19:39 --> 00:19:40
Listen, I need a chopper.

791
00:19:40 --> 00:19:42
Shit, we need the whole
God damn air force.

792
00:19:42 --> 00:19:43
How do you get into this?

793
00:19:43 --> 00:19:44
Take your hat off.

794
00:19:44 --> 00:19:45
Fuck you.

795
00:19:45 --> 00:19:47
Santee fucked your wife, Esther?

796
00:19:47 --> 00:19:49
Many times, Rudy, many times.

797
00:19:49 --> 00:19:51
Just something
wrong about that.

798
00:19:51 --> 00:19:55
Kul Lipski said, &quot;A friend is somebody
who doesn&#39;t fuck your wife.&quot;

799
00:19:55 --> 00:19:57
That lets Santee out right there.

800
00:19:57 --> 00:19:59
I never said Santee
was a friend.

801
00:19:59 --> 00:20:00
I said he was like a son to me.

802
00:20:00 --> 00:20:01
Makes it worse, doesn&#39;t it?

803
00:20:01 --> 00:20:04
Oh, yeah, much worse.

804
00:20:04 --> 00:20:06
Well, I guess they&#39;re printing
a picture for the post office now.

805
00:20:06 --> 00:20:08
Shoulda gotten off the bus
when you could.

806
00:20:08 --> 00:20:09
You still don&#39;t get it, do you?

807
00:20:09 --> 00:20:10
Get what?

808
00:20:10 --> 00:20:11
Nothing.

809
00:20:11 --> 00:20:12
Do we just keep driving

810
00:20:12 --> 00:20:14
or do you have anything
resembling a plan?

811
00:20:14 --> 00:20:15
Yeah, we&#39;re gonna get away.

812
00:20:15 --> 00:20:18
Oh, well, would it be
too much to ask how?

813
00:20:18 --> 00:20:21
It&#39;s a big desert and they got
nothin&#39; that can keep up with us.

814
00:20:21 --> 00:20:22
Damn!

815
00:20:22 --> 00:20:23
You know, it&#39;s funny...

816
00:20:23 --> 00:20:24
they kind of look like people,
don&#39;t they?

817
00:20:24 --> 00:20:26
You mean the Joshua trees?

818
00:20:26 --> 00:20:27
Yeah.

819
00:20:27 --> 00:20:30
The Mormon settlers thought
they looked like the prophet Joshua.

820
00:20:30 --> 00:20:31
That&#39;s how they got their name.

821
00:20:31 --> 00:20:34
Just so you all know,
this is no longer a hostage situation.

822
00:20:34 --> 00:20:36
So, hostage procedures
no longer apply.

823
00:20:36 --> 00:20:38
A warrant was issued
40 minutes ago

824
00:20:38 --> 00:20:40
for the arrest of Deputy Marek.

825
00:20:40 --> 00:20:42
She is to be considered,
not as an abductee,

826
00:20:42 --> 00:20:43
but as an accomplice.

827
00:20:43 --> 00:20:46
She has the same training
as all of you.

828
00:20:46 --> 00:20:49
She may be as dangerous,
if not more dangerous,

829
00:20:49 --> 00:20:50
than Santee himself.

830
00:20:50 --> 00:20:52
Sheriff Cepeda.

831
00:20:52 --> 00:20:54
Just on a personal note here...

832
00:20:54 --> 00:20:56
Just 12 hours ago
they put a bullet into the head

833
00:20:56 --> 00:20:58
of a Mojave County sheriff
named Michael Agnos,

834
00:20:58 --> 00:20:59
some of you may have known.

835
00:20:59 --> 00:21:01
He&#39;s probably hiding
in Joshua Tree now.

836
00:21:01 --> 00:21:03
That&#39;s his home. Be careful.

837
00:21:03 --> 00:21:05
All right. Let&#39;s move out.

838
00:21:05 --> 00:21:07
You know, for a cop,
you&#39;re not bad lookin&#39;.

839
00:21:07 --> 00:21:08
Thanks.

840
00:21:08 --> 00:21:09
For what?

841
00:21:09 --> 00:21:10
Stickin&#39; around.

842
00:21:10 --> 00:21:12
You&#39;re not a very nice person, Santee.

843
00:21:12 --> 00:21:15
You slept with Severence&#39;s wife,
you&#39;ve hurt other people.

844
00:21:15 --> 00:21:16
You&#39;ve hurt me.

845
00:21:16 --> 00:21:17
Never said I was running for Pope.

846
00:21:17 --> 00:21:19
Well, I&#39;m not
a very nice person either.

847
00:21:19 --> 00:21:20
Don&#39;t start this, Rita.

848
00:21:20 --> 00:21:21
That&#39;s enough, babe.

849
00:21:21 --> 00:21:24
Dont&#39; worry,
we&#39;ll hear anything.

850
00:21:24 --> 00:21:25
We&#39;ll hear it.

851
00:21:25 --> 00:21:27
- Hear something?
- Don&#39;t stop me.

852
00:21:27 --> 00:21:28
It&#39;s nothing.

853
00:21:28 --> 00:21:30
- Hear it?
- It&#39;s nothing, it&#39;s nothing.

854
00:21:30 --> 00:21:31
Quick, get in the car.

855
00:21:31 --> 00:21:32
Sure you want to be part of this?

856
00:21:32 --> 00:21:35
Spotted him, on the frontage road
at mile 3-6-0.

857
00:21:35 --> 00:21:37
Looks like he&#39;s headin&#39;
for the old rail road station.

858
00:21:37 --> 00:21:38
Lieutenant Severence.

859
00:21:38 --> 00:21:39
Go ahead.

860
00:21:39 --> 00:21:40
We found Santee, sir.

861
00:21:40 --> 00:21:41
He&#39;s heading for the mountains.

862
00:21:41 --> 00:21:43
Frank, how come
you and Esther never had kids?

863
00:21:43 --> 00:21:46
I told ya...
Santee, he&#39;s like my kid.

864
00:21:46 --> 00:21:48
He was 16, for Chrissake,
when I arrested him.

865
00:21:48 --> 00:21:49
The poor bastard.

866
00:21:49 --> 00:21:51
Imagine having you for a father.

867
00:21:51 --> 00:21:52
Fuck you, Rudy.

868
00:21:52 --> 00:21:54
Unit 211,
motorist needs assistance.

869
00:21:54 --> 00:21:57
Overheated car,
highway 10, exit 122.

870
00:21:57 --> 00:21:58
You guys are lookin&#39; hard enough.

871
00:21:58 --> 00:21:59
You seen anything?

872
00:21:59 --> 00:22:00
No, sir.

873
00:22:00 --> 00:22:01
Jesus, Mary.

874
00:22:01 --> 00:22:02
Okay, men, steady.

875
00:22:02 --> 00:22:03
Hold your fire.

876
00:22:03 --> 00:22:04
Easy.

877
00:22:04 --> 00:22:06
No, no, just stay.

878
00:22:06 --> 00:22:08
- Follow him.
- He said to stay here.

879
00:22:08 --> 00:22:11
Stay here, hold your positions.

880
00:22:11 --> 00:22:12
They&#39;re comin&#39; back this way.

881
00:22:12 --> 00:22:14
When we get there,
you go in first.

882
00:22:14 --> 00:22:15
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you!

883
00:22:15 --> 00:22:16
Fuck you.

884
00:22:16 --> 00:22:18
Severence, Severence,
this is Cepeda,

885
00:22:18 --> 00:22:20
we&#39;re on the mountain behind you,
three or four minutes back.

886
00:22:20 --> 00:22:21
Here, light this for me.

887
00:22:21 --> 00:22:22
What are you, fucking crazy?

888
00:22:22 --> 00:22:23
What, do you want me
to be nervous?

889
00:22:23 --> 00:22:25
Oh shit, the fire gate&#39;s down!

890
00:22:25 --> 00:22:26
Come on, Rita, come on.

891
00:22:26 --> 00:22:27
Stay down and you&#39;ll live.

892
00:22:27 --> 00:22:29
Severence, this is Cepeda.

893
00:22:29 --> 00:22:31
We&#39;re behind you,
are you still on the road?

894
00:22:31 --> 00:22:33
Severence, what is your position?

895
00:22:33 --> 00:22:35
Severence, if you can hear me,

896
00:22:35 --> 00:22:39
the highway patrol has sealed
all the roads off the mountain.

897
00:22:39 --> 00:22:40
Santee&#39;s cornered.

898
00:22:40 --> 00:22:41
Can you hear me?

899
00:22:41 --> 00:22:43
Severence,
this is Sheriff Cepeda, come in.

900
00:22:43 --> 00:22:45
Severence, Cepeda here.

901
00:22:45 --> 00:22:46
Santee!

902
00:22:46 --> 00:22:48
Come on out, Santee!

903
00:22:48 --> 00:22:50
Nobody&#39;s going to harm you!

904
00:22:50 --> 00:22:50
Drop it!

905
00:22:50 --> 00:22:51
Damn it!

906
00:22:51 --> 00:22:52
What is this, darling, an arrest?

907
00:22:52 --> 00:22:53
I said drop it.

908
00:22:53 --> 00:22:57
Rudy, this deputy wants
to place us under arrest.

909
00:22:57 --> 00:22:59
That&#39;s funny,
she doesn&#39;t look like a deputy.

910
00:22:59 --> 00:23:00
She looks like an accomplice.

911
00:23:00 --> 00:23:01
Accomplice to a cop.

912
00:23:01 --> 00:23:02
Give it up, Santee!

913
00:23:02 --> 00:23:03
Don&#39;t do it!

914
00:23:03 --> 00:23:04
He&#39;ll kill me anyway!

915
00:23:04 --> 00:23:06
I&#39;m here, Severence!

916
00:23:06 --> 00:23:07
Let her go!

917
00:23:07 --> 00:23:09
Get down here, kid,
and be quick!

918
00:23:09 --> 00:23:11
- You take the west ridge.
- Yes, sir.

919
00:23:11 --> 00:23:12
Let&#39;s go guys, quick!

920
00:23:12 --> 00:23:12
Hello.

921
00:23:12 --> 00:23:13
Good-bye.

922
00:23:13 --> 00:23:16
I always taught you to hang on
to the bitter end, Santee.

923
00:23:16 --> 00:23:18
You&#39;re not giving up
on me, are ya, kid?

924
00:23:18 --> 00:23:19
So long.

925
00:23:19 --> 00:23:21
- Somethin&#39; up there.
- Yeah, it&#39;s movin&#39;, let&#39;s go.

926
00:23:21 --> 00:23:22
Nice meeting you.

927
00:23:22 --> 00:23:23
Kid...

928
00:23:23 --> 00:23:26
Kid, we don&#39;t need
any of these people, kid.

929
00:23:26 --> 00:23:27
Watch this.

930
00:23:27 --> 00:23:28
Fuck you!

931
00:23:28 --> 00:23:29
This is for Eddie.

932
00:23:29 --> 00:23:30
Go ahead, kid.

933
00:23:30 --> 00:23:32
Then do it. I&#39;d do it to you.

934
00:23:32 --> 00:23:33
- Don&#39;t...
- Hold it, Santee!

935
00:23:33 --> 00:23:34
Do not move!

936
00:23:34 --> 00:23:35
Okay, boys, stand back.

937
00:23:35 --> 00:23:37
Thank God, you&#39;re here.

938
00:23:37 --> 00:23:38
Santee killed Rudisill.

939
00:23:38 --> 00:23:39
You&#39;re under arrest.

940
00:23:39 --> 00:23:40
What!

941
00:23:40 --> 00:23:43
I just saw a video a you shootin&#39;
Deputy Agnos, Severence.

942
00:23:43 --> 00:23:44
You&#39;re goin&#39; up the river.

943
00:23:44 --> 00:23:45
Fuck you.

944
00:23:45 --> 00:23:48
Guess you didn&#39;t see
the surveillance cameras, did ya?

945
00:23:48 --> 00:23:49
Too bad.

946
00:23:49 --> 00:23:50
You have the right to remain silent.

947
00:23:50 --> 00:23:52
If you give up the right
to remain silent, anything you say

948
00:23:52 --> 00:23:54
can and will be used
against you in a court a law...

949
00:23:54 --> 00:23:55
Have you heard
from Mara and the kid?

950
00:23:55 --> 00:23:56
Yeah, they went back
to New Orleans.

951
00:23:56 --> 00:23:59
I... I heard they came
into some money.

952
00:23:59 --> 00:24:00
Really?

953
00:24:00 --> 00:24:01
Well, I guess I&#39;d better get going.

954
00:24:01 --> 00:24:03
Old Woody here,
has got a crush on you.

955
00:24:03 --> 00:24:04
Oh, is that right?

956
00:24:04 --> 00:24:06
Yeah, well, he&#39;ll be mad
as hell if he finds out you left

957
00:24:06 --> 00:24:07
and he couldn&#39;t see you.

958
00:24:07 --> 00:24:08
He can count
on me coming back around.

959
00:24:08 --> 00:24:10
There&#39;s a couple of felons
I&#39;m supposed to keep my eye on.

960
00:24:10 --> 00:24:12
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

961
00:24:12 --> 00:24:13
Okay.

962
00:24:13 --> 00:24:14
Well...

963
00:24:14 --> 00:24:15
Next time you 4 by 4...

964
00:24:15 --> 00:24:16
you know who to call.

965
00:24:16 --> 00:24:17
Oop.
